concentration up to 70 mg l 1 and pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification pad can effectively remove as iii no3 and po4 3 simultaneously treating water with as iii 874 50 32 76 µg l 1 no3 n 30 mg l 1

detection limit at hydraulic retention time 6 h in the pslad biofilter thiobacillus is the most abundant bacterium and it uses pyrrhotite and sulfur as electron donor to reduce no3 and basically fe2 and as iii are oxidized to fe3 and arsenate respectively as and po4 3 were mainly removed through precipitates feaso4 and fepo4 respectively technology based on the pad is a simple cost effective and efficient way for remediation of as iii and no3 co contaminated groundwater and avoiding contaminants transference between groundwater and surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification arsenite nitrate thiobacillus groundwater 1 introduction the most serious global groundwater issues are arsenic as and nitrate no3 contaminations smedley and kinniburgh 2002 smith et al 2017 shakya and ghosh 2019 as and no3 have been reported to co exist in groundwater in various locations of the world due to anthropogenic activities and natural biogeochemical reactions upadhyaya et al 2010 shakya and ghosh 2019 li et al 2016b as and no3 n can be up to 1000 µg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 respectively sarkar and paul 2016 rahman et al 2014 shakya and ghosh 2019 in order to minimize their deleterious effects on human health the drinking water maximum contaminant levels mcl for as and no3 n are 10 µg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively in china mhprc 2006 and the usa li et al 2016a therefore it is imperative to develop deep and simultaneous as and no3 removal technologies from groundwater the main as species in groundwater are inorganic arsenite as iii and arsenate as v gong et al 2016 sun et al 2009 and the former is more dominant than the latter under reducing conditions guo et al 2014 they can only be removed from groundwater through physicochemical processes bothe et al 1999 sahinkaya and kilic 2014 upadhyaya et al 2010 no3 is commonly removed from groundwater using physicochemical process and microbial denitrification upadhyaya et al 2010 but the former is often associated with high operating costs complicated process and risk of secondary pollution shakya and ghosh 2018 therefore it is desirable that a method is able to combine biological no3 removal and physicochemical as removal for polluted groundwater treatment pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 is one of the most abundant iron sulfur minerals belzile et al 2004 recently pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification pad has attracted increasing attentions for its excellent performance of simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal from wastewater li et al 2016b 2013a zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 and is considered as a biotechnology towards next generation wastewater treatment hu et al 2020 the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification pad can proceed as follows li et al 2020 1 f e s 9 5 n o 3 8 5 h 2 o 9 10 n 2 f e o h 3 1 5 h s o 4 2 fe oh 3 is biologically produced in the pad pyrrhotite itself and the biogenic fe oh 3 have shown to be highly effective in removing as from groundwater through adsorption and co precipitation hohmann et al 2010 han et al 2011 which is simple and cost effective omoregie et al 2013 therefore biological no3 removal and physicochemical as removal can be combined through the pad however study on simultaneous as and no3 removal from groundwater based on the pad has never been found before microbial nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation mnfo has been reported to be able to remove as and no3 effectively and several anaerobic nitrate dependent fe ii oxidizing bacteria such as c freundii pxl1 li et al 2015 clostridium sp strain pxl2 li et al 2016a pseudogulbenkiania sp strain 2002 xiu et al 2016 efficiently oxidized fe ii associated with the reduction of nitrate and their metabolisms were not inhibited by as in the concentration range that usually found in the groundwater in the pad the most common denitrification bacteria are thiobacillus and sulfurimonas li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 whether their metabolism are inhibited or not by as is the key to apply the pad to remove as and no3 simultaneously as iii is more mobile toxic and difficult to be removed than as v xiu et al 2016 renock et al 2009 and usually oxidated to as v for higher removal efficiency kim et al 2015 therefore this study pays attention to simultaneous as iii and no3 removal the main objectives of this study are to investigate 1 feasibility of simultaneous as iii and no3 removal based on the pad 2 performance of reactor based on the pad for simultaneous as iii and no3 removal 3 mechanisms of simultaneous as iii and no3 removal of the pad this study would be conducive to develop a novel way to remove simultaneous as and no3 removal from groundwater deeply 2 materials and methods 2 1 pyrrhotite sulfur and limestone pyrrhotite sulfur and limestone were obtained from anhui jiangsu and hubei provinces respectively china pyrrhotite was sieved into particles of 0 25 0 85 and 2 36 4 mm for batch and column experiments respectively pyrrhotite particles were pretreated to get rid of oxides on the surface of pyrrhotite through pickling with dilute h2so4 according to literature li et al 2016b contents of pyrrhotite and limestone were analyzed with x ray fluorescence xrf arl 9800 arl switzerland the contents of fes in pyrrhotite are 98 4 table s1 in the si and caco3 in limestone is 98 9 table s2 purity of sulfur is 99 6 2 2 batch experiments pyrrhotite 10 g inoculum 3 5 ml and simulated groundwater 50 ml were added to 60 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube sarstedt ltd germany simulated groundwater used in the batch experiments was composed of kno3 0 217 g l 1 kh2po4 0 044 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o 0 05 g l 1 and naaso2 with variable concentrations thus the concentrations of no3 n and po4 3 p were kept at 30 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively as iii concentrations were set to be 0 10 30 50 70 mg l 1 respectively the centrifuge tubes filled with simulated groundwater inoculum and pyrrhotite were flushed with n2 for 60 s to exclude air from the solution and headspace sealed and placed on a rotator for reaction in a thermostatic chamber the temperature was kept at 28 during each batch experiment three tubes for triplicate were randomly taken out from the rotator for sampling every 48 h water samples were analyzed for ph no3 n no2 n so4 2 tas total arsenic and po4 3 p and the average data and standard deviation were presented 2 3 column experiments glassical columns were established as the anaerobic up flow fixed bed reactors they had an internal diameter of 100 mm a height of 500 mm and a packed height of 480 mm one was filled with mixture of pyrrhotite sulfur and limestone particles with volume ratio of 6 3 1 for the pyrrhotite sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification pslad biofilter the other was filled with mixture of sulfur and limestone particles with volume ratio of 3 1 for the slad biofilter as the control with a porosity of about 41 the effective pore water volume was 1 66 l the calculating method of hydraulic retention time hrt was described in previous study li et al 2016b the hrt was kept at 6 h according to previous study li et al 2020 five sampling outlets outlets 1 5 fig s1 at height of 80 160 240 320 400 mm respectively from the bottom of the column were used for media sampling outlet 6 for effluent was located at the height of 500 mm after biofilm culture finished the two columns were fed with the same simulated groundwater which was prepared with tap water naaso2 kh2po4 and kno3 no3 n and po4 3 p concentrations of the simulated groundwater were kept at about 30 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively and as iii varied in the range of 200 10000μg l 1 2 2 enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers and biofilm culture in the columns sulfur based autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from anaerobic sludge of a local wwtp the culturing medium baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 was modified to be made of deionized water and chemicals with 5 g l 1 na2s2o3 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 2 g l 1 kno3 2 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 nh4cl 0 5 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o and 0 01 g l 1 feso4 7h2o all chemicals used in the present study were analytical grade the culturing medium the enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers and the culturing of biofilm were consistent with the previous study li et al 2016b in order to ensure sufficient biofilm growth the two columns were fed with a solution generated from the culturing medium 95 and the inoculum solution 5 obtained from the preceding enrichment the solution was flushed with n2 for 15 min and then pumped into the two columns continuously the solution was circulated in the columns for 4 days and then replaced with fresh one the duration of the biofilm enrichment lasted for 6 cycles 24 d 2 5 sampling and analysis after water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filter paper the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 in the filtrates were measured with ion chromatography mp551 tas total arsenic was measured with atomic fluorescence spectrometry af 610d2 po4 3 p was determined according to the standard methods mepprc ministry of environmental protection of people s republic of china 2002 ph values were measured with a ph meter wtw 340 germany pyrrhotite samples taken from outlets 1 3 5 of the pslad column were treated following torrento torrento et al 2012 and gold coated emitech k550 for scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 3400 n ⅱ hitachinaka japan and eds energy dispersive spectrometer precipitates in the pslad and slad effluent were collected for x

microbial community analysis were fixed with 100 ethanol immediately at a ratio of 1 1 v v and stored at 20 before dna extraction total genomic dna were extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s instructions to determine the final dna concentration and purification nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa wang et al 2020 the detailed steps were described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of simultaneous as iii and no3 removal from simulated groundwater with the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification as shown in fig 1 with as iii concentration increasing from 0 to 70 mg l 1 the average ton no3 n no2 n and no3 n removal efficiencies in the batch experiment of 14 days decreased from 81 44 3 06 to 63 28 5 52 and from 98 42 1 15 to 85 16 1 34 respectively it indicated that as iii decreased denitrification rate of the pad but the pad can be carried out even as the as iii concentration was up to 70 mg l 1 therefore the metabolism of the sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers basically cannot be inhibited by as iii in the usual concentration range of groundwater like those anaerobic nitrate dependent fe ii oxidizing bacteria li et al 2015 li et al 2016 xiu et al 2016 with as iii concentration increasing the peak of no2 n accumulated became higher and appeared later when the concentrations of as iii were 0 and 70 mg l 1 the peaks of no2 n were 11 00 1 66 mg l 1 on the 4th day and 18 33 0 56mg l 1 on the 8th day respectively fig 1c there are two stages during no3 reduction via pad reduction of no3 to no2 and no2 to n2 and the former is faster than the latter zhang et al 2019 therefore it was deduced that the effects of as iii on the first stage of denitrification is smaller than those on the second stage of denitrification by comparison with the previous study zhang et al 2019 effects of both as iii and po4 3 on the pad were similar more than 90 of as iii fig 1d and po4 3 fig 1e were removed quickly in the first 2 days and the residue of them slowly decreased to 0 in the following days which is similar to po4 3 removal process in the previous pad study for simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 po4 3 removal mechanisms in the pad are adsorption and precipitation which should be the as removal mechanisms too usually adsorption finishes in 2 days liu et al 2016 and precipitation is controlled by iron ions produced pyrrhotite is an excellent adsorbent of as gong et al 2016 liu et al 2016 and po4 3 zhang et al 2019 li et al 2013b and dosage of pyrrhotite in the batch experiment is very large thus most of as iii and po4 3 were removed through adsorption in 2 days the production rate of iron ions by the pad was slow so the residual as iii and po4 3 precipitated slowly in the following days fig 1e shows that po4 3 removal was nearly not affected by the as iii concentration because of the huge as iii and po4 3 adsorption capacity of the pyrrhotite used in the experiment so4 2 fig 1f increased quickly in the first 2 days due to residual oxides on the pyrrhotite releasing so4 2 which is similar to the previous study li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 the batch experiments clearly show that the pad completely removed as iii no3 and po4 3 from simulated groundwater 3 2 simultaneous as iii and no3 removal performance of the pyrrhotite sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification biofilter no3 removal rate of the pad column is slow li et al 2016b and the pyrrhotite sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification pslad column li et al 2020 can efficiently and deeply remove no3 and po4 3 simultaneously because of synergistic effects between the pad and sad therefore the pslad column is applied in the study for investigating simultaneous as iii and no3 removal performance based on the pad and the slad column as the control the whole operation period lasted 190 days which were divided into 6 phases as shown in table s3 with average influent as iii increasing from 195 67 8 83 to 1822 63 83 21 µg l 1 the average effluent ton of the pslad and slad increased slowly from 2 39 0 47 to 5 22 1 67 mg l 1 and from 2 18 0 71 to 2 83 0 81mg l 1 fig 2 a and table s2 respectively much lower than the mcl for no3 and the effluent no2 n was very small fig 2c which indicated no secondary no2 pollution occurred thus the average effluent no3 n of the pslad and slad were very close to the average effluent ton of themselves fig 2b table s3 only as the influent as iii was up to 10 387 55 403 95μg l 1 the average effluent no2 n became higher and the effluent ton for the pslad and slad were 8 93 1 29 and 13 01 4 10 mg l 1 respectively in the previous study li et al 2020 treating wastewater with 30 mg l 1 no3 n and1 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p at hrt 6 h the pslad and slad obtained the effluent ton 0 61 and 0 36 mg l 1 respectively by comparison the effects of as iii below 1822 63 µg l 1 on denitrification of both the pslad and slad were very limited as shown in fig 2d and table s3 when the influent as iii were 195 67 8 83 400 93 12 44 and 874 50 32 76 µg l 1 the effluent tas of the pslad were 0 38 0 60 1 50 0 87 and 7 84 7 29 µg l 1 respectively lower than the mcl for as which corresponded to the average as removal efficiency over 99 99 usually as in the groundwater is no more than 1000μg l 1 therefore the pslad can be used to remove as iii from most of polluted groundwater to below mcl when the influent as iii were 1180 25 46 20 1822 63 83 21 and 10 387 55 403 95 µg l 1 the effluent tas were 17 98 10 39 113 80 95 22 and 3135 33 288 09 µg l 1 respectively higher than the mcl for as even as the influent as iii was 10 387 55 403 95 µg l 1 the average as removal efficiency of the pslad was still up to 70 but those of the slad were always below 10 during the whole column experiments it fully indicated that as removal in the pslad biofilter was mainly based on the pad when the influent as iii was below 1822 63 µg l 1 the average effluent po4 3 p of the pslad were below 0 06 mg l 1 fig 2e table s2 which corresponded to the average removal efficiency over 89 but the average effluent po4 3 p of the slad were close to the influent po4 3 p which further confirmed the po4 3 p removal of the slad is very small li et al 2014 2020 therefore the higher po4 3 p removal in the pslad was based on the pad too when the influent as iii was 10 387 55 403 95μg l 1 the effluent po4 3 p of the pslad and slad were 1 95 0 02 and 2 75 0 02mg l 1 much higher than the influent po4 3 p it indicated that the po4 3 adsorbed and precipitated in the pslad and slad released into water again because of action of higher as iii concentration therefore inhibitory competitive effect existed between as iii and po4 3 and only as the capacity of adsorption and precipitation for both as and po4 3 was enough the inhibitory competitive effect would not occur clearly as shown in phase 1 5 of the column experiment and in the batch experiment niazi and burton 2016 found no inhibitory competitive effect of po4 3 on as iii sorption to nanoparticulate fes which is not in agreement with this study during the whole column operation the average effluent so4 2 of the pslad was lower than that of the slad which was also shown in the previous study li et al 2020 because the anaerobic condition did not keep seriously the so4 2 produced in both the pslad and slad were higher than those of corresponding stoichiometry of the pad and sad but in the most time of the column experiments effluent so4 2 of the pslad was lower than standards for drinking water quality in china gb 5749 2006 mhprc 2006 simultaneous as and no3 removal upon mnfo has been widely studied the denitrification rate of the mnfo is no more than 2 8 mg l h 1 no3 n and usually the initial fe as ratios of 75 is needed for removing as to below 10 µg l 1 xiu et al 2016 because the stoichiometric molar ratio of no3 fe ii is 5 for mnfo vast fe ii have to be injected to ensure as and no3 below the mcl with continuous flow sand filled column for mnfo and 20 mgl 1 fe ii supplied as fecl2 at hrt 24 h the average influent as iii concentration of 567 µg l 1 was reduced to 10 6 µg l 1 sun et al 2009 which is above the mcl in other fixed bed bioreactor systems for simultaneous as and no3 removal by adding acetate upadhyaya et al 2010 or vinegar snyder et al 2016 and fe ii with the influent as 200 µg l 1 and no3 50 mg l 1 the denitrification rate was higher but effluent as remained above the mcl too by comparison the pslad has higher simultaneous as iii and no3 removal rate lower effluent as and no3 concentration below the mcl and no need adding any reagents the most serious global surface water issues are po4 3 and no3 contamination which are the main cause of eutrophication conley et al 2009 because of interaction between groundwater and surface water po4 3 is common in as and no3 contaminated groundwater niazi and burton 2016 with higher simultaneous as no3 and po4 3 removal and without adding any reagents the pslad could be a promissing way to avoid contaminants transferrence between ground water and surface water han et al 2011 and even could be used to remove other co existing contaminants such as vanadium zhang et al 2018 and chromium shi et al 2019 etc 3 3 as iii and po4 3 removal mechanisms based on the pad sem observation shows many bacteria and secondary minerals attached on the surface of pyrrhotite fig 3 biomass decreased and amount of secondary minerals increased with height of the column increasing for no3 was reduced and secondary minerals produced gradually with the simulated groundwater flowing up along the column fig s2 shows sem eds of the secondary minerals whose elemental compositions were shown in table s4 the secondary minerals at point 1 2 3 and 4 can be interpreted as feooh s fes and feaso4 feooh respectively according to table s4 unfortunately secondary mineral containing elemental p did not found by the sem eds points 1 2 3 and 4 analyzed with eds shown in fig s3 and their elemental composition shown in table s4 precipitates in the effluents of pslad and slad were tested with xrf table s5 xps fig 4 and xrd fig 5 content of fe in the precipitate of pslad is up to 45 49 which was resulted from the pad contents of as and phosphorus p are 1 28 and 10 99 respectively it shows that as and p were removed through adsorption and co precipitation with fe on the contrary as and p in the precipitate of slad are only 0 029 and 0 17 respectively which is consistent with poor as and p removal performance of slad content of s in the precipitates of pslad and slad are 28 69 and 99 42 respectively it indicates that many fine particle sulfur were carried out of the two columns by the water flow there are many small or trace components in the precipitate of pslad such as si ca al k mn ba etc table s5 which were released into water because of the pad and were precipitated fe 2p s 2p and as 3d xps spectra of the precipitate samples of the pslad and slad are shown in fig 4 for the precipitate of pslad fe 2p s 2p and as 3d xps spectra consist of 51 86 fe iii s 33 87 fe iii o and 14 27 fe iii so4 52 61 sn 2 and 47 39 so4 2 and 37 97 as iii o and 62 03 as v o respectively table s6 it indicated that most of fe2 and as iii were oxidized to fe3 and as v in the pslad column which supported the interpretation of sem eds of secondary minerals on the pyrrhotite for the precipitate of the slad s 2p and as 3d xps spectra consist of 79 56 sn 2 and 20 44 so4 2 and 36 08 as iii s and 63 92 as v o respectively it shows occurrence of oxidation of as iii to as v in the slad too xrd spectra of precipitates suggest formation of feaso4 and fepo4 in the pslad and ca3 po4 2 and ca2as2o7 in the slad it supports interpretation of sem eds of secondary mineral on the pyrrhotite and analyses of xps spectra of precipitates of pslad and slad therefore as was removed through adsorption and co precipitation with biogenic fe3 in the pslad ca3 po4 2 and ca2as2o7 are stable at ph 10 whereas feaso4 and fepo4 are stable at ph 7 bothe and brown 1999 therefore the pslad has higher as and po4 3 removal than the slad elemental s in the precipitates of the pslad and slad should be carried out of the two columns by up flow water 3 4 microbial communities in the column experiments in the inoculum the dominant bacteria at the genus level were sulfurimonas 85 12 halothiobacillus 10 86 lentimicrobium 1 17 sulfurospirillum 0 60 and thiobacillus 0 56 fig s3 sulfurimonas and thiobacillus are common sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers halothiobacillus is a salt tolerant sulfur autotrophic denitrifier sorokin 2008 thus in the inoculum the abundance of sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers were more than 96 54 which signified success of enrichment culture of sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers thiobacillus norank f phos he36 and ferritrophicum were the 3 most abundant in both the pslad and slad columns and their average abundance were 55 83 14 31 12 16 8 21 4 46 1 68 in the pslad and 48 76 25 23 16 60 5 26 16 53 14 75 in the slad respectively fig 6 sulfurimonas the most abundant bacterium in the inoculum basically disappeared and thiobacillus became the most dominant in both the pslad and slad which also happened in the previous study li et al 2020 it further demonstrated that thiobacillus is much easier to apply sulfur and pyrrhotite as electron donor than sulfurimonas norank f phos he36 the second dominant bacterium in both the pslad and slad of this study appeared neither in the pslad and slad of previous study nor in the inoculumn whose functions were not clear it should be related to as iii metabolic process ferritrophicum could use fe2 and sulfide as electron donors to reduce nitrate hafenbradl et al 1996 which was also appeared in the sulfur siderite pilot biofilter where a number of fe ii and sulfur existed wang et al 2019 it indicated that in both the pslad and slad columns no3 was mainly removed by thiobacillus and ferritrophicum with pyrrhotite and sulfur as the electron donor thiomonas the known as iii oxidating bacterium rahman et al 2014 increased along the pslad and slad columns and accounted for 4 00 and 5 89 at the outlet 5 of them respectively it signified occurrence of oxidation of as iii to as v in both the pslad and slad which were confirmed by xps and the xrd spectra of precipitates of themselves in previous study the co occurrence of thiomonas and ferritrophicum were linked to the formation of iron and as v rich precipitates tardy et al 2018 which was supported by this study sulfurospirillum 1 62 1 19 with respiratory arsenate reductase activity occurred in the slad column but not in the pslad column it implied the as iii and as v cycle existed in the slad column but did not in the pslad because most of as was removed in the pslad but not in the slad geothrix 1 06 0 89 the iron reducing bacterium weber et al 2006 occurred in the pslad but not in the slad for no fe in the slad it plays important role for ferrous and ferric cycle in the pslad 4 conclusions pyrrhotite is one of the most abundant and widespread iron sulfides in the earth and often considered as a gangue mineral in this study simultaneous as iii and no3 removal were investigated based on pad the pad process could not be inhibited by as iii with concentration up to 70 mg l 1 in the batch experiment treating water with as iii 874 50 32 76 µg l 1 no3 n 30 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 the pslad biofilter could achieve effluent with as iii 7 84 7 29 µg l 1 no3 n 3 78 1 14 mg l 1 and po4 3 p below detection limit in the pslad thiobacillus was the most abundant bacterium and it used pyrrhotite and sulfur as electron donor to reduce no3 and basically fe2 and as iii were oxidized to fe3 and as v respectively as and po4 3 were mainly removed through precipitates feaso4 and fepo4 respectively therefore compared with the mnfo the most commonly studied for simultaneous as and no3 removal the technology based on the pad is a simple cost effective and efficient way for remediation of as and no3 co contaminated

groundwater through physicochemical processes bothe et al 1999 sahinkaya and kilic 2014 upadhyaya et al 2010 no3 is commonly removed from groundwater using physicochemical process and microbial denitrification upadhyaya et al 2010 but the former is often associated with high operating costs complicated process and risk of secondary pollution shakya and ghosh 2018 therefore it is desirable that a method is able to combine biological no3 removal and physicochemical as removal for polluted groundwater treatment pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 is one of the most abundant iron sulfur minerals belzile et al 2004 recently pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification pad has attracted increasing attentions for its excellent performance of simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal from wastewater li et al 2016b 2013a zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 and is considered as a biotechnology towards next generation wastewater treatment hu et al 2020 the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification pad can proceed as follows li et al 2020 1 f e s 9 5 n o 3 8 5 h 2 o 9 10 n 2 f e o h 3 1 5 h s o 4 2 fe oh 3 is biologically produced in the pad pyrrhotite itself and the biogenic fe oh 3 have shown to be highly effective in removing as from groundwater through adsorption and co precipitation hohmann et al 2010 han et al 2011 which is simple and cost effective omoregie et al 2013 therefore biological no3 removal and physicochemical as removal can be combined through the pad however study on simultaneous as and no3 removal from groundwater based on the pad has never been found before microbial nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation mnfo has been reported to be able to remove as and no3 effectively and several anaerobic nitrate dependent fe ii oxidizing bacteria such as c freundii pxl1 li et al 2015 clostridium sp strain pxl2 li et al 2016a pseudogulbenkiania sp strain 2002 xiu et al 2016 efficiently oxidized fe ii associated with the reduction of nitrate and their metabolisms were not inhibited by as in the concentration range that usually found in the groundwater in the pad the most common denitrification bacteria are thiobacillus and sulfurimonas li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 whether their metabolism are inhibited or not by as is the key to apply the pad to remove as and no3 simultaneously as iii is more mobile toxic and difficult to be removed than as v xiu et al 2016 renock et al 2009 and usually oxidated to as v for higher removal efficiency kim et al 2015 therefore this study pays attention to simultaneous as iii and no3 removal the main objectives of this study are to investigate 1 feasibility of simultaneous as iii and no3 removal based on the pad 2 performance of reactor based on the pad for simultaneous as iii and no3 removal 3 mechanisms of simultaneous as iii and no3 removal of the pad this study would be conducive to develop a novel way to remove simultaneous as and no3 removal from groundwater deeply 2 materials and methods 2 1 pyrrhotite sulfur and limestone pyrrhotite sulfur and limestone were obtained from anhui jiangsu and hubei provinces respectively china pyrrhotite was sieved into particles of 0 25 0 85 and 2 36 4 mm for batch and column experiments respectively pyrrhotite particles were pretreated to get rid of oxides on the surface of pyrrhotite through pickling with dilute h2so4 according to literature li et al 2016b contents of pyrrhotite and limestone were analyzed with x ray fluorescence xrf arl 9800 arl switzerland the contents of fes in pyrrhotite are 98 4 table s1 in the si and caco3 in limestone is 98 9 table s2 purity of sulfur is 99 6 2 2 batch experiments pyrrhotite 10 g inoculum 3 5 ml and simulated groundwater 50 ml were added to 60 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube sarstedt ltd germany simulated groundwater used in the batch experiments was composed of kno3 0 217 g l 1 kh2po4 0 044 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o 0 05 g l 1 and naaso2 with variable concentrations thus the concentrations of no3 n and po4 3 p were kept at 30 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively as iii concentrations were set to be 0 10 30 50 70 mg l 1 respectively the centrifuge tubes filled with simulated groundwater inoculum and pyrrhotite were flushed with n2 for 60 s to exclude air from the solution and headspace sealed and placed on a rotator for reaction in a thermostatic chamber the temperature was kept at 28 during each batch experiment three tubes for triplicate were randomly taken out from the rotator for sampling every 48 h water samples were analyzed for ph no3 n no2 n so4 2 tas total arsenic and po4 3 p and the average data and standard deviation were presented 2 3 column experiments glassical columns were established as the anaerobic up flow fixed bed reactors they had an internal diameter of 100 mm a height of 500 mm and a packed height of 480 mm one was filled with mixture of pyrrhotite sulfur and limestone particles with volume ratio of 6 3 1 for the pyrrhotite sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification pslad biofilter the other was filled with mixture of sulfur and limestone particles with volume ratio of 3 1 for the slad biofilter as the control with a porosity of about 41 the effective pore water volume was 1 66 l the calculating method of hydraulic retention time hrt was described in previous study li et al 2016b the hrt was kept at 6 h according to previous study li et al 2020 five sampling outlets outlets 1 5 fig s1 at height of 80 160 240 320 400 mm respectively from the bottom of the column were used for media sampling outlet 6 for effluent was located at the height of 500 mm after biofilm culture finished the two columns were fed with the same simulated groundwater which was prepared with tap water naaso2 kh2po4 and kno3 no3 n and po4 3 p concentrations of the simulated groundwater were kept at about 30 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively and as iii varied in the range of 200 10000μg l 1 2 2 enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers and biofilm culture in the columns sulfur based autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from anaerobic sludge of a local wwtp the culturing medium baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 was modified to be made of deionized water and chemicals with 5 g l 1 na2s2o3 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 2 g l 1 kno3 2 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 nh4cl 0 5 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o and 0 01 g l 1 feso4 7h2o all chemicals used in the present study were analytical grade the culturing medium the enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers and the culturing of biofilm were consistent with the previous study li et al 2016b in order to ensure sufficient biofilm growth the two columns were fed with a solution generated from the culturing medium 95 and the inoculum solution 5 obtained from the preceding enrichment the solution was flushed with n2 for 15 min and then pumped into the two columns continuously the solution was circulated in the columns for 4 days and then replaced with fresh one the duration of the biofilm enrichment lasted for 6 cycles 24 d 2 5 sampling and analysis after water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filter paper the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 in the filtrates were measured with ion chromatography mp551 tas total arsenic was measured with atomic fluorescence spectrometry af 610d2 po4 3 p was determined according to the standard methods mepprc ministry of environmental protection of people s republic of china 2002 ph values were measured with a ph meter wtw 340 germany pyrrhotite samples taken from outlets 1 3 5 of the pslad column were treated following torrento torrento et al 2012 and gold coated emitech k550 for scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 3400 n ⅱ hitachinaka japan and eds energy dispersive spectrometer precipitates in the pslad and slad effluent were collected for x ray diffraction xrd x tra arl switzerland x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo scientific k alpha usa and xrf 2 6 microbial community analysis the fillers from the pslad and slad columns for microbial community analysis were fixed with 100 ethanol immediately at a ratio of 1 1 v v and stored at 20 before dna extraction total genomic dna were extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s instructions to determine the final dna concentration and purification nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa wang et al 2020 the detailed steps were described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of simultaneous as iii and no3 removal from simulated groundwater with the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification as shown in fig 1 with as iii concentration increasing from 0 to 70 mg l 1 the average ton no3 n no2 n and no3 n removal efficiencies in the batch experiment of 14 days decreased from 81 44 3 06 to 63 28 5 52 and from 98 42 1 15 to 85 16 1 34 respectively it indicated that as iii decreased denitrification rate of the pad but the pad can be carried out even as the as iii concentration was up to 70 mg l 1 therefore the metabolism of the sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers basically cannot be inhibited by as iii in the usual concentration range of groundwater like those anaerobic nitrate dependent fe ii oxidizing bacteria li et al 2015 li et al 2016 xiu et al 2016 with as iii concentration increasing the peak of no2 n accumulated became higher and appeared later when the concentrations of as iii were 0 and 70 mg l 1 the peaks of no2 n were 11 00 1 66 mg l 1 on the 4th day and 18 33 0 56mg l 1 on the 8th day respectively fig 1c there are two stages during no3 reduction via pad reduction of no3 to no2 and no2 to n2 and the former is faster than the latter zhang et al 2019 therefore it was deduced that the effects of as iii on the first stage of denitrification is smaller than those on the second stage of denitrification by comparison with the previous study zhang et al 2019 effects of both as iii and po4 3 on the pad were similar more than 90 of as iii fig 1d and po4 3 fig 1e were removed quickly in the first 2 days and the residue of them slowly decreased to 0 in the following days which is similar to po4 3 removal process in the previous pad study for simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 po4 3 removal mechanisms in the pad are adsorption and precipitation which should be the as removal mechanisms too usually adsorption finishes in 2 days liu et al 2016 and precipitation is controlled by iron ions produced pyrrhotite is an excellent adsorbent of as gong et al 2016 liu et al 2016 and po4 3 zhang et al 2019 li et al 2013b and dosage of pyrrhotite in the batch experiment is very large thus most of as iii and po4 3 were removed through adsorption in 2 days the production rate of iron ions by the pad was slow so the residual as iii and po4 3 precipitated slowly in the following days fig 1e shows that po4 3 removal was nearly not affected by the as iii concentration because of the huge as iii and po4 3 adsorption capacity of the pyrrhotite used in the experiment so4 2 fig 1f increased quickly in the first 2 days due to residual oxides on the pyrrhotite releasing so4 2 which is similar to the previous study li et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 the batch experiments clearly show that the pad completely removed as iii no3 and po4 3 from simulated groundwater 3 2 simultaneous as iii and no3 removal performance of the pyrrhotite sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification biofilter no3 removal rate of the pad column is slow li et al 2016b and the pyrrhotite sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification pslad column li et al 2020 can efficiently and deeply remove no3 and po4 3 simultaneously because of synergistic effects between the pad and sad therefore the pslad column is applied in the study for investigating simultaneous as iii and no3 removal performance based on the pad and the slad column as the control the whole operation period lasted 190 days which were divided into 6 phases as shown in table s3 with average influent as iii increasing from 195 67 8 83 to 1822 63 83 21 µg l 1 the average effluent ton of the pslad and slad increased slowly from 2 39 0 47 to 5 22 1 67 mg l 1 and from 2 18 0 71 to 2 83 0 81mg l 1 fig 2 a and table s2 respectively much lower than the mcl for no3 and the effluent no2 n was very small fig 2c which indicated no secondary no2 pollution occurred thus the average effluent no3 n of the pslad and slad were very close to the average effluent ton of themselves fig 2b table s3 only as the influent as iii was up to 10 387 55 403 95μg l 1 the average effluent no2 n became higher and the effluent ton for the pslad and slad were 8 93 1 29 and 13 01 4 10 mg l 1 respectively in the previous study li et al 2020 treating wastewater with 30 mg l 1 no3 n and1 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p at hrt 6 h the pslad and slad obtained the effluent ton 0 61 and 0 36 mg l 1 respectively by comparison the effects of as iii below 1822 63 µg l 1 on denitrification of both the pslad and slad were very limited as shown in fig 2d and table s3 when the influent as iii were 195 67 8 83 400 93 12 44 and 874 50 32 76 µg l 1 the effluent tas of the pslad were 0 38 0 60 1 50 0 87 and 7 84 7 29 µg l 1 respectively lower than the mcl for as which corresponded to the average as removal efficiency over 99 99 usually as in the groundwater is no more than 1000μg l 1 therefore the pslad can be used to remove as iii from most of polluted groundwater to below mcl when the influent as iii were 1180 25 46 20 1822 63 83 21 and 10 387 55 403 95 µg l 1 the effluent tas were 17 98 10 39 113 80 95 22 and 3135 33 288 09 µg l 1 respectively higher than the mcl for as even as the influent as iii was 10 387 55 403 95 µg l 1 the average as removal efficiency of the pslad was still up to 70 but those of the slad were always below 10 during the whole column experiments it fully indicated that as removal in the pslad biofilter was mainly based on the pad when the influent as iii was below 1822 63 µg l 1 the average effluent po4 3 p of the pslad were below 0 06 mg l 1 fig 2e table s2 which corresponded to the average removal efficiency over 89 but the average effluent po4 3 p of the slad were close to the influent po4 3 p which further confirmed the po4 3 p removal of the slad is very small li et al 2014 2020 therefore the higher po4 3 p removal in the pslad was based on the pad too when the influent as iii was 10 387 55 403 95μg l 1 the effluent po4 3 p of the pslad and slad were 1 95 0 02 and 2 75 0 02mg l 1 much higher than the influent po4 3 p it indicated that the po4 3 adsorbed and precipitated in the pslad and slad released into water again because of action of higher as iii concentration therefore inhibitory competitive effect existed between as iii and po4 3 and only as the capacity of adsorption and precipitation for both as and po4 3 was enough the inhibitory competitive effect would not occur clearly as shown in phase 1 5 of the column experiment and in the batch experiment niazi and burton 2016 found no inhibitory competitive effect of po4 3 on as iii sorption to nanoparticulate fes which is not in agreement with this study during the whole column operation the average effluent so4 2 of the pslad was lower than that of the slad which was also shown in the previous study li et al 2020 because the anaerobic condition did not keep seriously the so4 2 produced in both the pslad and slad were higher than those of corresponding stoichiometry of the pad and sad but in the most time of the column experiments effluent so4 2 of the pslad was lower than standards for drinking water quality in china gb 5749 2006 mhprc 2006 simultaneous as and no3 removal upon mnfo has been widely studied the denitrification rate of the mnfo is no more than 2 8 mg l h 1 no3 n and usually the initial fe as ratios of 75 is needed for removing as to below 10 µg l 1 xiu et al 2016 because the stoichiometric molar ratio of no3 fe ii is 5 for mnfo vast fe ii have to be injected to ensure as and no3 below the mcl with continuous flow sand filled column for mnfo and 20 mgl 1 fe ii supplied as fecl2 at hrt 24 h the average influent as iii concentration of 567 µg l 1 was reduced to 10 6 µg l 1 sun et al 2009 which is above the mcl in other fixed bed bioreactor systems for simultaneous as and no3 removal by adding acetate upadhyaya et al 2010 or vinegar snyder et al 2016 and fe ii with the influent as 200 µg l 1 and no3 50 mg l 1 the denitrification rate was higher but effluent as remained above the mcl too by comparison the pslad has higher simultaneous as iii and no3 removal rate lower effluent as and no3 concentration below the mcl and no need adding any reagents the most serious global surface water issues are po4 3 and no3 contamination which are the main cause of eutrophication conley et al 2009 because of interaction between groundwater and surface water po4 3 is common in as and no3 contaminated groundwater niazi and burton 2016 with higher simultaneous as no3 and po4 3 removal and without adding any reagents the pslad could be a promissing way to avoid contaminants transferrence between ground water and surface water han et al 2011 and even could be used to remove other co existing contaminants such as vanadium zhang et al 2018 and chromium shi et al 2019 etc 3 3 as iii and po4 3 removal mechanisms based on the pad sem observation shows many bacteria and secondary minerals attached on the surface of pyrrhotite fig 3 biomass decreased and amount of secondary minerals increased with height of the column increasing for no3 was reduced and secondary minerals produced gradually with the simulated groundwater flowing up along the column fig s2 shows sem eds of the secondary minerals whose elemental compositions were shown in table s4 the secondary minerals at point 1 2 3 and 4 can be interpreted as feooh s fes and feaso4 feooh respectively according to table s4 unfortunately secondary mineral containing elemental p did not found by the sem eds points 1 2 3 and 4 analyzed with eds shown in fig s3 and their elemental composition shown in table s4 precipitates in the effluents of pslad and slad were tested with xrf table s5 xps fig 4 and xrd fig 5 content of fe in the precipitate of pslad is up to 45 49 which was resulted from the pad contents of as and phosphorus p are 1 28 and 10 99 respectively it shows that as and p were removed through adsorption and co precipitation with fe on the contrary as and p in the precipitate of slad are only 0 029 and 0 17 respectively which is consistent with poor as and p removal performance of slad content of s in the precipitates of pslad and slad are 28 69 and 99 42 respectively it indicates that many fine particle sulfur were carried out of the two columns by the water flow there are many small or trace components in the precipitate of pslad such as si ca al k mn ba etc table s5 which were released into water because of the pad and were precipitated fe 2p s 2p and as 3d xps spectra of the precipitate samples of the pslad and slad are shown in fig 4 for the precipitate of pslad fe 2p s 2p and as 3d xps spectra consist of 51 86 fe iii s 33 87 fe iii o and 14 27 fe iii so4 52 61 sn 2 and 47 39 so4 2 and 37 97 as iii o and 62 03 as v o respectively table s6 it indicated that most of fe2 and as iii were oxidized to fe3 and as v in the pslad column which supported the interpretation of sem eds of secondary minerals on the pyrrhotite for the precipitate of the slad s 2p and as 3d xps spectra consist of 79 56 sn 2 and 20 44 so4 2 and 36 08 as iii s and 63 92 as v o respectively it shows occurrence of oxidation of as iii to as v in the slad too xrd spectra of precipitates suggest formation of feaso4 and fepo4 in the pslad and ca3 po4 2 and ca2as2o7 in the slad it supports interpretation of sem eds of secondary mineral on the pyrrhotite and analyses of xps spectra of precipitates of pslad and slad therefore as was removed through adsorption and co precipitation with biogenic fe3 in the pslad ca3 po4 2 and ca2as2o7 are stable at ph 10 whereas feaso4 and fepo4 are stable at ph 7 bothe and brown 1999 therefore the pslad has higher as and po4 3 removal than the slad elemental s in the precipitates of the pslad and slad should be carried out of the two columns by up flow water 3 4 microbial communities in the column experiments in the inoculum the dominant bacteria at the genus level were sulfurimonas 85 12 halothiobacillus 10 86 lentimicrobium 1 17 sulfurospirillum 0 60 and thiobacillus 0 56 fig s3 sulfurimonas and thiobacillus are common sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers halothiobacillus is a salt tolerant sulfur autotrophic denitrifier sorokin 2008 thus in the inoculum the abundance of sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers were more than 96 54 which signified success of enrichment culture of sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers thiobacillus norank f phos he36 and ferritrophicum were the 3 most abundant in both the pslad and slad columns and their average abundance were 55 83 14 31 12 16 8 21 4 46 1 68 in the pslad and 48 76 25 23 16 60 5 26 16 53 14 75 in the slad respectively fig 6 sulfurimonas the most abundant bacterium in the inoculum basically disappeared and thiobacillus became the most dominant in both the pslad and slad which also happened in the previous study li et al 2020 it further demonstrated that thiobacillus is much easier to apply sulfur and pyrrhotite as electron donor than sulfurimonas norank f phos he36 the second dominant bacterium in both the pslad and slad of this study appeared neither in the pslad and slad of previous study nor in the inoculumn whose functions were not clear it should be related to as iii metabolic process ferritrophicum could use fe2 and sulfide as electron donors to reduce nitrate hafenbradl et al 1996 which was also appeared in the sulfur siderite pilot biofilter where a number of fe ii and sulfur existed wang et al 2019 it indicated that in both the pslad and slad columns no3 was mainly removed by thiobacillus and ferritrophicum with pyrrhotite and sulfur as the electron donor thiomonas the known as iii oxidating bacterium rahman et al 2014 increased along the pslad and slad columns and accounted for 4 00 and 5 89 at the outlet 5 of them respectively it signified occurrence of oxidation of as iii to as v in both the pslad and slad which were confirmed by xps and the xrd spectra of precipitates of themselves in previous study the co occurrence of thiomonas and ferritrophicum were linked to the formation of iron and as v rich precipitates tardy et al 2018 which was supported by this study sulfurospirillum 1 62 1 19 with respiratory arsenate reductase activity occurred in the slad column but not in the pslad column it implied the as iii and as v cycle existed in the slad column but did not in the pslad because most of as was removed in the pslad but not in the slad geothrix 1 06 0 89 the iron reducing bacterium weber et al 2006 occurred in the pslad but not in the slad for no fe in the slad it plays important role for ferrous and ferric cycle in the pslad 4 conclusions pyrrhotite is one of the most abundant and widespread iron sulfides in the earth and often considered as a gangue mineral in this study simultaneous as iii and no3 removal were investigated based on pad the pad process could not be inhibited by as iii with concentration up to 70 mg l 1 in the batch experiment treating water with as iii 874 50 32 76 µg l 1 no3 n 30 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 the pslad biofilter could achieve effluent with as iii 7 84 7 29 µg l 1 no3 n 3 78 1 14 mg l 1 and po4 3 p below detection limit in the pslad thiobacillus was the most abundant bacterium and it used pyrrhotite and sulfur as electron donor to reduce no3 and basically fe2 and as iii were oxidized to fe3 and as v respectively as and po4 3 were mainly removed through precipitates feaso4 and fepo4 respectively therefore compared with the mnfo the most commonly studied for simultaneous as and no3 removal the technology based on the pad is a simple cost effective and efficient way for remediation of as and no3 co contaminated

17381,biomineralized vivianite induced by dissimilatory iron reduction bacteria dirb has received increasing attention because it alleviates phosphorus crisis and phosphorus pollution simultaneously however the relatively small crystal size and low fe iii reduction rate restrict the separation and recovery of vivianite in this study graphite was selected as additive to enhance vivianite biomineralization with soluble ferric citrate and insoluble hematite as two representative electron acceptors as soluble ferric citrate provided abundant accessible electron acceptors relatively inconspicuous increase lower than 7 was observed for graphite on vivianite formation while inoculated with raw sewage or dirb in contrast graphite considerably increased vivianite formation efficiency by 23 in insoluble hematite inoculated with raw sewage the graphite promotion on vivianite formation in hematite batch was magnified to 70 by dirb dosing hematite inhibited the supply of electron acceptors while conductive graphite promoted the electrical connection between minerals and dirb thus improved the fe iii reduction rate and efficiency in addition secondary minerals in hematite exhibited a larger aspect ratio and tended to aggregate on graphite graphite enlarged the vivianite size in hematite from 10 µm to 90 µm due to aggregation enhancing dissimilatory iron reduction dir

fermentation system steady conductive fe3o4 was found to increase the electron transport activity of respiration by 99 and accelerate the anaerobic digestion rate significantly yin et al 2018 compared to metal based materials carbon based materials have more significant enhancement concerning thermodynamics and dynamics in fermentation for it might couple of multiple facilitating factors such as specific surface area porosity adsorption electron donating capacity edc etc wu et al 2020 besides conductive carbon based materials including carbon cloth pyrogenic carbonaceous materials have been proved to act as electron conduits to promote electron transfer significantly cheng et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 graphite is recognized as a highly conductive carbon material utilized universally in various aspects including microbial fuel cells an et al 2017 anaerobic digesters wu et al 2020 and deionization li et al 2017a in this research high conductive graphite was first introduced to increase the fe iii reduction rate and efficiency and thus enhanced vivianite formation in wwtps the roles of graphite in dir and vivianite biomineralization were investigated in batch reactors inoculated with either raw sewage or dirb feeding with ferric citrate or hematite as electron acceptors respectively iron reduction rate phosphorus removal vivianite formation efficiency as well as the morphology of final biomineral products were analyzed to speculate the possible promotion mechanism of graphite with the expectation of proposing an innovative perspective for vivianite formation enhancement 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and cultivation conditions based on our previous studies wang et al 2018 the vivianite formation efficiency of sludge inoculated batch was 42 lower than that of sewage inoculated batch due to higher biomass and more heterotrophic bacteria competing for nutrients and carbon sources in order to figure out the exact influence of graphite on fe iii reduction as well as eliminate the effect of the complex digested sludge sewage and pure bacteria were inoculated as the biomass in addition to simulate the microbial environment of the beginning of the sewage treatment plants inflow and actual application of graphite we selected inflowing sewage of the local municipal wwtp as the sewage inoculum tianjin university tianjin china the detailed

the mean values 3 results and discussion 3 1 graphite promoted vivianite formation negligibly with fe3 as electron acceptors inoculated with raw sewage biomass fe3 concentration decreased in both ms and msg batches accompanied by the continuous increase of fe ii content in the solid phase fig s1 simultaneously solid fe iii accumulated sharply during day 2 4 and then reduced particularly in the initial 4 days the content of fe3 in the ms group decreased by 7 46 mm while the fe iii and fe ii content increased by 4 80 mm and 2 60 mm respectively in the msg group the addition of graphite alleviated the rapid precipitation of fe3 compare with the ms batch fe3 consumed only 2 57 mm in the first four days in msg in which only 0 77 mm was precipitated in the form of solid fe iii after 6 days fe3 was depleted in both ms and msg batches dropping from the initial 8 92 8 94 mm to about 0 23 0 24 mm fig s1d similarly the concentration of po4 3 was also declined from the initial 7 92 8 16 mm to 3 16 3 19 mm on day 6 and then slowly decreased to 2 57 2 64 mm on day 22 fig s1e the rapid synchronization decrease of fe3 and po4 3 was attributed to the consumption of the citrate leading to fe3 release and complexation with po4 3 to form fe iii p precipitates correspondingly the content of extractable fe iii and p increased sharply during the first 6 days with the color of the medium changed from transparent bright orange solution to black flocculation fig s2 the fe iii content in ms reached the peak at day 4 5 10 mm and then decreased continuously until it approached 0 which indicated that dirb was able to use the complexed fe iii p precipitate as electron acceptor for dissimilation reduction msg by contrast delayed two days to get the peak 2 20 mm fe iii lower than that in ms batches fe iii p content decreased after graphite supplementation which confirmed that graphite alleviated the precipitation of fe3 accordingly fe ii content increased sharply reached about 6 mm content in both batches during the first 6 days at the same time the concentration of reduced soluble fe2 was kept at a relatively low level at the range of 0 0 10 mm in both ms and msg batches fig s1b the low fe2 concentration is mainly due to the fe3 rapid reduction in bulk solution to reach the precipitated supersaturated index threshold to synthesis vivianite liu et al 2018 the continuous and steady increase of fe ii and p in the solid phase indicated that vivianite was accumulated constantly after day 6 the reduction of complexed fe iii precipitates turned to be the major reaction and fe ii content in the msg batch emerged to be higher than that in ms batch in particular the tfe ii content of msg was 9 higher than that of ms group on day 14 with the maximum fe ii content gap of 0 75 mm though the r ave of ms and msg varied infinitesimally 0 37 mm day 1 and 0 39 mm day 1 respectively the r max of msg reached 1 66 mm day 1 which was 11 higher than that of ms 1 50 mm day 1 nevertheless due to the exhaustion of electron acceptor fe iii and fe3 there was a tiny distinction between ms and msg for both e p 62 and 64 respectively and e v 31 and 32 respectively as a result in the sewage inoculated groups feeding with fe3 as electron acceptor graphite promoted the vivianite formation slightly according to sem the flower like nodules composed of rhombic platy shaped crystals stacked in random directions are vivianite fig 1 a with the whole size of 30 70 μm only minerals can be observed in the field of view at low magnification of 300 x while microbes appeared in the 5 0 kx magnification field figs s9 the scale shaped sheets with uneven surfaces were graphite particles fig 1b graphite addition enlarged the size of vivianite from the range of 30 70 µm in ms batches to 40 110 μm in msg batches the eds results fig 1c revealed the fe p ratio of crystals is 1 50 which was exactly with the stoichiometric ratio of fe p in vivianite meanwhile the xrd patterns fig s3 of collected precipitates revealed that the main diffraction peaks were in coincidence with the vivianite reference pattern pdf 30 0662 and graphite addition increase the crystallinity of vivianite both sem eds and xrd fig s3 and table s3 analysis suggested that vivianite was almost the main detectable fe p mineral the biomass content and microbial communities of ms and msg batches were compared to further reveal the function of graphite on vivianite production fig s4 after 22 days cultivation the protein content of ms and msg groups increased from 1 35 µg ml 1 to 63 61 µg ml 1 and 63 52 µg ml 1 respectively the negligible difference of biomass protein content between ms and msg indicated that graphite has little impact on the biomass proliferation compared with the original sewage the biodiversity of both ms and msg decreased with the cultivation the proportion of proteobacteria increased by 30 and 21 with or without graphite geobacter is an important member within the proteobacteria phylum röling 2014 which has been confirmed to be the iron manganese and some metals including solid phase respiration bacteria in natural environment reguera and kashefi 2019 to illustrate the mechanism of how graphite affects the fe iii reduction and vivianite production geobacter sulfurreducens pca a representative dirb in proteobacteria were inoculated in further pure batches inoculated with geobacter though the variation of iron and phosphorus were consistent with the trend in sewage batches fig s5 the fe iii reduction rates of pure culture batches were much higher than that of sewage batches the r ave in the ps and psg were 2 79 mm day 1 and 2 95 mm day 1 6 5 and 6 6 times higher than that in ms and msg the r max even reached 7 11 mm day 1 and 8 20 mm day 1 induced the dir almost finished in 24 h due to the variation of biomass content fig s8 the biomass normalization rate table s2 of both ms and msg was 0 007 mm day 1 µg ml 1 63 and 67 lower than that in ps and psg due to geobacter content throughout the whole batch tfe ii content in psg was always 2 16 higher than that in the ps batch especially at 36 hours the tfe ii content of the graphite group was 16 higher than that in control comparing with 9 enhancement in sewage batches graphite promotion on fe iii reduction and vivianite production was magnified in pure culture batches inoculated with geobacter however due to the exhaustion of electron acceptor fe iii and fe3 graphite addition increased the final e v of ps by only 7 from 29 in ps batch to 31 in psg batch feeding with fe3 as electron acceptor graphite addition enhanced the fe3 reduction and vivianite production slightly whether inoculated with sewage or geobacter 3 2 graphite promoted vivianite formation significantly with hematite as electron acceptors feeding hematite as electron acceptor fe iii content in both mi and mig batches decreased gradually from the initial 7 80 mm to 0 00 mm accompanied by the increase of fe2 fe3 and fe ii content fig s6 synchronously the concentration of po4 3 decreased and the p accumulated steadily in the solid phase the fe ii and p content in mig batches were always higher than that in mi batches on day 15 the tfe ii content of mig was 23 higher than mi group with the maximum fe ii content gap of 0 98 mm simultaneously the p content in mig batches was 21 higher than that in mi batches correspondingly the e p and e v of mig were 21 and 23 higher than mi on day 15 graphite addition increased the r max of mi by 17 from 0 35 mm day 1 in mi batch to 0 41 mm day 1 in mig batch as a result graphite addition promoted both the dissimilated hematite reduction and the mineralization of vivianite in raw sewage batches the phylogenetic analysis showed that the biodiversity decreased in both mi and mig batches fig 2 a the percentage of the proteobacteria increased from 34 raw sewage to 93 mi in mig graphite addition enhanced the percentage of the proteobacteria up to 99 at the genus level geobacter exhibited significant enhancement from the initial 1 in raw sewage to 94 and 99 in mi and mig batches similar to the phylum results the graphite addition increased the geobacter abundance fig 2b showing that graphite selectively enriched the dirb similar to sewage batches feeding with hematite fe ii accumulated continuously in both pi and pig batches along with the decrease of fe iii fig 3 distinguishingly comparing to mig much more significant enhancement of graphite on fe iii reduction and vivianite production was observed in pig comparing to 17 enhancement in sewage batches adding graphite increased the r max by 131 in pure culture from 0 030 mm day 1 in pi to 0 067 mm day 1 in pig simultaneously graphite addition increased the final e v of pi by 70 from 5 in pi batch to 9 in pig batch due to the insolubility of hematite less vivianite was accumulated during relatively slow fe iii reduction in pig as a result the e v of pi and pig batches were as low as 5 and 9 much lower than that in psg 31 though the e v was relatively low in pig graphite addition increased the e v by 70 much higher than 23 enhancement in sewage batches in summary feeding with hematite as electron acceptor graphite promoted the fe iii reduction and vivianite formation notably and this promotion was significantly amplified with the pure culture of dirb 3 3 graphite facilitate the vivianite enlargement by 90 µm with hematite as electron acceptors quite different from the flower like crystals with fe3 as electron acceptors vivianite produced from hematite was fine crystals with larger aspect ratio about 3 3 and stacked unidirectionally along the long side hematite particles were not visible in the field of vision because of the nanometer level size of hematite figs 4 and s7 feeding with ferric citrate fe3 was sharply reduced to fe2 in a short time attributed to the low solubility of vivianite k sp 10 32 under neutral ph the reduced fe2 quickly binds to po4 3 into rhombic platy shaped crystals which then stacked non directionally to form flower like crystals fig 1a comparing to nucleating directly from solution mineralization of fe3 rothe et al 2016 vivianite with insoluble electron acceptor was a secondary mineral of hematite reduction it was affected by reductive dissolution of fe iii ph redox potential orp the supersaturation of the solution and surface processes edge free energy lundager madsen and bruun hansen 2014 hu et al confirmed that the aspect ratio of the iron mineral was affected by the molar ratio of iron ions and phosphate hu and yu 2008 a lower molar ratio of fe3 po4 3 especially with relatively high po4 3 was beneficial to synthesize elongated crystals with a longer length and a shorter radial diameter the anisotropic growth was resulted from the specific adsorption of po4 3 on mineral which limited the radial direction growth feeding with hematite fe2 concentration is much lower than po4 3 concentration due to the slow reduction rate of insoluble fe iii po4 3 was directionally adsorbed on vivianite which further oriented stacked along the long axis fig 4a agglomerate vivianite was synthesized in mig and pig batches from hematite while monodispersed vivianite crystals were produced without graphite addition fig 4b graphite accelerated the fe iii reduction from hematite to generate more fe2 which quickly precipitated with po4 3 to synthesize more vivianite crystal nuclei high surface energy and instability of newly small crystal nucleus generated during secondary mineralization induced aggregation to form large agglomerate vivianite hu and yu 2008 inoculated with geobacter or sewage batches graphite promoted the aggregation of vivianite during the dissimilated hematite reduction to form the vivianite crystal larger than 90 µm figs 4 and s7 besides researchers demonstrated that additives normally have a marked influence on the surface as well as edge free energies and thus on crystallization kinetics lundager madsen and koch 2018 for example lundager lundager madsen 2008 analyzed the kinetics of several additives in solvent mediated phase transformation of brushite to basic calcium phosphates they found that additive accelerated the surface nucleation which is identical to vivianite crystallization kinetics nucleation growth at higher supersaturation lundager madsen and bruun hansen 2014 adding zn was verified to lower the edge free energy which favored irregular aggregates and inhibited lateral growth lundager madsen 2008 similarly as graphite addition lowered the edge free energy mineralized tiny vivianite crystals and irregular aggregates fig 4b tended to accelerate the crystal growth rate by surface nucleation rosa and lundager madsen 2010 3 4 graphite enhanced the vivianite formation by promoting an electrical connection between minerals and microorganisms distinguishing the dir rate with different inoculum and iron sources it was discovered that the r max using ferric citrate as electron acceptors 1 66 and 8 20 mm day 1 in msg and psg was much higher than using hematite as electron acceptors 0 41 mm day 1 in mig and 0 07 mm day 1 in pig fig 5 e besides in fe3 batches the r max of pure culture batches was significantly higher 7 11 mm day 1 in ps and 8 20 mm day 1 in psg than that in the sewage batches 1 50 mm day 1 in ms and 1 67 mm day 1 in msg though the r max value of hematite was much lower than that in fe3 the acceleration of graphite on r max was amplified to up to 17 and 131 in mig and pig the iron reduction rates of pig were always higher than those of pi all through the whole batches experiments fig 5d especially r max of pi and pig were much lower than that in mi and mig much lower r max in pi 0 03 mm day 1 than in mi 0 35 mm day 1 was ascribed as follows the lower reduction rate of hematite caused by the insoluble nature limited accessible electron acceptor and thus constrained the bacteria growth which engendered lower protein content and biomass content fig s8 besides the complexity of microorganisms in mi mig batches secreted naturally organic matter nom it can serve as electron shuttle to enhance the iron reduction and fe ii complexant as well as avoid fe ii sorption on hematite occupying the reduction sites royer et al 2002 the e v increased by 3 7 23 and 70 respectively with graphite added in the msg psg mig and pig batches fig 5f graphite strengthens the vivianite production in mig and pig batches with insoluble hematite as electron acceptor fig 5f in contrast a tiny enhancement was observed in ferric citrate batches feeding with soluble or insoluble electron acceptors dirb adopts different electron transfer mechanisms bretschger et al 2007 leang et al 2005 rosenbaum et al 2012 the electron transfer from dirb to fe iii minerals largely depends on the accessibility of fe iii to the cells kappler et al 2014 the insolubility of hematite restricts the electrons crossing the cell membrane which furtherly inhibits the iron reduction in the periplasm or cytoplasm reguera et al 2005 delicate cooperation of electrical respiration chains enables electrons to transfer across multilayered membranes to electrical contact with extracellular mineral particles which will overcome the hematite reduction inhibition fig 6 reguera and kashefi 2019 in batch experiments hematite might be partly clustered due to the small size 30 nm the scattered hematite can contact directly with the outer membrane of cells to receive electrons transferred from periplasm with omcs or omcb or electrically connect with pili to receive electron from electrical respiration chains while the electron transfer towards clustered hematite was mainly mediated by pili because the aggregated hematite particles reduced the contact areas which restrain the effective direct contact electron pathway through omcs or omcb indeed the superior of pili have been demonstrated by transmission electron micrographs tem of geobacter sulfurreducens using fe iii oxides as electron acceptor where most of the mineral particles prefer to associate with pili than with cell surface reguera et al 2005 when highly conductive graphite particles 10 µm larger than hematite particles 30 nm were introduced into batches the electron transfer efficiency is promoted for either scattered or clustered hematite conductive graphite facilitated the pili mediated electron transfer by providing higher and more efficient electrical connection areas thus extending the radius of electron transfer for closer electrical interactions between minerals and cells it seems that the role of pili in soluble fe3 is less essential because the pili were not observed in cells grown with soluble chelated forms of the fe iii e g fe iii citrate reguera et al 2005 if the available electron acceptor of fe3 was sufficient non pili mediated electron transfer mechanisms took dominant while the enhancement of supplemented graphite on electron transfer was almost invisible once the available fe3 was exhausted in msg graphite was observed to subtly promoted the pili mediated fe iii p complex reduction fig 1a and c after 10 days while the low reduction rate in hematite batches both the insoluble nature and highly crystallinity constrain the bioavailability of microbes to some extent the graphite addition enriched the functional bacteria geobacter and accelerated the reduction by 131 in pure culture from 0 030 mm day 1 in pi to 0 067 mm day 1 in pig feeding with ferric citrate as electron acceptors graphite exhibited relatively inconspicuous enhancement lower than 7 on vivianite formation whether inoculated with raw sewage or dirb to cut the cost of dosing iron salts in wastewater treatment a moderate amount of iron ore residues such as hematite or other iron minerals was a good substitute for iron salts though insoluble nature of these iron ore residues constrained the reduction graphite accelerated the dir rate in sewage batches by 23 to some extent graphite can be applied in the actual wastewater treatment to enhance the reduction and function of iron ore residues besides although protein content in pig was 78 lower than of mig generally corresponded to lower eps content the graphite promotion on vivianite formation was largely magnified to 70 which demonstrated that the enhancement of graphite on vivianite production was superior to electron shuttles in eps xiao et al 2017 in addition it has been confirmed that adding conductive graphite can enhance the electron transfer efficiency in the anaerobic fermentation system inoculated with anaerobic sludge which provided more evidence for graphite utilization in actual application zhao et al 2015 the separation of vivianite from sludge was difficult due to its tiny crystal size which furtherly inhibited vivianite recovery due to the limited spaces 20 ml restricted the crystals growth the vivianite size was only 90 µm fig s10a while in large bottles 100 ml vivianite can be harvested nearly 240 µm fig s10b which exhibited great potential for graphite application in addition our latter work will investigate the long terms culturing experiments for crystals growth and focus on sludge and actual sewage system to explore the potential effect of graphite in the vivianite formation furthermore the more economic and environmental friendly additive will be explored to enhance the mineralization and phosphorus recovery 4 conclusions the impact of graphite on vivianite formation was systematically investigated in this work with soluble or insoluble electron acceptors by comparing the dir rate fe ii content phosphorus and vivianite formation efficiency it was concluded that graphite promoted dir slightly with ferric citrate within 10 and robustly with limited available electron acceptors hematite conductive graphite enhanced electrical connection between insoluble minerals and bacteria to promote the electron transfer in addition graphite enlarged the vivianite size from hematite significantly through secondary mineralization our research provides useful insights for enhancing the electron transfer between insoluble electron acceptors and microorganisms phosphate mineralization and vivianite crystal growth at the same time other conductive materials may play a role in phosphorus mineralization as well in addition enhancing dir of iron oxides and enlarging crystal size provide new insights for vivianite formation and separation during wastewater treatment declaration of

17381,biomineralized vivianite induced by dissimilatory iron reduction bacteria dirb has received increasing attention because it alleviates phosphorus crisis and phosphorus pollution simultaneously however the relatively small crystal size and low fe iii reduction rate restrict the separation and recovery of vivianite in this study graphite was selected as additive to enhance vivianite biomineralization with soluble ferric citrate and insoluble hematite as two representative electron acceptors as soluble ferric citrate provided abundant accessible electron acceptors relatively inconspicuous increase lower than 7 was observed for graphite on vivianite formation while inoculated with raw sewage or dirb in contrast graphite considerably increased vivianite formation efficiency by 23 in insoluble hematite inoculated with raw sewage the graphite promotion on vivianite formation in hematite batch was magnified to 70 by dirb dosing hematite inhibited the supply of electron acceptors while conductive graphite promoted the electrical connection between minerals and dirb thus improved the fe iii reduction rate and efficiency in addition secondary minerals in hematite exhibited a larger aspect ratio and tended to aggregate on graphite graphite enlarged the vivianite size in hematite from 10 µm to 90 µm due to aggregation enhancing dissimilatory iron reduction dir

wilfert et al 2018 2015 2016 vivianite may potentially find used as agriculture fertilizer to boost the bean yield to substitute chemical fertilizers which were commonly used fodoué et al 2015 besides it also efficiently alleviates chlorosis of crops caused by iron deficiency in calcareous soil de santiago et al 2013 díaz et al 2009 which usually leads to growth depression leaf necrosis and crop

they also illustrated the optimal conditions for vivianite formation were in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 with initial po4 3 5 mg l and fe p molar ratio of 1 5 though vivianite biosynthesis technologies for phosphorus mineralization have received inspiring results there are still some issues to be solved the biggest challenge is the relatively small crystal makes it hard to separate and select moreover it also causes slow and inefficient fe iii reduction vivianite is biomineralized products of dirb by reducing high valent iron compound fe iii to divalent iron ion fe2 increasing the iron

the morphology of final biomineral products were analyzed to speculate the possible promotion mechanism of graphite with the expectation of proposing an innovative perspective for vivianite formation enhancement 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and cultivation conditions based on our previous studies wang et al 2018 the vivianite formation efficiency of sludge inoculated batch was 42 lower than that of sewage inoculated batch due to higher biomass and more heterotrophic bacteria competing for nutrients and carbon sources in order to figure out the exact influence of graphite on fe iii reduction as well as eliminate the effect of the complex digested sludge sewage and pure bacteria were inoculated as the biomass in addition to simulate the microbial environment of the beginning of

the mean values 3 results and discussion 3 1 graphite promoted vivianite formation negligibly with fe3 as electron acceptors inoculated with raw sewage biomass fe3 concentration decreased in both ms and msg batches accompanied by the continuous increase of fe ii content in the solid phase fig s1 simultaneously solid fe iii accumulated sharply during day 2 4 and then reduced particularly in the initial 4 days the content of fe3 in the ms group decreased by 7 46 mm while the fe iii and fe ii content increased by 4 80 mm and 2 60 mm respectively in the msg group the addition of graphite alleviated the rapid precipitation of fe3 compare with the ms batch fe3 consumed only 2 57 mm in the first four days in msg in which only 0 77 mm was precipitated in the form of solid fe iii after 6 days fe3 was depleted in both ms and msg batches dropping from the initial 8 92 8 94 mm to about 0 23 0 24 mm fig s1d similarly the concentration of po4 3 was also declined from the initial 7 92 8 16 mm to 3 16 3 19 mm on day 6 and then slowly decreased to 2 57 2 64 mm on day 22 fig s1e the rapid synchronization decrease of fe3 and po4 3 was attributed to the consumption of the citrate leading to fe3 release and complexation with po4 3 to form fe iii p precipitates correspondingly the content of extractable fe iii and p increased sharply during the first 6 days with the color of the medium changed from transparent bright orange solution to black flocculation fig s2 the fe iii content in ms reached the peak at day 4 5 10 mm and then decreased continuously until it approached 0 which indicated that dirb was able to use the complexed fe iii p precipitate as electron acceptor for dissimilation reduction msg by contrast delayed two days to get the peak 2 20 mm fe iii lower than that in ms batches fe iii p content decreased after graphite supplementation which confirmed that graphite alleviated the precipitation of fe3 accordingly fe ii content increased sharply reached about 6 mm content in both batches during the first 6 days at the same time the concentration of reduced soluble fe2 was kept at a relatively low level at the range of 0 0 10 mm in both ms and msg batches fig s1b the low fe2 concentration is mainly due to the fe3 rapid reduction in bulk solution to reach the precipitated supersaturated index threshold to synthesis vivianite liu et al 2018 the continuous and steady increase of fe ii and p in the solid phase indicated that vivianite was accumulated constantly after day 6 the reduction of complexed fe iii precipitates turned to be the major reaction and fe ii content in the msg batch emerged to be higher than that in ms batch in particular the tfe ii content of msg was 9 higher than that of ms group on day 14 with the maximum fe ii content gap of 0 75 mm though the r ave of ms and msg varied infinitesimally 0 37 mm day 1 and 0 39 mm day 1 respectively the r max of msg reached 1 66 mm day 1 which was 11 higher than that of ms 1 50 mm day 1 nevertheless due to the exhaustion of electron acceptor fe iii and fe3 there was a tiny distinction between ms and msg for both e p 62 and 64 respectively and e v 31 and 32 respectively as a result in the sewage inoculated groups feeding with fe3 as electron acceptor graphite promoted the vivianite formation slightly according to sem the flower like nodules composed of rhombic platy shaped crystals stacked in random directions are vivianite fig 1 a with the whole size of 30 70 μm only minerals can be observed in the field of view at low magnification of 300 x while microbes appeared in the 5 0 kx magnification field figs s9 the scale shaped sheets with uneven surfaces were graphite particles fig 1b graphite addition enlarged the size of vivianite from the range of 30 70 µm in ms batches to 40 110 μm in msg batches the eds results fig 1c revealed the fe p ratio of crystals is 1 50 which was exactly with the stoichiometric ratio of fe p in vivianite meanwhile the xrd patterns fig s3 of collected precipitates revealed that the main diffraction peaks were in coincidence with the vivianite reference pattern pdf 30 0662 and graphite addition increase the crystallinity of vivianite both sem eds and xrd fig s3 and table s3 analysis suggested that vivianite was almost the main detectable fe p mineral the biomass content and microbial communities of ms and msg batches were compared to further reveal the function of graphite on vivianite production fig s4 after 22 days cultivation the protein content of ms and msg groups increased from 1 35 µg ml 1 to 63 61 µg ml 1 and 63 52 µg ml 1 respectively the negligible difference of biomass protein content between ms and msg indicated that graphite has little impact on the biomass proliferation compared with the original sewage the biodiversity of both ms and msg decreased with the cultivation the proportion of proteobacteria increased by 30 and 21 with or without graphite geobacter is an important member within the proteobacteria phylum röling 2014 which has been confirmed to be the iron manganese and some metals including solid phase respiration bacteria in natural environment reguera and kashefi 2019 to illustrate the mechanism of how graphite affects the fe iii reduction and vivianite production geobacter sulfurreducens pca a representative dirb in proteobacteria were inoculated in further pure batches inoculated with geobacter though the variation of iron and phosphorus were consistent with the trend in sewage batches fig s5 the fe iii reduction rates of pure culture batches were much higher than that of sewage batches the r ave in the ps and psg were 2 79 mm day 1 and 2 95 mm day 1 6 5 and 6 6 times higher than that in ms and msg the r max even reached 7 11 mm day 1 and 8 20 mm day 1 induced the dir almost finished in 24 h due to the variation of biomass content fig s8 the biomass normalization rate table s2 of both ms and msg was 0 007 mm day 1 µg ml 1 63 and 67 lower than that in ps and psg due to geobacter content throughout the whole batch tfe ii content in psg was always 2 16 higher than that in the ps batch especially at 36 hours the tfe ii content of the graphite group was 16 higher than that in control comparing with 9 enhancement in sewage batches graphite promotion on fe iii reduction and vivianite production was magnified in pure culture batches inoculated with geobacter however due to the exhaustion of electron acceptor fe iii and fe3 graphite addition increased the final e v of ps by only 7 from 29 in ps batch to 31 in psg batch feeding with fe3 as electron acceptor graphite addition enhanced the fe3 reduction and vivianite production slightly whether inoculated with sewage or geobacter 3 2 graphite promoted vivianite formation significantly with hematite as electron acceptors feeding hematite as electron acceptor fe iii content in both mi and mig batches decreased gradually from the initial 7 80 mm to 0 00 mm accompanied by the increase of fe2 fe3 and fe ii content fig s6 synchronously the concentration of po4 3 decreased and the p accumulated steadily in the solid phase the fe ii and p content in mig batches were always higher than that in mi batches on day 15 the tfe ii content of mig was 23 higher than mi group with the maximum fe ii content gap of 0 98 mm simultaneously the p content in mig batches was 21 higher than that in mi batches correspondingly the e p and e v of mig were 21 and 23 higher than mi on day 15 graphite addition increased the r max of mi by 17 from 0 35 mm day 1 in mi batch to 0 41 mm day 1 in mig batch as a result graphite addition promoted both the dissimilated hematite reduction and the mineralization of vivianite in raw sewage batches the phylogenetic analysis showed that the biodiversity decreased in both mi and mig batches fig 2 a the percentage of the proteobacteria increased from 34 raw sewage to 93 mi in mig graphite addition enhanced the percentage of the proteobacteria up to 99 at the genus level geobacter exhibited significant enhancement from the initial 1 in raw sewage to 94 and 99 in mi and mig batches similar to the phylum results the graphite addition increased the geobacter abundance fig 2b showing that graphite selectively enriched the dirb similar to sewage batches feeding with hematite fe ii accumulated continuously in both pi and pig batches along with the decrease of fe iii fig 3 distinguishingly comparing to mig much more significant enhancement of graphite on fe iii reduction and vivianite production was observed in pig comparing to 17 enhancement in sewage batches adding graphite increased the r max by 131 in pure culture from 0 030 mm day 1 in pi to 0 067 mm day 1 in pig simultaneously graphite addition increased the final e v of pi by 70 from 5 in pi batch to 9 in pig batch due to the insolubility of hematite less vivianite was accumulated during relatively slow fe iii reduction in pig as a result the e v of pi and pig batches were as low as 5 and 9 much lower than that in psg 31 though the e v was relatively low in pig graphite addition increased the e v by 70 much higher than 23 enhancement in sewage batches in summary feeding with hematite as electron acceptor graphite promoted the fe iii reduction and vivianite formation notably and this promotion was significantly amplified with the pure culture of dirb 3 3 graphite facilitate the vivianite enlargement by 90 µm with hematite as electron acceptors quite different from the flower like crystals with fe3 as electron acceptors vivianite produced from hematite was fine crystals with larger aspect ratio about 3 3 and stacked unidirectionally along the long side hematite particles were not visible in the field of vision because of the nanometer level size of hematite figs 4 and s7 feeding with ferric citrate fe3 was sharply reduced to fe2 in a short time attributed to the low solubility of vivianite k sp 10 32 under neutral ph the reduced fe2 quickly binds to po4 3 into rhombic platy shaped crystals which then stacked non directionally to form flower like crystals fig 1a comparing to nucleating directly from solution mineralization of fe3 rothe et al 2016 vivianite with insoluble electron acceptor was a secondary mineral of hematite reduction it was affected by reductive dissolution of fe iii ph redox potential orp the supersaturation of the solution and surface processes edge free energy lundager madsen and bruun hansen 2014 hu et al confirmed that the aspect ratio of the iron mineral was affected by the molar ratio of iron ions and phosphate hu and yu 2008 a lower molar ratio of fe3 po4 3 especially with relatively high po4 3 was beneficial to synthesize elongated crystals with a longer length and a shorter radial diameter the anisotropic growth was resulted from the specific adsorption of po4 3 on mineral which limited the radial direction growth feeding with hematite fe2 concentration is much lower than po4 3 concentration due to the slow reduction rate of insoluble fe iii po4 3 was directionally adsorbed on vivianite which further oriented stacked along the long axis fig 4a agglomerate vivianite was synthesized in mig and pig batches from hematite while monodispersed vivianite crystals were produced without graphite addition fig 4b graphite accelerated the fe iii reduction from hematite to generate more fe2 which quickly precipitated with po4 3 to synthesize more vivianite crystal nuclei high surface energy and instability of newly small crystal nucleus generated during secondary mineralization induced aggregation to form large agglomerate vivianite hu and yu 2008 inoculated with geobacter or sewage batches graphite promoted the aggregation of vivianite during the dissimilated hematite reduction to form the vivianite crystal larger than 90 µm figs 4 and s7 besides researchers demonstrated that additives normally have a marked influence on the surface as well as edge free energies and thus on crystallization kinetics lundager madsen and koch 2018 for example lundager lundager madsen 2008 analyzed the kinetics of several additives in solvent mediated phase transformation of brushite to basic calcium phosphates they found that additive accelerated the surface nucleation which is identical to vivianite crystallization kinetics nucleation growth at higher supersaturation lundager madsen and bruun hansen 2014 adding zn was verified to lower the edge free energy which favored irregular aggregates and inhibited lateral growth lundager madsen 2008 similarly as graphite addition lowered the edge free energy mineralized tiny vivianite crystals and irregular aggregates fig 4b tended to accelerate the crystal growth rate by surface nucleation rosa and lundager madsen 2010 3 4 graphite enhanced the vivianite formation by promoting an electrical connection between minerals and microorganisms distinguishing the dir rate with different inoculum and iron sources it was discovered that the r max using ferric citrate as electron acceptors 1 66 and 8 20 mm day 1 in msg and psg was much higher than using hematite as electron acceptors 0 41 mm day 1 in mig and 0 07 mm day 1 in pig fig 5 e besides in fe3 batches the r max of pure culture batches was significantly higher 7 11 mm day 1 in ps and 8 20 mm day 1 in psg than that in the sewage batches 1 50 mm day 1 in ms and 1 67 mm day 1 in msg though the r max value of hematite was much lower than that in fe3 the acceleration of graphite on r max was amplified to up to 17 and 131 in mig and pig the iron reduction rates of pig were always higher than those of pi all through the whole batches experiments fig 5d especially r max of pi and pig were much lower than that in mi and mig much lower r max in pi 0 03 mm day 1 than in mi 0 35 mm day 1 was ascribed as follows the lower reduction rate of hematite caused by the insoluble nature limited accessible electron acceptor and thus constrained the bacteria growth which engendered lower protein content and biomass content fig s8 besides the complexity of microorganisms in mi mig batches secreted naturally organic matter nom it can serve as electron shuttle to enhance the iron reduction and fe ii complexant as well as avoid fe ii sorption on hematite occupying the reduction sites royer et al 2002 the e v increased by 3 7 23 and 70 respectively with graphite added in the msg psg mig and pig batches fig 5f graphite strengthens the vivianite production in mig and pig batches with insoluble hematite as electron acceptor fig 5f in contrast a tiny enhancement was observed in ferric citrate batches feeding with soluble or insoluble electron acceptors dirb adopts different electron transfer mechanisms bretschger et al 2007 leang et al 2005 rosenbaum et al 2012 the electron transfer from dirb to fe iii minerals largely depends on the accessibility of fe iii to the cells kappler et al 2014 the insolubility of hematite restricts the electrons crossing the cell membrane which furtherly inhibits the iron reduction in the periplasm or cytoplasm reguera et al 2005 delicate cooperation of electrical respiration chains enables electrons to transfer across multilayered membranes to electrical contact with extracellular mineral particles which will overcome the hematite reduction inhibition fig 6 reguera and kashefi 2019 in batch experiments hematite might be partly clustered due to the small size 30 nm the scattered hematite can contact directly with the outer membrane of cells to receive electrons transferred from periplasm with omcs or omcb or electrically connect with pili to receive electron from electrical respiration chains while the electron transfer towards clustered hematite was mainly mediated by pili because the aggregated hematite particles reduced the contact areas which restrain the effective direct contact electron pathway through omcs or omcb indeed the superior of pili have been demonstrated by transmission electron micrographs tem of geobacter sulfurreducens using fe iii oxides as electron acceptor where most of the mineral particles prefer to associate with pili than with cell surface reguera et al 2005 when highly conductive graphite particles 10 µm larger than hematite particles 30 nm were introduced into batches the electron transfer efficiency is promoted for either scattered or clustered hematite conductive graphite facilitated the pili mediated electron transfer by providing higher and more efficient electrical connection areas thus extending the radius of electron transfer for closer electrical interactions between minerals and cells it seems that the role of pili in soluble fe3 is less essential because the pili were not observed in cells grown with soluble chelated forms of the fe iii e g fe iii citrate reguera et al 2005 if the available electron acceptor of fe3 was sufficient non pili mediated electron transfer mechanisms took dominant while the enhancement of supplemented graphite on electron transfer was almost invisible once the available fe3 was exhausted in msg graphite was observed to subtly promoted the pili mediated fe iii p complex reduction fig 1a and c after 10 days while the low reduction rate in hematite batches both the insoluble nature and highly crystallinity constrain the bioavailability of microbes to some extent the graphite addition enriched the functional bacteria geobacter and accelerated the reduction by 131 in pure culture from 0 030 mm day 1 in pi to 0 067 mm day 1 in pig feeding with ferric citrate as electron acceptors graphite exhibited relatively inconspicuous enhancement lower than 7 on vivianite formation whether inoculated with raw sewage or dirb to cut the cost of dosing iron salts in wastewater treatment a moderate amount of iron ore residues such as hematite or other iron minerals was a good substitute for iron salts though insoluble nature of these iron ore residues constrained the reduction graphite accelerated the dir rate in sewage batches by 23 to some extent graphite can be applied in the actual wastewater treatment to enhance the reduction and function of iron ore residues besides although protein content in pig was 78 lower than of mig generally corresponded to lower eps content the graphite promotion on vivianite formation was largely magnified to 70 which demonstrated that the enhancement of graphite on vivianite production was superior to electron shuttles in eps xiao et al 2017 in addition it has been confirmed that adding conductive graphite can enhance the electron transfer efficiency in the anaerobic fermentation system inoculated with anaerobic sludge which provided more evidence for graphite utilization in actual application zhao et al 2015 the separation of vivianite from sludge was difficult due to its tiny crystal size which furtherly inhibited vivianite recovery due to the limited spaces 20 ml restricted the crystals growth the vivianite size was only 90 µm fig s10a while in large bottles 100 ml vivianite can be harvested nearly 240 µm fig s10b which exhibited great potential for graphite application in addition our latter work will investigate the long terms culturing experiments for crystals growth and focus on sludge and actual sewage system to explore the potential effect of graphite in the vivianite formation furthermore the more economic and environmental friendly additive will be explored to enhance the mineralization and phosphorus recovery 4 conclusions the impact of graphite on vivianite formation was systematically investigated in this work with soluble or insoluble electron acceptors by comparing the dir rate fe ii content phosphorus and vivianite formation efficiency it was concluded that graphite promoted dir slightly with ferric citrate within 10 and robustly with limited available electron acceptors hematite conductive graphite enhanced electrical connection between insoluble minerals and bacteria to promote the electron transfer in addition graphite enlarged the vivianite size from hematite significantly through secondary mineralization our research provides useful insights for enhancing the electron transfer between insoluble electron acceptors and microorganisms phosphate mineralization and vivianite crystal growth at the same time other conductive materials may play a role in phosphorus mineralization as well in addition enhancing dir of iron oxides and enlarging crystal size provide new insights for vivianite formation and separation during wastewater treatment declaration of

17382,the efficient removal of arsenite as iii from groundwater remains a great challenge nanoscale oxides of fe iii zr iv and al iii can selectively remove arsenic from groundwater through inner sphere complexation however owing to polysilicate coatings formation on nanoparticles surface the ubiquitous silicate exerts remarkably adverse effects on as iii removal herein we propose a new strategy to enhance silicate resistance of nanoscale oxides by embedding them inside the redox polymer host as a proof of concept the nanocomposite hfo ps cl was employed to remove as iii from silicate containing water the polymer host ps cl contains active chlorine to oxidize as iii into arsenate as v and the embedded fe iii oxides enabling specific adsorption toward arsenic silicate exerts negligible effects on as iii removal by hfo ps cl in ph 3 7 but increasing the residual arsenic concentration from 49 µg l to 166 µg l for the solutions treated by hfo ps n i e the nanoscale fe iii oxides embedded inside the polymer host without active chlorine during the six cyclic decontamination regeneration assays hfo ps cl steadily reduces as iii below 10 µg l as for hfo ps n however the residual arsenic increases to 57 µg l in the sixth run in column mode hfo ps cl column generates 3200 bed volume bv clean water as 10 µg l from the simulated as iii contaminated groundwater in contrast the values for as v contaminated water and hfo ps n column are only 650 bv and 608 bv respectively the stoichiometric assays xps and in situ atr ftir analysis demonstrate that silicate polymerization is intensively suppressed by the protons produced during as iii oxidation thus rendering hfo ps cl with excellent silicate resistant properties graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords inner sphere complex oxidation silicate active site regeneration 1 introduction millions of people are threatened by arsenic as contamination in groundwater worldwide ali et al 2019 bhowmick et al 2018 there are two main inorganic as species i e arsenate as v and much more toxic arsenite as iii guo et al 2014 macdonald et al 2016 rodriguez lado et al 2013 in the anoxic environment such as groundwater as iii was frequently detected as the dominant form smedley and kinniburgh 2002 unlike the anionic as v as iii mainly exists as neutral molecule in nature waters berner et al 2010 li et al 2016 male et al 2007 and the sequestration of as iii from water is much more difficult than as v feng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 for instance the adsorption distribution coefficient kd of as v onto amorphous iron oxide was above three times that of as iii at ph 5 0 dixit and hering 2003 liu et al 2015 similarly only 79 as iii was removed from water by using the iron oxide coated sand whereas the removal efficiency for as v was 99 5 under otherwise identical conditions hsu et al 2008 due to highly toxic nature the world health organization who and environmental protection agencies of china and the us have set the allowable maximum contaminant level mcl of as in drinking water as 10 µg l however it is rather hard for traditional precipitation or coagulation methods to reduce as particularly as iii to such low levels pi et al 2017 senn et al 2018 shi et al 2018 in the past decades a variety of nanoscale hydro oxides of fe iii zr iv and al iii and their derivatives have been prepared for specific as adsorption through inner sphere complex formation gu et al 2016 liu et al 2015 park et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for example various polymer nanocomposites pncs were developed by encapsulating nanoscale fe iii oxides inside porous polymer beads lofrano et al 2016 sun et al 2018 these nanocomposite adsorbents exhibited satisfactory as v removal and exceptional stability in an over 1 year successive pilot scale assay on mining wastewater jiang et al 2014 owing to the integration of high adsorption reactivity of the nanoparticles nps and easy operation of the bulky hosts still the removal of as iii by pncs is much more inefficient than as v in fixed bed adsorption the effective treatment amount of as iii is only 20 of that for as v yu et al 2019 moreover the adsorption of as iii v onto nps is significantly affected by the omnipresent silicates german et al 2019 hiemstra 2018 in the case of as iii adsorption onto goethite the presence of 1 mm silicate increased the residual as iii from nearly zero to 280 µg l luxton et al 2008 with respect to as v silicate exerted negligible effects on the decontamination efficiency of iron oxides in batch adsorption assays christl et al 2012 however the incubation of iron oxide with 60 µm silicate for 50 days reduced the removal efficiency of as v from 100 to 60 christl et al 2012 suggesting that mere pre oxidation of as iii into as v cannot rule out the adverse impacts exerted by silicate the reason for such a remarkable decline in adsorption efficiency is that silicate could also form stable inner sphere complex with metal oxides thus competing for the adsorption sites with as iii v hiemstra 2018 kanematsu et al 2018 more importantly polysilicate species would gradually form on the surface of metal oxides through silicon oxygen silicon bonds formation under neutral or alkaline conditions christl et al 2012 hiemstra 2018 kanematsu et al 2018 swedlund et al 2011 as a result a considerable amount of the active sites is unable to interact with as christl et al 2012 also the formation of polysilicate species is unfavorable to the regeneration of the exhausted adsorbents it was reported that alkali treatment could desorb 95 as v from iron oxides whereas this value for polysilicates is only 45 padungthon and sengupta 2013 the undesirable effects caused by silicate have become one of the major challenges compromising the long term utilization of nanomaterials in groundwater treatment in this study we propose a new strategy to enhance the silicate resistance of nps through embedding them inside the redox polymer host containing active chlorine the oxidation of as iii by active chlorine will produce massive protons protons facilitate adsorption of the generated as v onto nps zhang et al 2017 and more importantly transform silicates into neutral molecules and suppress their polymerization on nps surface christl et al 2012 hence the combination of oxidation and adsorption may render the resultant nanocomposite with outstanding silicate resistant properties although the oxidation of as iii by using active chlorine kociołek balawejder et al 2011 natan et al 2015 and subsequent adsorption of the generated as v by using iron oxides zhang et al 2014 have been extensively reported the synergistic effects between the two reactions were rarely observed as a proof of concept hfo ps cl i e a recently developed nanocomposite containing active chlorine and fe iii oxide nps zhang et al 2017 is employed for the removal of as iii from silicate containing water the performance of another nanocomposite referred to as hfo ps n i e the pnc contains fe iii oxide nps but without active chlorine and the performance of hfo ps cl for as v removal were investigated as comparisons the underlying mechanism for the outstanding silicate resistance of hfo ps cl was particularly discussed this study sheds new light on rational design of highly efficient purifiers

hfo ps n and hfo ps cl were prepared according to our previous study zhang et al 2017 in brief 41 g dmh was mixed with 6 g koh in 20 ml boiling ethanol for several hours to obtain the deprotonated dmh the polymer host ps n was then obtained from the reaction between 80 g cmps and the deprotonated dmh in anhydrous dimethylformamide dmf at 95 c for 12 h then the ps n was immersed with the binary

ferrihydrite respectively 2 3 batch experiments considering that silicate concentration in most groundwater is in the range of 1 10 mg si l kortatsi 2007 all the solutions used in this study contained 5 mg si l unless otherwise specified the batch experiments were conducted by adding 0 050 g hfo ps cl n into the solutions 100 ml followed by shaking at 298 k for 48 h to ensure equilibrium given that groundwater are mainly weakly alkaline dehbandi et al 2019 the initial ph of each solution was adjusted to 8 0 0 2 using 0 1 m hcl and naoh unless otherwise specified the concentration of as was set as 1000 µg l unless particularly stated the kinetic information was obtained from the experiments on as iii solutions with and without silicate 5 0 mg si l and water samples were collected at time intervals to determine the concentration of as iii and as v the effects of silicate on as iii removal were tested by varying its concentration from 0 to 20 mg si l the effects of initial ph on the adsorption of as iii onto hfo ps cl n were investigated with and without silicate 5 0 mg si l in a wide ph range 3 9 adsorption experiments were also carried out on silicate solutions 5 0 mg si l without as in ph range 3 9 using 0 1 m hcl and naoh to maintain solution phs at the preset values throughout the entire experiments the cyclic adsorption experiments were conducted on as iii as v solutions containing silicate 5 0 mg si l after adsorption the used hfo ps cl n beads were immersed in 5 naoh for 6 h followed by subsequent treatment with 2 naclo at ph 7 5 0 5 for 6 h to regenerate the nanocomposite materials afterward the beads were added into the fresh solutions to start cyclic runs in order to explore the underlying mechanism for silicate resistance the adsorption of as iii v by hfo ps cl was conducted in a wide ph range 3 9 where the solution phs were maintained at the preset values by using 0 1 m hcl and naoh throughout the entire experiments besides the adsorption of as iii v by hfo ps cl in the presence absence of silicate 5 0 mg si l was investigated with varying the initial as concentration from 0 5 to 15 0 mg l 2 3 column experiments column experiments were conducted in glass columns in the length of 130 mm and diameter of 12 mm with thermostatic water bath jackets at 298 k each column was packed with 5 ml aliquot of hfo ps cl or hfo ps n equivalent to 3 9 g dry beads the synthetic solutions ph 8 0 0 2 containing as iii or as v 200 µg l sulfate 200 mg l and silicate 5 0 mg si l were pumped up to down through the adsorbent columns by a peristaltic pump

groundwater jia et al 2017 2 4 characterization and analysis mineralogy of the nanocomposite beads was investigated by an xrd analyzer arl x tra switzerland over a wide range of angles 5 80 with a cu

derived from at least triplet experiments 3 1 effects of silicate on as iii removal the as removal kinetics are depicted in fig 1b clearly the integration of oxidation reduces the equilibrium as concentration from 100 µg l for hfo ps n fig s3 to 1 2 µg l for hfo ps cl fig 1b indicating that oxidation of as iii into as v plays a crucial role in the enhanced removal of as iii by hfo ps cl in comparison with the removal of as iii by hfo ps cl the adsorption of as v onto hfo ps cl exhibited faster kinetics but a similar equilibrium concentration fig 1b in agreement with the fact that all the as loaded on hfo ps cl has been transformed into as v zhang et al 2017 decontamination efficiencies of hfo ps cl and hfo ps n were both adversely affected by silicate 5 mg si l our preliminary study suggests that hfo ps cl sequestrates as through two ways i e inner sphere complexation with as v by fe iii oxide nps and electrostatic attraction by the polymer host ps cl with isoelectric point of 9 2 extensive studies have demonstrated that silicate exerted negligible effects on as v adsorption by iron oxides in batch mode christl et al 2012 possibly owing to the much slower kinetics of silicate iron oxide interaction than that between as v and iron oxides hence the increase of the residual as concentration for hfo ps cl from 1 2 to 46 8 µg l is mainly arising from the competition of silicate for the electrostatic attraction sites in ps cl host as elucidated below concerning hfo ps n however the adsorption of as iii is solely owing to the fe iii oxide nps and the inner sphere complexation between as iii and fe iii oxide nps possesses comparable kinetics with the silicate np interaction yang et al 2009 thus the increase of residual as concentration from 100 to 127 µg l fig s3 is ascribed to the occupation of np surface sites by silicate to further clarify the effect of silicate on as iii removal by hfo ps cl the evolution of aqueous as iii as v and total as is depicted in fig 2 a c in the solution without silicate aqueous as v increases very rapidly to 33 µg l in the first 2h followed by a gradual decrease to nearly zero fig 2b the low aqueous as v concentration during the entire process can be explained by the rapid adsorption rate toward as v fig 1b with respect to the solution with silicate the removal kinetics of as iii was almost identical to the silicate free system fig 2a mainly because the oxidation of as iii was unaffected by silicate however 180 µg l as v is gradually detected in solution and then the concentration decreases to 40 µg l fig 2b it is because silicate competes with as v for the electrostatic attraction sites on the ps cl host as confirmed by the fact that the addition of sulfate 200 mg l a common anion exhibiting much weaker affinity with iron oxides than as v guan et al 2009 in the silicate free system could also increase the residual as v concentration to 40 µg l in addition the effects of silicate concentration on the removal of as iii by hfo ps cl n are depicted in fig 2d from which one can see that the equilibrium as concentration ascends with the coexisting silicate increasing this is expectable because more silicate may pose more intensive competition for adsorption sites clearly hfo ps cl still exhibits significantly enhanced removal efficiencies toward as iii than hfo ps n note that hfo ps cl is capable of directly diminishing as iii from 1000 µg l below 50 µg l fig 2d when silicate concentration is comparable with most groundwaters 0 10 mg si l kortatsi 2007 further increasing silicate concentration would result in significant decline in as iii removal efficiency indicating that hfo ps cl might not work for the groundwaters containing excess silicate e g up to 50 mg si l 3 2 effects of ph effects of initial ph on as iii removal from the solutions with or without silicate were examined as shown in fig 3 a the residual as iii in the solutions treated by hfo ps n slightly decreased from 90 µg l to 48 µg l by increasing ph from 3 9 consistent with as iii adsorption onto iron oxides reported previously zhang et al 2017 when silicate coexists the decontamination capability of hfo ps n was obviously suppressed and the residual as iii increased to 200 µg l besides the as iii removal efficiency of hfo ps n at ph 9 is inferior to those in ph 5 7 possibly associated with the elevated silicate uptake onto hfo ps n with ph increasing fig 3b as for hfo ps cl on the contrary the presence of silicate and ph variation from 3 7 exerted negligible effects on as iii removal efficiency fig 3a such desirable performance is mainly ascribed to the h generated during as iii oxidation eq 1 which will be further discussed below further increasing ph to around 9 the removal efficiency of hfo ps cl dropped sharply because the adsorption of as v onto fe iii oxide nps was intensively inhibited under alkaline conditions dixit and hering 2003 liu et al 2015 luong et al 2018 park et al 2018 1 p stands for the polystyrene matrix as the initial ph increased the amounts of silicate uptake onto hfo ps cl and hfo ps n both elevate fig 3b the preliminary study suggested that the adsorption of silicate onto the host materials ps cl n is negligible with ph increasing the dominant form of silicate gradually changed from neutral molecule h4sio4 into free anion sio3 2 meanwhile the surface charge of iron oxide nps changed because of protonation deprotonation reactions nie et al 2013 besides the increased ph facilitates si o coupling reaction and thereby enhanced polysilicate coatings formation on iron oxides surface christl et al 2012 dietzel 2000 swedlund et al 2011 thus the interaction between silicate and iron oxide was highly ph dependent note that the adsorption capacities of silicate onto hfo ps cl are much lower than those onto hfo ps n in a wide ph range 3 9 mainly associated with the h released during as iii oxidation eq 1 given the crucial role of as iii oxidation it is worth mentioning that people should minimize exposure of the as iii contaminated water to air such that pre oxidation of as iii could be avoided 3 3 underlying mechanism for silicate antifouling properties to uncover the mechanism for the silicate antifouling properties hfo ps cl was utilized to remove as iii v where phs were maintained at the preset values by using hcl and naoh solutions throughout the experiments interestingly the residual as concentrations in the as iii as v solutions treated by hfo ps cl referred to as hfo ps cl asiii and hfo ps cl asv respectively overlap with each other in ph 3 9 fig 4 a implying that the as sequestration onto the solid material is mainly determined by the interaction between hfo ps cl and as v consistent with the fact that all the as uptake onto hfo ps cl is present in the form of as v zhang et al 2017 with respect to the situation without maintaining solution ph however hfo ps cl possesses significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward as iii than as v fig 4b which should be attributed to the h generated by as iii oxidation eq 1 to clarify effects of ph on as v removal by hfo ps cl was monitored in fig s4a from which one could clearly see that as v adsorption was enhanced by decreasing solution ph from 11 0 to 3 0 the results are reasonable because the proportion of the positively charged site feoh2 on np surface increased with ph decreasing to 3 0 fig s5a facilitating the interaction with as v anions the protons can change the surface charge of iron oxides through the protonation reaction in eqs 2 and 3 nie et al 2013 thus promoting the adsorption toward as v anions 2 fe o h feoh 3 feoh h feo h 2 stands for iron oxide surface the oxidation of as iii caused negligible enhancement in fe iii oxide dissolution because solution phs were still above 4 fig s6a and under such conditions the dissolution of iron oxides could be ignored another set of experiments were carried out by adding 0 1 m hcl dropwise into the as v solutions to simulate the generation of h during as iii oxidation the details for the estimation of hcl addition could be found in text s1 and table s1 as displayed in fig s6a the equilibrium ph plots in the as iii solutions and the as v solutions with hcl addition overlap very well furthermore the adsorption isotherm toward as v with hcl addition overlaps with that of as iii as well fig 4b hence we conclude that hcl addition table s1 is able to simulate the generation of h during as iii oxidation as mentioned above as iii is almost 100 transformed into as v by hfo ps cl fig 2a and silicate exerts a negligible effect on as iii oxidation thus the amount of h generated during as iii oxidation is unaffected by silicate as shown in fig 4c without hcl addition the adsorption of as v onto hfo ps cl is obviously inhibited by silicate e g the adsorption capacity decreases from 9 1 mg g for the silicate free system fig 4b to 6 0 mg g for the silicate present system in comparison the presence of silicate exerts less effects on as iii removal by hfo ps cl e g decreasing the adsorption capacity from 11 3 mg g for the silicate free system fig 4b to 9 5 mg g fig 4c attractively hcl addition according to table s1 enhances the removal efficiencies of as v greatly to almost the same with as iii fig 4c demonstrating the key role of h in the silicate resistant properties the effects of bicarbonate on as iii removal were depicted in fig s7a bicarbonate exhibited negligible impacts on as iii removal by hfo ps n regardless of whether silicate was present or not because inner sphere complexation between as iii and iron oxides was barely affected by bicarbonate as for hfo ps cl however the presence of bicarbonate increased the equilibrium concentration of arsenic from 6 to 18 and to 36 µg l for the silicate absent and present systems respectively fig s7a mainly because the ph buffer ability of bicarbonate fig s7b further increasing bicarbonate concentration above 100 mg l brought about negligible change in the equilibrium as concentration the results in fig s7c indicated that the oxidation of as iii by the ps cl host was unaffected by bicarbonate hence the increase of equilibrium arsenic concentration was mainly attributed to the declined adsorption capability under higher phs according to previous study nie et al 2013 the embedded fe iii oxide nps the protonated state was feoh2 possessed pka1 and pka2 values of 5 23 and 7 07 respectively the results calculated by visual minteq 3 0 software fig s5 suggested that at ph 8 0 the dominant species for iron oxide nps as iii as v silicate and bicarbonate were feo h3aso3 pka1 9 2 haso4 2 pka1 2 2 pka2 6 97 pka3 11 93 h4sio4 pka1 9 8 pka2 13 2 and hco3 pka1 6 38 pka2 10 33 respectively in other words the fe iii oxide nps exhibited higher affinity to protons than as iii v silicate and bicarbonate at ph 8 0 considering that as iii oxidation mainly took place inside hfo ps cl zhang et al 2017 the generated protons were mainly captured by the fe iii oxide nps and that is why bicarbonate exerted little effects on as iii removal by hfo ps cl the xps si 2p spectra of the hfo ps cl n samples used in silicate containing solutions were recorded as shown in fig 6a the xps si 2p spectra of hfo ps cl asiii describes an intense binding energy peak locating at 101 9 ev in contrast the values for hfo ps n asiii and hfo ps cl asv shifted to 102 2 ev and 102 5 ev respectively in comparison with hfo ps cl asiii the significant shifts that occurred in hfo ps cl asv and hfo ps n asiii are attributed to obvious silicate polymerization inside the nanocomposites swedlund et al 2011 furthermore the atr ftir absorbance spectra of the solid samples i e hfo ps cl asiii hfo ps n asiii and hfo ps cl asv were in situ recorded at time intervals during the reactions fig s8 then the absorbance increment for each sample was obtained by subtracting the initial spectrum respectively as depicted in fig 6b negligible change is observed in hfo ps cl asiii spectra within 160 min after a largely prolonged time 7200 min two weak peaks at 975 cm 1 and 1020 cm 1 arising from the typical vibration of monomeric and oligomeric silicates respectively christl et al 2012 swedlund et al 2011 appear in the spectrum with respect to hfo ps n asiii and hfo ps cl asv samples however the characteristic peaks of oligomeric silicate can be clearly observed in the first 40 min and become rather intense in 160 min clearly as iii oxidation intensively inhibits silicate polymerization inside hfo ps cl such results are not surprising since as iii oxidation released a considerable amount of h eq 1 which was unfavorable to si o si bond formation christl et al 2012 as reported before the monomeric silicate poses negligible effects on as v adsorption onto iron oxide nps due to the relatively slow adsorption kinetics christl et al 2012 yang et al 2009 while the polysilicate species are able to cover the adsorption sites on nps surface christl et al 2012 the mechanism for the excellent silicate resistance of hfo ps cl is schematically illustrated in fig 7 in brief as iii oxidation by hfo ps cl produced massive h bringing about great enhancement of as v adsorption owing to the change of nps surface charge as well as dramatic suppression of silicate polymerization inside the solid adsorbents 3 4 potential for practical application the cyclic utilization of hfo ps cl and hfo ps n for as iii as v removal from the silicate containing waters are described in fig 5 a after adsorption the solid adsorbents were regenerated by 5 naoh solution followed by subsequent treatment with 2 naclo solution during 6 cyclic successive runs the decontamination efficiency of hfo ps cl asiii remained constant with residual as concentration always below 10 µg l i e the drinking water standards regulated by who us and chinese epa on the contrary the removal efficiencies for hfo ps cl asv and hfo ps n asiii declined gradually during the cyclic adsorption regeneration runs and the residual as concentration ascended up to 16 0 µg l and 57 4 µg l respectively in the 6th run the decline in adsorption efficiency is ascribed to the adverse effects caused by silicate given that the adsorption capability of hfo ps n and hfo ps cl could be fully refreshed by naoh solution under the silicate free systems zhang et al 2017 note that the decline in the removal efficiency of hfo ps cl asv further demonstrates the crucial role of the h generated during as iii oxidation in silicate resistant properties humic acid was used as the representative to detect the effects of natural organic matters noms on as iii removal as depicted in fig s7d the presence of humic acid 2 16 mg c l caused negligible implications on as iii removal efficiency possibly because the much larger size of nom molecules than as iii inhibited the diffusion of nom inside nanopores of the polymer host siripinyanond et al 2005 furthermore column adsorption experiments were conducted on the simulated and the real groundwater the synthetic solutions containing 200 µg l as iii or as v 5 mg si l silicate and 200 mg l so4 2 were pumped up to down through the hfo ps cl or hfo ps n samples packed in the columns as shown in fig 5b hfo ps cl column was able to generate 3200 bv clean water as 10 µg l from as iii contaminated water successively in comparison the clean water produced by the hfo ps cl column from as v contaminated solution and by hfo ps n column from as iii polluted solution were only 650 bv and 608 bv respectively after adsorption the exhausted hfo ps cl could be fully refreshed by treatment with naoh and naclo solutions for repeated use without any loss in decontamination efficiency as elucidated above also the real groundwater sampled from jinzhong city china was spiked with 200 µg l as iii and then was pumped up to down through the hfo ps cl n columns in comparison with the synthetic water the effective treatment amounts for hfo ps cl n columns both declined still the effective treatment amount for hfo ps cl column 1640 bv was much higher than hfo ps n column 260 bv further verifying the important role of as iii oxidation note that the presence of bicarbonate could maintain ph of the effluent at 8 0 fig 5c while the effluent ph from the synthetic water declined to 4 for hfo ps cl column at initial and was maintained at 6 later fig 5b 4 conclusions in this study we reported a new strategy i e the combination of oxidation and adsorption to enhance silicate resistance of nanocomposite adsorbents for water decontamination from as iii as a proof of concept a bifunctional nanocomposite hfo ps cl i e the redox polymer containing fe iii oxide nps was utilized to sequestrate as iii from silicate containing water we demonstrated that the h generated during as iii oxidation could enhance adsorption toward the generated as v and more importantly could inhibit silicate polymerization and thereby suppress the formation of polysilicate coatings on nps surface as a result hfo ps cl exhibited greatly enhanced as iii removal efficiency than the nanocomposite adsorbent hfo ps n in both batch and column adsorption moreover hfo ps cl was able to retain constant decontamination efficiency during the cyclic adsorption regeneration runs owing to the silicate resistant properties given that silicate is ubiquitous in waste waters and it exerts obviously adverse impacts on the removal of various contaminants like phosphorous fluorine nitrate and persistent organic pollutants pops this study may stimulate more efforts on the rational design of water purifiers with outstanding silicate resistant properties

17382,the efficient removal of arsenite as iii from groundwater remains a great challenge nanoscale oxides of fe iii zr iv and al iii can selectively remove arsenic from groundwater through inner sphere complexation however owing to polysilicate coatings formation on nanoparticles surface the ubiquitous silicate exerts remarkably adverse effects on as iii removal herein we propose a new strategy to enhance silicate resistance of nanoscale oxides by embedding them inside the redox polymer host as a proof of concept the nanocomposite hfo ps cl was employed to remove as iii from silicate containing water the polymer host ps cl contains active chlorine to oxidize as iii into arsenate as v and the embedded fe iii oxides enabling specific adsorption toward arsenic silicate exerts negligible effects on as iii removal by hfo ps cl in ph 3 7 but increasing the residual arsenic concentration from 49 µg l to 166 µg l for the solutions treated by hfo ps n i e the nanoscale fe iii oxides embedded inside the polymer host without active chlorine during the six cyclic decontamination regeneration assays hfo ps cl steadily reduces as iii below 10 µg l as for hfo ps n however the residual arsenic increases to 57 µg l in the sixth run in column mode hfo ps cl column generates 3200 bed volume bv clean water as 10 µg l from the simulated as iii contaminated groundwater in contrast the values for as v contaminated water and hfo ps n column are only 650 bv and 608 bv respectively the stoichiometric assays xps and in situ atr ftir analysis demonstrate that silicate polymerization is intensively suppressed by the protons produced during as iii oxidation thus rendering hfo ps cl with excellent silicate resistant properties graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords inner sphere complex oxidation silicate active site regeneration 1 introduction millions of people are threatened by arsenic as contamination in groundwater worldwide ali et al 2019 bhowmick et al 2018 there are two main inorganic as species i e arsenate as v and much more toxic arsenite as iii guo et al 2014 macdonald et al 2016 rodriguez lado et al 2013 in the anoxic environment such as groundwater as iii was frequently detected as the dominant form smedley and kinniburgh 2002 unlike the anionic as v as iii mainly exists as neutral molecule in nature waters berner et al 2010 li et al 2016 male et al 2007 and the sequestration of as iii from water is much more difficult than as v feng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 for instance the adsorption distribution coefficient kd of as v onto amorphous iron oxide was above three times that of as iii at ph 5 0 dixit and hering 2003 liu et al 2015 similarly only 79 as iii was removed from water by using the iron oxide coated sand whereas the removal efficiency for as v was 99 5 under otherwise identical conditions hsu et al 2008 due to highly toxic nature the world health organization who and environmental protection agencies of china and the us have set the allowable maximum contaminant level mcl of as in drinking water as 10 µg l however it is rather hard for traditional precipitation or coagulation methods to reduce as particularly as iii to such low levels pi et al 2017 senn et al 2018 shi et al 2018 in the past decades a variety of nanoscale hydro oxides of fe iii zr iv and al iii and their derivatives have been prepared for specific as adsorption through inner sphere complex formation gu et al 2016 liu et al 2015 park et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for example various polymer nanocomposites pncs were developed by encapsulating nanoscale fe iii oxides inside porous polymer beads lofrano et al 2016 sun et al 2018 these nanocomposite adsorbents exhibited satisfactory as v removal and exceptional stability in an over 1 year successive pilot scale assay on mining wastewater jiang et al 2014 owing to the integration of high adsorption reactivity of the nanoparticles nps and easy operation of the bulky hosts still the removal of as iii by pncs is much more inefficient than as v in fixed bed adsorption the effective treatment amount of as iii is only 20 of that for as v yu et al 2019 moreover the adsorption of as iii v onto nps is significantly affected by the omnipresent silicates german et al 2019 hiemstra 2018 in the case of as iii adsorption onto goethite the presence of 1 mm silicate increased the residual as iii from nearly zero to 280 µg l luxton et al 2008 with respect to as v silicate exerted negligible effects on the decontamination efficiency of iron oxides in batch adsorption assays christl et al 2012 however the incubation of iron oxide with 60 µm silicate for 50 days reduced the removal efficiency of as v from 100 to 60 christl et al 2012 suggesting that mere pre oxidation of as iii into as v cannot rule out the adverse impacts exerted by silicate the reason for such a remarkable decline in adsorption efficiency is that silicate could also form stable inner sphere complex with metal oxides thus competing for the adsorption sites with as iii v hiemstra 2018 kanematsu et al 2018 more importantly polysilicate species would gradually form on the surface of metal oxides through silicon oxygen silicon bonds formation under neutral or alkaline conditions christl et al 2012 hiemstra 2018 kanematsu et al 2018 swedlund et al 2011 as a result a considerable amount of the active sites is unable to interact with as christl et al 2012 also the formation of polysilicate species is unfavorable to the regeneration of the exhausted adsorbents it was reported that alkali treatment could desorb 95 as v from iron oxides whereas this value for polysilicates is only 45 padungthon and sengupta 2013 the undesirable effects caused by silicate have become one of the major challenges compromising the long term utilization of nanomaterials in groundwater treatment in this study we propose a new strategy to enhance the silicate resistance of nps through embedding them inside the redox polymer host containing active chlorine the oxidation of as iii by active chlorine will produce massive protons protons facilitate adsorption of the generated as v onto nps zhang et al 2017 and more importantly transform silicates into neutral molecules and suppress their polymerization on nps surface christl et al 2012 hence the combination of oxidation and adsorption may render the resultant nanocomposite with outstanding silicate resistant properties although the oxidation of as iii by using active chlorine kociołek balawejder et al 2011 natan et al 2015 and subsequent adsorption of the generated as v by using iron oxides zhang et al 2014 have been extensively reported the synergistic effects between the two reactions were rarely observed as a proof of concept hfo ps cl i e a recently developed nanocomposite containing active chlorine and fe iii oxide nps zhang et al 2017 is employed for the removal of as iii from silicate containing water the performance of another nanocomposite referred to as hfo ps n i e the pnc contains fe iii oxide nps but without active chlorine and the performance of hfo ps cl for as v removal were investigated as comparisons the underlying mechanism for the outstanding silicate resistance of hfo ps cl was particularly discussed this study sheds new light on rational design of highly efficient purifiers applicable in silicate containing water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all of the reagents used in this study were of analytical pure or higher grade stock solution of as iii and

the polymer host ps n was then obtained from the reaction between 80 g cmps and the deprotonated dmh in anhydrous dimethylformamide dmf at 95 c for 12 h then the ps n was immersed with the binary solution of 1 0 m fecl3 and 2 0 m hcl for 6 h followed by alkaline treatment to allow in situ growth of fe iii oxide nps inside the nanopores and the resultant nanocomposite were referred to as hfo ps n after the treatment by 2 naclo solution ph 7 5 0 5 at 50 c for 6 h hfo ps n was transformed into hfo ps cl the structure of hfo ps n and hfo ps cl were schematically illustrated in fig 1 a the

ferrihydrite respectively 2 3 batch experiments considering that silicate concentration in most groundwater is in the range of 1 10 mg si l kortatsi 2007 all the solutions used in this study contained 5 mg si l unless otherwise specified the batch experiments were conducted by adding 0 050 g hfo ps cl n into the solutions 100 ml followed by shaking at 298 k for 48 h to ensure equilibrium given that groundwater are mainly weakly alkaline dehbandi et al 2019 the initial ph of each solution was adjusted to 8 0 0 2 using 0 1 m hcl and naoh unless otherwise specified the concentration of as was set as 1000 µg l unless particularly stated the kinetic information was obtained from the experiments on as iii solutions with and without silicate 5 0 mg si l and water samples were collected at time intervals to determine the concentration of as iii and as v the effects of silicate on as iii removal were tested by varying its concentration from 0 to 20 mg si l the effects of initial ph on the adsorption of as iii onto hfo ps cl n were investigated with and without silicate 5 0 mg si l in a wide ph range 3 9 adsorption experiments were also carried out on silicate solutions 5 0 mg si l without as in ph range 3 9 using 0 1 m hcl and naoh to maintain solution phs at the preset values throughout the entire experiments the cyclic adsorption experiments were conducted on as iii as v solutions containing silicate 5 0 mg si l after adsorption the used hfo ps cl n beads were immersed in 5 naoh for 6 h followed by subsequent treatment with 2 naclo at ph 7 5 0 5 for 6 h to regenerate the nanocomposite materials afterward the beads were added into the fresh solutions to start cyclic runs in order to explore the underlying mechanism for silicate resistance the adsorption of as iii v by hfo ps cl was conducted in a wide ph range 3 9 where the solution phs were maintained at the preset values by using 0 1 m hcl and naoh throughout the entire experiments besides the adsorption of as iii v by hfo ps cl in the presence absence of silicate 5 0 mg si l was investigated with varying the initial as concentration from 0 5 to 15 0 mg l 2 3 column experiments column experiments were conducted in glass columns in the length of 130 mm and diameter of 12 mm with thermostatic water bath jackets at 298 k each column was packed with 5 ml aliquot of hfo ps cl or hfo ps n equivalent to 3 9 g dry beads the synthetic solutions ph 8 0 0 2 containing as iii or as v 200 µg l sulfate 200 mg l and silicate 5 0 mg si l were pumped up to down through the adsorbent columns by a peristaltic pump longerpump china at a constant flow rate of 15 bed volume bv per hour equivalent to the empty bed contact time ebct of 4 min sulfate was utilized to simulate the total dissolved solids tds in groundwater jia et al 2017 2 4 characterization and analysis mineralogy of the nanocomposite beads was investigated by an xrd analyzer arl x tra switzerland over a wide range of angles 5 80 with a cu

derived from at least triplet experiments 3 1 effects of silicate on as iii removal the as removal kinetics are depicted in fig 1b clearly the integration of oxidation reduces the equilibrium as concentration from 100 µg l for hfo ps n fig s3 to 1 2 µg l for hfo ps cl fig 1b indicating that oxidation of as iii into as v plays a crucial role in the enhanced removal of as iii by hfo ps cl in comparison with the removal of as iii by hfo ps cl the adsorption of as v onto hfo ps cl exhibited faster kinetics but a similar equilibrium concentration fig 1b in agreement with the fact that all the as loaded on hfo ps cl has been transformed into as v zhang et al 2017 decontamination efficiencies of hfo ps cl and hfo ps n were both adversely affected by silicate 5 mg si l our preliminary study suggests that hfo ps cl sequestrates as through two ways i e inner sphere complexation with as v by fe iii oxide nps and electrostatic attraction by the polymer host ps cl with isoelectric point of 9 2 extensive studies have demonstrated that silicate exerted negligible effects on as v adsorption by iron oxides in batch mode christl et al 2012 possibly owing to the much slower kinetics of silicate iron oxide interaction than that between as v and iron oxides hence the increase of the residual as concentration for hfo ps cl from 1 2 to 46 8 µg l is mainly arising from the competition of silicate for the electrostatic attraction sites in ps cl host as elucidated below concerning hfo ps n however the adsorption of as iii is solely owing to the fe iii oxide nps and the inner sphere complexation between as iii and fe iii oxide nps possesses comparable kinetics with the silicate np interaction yang et al 2009 thus the increase of residual as concentration from 100 to 127 µg l fig s3 is ascribed to the occupation of np surface sites by silicate to further clarify the effect of silicate on as iii removal by hfo ps cl the evolution of aqueous as iii as v and total as is depicted in fig 2 a c in the solution without silicate aqueous as v increases very rapidly to 33 µg l in the first 2h followed by a gradual decrease to nearly zero fig 2b the low aqueous as v concentration during the entire process can be explained by the rapid adsorption rate toward as v fig 1b with respect to the solution with silicate the removal kinetics of as iii was almost identical to the silicate free system fig 2a mainly because the oxidation of as iii was unaffected by silicate however 180 µg l as v is gradually detected in solution and then the concentration decreases to 40 µg l fig 2b it is because silicate competes with as v for the electrostatic attraction sites on the ps cl host as confirmed by the fact that the addition of sulfate 200 mg l a common anion exhibiting much weaker affinity with iron oxides than as v guan et al 2009 in the silicate free system could also increase the residual as v concentration to 40 µg l in addition the effects of silicate concentration on the removal of as iii by hfo ps cl n are depicted in fig 2d from which one can see that the equilibrium as concentration ascends with the coexisting silicate increasing this is expectable because more silicate may pose more intensive competition for adsorption sites clearly hfo ps cl still exhibits significantly enhanced removal efficiencies toward as iii than hfo ps n note that hfo ps cl is capable of directly diminishing as iii from 1000 µg l below 50 µg l fig 2d when silicate concentration is comparable with most groundwaters 0 10 mg si l kortatsi 2007 further increasing silicate concentration would result in significant decline in as iii removal efficiency indicating that hfo ps cl might not work for the groundwaters containing excess silicate e g up to 50 mg si l 3 2 effects of ph effects of initial ph on as iii removal from the solutions with or without silicate were examined as shown in fig 3 a the residual as iii in the solutions treated by hfo ps n slightly decreased from 90 µg l to 48 µg l by increasing ph from 3 9 consistent with as iii adsorption onto iron oxides reported previously zhang et al 2017 when silicate coexists the decontamination capability of hfo ps n was obviously suppressed and the residual as iii increased to 200 µg l besides the as iii removal efficiency of hfo ps n at ph 9 is inferior to those in ph 5 7 possibly associated with the elevated silicate uptake onto hfo ps n with ph increasing fig 3b as for hfo ps cl on the contrary the presence of silicate and ph variation from 3 7 exerted negligible effects on as iii removal efficiency fig 3a such desirable performance is mainly ascribed to the h generated during as iii oxidation eq 1 which will be further discussed below further increasing ph to around 9 the removal efficiency of hfo ps cl dropped sharply because the adsorption of as v onto fe iii oxide nps was intensively inhibited under alkaline conditions dixit and hering 2003 liu et al 2015 luong et al 2018 park et al 2018 1 p stands for the polystyrene matrix as the initial ph increased the amounts of silicate uptake onto hfo ps cl and hfo ps n both elevate fig 3b the preliminary study suggested that the adsorption of silicate onto the host materials ps cl n is negligible with ph increasing the dominant form of silicate gradually changed from neutral molecule h4sio4 into free anion sio3 2 meanwhile the surface charge of iron oxide nps changed because of protonation deprotonation reactions nie et al 2013 besides the increased ph facilitates si o coupling reaction and thereby enhanced polysilicate coatings formation on iron oxides surface christl et al 2012 dietzel 2000 swedlund et al 2011 thus the interaction between silicate and iron oxide was highly ph dependent note that the adsorption capacities of silicate onto hfo ps cl are much lower than those onto hfo ps n in a wide ph range 3 9 mainly associated with the h released during as iii oxidation eq 1 given the crucial role of as iii oxidation it is worth mentioning that people should minimize exposure of the as iii contaminated water to air such that pre oxidation of as iii could be avoided 3 3 underlying mechanism for silicate antifouling properties to uncover the mechanism for the silicate antifouling properties hfo ps cl was utilized to remove as iii v where phs were maintained at the preset values by using hcl and naoh solutions throughout the experiments interestingly the residual as concentrations in the as iii as v solutions treated by hfo ps cl referred to as hfo ps cl asiii and hfo ps cl asv respectively overlap with each other in ph 3 9 fig 4 a implying that the as sequestration onto the solid material is mainly determined by the interaction between hfo ps cl and as v consistent with the fact that all the as uptake onto hfo ps cl is present in the form of as v zhang et al 2017 with respect to the situation without maintaining solution ph however hfo ps cl possesses significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward as iii than as v fig 4b which should be attributed to the h generated by as iii oxidation eq 1 to clarify effects of ph on as v removal by hfo ps cl was monitored in fig s4a from which one could clearly see that as v adsorption was enhanced by decreasing solution ph from 11 0 to 3 0 the results are reasonable because the proportion of the positively charged site feoh2 on np surface increased with ph decreasing to 3 0 fig s5a facilitating the interaction with as v anions the protons can change the surface charge of iron oxides through the protonation reaction in eqs 2 and 3 nie et al 2013 thus promoting the adsorption toward as v anions 2 fe o h feoh 3 feoh h feo h 2 stands for iron oxide surface the oxidation of as iii caused negligible enhancement in fe iii oxide dissolution because solution phs were still above 4 fig s6a and under such conditions the dissolution of iron oxides could be ignored another set of experiments were carried out by adding 0 1 m hcl dropwise into the as v solutions to simulate the generation of h during as iii oxidation the details for the estimation of hcl addition could be found in text s1 and table s1 as displayed in fig s6a the equilibrium ph plots in the as iii solutions and the as v solutions with hcl addition overlap very well furthermore the adsorption isotherm toward as v with hcl addition overlaps with that of as iii as well fig 4b hence we conclude that hcl addition table s1 is able to simulate the generation of h during as iii oxidation as mentioned above as iii is almost 100 transformed into as v by hfo ps cl fig 2a and silicate exerts a negligible effect on as iii oxidation thus the amount of h generated during as iii oxidation is unaffected by silicate as shown in fig 4c without hcl addition the adsorption of as v onto hfo ps cl is obviously inhibited by silicate e g the adsorption capacity decreases from 9 1 mg g for the silicate free system fig 4b to 6 0 mg g for the silicate present system in comparison the presence of silicate exerts less effects on as iii removal by hfo ps cl e g decreasing the adsorption capacity from 11 3 mg g for the silicate free system fig 4b to 9 5 mg g fig 4c attractively hcl addition according to table s1 enhances the removal efficiencies of as v greatly to almost the same with as iii fig 4c demonstrating the key role of h in the silicate resistant properties the effects of bicarbonate on as iii removal were depicted in fig s7a bicarbonate exhibited negligible impacts on as iii removal by hfo ps n regardless of whether silicate was present or not because inner sphere complexation between as iii and iron oxides was barely affected by bicarbonate as for hfo ps cl however the presence of bicarbonate increased the equilibrium concentration of arsenic from 6 to 18 and to 36 µg l for the silicate absent and present systems respectively fig s7a mainly because the ph buffer ability of bicarbonate fig s7b further increasing bicarbonate concentration above 100 mg l brought about negligible change in the equilibrium as concentration the results in fig s7c indicated that the oxidation of as iii by the ps cl host was unaffected by bicarbonate hence the increase of equilibrium arsenic concentration was mainly attributed to the declined adsorption capability under higher phs according to previous study nie et al 2013 the embedded fe iii oxide nps the protonated state was feoh2 possessed pka1 and pka2 values of 5 23 and 7 07 respectively the results calculated by visual minteq 3 0 software fig s5 suggested that at ph 8 0 the dominant species for iron oxide nps as iii as v silicate and bicarbonate were feo h3aso3 pka1 9 2 haso4 2 pka1 2 2 pka2 6 97 pka3 11 93 h4sio4 pka1 9 8 pka2 13 2 and hco3 pka1 6 38 pka2 10 33 respectively in other words the fe iii oxide nps exhibited higher affinity to protons than as iii v silicate and bicarbonate at ph 8 0 considering that as iii oxidation mainly took place inside hfo ps cl zhang et al 2017 the generated protons were mainly captured by the fe iii oxide nps and that is why bicarbonate exerted little effects on as iii removal by hfo ps cl the xps si 2p spectra of the hfo ps cl n samples used in silicate containing solutions were recorded as shown in fig 6a the xps si 2p spectra of hfo ps cl asiii describes an intense binding energy peak locating at 101 9 ev in contrast the values for hfo ps n asiii and hfo ps cl asv shifted to 102 2 ev and 102 5 ev respectively in comparison with hfo ps cl asiii the significant shifts that occurred in hfo ps cl asv and hfo ps n asiii are attributed to obvious silicate polymerization inside the nanocomposites swedlund et al 2011 furthermore the atr ftir absorbance spectra of the solid samples i e hfo ps cl asiii hfo ps n asiii and hfo ps cl asv were in situ recorded at time intervals during the reactions fig s8 then the absorbance increment for each sample was obtained by subtracting the initial spectrum respectively as depicted in fig 6b negligible change is observed in hfo ps cl asiii spectra within 160 min after a largely prolonged time 7200 min two weak peaks at 975 cm 1 and 1020 cm 1 arising from the typical vibration of monomeric and oligomeric silicates respectively christl et al 2012 swedlund et al 2011 appear in the spectrum with respect to hfo ps n asiii and hfo ps cl asv samples however the characteristic peaks of oligomeric silicate can be clearly observed in the first 40 min and become rather intense in 160 min clearly as iii oxidation intensively inhibits silicate polymerization inside hfo ps cl such results are not surprising since as iii oxidation released a considerable amount of h eq 1 which was unfavorable to si o si bond formation christl et al 2012 as reported before the monomeric silicate poses negligible effects on as v adsorption onto iron oxide nps due to the relatively slow adsorption kinetics christl et al 2012 yang et al 2009 while the polysilicate species are able to cover the adsorption sites on nps surface christl et al 2012 the mechanism for the excellent silicate resistance of hfo ps cl is schematically illustrated in fig 7 in brief as iii oxidation by hfo ps cl produced massive h bringing about great enhancement of as v adsorption owing to the change of nps surface charge as well as dramatic suppression of silicate polymerization inside the solid adsorbents 3 4 potential for practical application the cyclic utilization of hfo ps cl and hfo ps n for as iii as v removal from the silicate containing waters are described in fig 5 a after adsorption the solid adsorbents were regenerated by 5 naoh solution followed by subsequent treatment with 2 naclo solution during 6 cyclic successive runs the decontamination efficiency of hfo ps cl asiii remained constant with residual as concentration always below 10 µg l i e the drinking water standards regulated by who us and chinese epa on the contrary the removal efficiencies for hfo ps cl asv and hfo ps n asiii declined gradually during the cyclic adsorption regeneration runs and the residual as concentration ascended up to 16 0 µg l and 57 4 µg l respectively in the 6th run the decline in adsorption efficiency is ascribed to the adverse effects caused by silicate given that the adsorption capability of hfo ps n and hfo ps cl could be fully refreshed by naoh solution under the silicate free systems zhang et al 2017 note that the decline in the removal efficiency of hfo ps cl asv further demonstrates the crucial role of the h generated during as iii oxidation in silicate resistant properties humic acid was used as the representative to detect the effects of natural organic matters noms on as iii removal as depicted in fig s7d the presence of humic acid 2 16 mg c l caused negligible implications on as iii removal efficiency possibly because the much larger size of nom molecules than as iii inhibited the diffusion of nom inside nanopores of the polymer host siripinyanond et al 2005 furthermore column adsorption experiments were conducted on the simulated and the real groundwater the synthetic solutions containing 200 µg l as iii or as v 5 mg si l silicate and 200 mg l so4 2 were pumped up to down through the hfo ps cl or hfo ps n samples packed in the columns as shown in fig 5b hfo ps cl column was able to generate 3200 bv clean water as 10 µg l from as iii contaminated water successively in comparison the clean water produced by the hfo ps cl column from as v contaminated solution and by hfo ps n column from as iii polluted solution were only 650 bv and 608 bv respectively after adsorption the exhausted hfo ps cl could be fully refreshed by treatment with naoh and naclo solutions for repeated use without any loss in decontamination efficiency as elucidated above also the real groundwater sampled from jinzhong city china was spiked with 200 µg l as iii and then was pumped up to down through the hfo ps cl n columns in comparison with the synthetic water the effective treatment amounts for hfo ps cl n columns both declined still the effective treatment amount for hfo ps cl column 1640 bv was much higher than hfo ps n column 260 bv further verifying the important role of as iii oxidation note that the presence of bicarbonate could maintain ph of the effluent at 8 0 fig 5c while the effluent ph from the synthetic water declined to 4 for hfo ps cl column at initial and was maintained at 6 later fig 5b 4 conclusions in this study we reported a new strategy i e the combination of oxidation and adsorption to enhance silicate resistance of nanocomposite adsorbents for water decontamination from as iii as a proof of concept a bifunctional nanocomposite hfo ps cl i e the redox polymer containing fe iii oxide nps was utilized to sequestrate as iii from silicate containing water we demonstrated that the h generated during as iii oxidation could enhance adsorption toward the generated as v and more importantly could inhibit silicate polymerization and thereby suppress the formation of polysilicate coatings on nps surface as a result hfo ps cl exhibited greatly enhanced as iii removal efficiency than the nanocomposite adsorbent hfo ps n in both batch and column adsorption moreover hfo ps cl was able to retain constant decontamination efficiency during the cyclic adsorption regeneration runs owing to the silicate resistant properties given that silicate is ubiquitous in waste waters and it exerts obviously adverse impacts on the removal of various contaminants like phosphorous fluorine nitrate and persistent organic pollutants pops this study may stimulate more efforts on the rational design of water purifiers with outstanding silicate resistant properties

17383,capsid integrity rt qpcr has recently been developed to discriminate between intact forms from inactivated forms of viruses but its applicability to identifying integrity of viruses in drinking water has remained limited in this study we investigated the application of capsid integrity rt qpcr using cis dichlorodiammineplatinum cddp with sodium deoxycholate sd pretreatment sd cddp rt qpcr to detect intact viruses in surface water and tap water a total of 63 water samples surface water n 20 tap water n 43 were collected in the kanto region in japan and quantified by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr for pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and seven other viruses pathogenic to humans aichivirus aiv noroviruses of genotypes i and ii enterovirus adenovirus type 40 and 41 and jc and bk polyomaviruses in surface water pmmov 100 was more frequently detected than other human pathogenic viruses 30 60 as determined by conventional rt qpcr sd cddp rt qpcr also revealed that intact pmmov 95 was more common than intact human pathogenic viruses 20 45 in the tap water samples most of the target viruses were not detected by conventional rt qpcr except for pmmov 9 and aiv 5 pmmov remained positive 5 whereas no aiv was detected when tested by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that some pmmov had an intact capsid whereas aiv had damaged capsids the presence of aiv in the absence of pmmov in tap water produced from groundwater may demonstrate the limitation of pmmov as a viral indicator in groundwater in addition to being abundant in surface water pmmov was detected in tap water including pmmov with intact capsids thus the absence of intact pmmov may be used to guarantee the viral safety of tap water produced from surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capsid integrity rt qpcr intact virus virus occurrence drinking water viral indicator 1 introduction human enteric viruses e g norovirus nov adenovirus adv and rotavirus rv are major causes of waterborne diseases recently they have been detected not only in source water including surface water and groundwater asami et al 2016 locas et al 2007 but also in treated drinking water and tap water across the world gibson et al 2011 haramoto et al 2004 kluge et al 2014 this is a great concern for public health since only a few virus particles are enough to cause infectious disease yezli and otter 2011 drinking water associated outbreaks caused by enteric viruses such as nov and rv have been reported worldwide craun et al 2006 kukkula et al 1999 thus monitoring the presence of human pathogenic viruses in drinking water is important to protect public health to monitor viruses in drinking water it is desirable to quantify infectious viruses by cost effective reliable and rapid tools although cell culture assays remain the gold standard for the detection of infectious viral particles these are expensive laborious and time consuming in addition the cell lines in use are not specific for most of the viruses therefore further confirmation e g molecular or immunological assays is needed for viral detection after cell culture assays hamza et al 2011a with the advantage of rapidity sensitivity and specificity molecular assays such as quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr and reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr are widely used for viral quantification in water however these molecular assays are not capable of detecting viral infectivity indeed the presence of enteric viruses in drinking water and tap water by rt qpcr has been reported however the infectivity let alone the structure intact or damaged capsids of the viruses was not discussed kluge et al 2014 yan et al 2012 recently a promising approach was developed to address the limitation of conventional molecular methods here water samples were pretreated with capsid integrity test reagents such as ethidium monoazide ema and propidium monoazide pma prior to rt qpcr capsid integrity rt qpcr leifels et al 2015 these reagents can block viral genomes from being detected by rt qpcr by entering the damaged capsid of inactivated viruses thus this capsid integrity rt qpcr can exclusively detect genomes of viruses with intact capsids however several studies found that the use of capsid integrity test reagents did not enable sufficient discrimination of infectious from inactivated viruses since this approach is based on capsid integrity as the criterion for the viral infectivity indeed viruses may undergo capsid alterations or genome damage thereby losing infectivity without allowing the penetration of capsid integrity test reagents leifels et al 2015 more recently a platinum compound namely cis dichlorodiammineplatinum cddp was used as an alternative capsid integrity test reagent for discrimination between viable and inactivated bacteria and viruses since it was more effective and less expensive than the monoazide reagents including ema and pma canh et al 2019b soejima et al 2016 besides pretreatment with sodium deoxycholate sd surfactant was also found to greatly enhance the performance of capsid integrity rt qpcr by promoting the penetration of capsid integrity test reagents into the capsid of damaged viruses canh et al 2019b although capsid integrity rt qpcr was successful in discriminating between intact and inactivated enteric viruses after various disinfection treatments particularly heat and chlorination under laboratory conditions canh et al 2019b leifels et al 2015 its application for investigating the presence of virus and capsid integrity in drinking water after disinfection remains limited prevost et al 2016 besides for quantifying viruses in drinking water it is necessary to concentrate large volumes of water samples environmental matrices e g humic acids commonly present in source water can be coconcentrated with target viruses during concentration of water samples and remain present in final concentrated samples environmental matrices were found to lower the effectiveness of capsid integrity testing canh et al 2018 including the efficiency of rt qpcr hata et al 2015 thus an effective procedure is needed to estimate the inhibitory effects of environmental matrices in drinking water samples on capsid integrity rt qpcr direct monitoring of pathogens in drinking water is impractical and expensive therefore indicators are often suggested to monitor the presence of pathogens symonds et al 2018 to date indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli and total coliforms are routinely monitored to ensure the microbial safety of drinking water however these indicator bacteria cannot be used as a proxy for the presence or absence of pathogenic viruses due to their different behavior and survival abilities in the environment and through treatment processes fong and lipp 2005 commonly found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater human specific enteric viruses such as adv enterovirus ev and aichivirus aiv have been proposed as indicators of human fecal pollution in water kitajima et al 2014 however their abundance in wastewater was observed to be not constant and may depend on the infection level in the local population symonds et al 2018 recently pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a plant virus belonging to the genus tobamovirus in the family virgaviridae was proposed as a viral indicator of fecal contamination in water due to its consistently higher abundance over human enteric viruses in feces domestic wastewater and environmental waters including drinking water sources around the world kitajima et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 pmmov was also suggested as a useful process indicator for investigating virus removal efficiency at full scale drinking water treatment plants dwtps asami et al 2016 canh et al 2019a kato et al 2018 pmmov was found to be more resistant than human pathogenic viruses against physical treatment processes e g coagulation sedimentation and filtration systems in dwtps asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 recently it was also found that pmmov was more resistant to disinfection treatments e g heat and chlorine treatments than enteric viruses adv and coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 shirasaki et al 2020 however the relationship between pmmov and human enteric viruses in treated drinking water after disinfection remains to be investigated it is important to investigate whether pmmov can be a viral indicator sufficiently verifying the viral safety of treated drinking water and the virus removal performance of water treatment facilities this study aimed to investigate the applicability of capsid integrity rt qpcr using cddp with sd pretreatment sd cddp rt qpcr for assessing virus presence and capsid integrity in surface water and tap water for this purpose surface water and tap water samples were collected in the kanto region japan and quantified by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr

of pmmov as an indicator to ensure the viral safety of drinking water was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection a total of 63 water samples 20 surface water and 43 tap water samples were collected every three months in the kanto region in japan from august 2018 to march 2019 fig 1 the surface water samples n 20 volume range 10 15 l mean volume 14 l were collected from four rivers and one lake the tap water samples n 43 volume range 150 500 l average volume 365 l were collected from 11 municipal facilities and parks which received drinking water from 11 different dwtps one tap water sample was not collected during the sampling period of 11 dwtps eight used surface water while the other three used groundwater as the source water the detailed treatment processes and capacity of these dwtps are shown in table s1 2 2 physicochemical water quality parameters and indicator bacteria physicochemical water quality parameters were measured immediately after collecting the samples water temperature and ph were measured using an hi 98129 water tester hanna tokyo japan turbidity was measured using a 2100q portable turbidimeter hach tokyo japan free and total chlorine concentrations were measured using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine colorimetric method in a dr890 colorimeter hach usa e coli and total coliforms were quantified using a filter unit 37 mm monitor unit 77 mm diameter 0 45 μm advantec tokyo japan and m coliblue24 broth hach within 6 h of sample collection 2 3 virus concentration method all water samples were concentrated using a negatively charged filter cartridge 0 5 µm pore size 0 09 m2 area opticap xl 2 merck millipore to a final volume of 1 ml based on the acid rinse alkaline elution method as described previously hata et al 2015 katayama et al 2002 the elution step was performed in the same direction as the filtration step the virus concentration method has been successfully applied to concentrate a wide range of enteric viruses in environmental water samples including surface water and tap water in japan asami et al 2016 canh et al 2019a haramoto et al 2013 2007 kato et al 2018 in addition the acid rinse alkaline elution method provided higher recovery yields of the virions compared to naked viral genomes therefore appropriate for selective detection of virions in water haramoto et al 2007 all tap water samples n 43 150 500l were concentrated on site the filer cartridges were kept at 4 c transported to the laboratory within 5 h and subjected to acid rinse and alkaline elution all surface water samples n 20 10 15 l were collected in 20 l sterilized containers and stored at 4 c for a maximum of 5 h before conducting the virus concentration in the laboratory the concentrated samples were divided into several aliquots and stored at 20 c until analysis each aliquot was frozen and thawed only once to prevent damage of the viral capsid the recovery efficiency of viruses by the acid rinse alkaline elution method was investigated for all the surface water and tap water samples using bacteriophage ms2 it is difficult to directly evaluate the efficiency in the large volumes of onsite tap water samples 150 500 l therefore a one hundredth volume of tap water samples was tested using a flat type of membrane katayama et al 2002 the recovery yields were mostly greater than 10 indicating that the virus concentration method employed functioned efficiently fig s1 2 4 pretreatment for capsid integrity testing cddp treatment combined with sd pretreatment was conducted according to a previous study canh et al 2019b briefly sd powder wako pure chemical industries tokyo japan was dissolved in milli q water to obtain a stock concentration of 10 w v cddp powder sigma aldrich tokyo japan was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to obtain a 100 mm concentration and stored at 20 c until use the sd stock solution was added to water samples to obtain a final concentration of 0 1 mixed well and incubated at 37 c for 30 min next the cddp stock solution was added into the sd pretreated samples to obtain a final concentration of 1 000 µm incubated at 37 c for 30 min and subjected to nucleic acid extraction the cddp concentration 1 000 µm was determined as the most effective concentration from our previous study since this concentration showed the high reduction of naked viral genomes without any significant impacts on viral infectivity canh et al 2019b 2 5 nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription viral rna was extracted from 140 µl of water using the qiaamp viral rna minikit qiagen tokyo japan whereas viral dna was extracted from 200 µl of water using qiaamp dna minikit qiagen according to the manufacturers instructions the extracted viral rna was subjected to reverse transcription rt to synthesize cdna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems tokyo japan dna and cdna were used for qpcr analysis 2 6 virus quantification by qpcr qpcr was conducted using the steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems tokyo japan for a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 5 µl of cdna 10 µl of taqman gene expression master mix applied biosystems 1 µl each of 10 µm forward primer and reverse primer 0 5 µl of 5 µm taqman probe and 2 5 µl of nuclease free water primer and probe sequences and thermal cycling conditions were described in previous studies on the detection of pmmov aiv ev nov gi and gii adv 40 41 and bk and jc pyv table s2 the number of viral genome copies was determined from a calibration curve using plasmid dna or oligo dna containing the target sequence for each amplification calibration curves were developed by 10 fold serial dilutions 104 10 copies well for each target virus the qpcr was performed in duplicate for each sample and considered positive only when the threshold cycle ct value for both duplicates was less than 40 as recommended by the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 when the ct value was more than 40 the concentration of virus in the water samples was reported as below the limit of quantification loq the qpcr quantification limit was one copy per reaction the loq was 51 4 77 1 viral copies l for the surface water samples 10 15 l and 1 5 5 1 viral copies l for the tap water samples 150 500 l 2 7 process control 2 7 1 effects of virus concentration processes on the viral capsid to evaluate whether the virus concentration processes themselves could damage viral capsids milli q water 300 ml spiked with different viruses including aiv nov ii and pmmov was tested by the virus concentration method used for the surface water and tap water samples described above but using a flat type of membrane for small volume samples katayama et al 2002 the concentrated samples were then subjected to rt qpcr with and without sd cddp treatment it was observed that the detection levels of all viruses tested were comparable between rt qpcr with and without the sd cddp treatment indicating that the virus concentration processes had no impact on the viral capsids fig s2 2 7 2 evaluation of efficiency of rna dna extraction and rna dna amplification the efficiency of rna extraction and rt qpcr for detection of rna viruses was investigated using cucumber green mottle mosaic virus cgmmv fig 2 a which was used as a molecular process control for the quantification of rna viruses canh et al 2019a kato et al 2018 briefly cgmmv stock 1 4 µl around 108 copies ml which was provided by japan s national institute of agrobiological sciences was spiked into the concentrated water samples and milli q water control the recovery of cgmmv ecgmmv was calculated by comparing the copy number between the concentrated samples and the control according to the equation ecgmmv c c0 100 where ecgmmv is the efficiency of both rna extraction and rt qpcr using the molecular control c0 is the cgmmv copy number obtained from the control and c is the cgmmv copy number obtained from the concentrated water sample the efficiency of the rna extraction and rt qpcr for the detection of target rna viruses in the concentrated water samples was considered sufficient when the ecgmmv value was 10 this threshold was used to validate the efficiency of rna extraction and rt qpcr asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 invalid samples ecgmmv 10 were subjected to dilution 10 fold and 100 fold and dax 8 treatment fig 2 a the dax 8 treatment was described in detail in a previous study asami et al 2016 hata et al 2020 similarly adv type 5 adv5 2 0 µl around 108 copies ml provided by the kobe institute of health kobe japan was also used as molecular control to investigate the efficiency of both dna extraction and qpcr fig 2 a again the efficiency of dna extraction and qpcr for the detection of target dna viruses in the concentrated water samples was considered valid when the recovery of adv5 eadv5 value was 10 the concentration of target rna or dna viruses determined by conventional rt qpcr was used for analysis when ecgmmv or eadv5 value was 10 2 7 3 effectiveness of sd cddp treatment the effectiveness of sd cddp treatment in terms of eliminating naked rna dna viral genomes present in water samples was evaluated using naked genomes of murine norovirus mnv and naked genomes of phix174 phage phix174 fig 2 b briefly naked mnv genomes 1 4 µl around 107 copies ml or naked phix174 genomes 2 0 µl around 108 copies ml were spiked into concentrated water samples e 10 no inhibition in the rt qpcr detection processes and subsequently subjected to sd cddp rt qpcr the sd cddp treatment was considered effective when the reduction of naked mnv phix174 genomes obtained from the target samples was comparable to the reduction obtained from the control milli q water the concentration of target rna or dna viruses determined by sd cddp rt qpcr was used for analysis when the sd cddp treatment was effective and no inhibition rna dna extraction and rt qpcr was observed ecgmmv or eadv5 value 10 the naked genomes of mnv and phix174 viruses were obtained from purified virus stocks after rna or dna extraction as described in section 2 5 the naked genomes were kept at 80 c until use 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical parameters and indicator bacteria data on physicochemical parameters and indicator bacteria for the surface water and tap water samples are summarized in table 1 for the surface water samples the levels of ph 7 6 0 5 e coli 2 2 0 8 log10 cfu 100 ml and total coliforms 3 6 0 9 log10 cfu 100 ml were relatively constant throughout the sampling period whereas wider fluctuations were observed for water temperature 18 3 7 4 c and turbidity 13 5 10 7 ntu for the tap water samples no e coli or other coliforms were detected other parameters such as ph 7 5 0 3 turbidity 0 1 0 1 ntu free chlorine 0 3 0 2 mg l and total chlorine residual 0 4 0 2 mg l were all relatively stable except for a wide range in water temperature 18 8 5 9 c 3 2 validation of efficiency using molecular controls 3 2 1 nucleic extraction and rt qpcr qpcr processes the efficacy of the detection processes including nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr amplification was evaluated for all the surface water and tap water samples samples exhibiting inhibition e 10 were subjected to dilution 10 fold and 100 fold and dax treatment to achieve efficiency comparable to that of the molecular control e 10 as a result valid values were obtained for all the samples e 10 tables s3 and s4 3 2 2 sd cddp treatment naked mnv and naked phix174 genomes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of sd cddp treatment in terms of eliminating rna or dna viral genomes present in the water samples respectively the sd cddp treatment was able to remove all 6 4 log10 copies ml of naked mnv genomes or 7 5 log10 copies ml of naked phix174 genomes spiked into all the concentrated surface and tap water samples hence comparable to the removal of these viral genomes in the control fig s3 this indicates that the sd cddp treatment was effective in terms of removing naked viral genomes rna and dna present in the concentrated surface and tap water samples besides the impacts of possible cddp residual after the sd cddp treatment and nucleic extraction on naked viral genomes were investigated using naked genomes of poliovirus 1 pv 1 however no negative impacts were observed since the detection levels of naked pv 1 genomes 107 copies ml spiked in the rna extracted samples with the cddp pretreatment was comparable to those without the cddp pretreatment fig s4 3 3 viruses and capsid integrity observed in surface water samples the presence of pmmov and other viruses pathogenic to humans aiv ev nov i nov ii adv40 41 jc pyv and bk pyv in the surface water samples n 20 was determined by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr table 2 fig 3 pmmov detection rate 100 concentration 3 0 7 4 log10 copies l was detected more frequently and at higher concentrations than the human pathogenic viruses 30 65 1 8 6 1 log10 copies l in surface water as determined by conventional rt qpcr this finding is in agreement with previous studies indicating a higher prevalence of pmmov than that of enteric viruses in surface water bodies around the world haramoto et al 2013 kitajima et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 however capsid integrity for pmmov and enteric viruses was not investigated in these previous studies in this study the application of sd cddp rt qpcr enabled the detection of viruses with intact capsids only we observed that intact pmmov 95 3 1 6 2 log10 copies l was also more prevalent in surface water samples than intact human pathogenic viruses 20 45 1 8 6 1 log10 copies l table 2 among human pathogenic viruses tested by conventional rt qpcr aiv 65 and adv40 41 65 were relatively more prevalent than ev nov i nov ii jc pyv and bk pyv 30 45 in surface water table 2 a relatively high prevalence of aiv and adv40 41 in river source water was also reported in previous studies haramoto et al 2012 yan et al 2012 however the prevalence of enteric viruses in rivers has varied among studies due to the difference in sample size geographic location and the level of virus infections in the local population pang et al 2019 besides human pathogenic viruses 20 45 with intact capsids were found relatively often in surface water samples as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr table 2 indicating that human pathogenic viruses can remain infective in surface water in a previous study most enteric viruses in surface water were also found to have intact capsids as they were both detected by conventional rt qpcr and ema rt qpcr prevost et al 2016 however when comparing the difference in the detection rates between conventional rt qpcr and capsid integrity rt qpcr for human pathogenic viruses e g aiv adv ev nov i and ii the difference was only 5 10 in the previous study prevost et al 2016 while they range between 10 and 45 in this study table 2 this inconsistent result may be explained as follows first it is possible that the human pathogenic viruses present in surface water sources rivers and lake in this study might have had more damaged capsids than those present in rivers in the previous study since many wastewater treatment plants in japan employ chlorination after secondary treatment second there was a difference in the use of capsid integrity test reagents between this study which used cddp reagent with sd pretreatment and the previous study which used ema reagent in our previous bench scale study the cddp reagent particularly with sd pretreatment was found to be more effective in terms of excluding inactivated viruses than ema or pma reagents canh et al 2019b therefore the sd cddp rt qpcr in this study may be more efficient than ema rt qpcr in the previous study for testing viral capsid integrity in environmental water samples besides the detection levels of targeted viruses determined by conventional rt qpcr were 0 2 2 0 log10 greater than those determined by sd cddp rt qpcr table 2 indicating that the viral genomes were generally more abundant than the intact viruses possibly infective viruses in surface water this agrees with previous studies which had reported the higher abundance of virus genomes than infectious viruses ev and rotavirus in surface water rutjes et al 2009 2005 thus sd cddp rt qpcr can be used to assess the potential risk of viral infection in surface waters more accurately than conventional rt qpcr 3 4 viral occurrence and capsid integrity in tap water samples forty three tap water samples were analyzed by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr for the presence of pmmov and other human pathogenic viruses aiv ev nov i nov ii adv40 41 jc pyv and bk pyv table 3 of all the target viruses only pmmov detection rate 9 concentration 2 20 2 90 log10 copies l and aiv 5 0 62 1 18 log10 copies l were detected in tap water by conventional rt qpcr pmmov 5 1 86 2 18 log10 copies l remained positive when analyzed by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that pmmov in tap water had intact and possibly infective capsids meanwhile no aiv with intact capsid was detected by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that aiv is non infectious in tap water the presence of enteric viruses in treated drinking water and tap water has been reported across the world particularly adv 100 rotavirus rv 100 and ev 17 in china yan et al 2012 ev 27 adv 23 and rv genogroup a 16 in brazil kluge et al 2014 nov i 4 and nov ii 7 in japan haramoto et al 2004 and hepatitis e in sweden wang et al 2020 however these previous studies used conventional rt qpcr which is not capable of assessing viral infectivity or identify whether the viruses are intact or not our finding suggests that sd cddp rt qpcr can provide more accurate information on viral occurrence and capsid integrity in treated drinking water than the conventional rt qpcr commonly used in previous studies viruses particularly pmmov and aiv were found in tap water treated by different treatment plants including plants 2 and 4 coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration chlorination cl2 plants 6 and 7 cl2 alone and plant 8 slow sand filtration cl2 fig 4 this suggests that these treatment plants were not able to remove all the viruses from the source water in general free chlorine can effectively inactivate viruses however intact pmmov virus was still detected in tap water particularly in water treated by plants 2 and 4 fig 4 this may suggest that the chlorine treatment in these plants was inefficient or affected by quality of drinking water indeed in the tap water positive for intact pmmov relatively high free chlorine residuals 0 41 and 0 48 mg l for plant 2 and plant 4 respectively were observed but in relatively low water temperatures 11 4 c and 13 1 c respectively table s5 low water temperatures were found to greatly reduce the efficiency of chlorine treatment sobsey et al 1988 thus it is possible that low water temperatures affected the chlorination treatment and contributed to the presence of viruses in tap water the efficiency of disinfection with free chlorine might be also be affected by the contact time and organic matter concentration in tap water however such data were not available for analysis in this study only pmmov was detected and found to have intact capsids which might also suggest that pmmov was generally more resistant against chlorine treatment than human pathogenic viruses particularly at plants 2 and 4 in a previous sd cddp rt qpcr experiment performed using phosphate buffered saline pbs under laboratory conditions we confirmed that pmmov was more resistant to free chlorine than coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 data not shown which was generally more resistant against chlorine treatments than other enteric viruses meister et al 2018 rachmadi et al 2020 besides pmmov was also detected at higher concentrations than the human pathogenic viruses in surface water thus it is possible that the presence of pmmov in tap water in the absence of the human pathogenic viruses might also result from the higher abundance of pmmov in surface water compared to the human pathogenic viruses the overall reductions of target viruses by dwtps were calculated table s6 however it was difficult to compare the reduction of pmmov with that of the human pathogenic viruses since most of the viruses were under the detection limit in tap water we observed cases where none of the tap water samples positive for aiv were positive for pmmov this unique observation was only obtained in the tap water samples provided by treatment plants 6 and 7 both of which used groundwater fig 4 it appears that pmmov did not coexist with aiv in tap water produced from groundwater the occurrence of viruses in groundwater before treatment was not investigated therefore the reason for the absence of pmmov in the presence of aiv in tap water is not clear it is possible that pmmov was not present or less abundant than aiv in groundwater in addition aiv might not be removed effectively in these treatment plants as only chlorination was applied and free chlorine residuals were observed at relatively low levels 0 07 and 0 2 mg l table s5 3 5 the potential of using pmmov as a viral indicator for risk management in surface water and drinking water pmmov was clearly found to be more abundant than the human pathogenic viruses aiv ev nov i nov ii adv40 41 jc pyv and bk pyv in surface water table 2 fig 3 the presence of pmmov was positively correlated to the presence of most of the human pathogenic viruses except for bk pyv rbk pyv 0 25 as determined by conventional qpcr and ev rev 0 73 as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr fig 3 this might suggest that the source of pmmov was probably similar to that of the human pathogenic viruses however there was a relatively high number of the surface water samples 35 65 and 47 76 when determined by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr respectively in which pmmov was detected while at least one of the human pathogenic viruses was not found the presence of pmmov was also observed in several surface water samples in which all the human pathogenic viruses were absent this may in part be due to pmmov being remarkably stable in water environments kuroda et al 2015 this suggests that the relevance of using pmmov as an indicator to accurately estimate the presence of pathogenic viruses in surface water may be limited this agrees with previous studies indicating that pmmov was not suitable for detecting fresh fecal pollution owing to its high stability in water bodies inoue et al 2020 kuroda et al 2015 however in this study pmmov was found to consistently coexist with human pathogenic viruses at a pmmov concentration higher than 4 9 log10 copies l as determined by conventional rt qpcr fig 3 a this might suggest that this pmmov concentration threshold can be used to indicate the presence of human pathogenic viruses in surface water in addition the cooccurrence of intact pmmov and intact human pathogenic viruses was observed at a pmmov concentration higher than 3 2 log10 copies l as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr fig 3 b suggesting that this threshold of intact pmmov concentration can be used to indicate the presence of intact human pathogenic viruses potentially infective viruses or assess the potential risk of viral infection in surface waters besides in comparison to chemical markers and bacterial indicators to indicate human fecal contaminations the use of pmmov has more advantages since it behaves more similarly to enteric viruses kitajima et al 2018 in tap water produced from groundwater the presence of pmmov was quite different from that of human pathogenic viruses particularly aiv which suggests that pmmov may not be a suitable indicator of human pathogenic viruses in tap water produced from groundwater fig 4 however compared with tap water produced from surface water pmmov was found relatively frequently in tap water in the absence of any human pathogenic viruses tested for fig 4 pmmov with intact capsids was also detected in tap water in addition to being more abundant in surface water pmmov was probably more resistant to drinking water treatment processes than human pathogenic viruses in previous studies pmmov was found to be removed to a lesser extent than enteric viruses when investigated in different drinking water treatment processes e g coagulation rapid sand filtration microfiltration and ultrafiltration at an all bench scale pilot scale and full scale plant monitoring although only conventional rt qpcr was used for quantifying viruses asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 recently pmmov was also found high resistance to chlorine treatment compared to enteric viruses adv and cv b5 shirasaki et al 2020 thus the absence of intact pmmov in tap water may be a useful criterion to ensure the efficiency of virus removal in dwtps or the absence of human pathogenic viruses in tap water produced from surface water however the presence of pmmov in tap water might not always correlate to the presence of human pathogenic viruses since pmmov can be sometimes detected in animal feces such as chicken cows goose and seagull hamza et al 2011b rosario et al 2009 therefore when pmmov is found in tap water especially in areas where these animals are prevalent other human enteric viruses should be investigated to accurately assess the risk of viral infection through tap water 4 conclusion in surface water pmmov was more frequently detected at higher concentrations than the human pathogenic viruses as measured by conventional rt qpcr intact pmmov was also more prevalent than intact human pathogenic viruses as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr in tap water samples only pmmov and aiv were detected among the target viruses pmmov was positive by conventional rt qpcr in 9 of the samples and remained positive by sd cddp rt qpcr in 5 of the samples indicating that pmmov possessed intact capsids in tap water aiv was positive by conventional rt qpcr 5 of the samples but negative by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that aiv had damaged capsids in tap water the presence of aiv in the absence of pmmov in tap water produced from groundwater may suggest the limitation of pmmov as a viral indicator in groundwater in tap water produced from surface waters only pmmov was detected and found to have intact capsids this could be due to the higher abundance of pmmov in surface water and the greater resistance of pmmov against drinking treatment processes compared to the human pathogenic viruses thus the absence of intact pmmov may be used as a possible criterion to ensure the absence of human pathogenic viruses in tap water produced from

17383,capsid integrity rt qpcr has recently been developed to discriminate between intact forms from inactivated forms of viruses but its applicability to identifying integrity of viruses in drinking water has remained limited in this study we investigated the application of capsid integrity rt qpcr using cis dichlorodiammineplatinum cddp with sodium deoxycholate sd pretreatment sd cddp rt qpcr to detect intact viruses in surface water and tap water a total of 63 water samples surface water n 20 tap water n 43 were collected in the kanto region in japan and quantified by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr for pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and seven other viruses pathogenic to humans aichivirus aiv noroviruses of genotypes i and ii enterovirus adenovirus type 40 and 41 and jc and bk polyomaviruses in surface water pmmov 100 was more frequently detected than other human pathogenic viruses 30 60 as determined by conventional rt qpcr sd cddp rt qpcr also revealed that intact pmmov 95 was more common than intact human pathogenic viruses 20 45 in the tap water samples most of the target viruses were not detected by conventional rt qpcr except for pmmov 9 and aiv 5 pmmov remained positive 5 whereas no aiv was detected when tested by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that some pmmov had an intact capsid whereas aiv had damaged capsids the presence of aiv in the absence of pmmov in tap water produced from groundwater may demonstrate the limitation of pmmov as a viral indicator in groundwater in addition to being abundant in surface water pmmov was detected in tap water including pmmov with intact capsids thus the absence of intact pmmov may be used to guarantee the viral safety of tap water produced from surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capsid integrity rt qpcr intact virus virus occurrence drinking water viral indicator 1 introduction human enteric viruses e g norovirus nov adenovirus adv and rotavirus rv are major causes of waterborne diseases recently they have been detected not only in source water including surface water and groundwater asami et al 2016 locas et al 2007 but also in treated drinking water and tap water across the world gibson et al 2011 haramoto et al 2004 kluge et al 2014 this is a great concern for public health since only a few virus particles are enough to cause infectious disease yezli and otter 2011 drinking water associated outbreaks caused by enteric viruses such as nov and rv have been reported worldwide craun et al 2006 kukkula et al 1999 thus monitoring the presence of human pathogenic viruses in drinking water is important to protect public health to monitor viruses in drinking water it is desirable to quantify infectious viruses by cost effective reliable and rapid tools although cell culture assays remain the gold standard for the detection of infectious viral particles these are expensive laborious and time consuming in addition the cell lines in use are not specific for most of the viruses therefore further confirmation e g molecular or immunological assays is needed for viral detection after cell culture assays hamza et al 2011a with the advantage of rapidity sensitivity and specificity molecular assays such as quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr and reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr are widely used for viral quantification in water however these molecular assays are not capable of detecting viral infectivity indeed the presence of enteric viruses in drinking water and tap water by rt qpcr has been reported however the infectivity let alone the structure intact or damaged capsids of the viruses was not discussed kluge et al 2014 yan et al 2012 recently a promising approach was developed to address the limitation of conventional molecular methods here water samples were pretreated with capsid integrity test reagents such as ethidium monoazide ema and propidium monoazide pma prior to rt qpcr capsid integrity rt qpcr leifels et al 2015 these reagents can block viral genomes from being detected by rt qpcr by entering the damaged capsid of inactivated viruses thus this capsid integrity rt qpcr can exclusively detect genomes of viruses with intact capsids however several studies found that the use of capsid integrity test reagents did not enable sufficient discrimination of infectious from inactivated viruses since this approach is based on capsid integrity as the criterion for the viral infectivity indeed viruses may undergo capsid alterations or genome damage thereby losing infectivity without allowing the penetration of capsid integrity test reagents leifels et al 2015 more recently a platinum compound namely cis dichlorodiammineplatinum cddp was used as an alternative capsid integrity test reagent for discrimination between viable and inactivated bacteria and viruses since it was more effective and less expensive than the monoazide reagents including ema and pma canh et al 2019b soejima et al 2016 besides pretreatment with sodium deoxycholate sd surfactant was also found to greatly enhance the performance of capsid integrity rt qpcr by promoting the penetration of capsid integrity test reagents into the capsid of damaged viruses canh et al 2019b although capsid integrity rt qpcr was successful in discriminating between intact and inactivated enteric viruses after various disinfection treatments particularly heat and chlorination under laboratory conditions canh et al 2019b leifels et al 2015 its application for investigating the presence of virus and capsid integrity in drinking water after disinfection remains limited prevost et al 2016 besides for quantifying viruses in drinking water it is necessary to concentrate large volumes of water samples environmental matrices e g humic acids commonly present in source water can be coconcentrated with target viruses during concentration of water samples and remain present in final concentrated samples environmental matrices were found to lower the effectiveness of capsid integrity testing canh et al 2018 including the efficiency of rt qpcr hata et al 2015 thus an effective procedure is needed to estimate the inhibitory effects of environmental matrices in drinking water samples on capsid integrity rt qpcr direct monitoring of pathogens in drinking water is impractical and expensive therefore indicators are often suggested to monitor the presence of pathogens symonds et al 2018 to date indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli and total coliforms are routinely monitored to ensure the microbial safety of drinking water however these indicator bacteria cannot be used as a proxy for the presence or absence of pathogenic viruses due to their different behavior and survival abilities in the environment and through treatment processes fong and lipp 2005 commonly found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater human specific enteric viruses such as adv enterovirus ev and aichivirus aiv have been proposed as indicators of human fecal pollution in water kitajima et al 2014 however their abundance in wastewater was observed to be not constant and may depend on the infection level in the local population symonds et al 2018 recently pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a plant virus belonging to the genus tobamovirus in the family virgaviridae was proposed as a viral indicator of fecal contamination in water due to its consistently higher abundance over human enteric viruses in feces domestic wastewater and environmental waters including drinking water sources around the world kitajima et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 pmmov was also suggested as a useful process indicator for investigating virus removal efficiency at full scale drinking water treatment plants dwtps asami et al 2016 canh et al 2019a kato et al 2018 pmmov was found to be more resistant than human pathogenic viruses against physical treatment processes e g coagulation sedimentation and filtration systems in dwtps asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 recently it was also found that pmmov was more resistant to disinfection treatments e g heat and chlorine treatments than enteric viruses adv and coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 shirasaki et al 2020 however the relationship between pmmov and human enteric viruses in treated drinking water after disinfection remains to be investigated it is important to investigate whether pmmov can be a viral indicator sufficiently verifying the viral safety of treated drinking water and the virus removal performance of water treatment facilities this study aimed to investigate the applicability of capsid integrity rt qpcr using cddp with sd pretreatment sd cddp rt qpcr for assessing virus presence and capsid integrity in surface water and tap water for this purpose surface water and tap water samples were collected in the kanto region japan and quantified by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr for the presence of pmmov aichi aiv enterovirus ev norovirus genogroups gi and gii nov gi and gii adenovirus type 40 and 41 adv 40 41 bk and jc polyomavirus bk and jc pyv in addition the suitability of pmmov as an indicator to ensure the viral safety of drinking water was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection a total of 63 water samples 20 surface water and 43 tap water samples were collected every three months in the kanto region in japan from august 2018 to march 2019 fig 1 the surface water samples n 20 volume range 10 15 l mean volume 14 l were collected from four rivers and one lake the tap water samples n 43 volume range 150 500 l average volume 365 l were collected from 11 municipal facilities and parks which received drinking water from 11 different dwtps one tap water sample was not collected during the sampling period of 11 dwtps eight used surface water while the other three used groundwater as the source water the detailed treatment processes and capacity of these dwtps are shown in table s1 2 2 physicochemical water quality parameters and indicator bacteria physicochemical water quality parameters were measured immediately after collecting the samples water temperature and ph were measured using an hi 98129 water tester hanna tokyo japan turbidity was measured using a 2100q portable turbidimeter hach tokyo japan free and

al 2015 katayama et al 2002 the elution step was performed in the same direction as the filtration step the virus concentration method has been successfully applied to concentrate a wide range of enteric viruses in environmental water samples including surface water and tap water in japan asami et al 2016 canh et al 2019a haramoto et al 2013 2007 kato et al 2018 in addition the acid rinse alkaline elution method provided higher recovery yields of the virions compared to naked viral genomes therefore appropriate for selective detection of virions in water haramoto et al 2007 all tap water samples n 43 150 500l were concentrated on site the filer cartridges were kept at 4 c transported to the laboratory within 5 h and subjected to acid rinse and alkaline elution all surface water samples n 20 10 15 l were collected in 20 l sterilized containers and stored at 4 c for a maximum of 5 h before conducting the virus concentration in the laboratory the concentrated samples were divided into several aliquots and stored at 20 c until analysis each aliquot was frozen and thawed only once to prevent damage of the viral capsid the recovery efficiency of viruses by the acid rinse alkaline elution method was investigated for all the surface water and tap water samples using bacteriophage ms2 it is difficult to directly evaluate the efficiency in the large volumes of onsite tap water samples 150 500 l therefore a one hundredth volume of tap water samples was tested using a flat type of membrane katayama et al 2002 the recovery yields were mostly greater than 10 indicating that the virus concentration method employed functioned efficiently fig s1 2 4 pretreatment for capsid integrity testing cddp treatment combined with sd pretreatment was conducted according to a previous study canh et al 2019b briefly sd powder wako pure chemical industries tokyo japan was dissolved in milli q water to obtain a stock concentration of 10 w v cddp powder sigma aldrich tokyo japan was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to obtain a 100 mm concentration and stored at 20 c until use the sd stock solution was added to water samples to obtain a final concentration of 0 1 mixed well and incubated at 37 c for 30 min next the cddp stock solution was added into the sd pretreated samples to obtain a final concentration of 1 000 µm incubated at 37 c for 30 min and subjected to nucleic acid extraction the cddp concentration 1 000 µm was determined as the most effective concentration from our previous study since this concentration showed the high reduction of naked viral genomes without any significant impacts on viral infectivity canh et al 2019b 2 5 nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription viral rna was extracted from 140 µl of water using the qiaamp viral rna minikit qiagen tokyo japan whereas viral dna was extracted from 200 µl of water using qiaamp dna minikit qiagen according to the manufacturers instructions the extracted viral rna was subjected to reverse transcription rt to synthesize cdna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems tokyo japan dna and cdna were used for qpcr analysis 2 6 virus quantification by qpcr qpcr was conducted using the steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems tokyo japan for a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 5 µl of cdna 10 µl of taqman gene expression master mix applied biosystems 1 µl each of 10 µm forward primer and reverse primer 0 5 µl of 5 µm taqman probe and 2 5 µl of nuclease free water primer and probe sequences and thermal cycling conditions were described in previous studies on the detection of pmmov aiv ev nov gi and gii adv 40 41 and bk and jc pyv table s2 the number of viral genome copies was determined from a calibration curve using plasmid dna or oligo dna containing the target sequence for each amplification calibration curves were developed by 10 fold serial dilutions 104 10 copies well for each target virus the qpcr was performed in duplicate for each sample and considered positive only when the threshold cycle ct value for both duplicates was less than 40 as recommended by the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 when the ct value was more than 40 the concentration of virus in the water samples was reported as below the limit of quantification loq the qpcr quantification limit was one copy per reaction the loq was 51 4 77 1 viral copies l for the surface water samples 10 15 l and 1 5 5 1 viral copies l for the tap water samples 150 500 l 2 7 process control 2 7 1 effects of virus concentration processes on the viral capsid to evaluate whether the virus concentration processes themselves could damage viral capsids milli q water 300 ml spiked with different viruses including aiv nov ii and pmmov was tested by the virus concentration method used for the surface water and tap water samples described above but using a flat type of membrane for small volume samples katayama et al 2002 the concentrated samples were then subjected to rt qpcr with and without sd cddp treatment it was observed that the detection levels of all viruses tested were comparable between rt qpcr with and without the sd cddp treatment indicating that the virus concentration processes had no impact on the viral capsids fig s2 2 7 2 evaluation of efficiency of rna dna extraction and rna dna amplification the efficiency of rna extraction and rt qpcr for detection of rna viruses was investigated using cucumber green mottle mosaic virus cgmmv fig 2 a which was used as a molecular process control for the quantification of rna viruses canh et al 2019a kato et al 2018 briefly cgmmv stock 1 4 µl around 108 copies ml which was provided by japan s national institute of agrobiological sciences was spiked into the concentrated water samples and milli q water control the recovery of cgmmv ecgmmv was calculated by comparing the copy number between the concentrated samples and the control according to the equation ecgmmv c c0 100 where ecgmmv is the efficiency of both rna extraction and rt qpcr using the molecular control c0 is the cgmmv copy number obtained from the control and c is the cgmmv copy number obtained from the concentrated water sample the efficiency of the rna extraction and rt qpcr for the detection of target rna viruses in the concentrated water samples was considered sufficient when the ecgmmv value was 10 this threshold was used to validate the efficiency of rna extraction and rt qpcr asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 invalid samples ecgmmv 10 were subjected to dilution 10 fold and 100 fold and dax 8 treatment fig 2 a the dax 8 treatment was described in detail in a previous study asami et al 2016 hata et al 2020 similarly adv type 5 adv5 2 0 µl around 108 copies ml provided by the kobe institute of health kobe japan was also used as molecular control to investigate the efficiency of both dna extraction and qpcr fig 2 a again the efficiency of dna extraction and qpcr for the detection of target dna viruses in the concentrated water samples was considered valid when the recovery of adv5 eadv5 value was 10 the concentration of target rna or dna viruses determined by conventional rt qpcr was used for analysis when ecgmmv or eadv5 value was 10 2 7 3 effectiveness of sd cddp treatment the effectiveness of sd cddp treatment in terms of eliminating naked rna dna viral genomes present in water samples was evaluated using naked genomes of murine norovirus mnv and naked genomes of phix174 phage phix174 fig 2 b briefly naked mnv genomes 1 4 µl around 107 copies ml or naked phix174 genomes 2 0 µl around 108 copies ml were spiked into concentrated water samples e 10 no inhibition in the rt qpcr detection processes and subsequently subjected to sd cddp rt qpcr the sd cddp treatment was considered effective when the reduction of naked mnv phix174 genomes obtained from the target samples was comparable to the reduction obtained from the control milli q water the concentration of target rna or dna viruses determined by sd cddp rt qpcr was used for analysis when the sd cddp treatment was effective and no inhibition rna dna extraction and rt qpcr was observed ecgmmv or eadv5 value 10 the naked genomes of mnv and phix174 viruses were obtained from purified virus stocks after rna or dna extraction as described in section 2 5 the naked genomes were kept at 80 c until use 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical parameters and indicator bacteria data on physicochemical parameters and indicator bacteria for the surface water and tap water samples are summarized in table 1 for the surface water samples the levels of ph 7 6 0 5 e coli 2 2 0 8 log10 cfu 100 ml and total coliforms 3 6 0 9 log10 cfu 100 ml were relatively constant throughout the sampling period whereas wider fluctuations were observed for water temperature 18 3 7 4 c and turbidity 13 5 10 7 ntu for the tap water samples no e coli or other coliforms were detected other parameters such as ph 7 5 0 3 turbidity 0 1 0 1 ntu free chlorine 0 3 0 2 mg l and total chlorine residual 0 4 0 2 mg l were all relatively stable except for a wide range in water temperature 18 8 5 9 c 3 2 validation of efficiency using molecular controls 3 2 1 nucleic extraction and rt qpcr qpcr processes the efficacy of the detection processes including nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr amplification was evaluated for all the surface water and tap water samples samples exhibiting inhibition e 10 were subjected to dilution 10 fold and 100 fold and dax treatment to achieve efficiency comparable to that of the molecular control e 10 as a result valid values were obtained for all the samples e 10 tables s3 and s4 3 2 2 sd cddp treatment naked mnv and naked phix174 genomes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of sd cddp treatment in terms of eliminating rna or dna viral genomes present in the water samples respectively the sd cddp treatment was able to remove all 6 4 log10 copies ml of naked mnv genomes or 7 5 log10 copies ml of naked phix174 genomes spiked into all the concentrated surface and tap water samples hence comparable to the removal of these viral genomes in the control fig s3 this indicates that the sd cddp treatment was effective in terms of removing naked viral genomes rna and dna present in the concentrated surface and tap water samples besides the impacts of possible cddp residual after the sd cddp treatment and nucleic extraction on naked viral genomes were investigated using naked genomes of poliovirus 1 pv 1 however no negative impacts were observed since the detection levels of naked pv 1 genomes 107 copies ml spiked in the rna extracted samples with the cddp pretreatment was comparable to those without the cddp pretreatment fig s4 3 3 viruses and capsid integrity observed in surface water samples the presence of pmmov and other viruses pathogenic to humans aiv ev nov i nov ii adv40 41 jc pyv and bk pyv in the surface water samples n 20 was determined by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr table 2 fig 3 pmmov detection rate 100 concentration 3 0 7 4 log10 copies l was detected more frequently and at higher concentrations than the human pathogenic viruses 30 65 1 8 6 1 log10 copies l in surface water as determined by conventional rt qpcr this finding is in agreement with previous studies indicating a higher prevalence of pmmov than that of enteric viruses in surface water bodies around the world haramoto et al 2013 kitajima et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 however capsid integrity for pmmov and enteric viruses was not investigated in these previous studies in this study the application of sd cddp rt qpcr enabled the detection of viruses with intact capsids only we observed that intact pmmov 95 3 1 6 2 log10 copies l was also more prevalent in surface water samples than intact human pathogenic viruses 20 45 1 8 6 1 log10 copies l table 2 among human pathogenic viruses tested by conventional rt qpcr aiv 65 and adv40 41 65 were relatively more prevalent than ev nov i nov ii jc pyv and bk pyv 30 45 in surface water table 2 a relatively high prevalence of aiv and adv40 41 in river source water was also reported in previous studies haramoto et al 2012 yan et al 2012 however the prevalence of enteric viruses in rivers has varied among studies due to the difference in sample size geographic location and the level of virus infections in the local population pang et al 2019 besides human pathogenic viruses 20 45 with intact capsids were found relatively often in surface water samples as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr table 2 indicating that human pathogenic viruses can remain infective in surface water in a previous study most enteric viruses in surface water were also found to have intact capsids as they were both detected by conventional rt qpcr and ema rt qpcr prevost et al 2016 however when comparing the difference in the detection rates between conventional rt qpcr and capsid integrity rt qpcr for human pathogenic viruses e g aiv adv ev nov i and ii the difference was only 5 10 in the previous study prevost et al 2016 while they range between 10 and 45 in this study table 2 this inconsistent result may be explained as follows first it is possible that the human pathogenic viruses present in surface water sources rivers and lake in this study might have had more damaged capsids than those present in rivers in the previous study since many wastewater treatment plants in japan employ chlorination after secondary treatment second there was a difference in the use of capsid integrity test reagents between this study which used cddp reagent with sd pretreatment and the previous study which used ema reagent in our previous bench scale study the cddp reagent particularly with sd pretreatment was found to be more effective in terms of excluding inactivated viruses than ema or pma reagents canh et al 2019b therefore the sd cddp rt qpcr in this study may be more efficient than ema rt qpcr in the previous study for testing viral capsid integrity in environmental water samples besides the detection levels of targeted viruses determined by conventional rt qpcr were 0 2 2 0 log10 greater than those determined by sd cddp rt qpcr table 2 indicating that the viral genomes were generally more abundant than the intact viruses possibly infective viruses in surface water this agrees with previous studies which had reported the higher abundance of virus genomes than infectious viruses ev and rotavirus in surface water rutjes et al 2009 2005 thus sd cddp rt qpcr can be used to assess the potential risk of viral infection in surface waters more accurately than conventional rt qpcr 3 4 viral occurrence and capsid integrity in tap water samples forty three tap water samples were analyzed by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr for the presence of pmmov and other human pathogenic viruses aiv ev nov i nov ii adv40 41 jc pyv and bk pyv table 3 of all the target viruses only pmmov detection rate 9 concentration 2 20 2 90 log10 copies l and aiv 5 0 62 1 18 log10 copies l were detected in tap water by conventional rt qpcr pmmov 5 1 86 2 18 log10 copies l remained positive when analyzed by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that pmmov in tap water had intact and possibly infective capsids meanwhile no aiv with intact capsid was detected by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that aiv is non infectious in tap water the presence of enteric viruses in treated drinking water and tap water has been reported across the world particularly adv 100 rotavirus rv 100 and ev 17 in china yan et al 2012 ev 27 adv 23 and rv genogroup a 16 in brazil kluge et al 2014 nov i 4 and nov ii 7 in japan haramoto et al 2004 and hepatitis e in sweden wang et al 2020 however these previous studies used conventional rt qpcr which is not capable of assessing viral infectivity or identify whether the viruses are intact or not our finding suggests that sd cddp rt qpcr can provide more accurate information on viral occurrence and capsid integrity in treated drinking water than the conventional rt qpcr commonly used in previous studies viruses particularly pmmov and aiv were found in tap water treated by different treatment plants including plants 2 and 4 coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration chlorination cl2 plants 6 and 7 cl2 alone and plant 8 slow sand filtration cl2 fig 4 this suggests that these treatment plants were not able to remove all the viruses from the source water in general free chlorine can effectively inactivate viruses however intact pmmov virus was still detected in tap water particularly in water treated by plants 2 and 4 fig 4 this may suggest that the chlorine treatment in these plants was inefficient or affected by quality of drinking water indeed in the tap water positive for intact pmmov relatively high free chlorine residuals 0 41 and 0 48 mg l for plant 2 and plant 4 respectively were observed but in relatively low water temperatures 11 4 c and 13 1 c respectively table s5 low water temperatures were found to greatly reduce the efficiency of chlorine treatment sobsey et al 1988 thus it is possible that low water temperatures affected the chlorination treatment and contributed to the presence of viruses in tap water the efficiency of disinfection with free chlorine might be also be affected by the contact time and organic matter concentration in tap water however such data were not available for analysis in this study only pmmov was detected and found to have intact capsids which might also suggest that pmmov was generally more resistant against chlorine treatment than human pathogenic viruses particularly at plants 2 and 4 in a previous sd cddp rt qpcr experiment performed using phosphate buffered saline pbs under laboratory conditions we confirmed that pmmov was more resistant to free chlorine than coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 data not shown which was generally more resistant against chlorine treatments than other enteric viruses meister et al 2018 rachmadi et al 2020 besides pmmov was also detected at higher concentrations than the human pathogenic viruses in surface water thus it is possible that the presence of pmmov in tap water in the absence of the human pathogenic viruses might also result from the higher abundance of pmmov in surface water compared to the human pathogenic viruses the overall reductions of target viruses by dwtps were calculated table s6 however it was difficult to compare the reduction of pmmov with that of the human pathogenic viruses since most of the viruses were under the detection limit in tap water we observed cases where none of the tap water samples positive for aiv were positive for pmmov this unique observation was only obtained in the tap water samples provided by treatment plants 6 and 7 both of which used groundwater fig 4 it appears that pmmov did not coexist with aiv in tap water produced from groundwater the occurrence of viruses in groundwater before treatment was not investigated therefore the reason for the absence of pmmov in the presence of aiv in tap water is not clear it is possible that pmmov was not present or less abundant than aiv in groundwater in addition aiv might not be removed effectively in these treatment plants as only chlorination was applied and free chlorine residuals were observed at relatively low levels 0 07 and 0 2 mg l table s5 3 5 the potential of using pmmov as a viral indicator for risk management in surface water and drinking water pmmov was clearly found to be more abundant than the human pathogenic viruses aiv ev nov i nov ii adv40 41 jc pyv and bk pyv in surface water table 2 fig 3 the presence of pmmov was positively correlated to the presence of most of the human pathogenic viruses except for bk pyv rbk pyv 0 25 as determined by conventional qpcr and ev rev 0 73 as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr fig 3 this might suggest that the source of pmmov was probably similar to that of the human pathogenic viruses however there was a relatively high number of the surface water samples 35 65 and 47 76 when determined by conventional rt qpcr and sd cddp rt qpcr respectively in which pmmov was detected while at least one of the human pathogenic viruses was not found the presence of pmmov was also observed in several surface water samples in which all the human pathogenic viruses were absent this may in part be due to pmmov being remarkably stable in water environments kuroda et al 2015 this suggests that the relevance of using pmmov as an indicator to accurately estimate the presence of pathogenic viruses in surface water may be limited this agrees with previous studies indicating that pmmov was not suitable for detecting fresh fecal pollution owing to its high stability in water bodies inoue et al 2020 kuroda et al 2015 however in this study pmmov was found to consistently coexist with human pathogenic viruses at a pmmov concentration higher than 4 9 log10 copies l as determined by conventional rt qpcr fig 3 a this might suggest that this pmmov concentration threshold can be used to indicate the presence of human pathogenic viruses in surface water in addition the cooccurrence of intact pmmov and intact human pathogenic viruses was observed at a pmmov concentration higher than 3 2 log10 copies l as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr fig 3 b suggesting that this threshold of intact pmmov concentration can be used to indicate the presence of intact human pathogenic viruses potentially infective viruses or assess the potential risk of viral infection in surface waters besides in comparison to chemical markers and bacterial indicators to indicate human fecal contaminations the use of pmmov has more advantages since it behaves more similarly to enteric viruses kitajima et al 2018 in tap water produced from groundwater the presence of pmmov was quite different from that of human pathogenic viruses particularly aiv which suggests that pmmov may not be a suitable indicator of human pathogenic viruses in tap water produced from groundwater fig 4 however compared with tap water produced from surface water pmmov was found relatively frequently in tap water in the absence of any human pathogenic viruses tested for fig 4 pmmov with intact capsids was also detected in tap water in addition to being more abundant in surface water pmmov was probably more resistant to drinking water treatment processes than human pathogenic viruses in previous studies pmmov was found to be removed to a lesser extent than enteric viruses when investigated in different drinking water treatment processes e g coagulation rapid sand filtration microfiltration and ultrafiltration at an all bench scale pilot scale and full scale plant monitoring although only conventional rt qpcr was used for quantifying viruses asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 recently pmmov was also found high resistance to chlorine treatment compared to enteric viruses adv and cv b5 shirasaki et al 2020 thus the absence of intact pmmov in tap water may be a useful criterion to ensure the efficiency of virus removal in dwtps or the absence of human pathogenic viruses in tap water produced from surface water however the presence of pmmov in tap water might not always correlate to the presence of human pathogenic viruses since pmmov can be sometimes detected in animal feces such as chicken cows goose and seagull hamza et al 2011b rosario et al 2009 therefore when pmmov is found in tap water especially in areas where these animals are prevalent other human enteric viruses should be investigated to accurately assess the risk of viral infection through tap water 4 conclusion in surface water pmmov was more frequently detected at higher concentrations than the human pathogenic viruses as measured by conventional rt qpcr intact pmmov was also more prevalent than intact human pathogenic viruses as determined by sd cddp rt qpcr in tap water samples only pmmov and aiv were detected among the target viruses pmmov was positive by conventional rt qpcr in 9 of the samples and remained positive by sd cddp rt qpcr in 5 of the samples indicating that pmmov possessed intact capsids in tap water aiv was positive by conventional rt qpcr 5 of the samples but negative by sd cddp rt qpcr indicating that aiv had damaged capsids in tap water the presence of aiv in the absence of pmmov in tap water produced from groundwater may suggest the limitation of pmmov as a viral indicator in groundwater in tap water produced from surface waters only pmmov was detected and found to have intact capsids this could be due to the higher abundance of pmmov in surface water and the greater resistance of pmmov against drinking treatment processes compared to the human pathogenic viruses thus the absence of intact pmmov may be used as a possible criterion to ensure the absence of human pathogenic viruses in tap water produced from

17384,fe based materials used to adsorb p are commonly considered to be limited by the increased fe lability while fe in drinking water treatment residue dwtr shows stable p adsorption abilities accordingly this study aimed to gain insight into fe lability in dwtr as compared to fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 using fe fractionation exafs and high throughput sequencing technologies the results showed that compared to fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 fe was relatively stable in the dwtr under the effects of organic matter sulfides and anaerobic conditions typically the addition of fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 enhanced fe mobility in sediment and overlying water promoting the formation of fe humin acid and ferrous sulfides fes and fes2 however the addition of dwtr even at relatively high doses of fe has limited impact on fe mobility the addition remarkably increased oxidizable fe in sediment by approximately 63 causing fe to be dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions like those in raw dwtr exafs analysis also suggested that fe humin acid increased substantially with the addition of dwtr becoming the main fe species in sediment with a relative abundance of 50 1 importantly the fe distributions were stable in sediment with dwtr added which demonstrated that organic matter stabilized the fe in the dwtr further analysis indicated that all materials promoted the enrichment of bacterial genera potentially related to fe metabolism e g bacteroides dok59 and methanosarcina fe2o3 in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fe ha in the dwtr group were the key species affecting the microbial communities overall the stabilizing effect of organic matter on fe in dwtr could be used to develop fe based materials to enhance fe stability for environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water treatment residuals iron stability recycling environmental remediation 1 introduction chemical immobilization is often used to control pollution in aquatic ecosystems a typical example is geoengineering in lakes which involves the use of inactivating materials to enhance p deposition for eutrophication control huser et al 2016 lürling et al 2016 materials containing relatively high amounts of p inactivating metals e g la al and zr have been widely applied in lake geoengineering wang and jiang 2016 lin et al 2020 in particular fe e g oxides and hydroxides is one of the recommended inactivating metals to develop such materials wang and jiang 2016 this is because in addition to strong p adsorption capabilities fe based materials have limited toxic effects on the natural environment at appropriate doses randall et al 1999 can enhance microbial processes in aquatic ecosystems zhuang et al 2019 and are relatively easy to obtain facilitating low cost environmental remediation chen et al 2016 however the p adsorption capabilities of fe based materials may be limited by increased fe lability especially under the effect of a reducing environment e g anaerobic conditions organic matter and sulfides kleeberg et al 2013 bakker et al 2015 fe based materials fe salts have been found to have varied results on p retention increasing it or having no effect during internal p loading control in lakes bakker et al 2015 low redox potential and interactions of chemical compounds especially organic matter and sulfides with fe may jeopardize the success of long term p loading control using fe based materials kleeberg et al 2013 bakker et al 2015 immers et al 2015 under anaerobic conditions the reduction of ferric to ferrous fe could reduce fe stability kleeberg et al 2013 while coprecipitation and complexation of fe with organic matter and sulfides could decrease the p adsorption capabilities of fe based materials bakker et al 2015 therefore maintaining fe stability is essential if fe based materials are to be used for environmental remediation drinking water treatment residue dwtr is an inevitable and nonhazardous byproduct of drinking water treatment plants ippolito et al 2011 keeley et al 2016 dwtr is generated in large amounts with a typical plant producing as much as 100 000 tons in a year ahmad et al 2016 in the past three decades dwtr has gradually come to be regarded as a kind of recyclable resource ostrom et al 2019 in particular dwtr has been found to have relatively high p adsorption capabilities and has been recycled to control p pollution for environmental remediation wang and jiang 2016 the high adsorption capability of dwtr is closely related to the amount of amorphous fe and al which come mainly from the flocculants applied during water purification in water treatment plants ippolito et al 2011 interestingly unlike many other fe based materials bakker et al 2015 p immobilized by fe in dwtr exhibited high stability under various conditions typically the immobilized p in dwtr was hard to desorb and no more than 1 12 of the total p was desorbed under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2012a even anaerobic incubation induced the transformation of the immobilized p from al bound to fe bound forms in dwtr wang et al 2012a low molecular weight organic acids citric acid and tartaric acid initially showed inhibitory effects on p adsorption the inhibition became weaker with time however eventually promoting p adsorption by fe in dwtr wang et al 2012b furthermore the p immobilized in sediment by dwtr exhibited high stability under the effect of hydrogen sulfide the sulfide could promote the enrichment of fe bound p in dwtr amended sediment wang et al 2013 these reports potentially indicate the relatively high stability of fe in dwtr considering the importance of maintaining fe stability during environmental remediation processes this study aimed to gain insight into fe lability in dwtr attempting to provide support for developing fe based materials it has been reported that as a typical syndrome of lake eutrophication algal bloom sedimentation can release massive amounts of organic matter leading to a reducing environment and enhancing sulfate reductions feng et al 2014 accordingly to comprehensively determine fe stability in dwtr this study was carried out by simulating algal bloom sedimentation fe fractionation and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs analysis were used and results were compared to two other commercial agents namely fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 which have been widely applied as p adsorbents wang and jiang 2016 responses of microbial communities were also determined using high throughput sequencing technology to assess the potential environmental effects of fe with different labilities recommendations for environmental remediation were ultimately presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation fresh dewatered dwtr was collected from a plant in beijing china air dried ground and sieved to a diameter below 0 147 mm the total fe in the dwtr was 97 7 1 2 mg g 1 other properties of the dwtr are presented in table s1 lake water sediment and algal blooms were collected from meiliang bay 31 32 n 120 10 e in lake taihu china surface sediments at a depth of 0 5 cm were sampled using a column sampler lake water was sampled at a depth of approximately 0 5 m the algae were collected using a nylon bag with a bore diameter of 0 0374 mm the dominant species in the sampled algal blooms was microcystis sp fig s1 the sampled sediments were filtered through a 1 8 mm sieve and subsequently homogenized lake water was filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filter paper in addition analytical grade fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 were used as reagents 2 2 microcosm tests the microcosm tests were conducted using 160 polyethylene bottles 250 ml wet sediments 50 g were added into the bottles followed by lake water 150 ml being careful to avoid sediment resuspension the bottles were equally divided into four groups including one control group for the other three groups dwtr fecl3 or fe2 so4 3 were added to the bottles and then left to stand overnight subsequently algal blooms were added obtaining algae concentrations dry weight of 0 3 and 4 8 g l 1 in overlying water the bottles were covered but not sealed to avoid excessive water evaporation and incubated at 30 1 c in the dark two bottles replications were sampled from each group for analysis and the tests were run until the overlying water properties were steady in this study algae concentrations were adopted according to previous reports feng et al 2014 liu et al 2015 representing low and high concentrations the doses of inactivating materials were calculated based on the amount of mobile p in the sediment table s2 the dosages were 0 051 g g 1 fresh sediment namely 89 0 μmol fe g 1 fresh sediment for the dwtr 3 26 μmol g 1 fresh sediment for fecl3 and 1 63 μmol g 1 fresh sediment for fe2 so4 3 after the tests the 0 1 cm surface sediments were sampled for further analysis 2 3 the exafs analysis the sediments

statistical analysis data analysis was performed using spss version 18 0 and included correlation analysis and one way analysis of variance anova based on α 0 05 redundancy analysis rda was performed using canoco 4 5 for windows biometris plant research international the netherlands 3 results 3 1 variations in overlying water properties 3 1 1 fe variations the clear variations were found in the soluble fe solid fe and total fe between low and high algae concentrations in the overlying water of each group fig 1 the soluble fe was described based on soluble fe ⅱ as the soluble total fe and fe ⅱ had minor differences at low algae concentration fig 1a the variations in soluble fe ⅱ were minor among different groups and kept at relatively low levels 0 200 mg l 1 except that a temporal increase to 2 89 mg l 1 was observed in the fecl3 group during the first 14 d at high algae concentration fig 1b fe ⅱ varied little between the control and dwtr groups and gradually decreased over time with average concentrations of 7 70 6 30 mg l 1 and 6 61 4 56 mg l 1 for the control and dwtr groups respectively across the entire test the soluble fe ⅱ also showed decreasing trends in the fecl3 group but the concentrations were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the control with an average concentration of 12 6 6 50 mg l 1 during the tests in the fe2 so4 3 group fe ⅱ quickly decreased during the first 7 d with an initial concentration of 19 3 2 5 mg l 1 the concentrations then remained at a relatively low level not detectable in most cases for solid fe at low algae concentration fig 1c there were no significant differences between the groups with concentrations 12 mg l 1 at high algae concentration fig 1d the solid fe was similar among the control dwtr and fe2 so4 3 groups remaining within 30 mg l 1 during the entire test the solid fe concentrations in the fe2 so4 3 group tended to be lower than those in the control and dwtr groups but not significantly different in statistic however in the fecl3 group a temporal increase in solid fe was observed from 0 42 d the concentrations of solid fe during the temporal increase stage were significantly higher than those in the other groups p 0 01 even attaining 105 mg l 1 in the fecl3 group the total fe figs 1e and 1f and solid fe in all groups at different algae concentrations were similar which could be because the total fe in the overlying water was mainly composed of solid fe table s3 these results demonstrated that increasing algae concentrations induced varied responses of fe in overlying water to different material additions dwtr had little effect on fe variations while fe concentrations tended to increase with fecl3 addition and decrease with fe2 so4 3 addition 3 1 2 orp doc sulfides and ph variations the do of the overlying water quickly decreased to extremely low levels near 0 mg l 1 during the first 3 d accordingly orp was adopted to reflect the redox conditions figs 1g and 1h the trends for orp were similar among the different groups at low and high algae concentrations the orp quickly decreased to negative values after algae addition on the 1st d before they stabilized at a certain level and gradually recovered the negative orps were prolonged and reached lower values as algae concentrations increased at high algae concentration negative orps were observed during 1 35 d for the control and dwtr groups during 1 42 d for the fecl3 group and during the whole test for the fe2 so4 3 group the doc concentrations increased with higher algae concentrations and the variations were similar among all groups at different algae concentrations figs 1i and 1j as time increased the doc concentrations clearly increased at the initial stage then decreased at low algae concentration the increase was observed during the first 7 d while it continued to the first 28 d at high algae concentration the sulfides showed similar trends among all groups at low algae concentration measuring approximately 0 03 mg l 1 figs 1k and 1l at high algae concentration a remarkable increase in sulfide concentrations was observed compared to those at low algae concentration the variations were similar to those in the control dwtr and fecl3 groups at high algae concentration the sulfides quickly decreased from 0 400 1 20 to 0 1 mg l 1 during the first 7 d remained constant at approximately 0 100 mg l 1 from 7 35 d and then slightly decreased again however in the fe2 so4 3 group the concentrations temporally increased to 0 770 mg l 1 from 7 35 d during this stage sulfide concentrations were significantly higher than those in the other groups p 0 05 the ph values were similar in all groups at different algae concentrations figs 1m and 1n at low algae concentration the ph was approximately 7 25 while at high algae concentration the ph gradually increased from approximately 5 5 remaining constant at approximately 7 25 in different groups therefore the effects of dwtr fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 on the variations in orp doc sulfide concentration and ph of overlying water were closely related to algae concentrations 3 1 3 relations between different overlying water properties pearson correlation analysis for various overlying water properties table 1 suggested that doc had significantly negative correlations p 0 01 with orp and ph but had significantly positive correlations p 0 01 with sulfide concentration sulfide concentration had significantly negative correlations p 0 01 with orp and ph and orp had significantly positive correlations p 0 01 with ph accordingly the temporarily increase in doc led to the relatively low ph in the initial tests figs 1m and 1n promoted sulfide accumulation and induced a negative orp in the overlying water the negative orp and low ph further enhanced sulfide accumulation among the three forms of fe in overlying water only soluble fe ⅱ had significantly positive correlations p 0 05 with sulfide concentration indicating a relatively weak correlations between fe and sulfides nevertheless soluble fe ⅱ solid fe and total fe in the overlying water had significantly negative correlations p 0 01 with orp and ph but significantly positive correlations p 0 01 with doc therefore increasing doc and decreasing ph and orp tended to increase fe mobility in the microcosm systems 3 2 fe species in sediment surface sediments of the different groups at high algae concentration were sampled for exafs analysis as fe in overlying water mainly differed at high algae concentration fig 1 the spoil values of reference compounds were first determined by principal component analysis table s4 and the fe humin acid ha fepo4 fe2o3 fe oh 3 and fe3 aq measurements were performed for linear combination fitting lcf analysis according to their lowest spoil values fes and fes2 were also used in the analysis because sulfides were detected during the microcosm test the spectra of the reference compounds including fe foil fe3 aq fe2o3 fe oh 3 fes fes2 fe acac 2 feo fe3o4 fef3 fe2 sio4 3 fepo4 and fe ha are presented in fig s2 and the results of lcf analysis are shown in fig 2 a and table 2 fe ha fes fes2 and fe oh 3 were detected in all groups while fe3 aq was detected in the control and fe2 so4 3 groups fe2o3 was detected in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fepo4 was detected in the control fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups compared to the control group the most remarkable changes were that the relative abundances of fe ha in sediments substantially increased from 17 8 3 2 control to 50 1 3 8 in the dwtr group 29 1 4 7 in the fecl3 group and 23 4 5 9 in the fe2 so4 3 group various changes in fes fes2 and fe oh 3 relative abundances were also observed in the three experimental groups but the changes were within 10 0 further calculation based on the relative abundances and the total fe contents table 1 suggested that in addition to fe ha in the three experimental groups the contents of ferrous sulfides including fes and fes2 and fe oh 3 also clearly increased from 9 75 and 10 9 to 13 7 19 3 and 17 2 19 1 mg g 1 respectively the most remarkable increase in ferrous sulfide concentration was found in the fe2 so4 3 group therefore fe species distributions showed different variations with the addition of dwtr fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 exafs shell fitting was performed to verify the reliability of the lcf results and to further investigate the properties of the fe species the results are shown in table 3 and figs 2b and 2c distinguishing p and s was difficult during shell fitting due to the close atomic numbers and similar electronic scattering abilities of the two elements considering the bond lengths of fe p and fe s in crystal fepo4 fes and fes2 however it was reasonable to believe that both fe p and fe s contributed to the shell of 2 3 å while the shell of 3 3 å was mainly the result of fe s the shell fitting results showed that the first shell could be the six coordinated o which mainly resulted from fe in its oxide hydroxids and organic bound forms the coordinated p s and fe in the outer shell further demonstrated that the bond lengths were similar to those in standard crystal structures and coordination numbers were basically consistent with the ratios obtained from lcf analysis these findings suggested that the selected standard reference compounds reflected fe species in solids 3 3 microbial communities in sediment a total of 150632 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained table s5 these sequences were assigned to 12079 otus with a cutoff of 0 03 according to the chao1 observed species shannon and simpson diversity indices the diversity of bacterial communities in all groups at high algae concentration was clearly lower than that at low concentration the pcoa and upgma cluster analysis further showed that the samples could be divided into two distinct clusters figs 3 a and 3b which occurred at low and high algae concentrations respectively from the phylogenetic analysis eighteen phyla were detected in the eight libraries with relative abundances 1 fig 3c compared to groups at low algae concentration the relative abundances of euryarchaeota bacteroidetes and firmicutes increased in groups at high algae concentration while those of crenarchaeota acidobacteria nitrospirae planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia decreased further analysis at the genus level fig 3d showed that the dominant genera in all groups had clear differences between low and high algae concentrations in all groups at low algae concentration the dominant genera were nitrosopumilus gouta19 nitrospira desulfococcus lcp 6 and planctomyces especially nitrosopumilus with relative abundances of 4 16 25 5 at high algae concentration bacteroides and dok59 were the dominant genera in the control dwtr and fecl3 groups other observed dominant genera were flavobacterium in the control and fecl3 groups comamonas and rhodanobacter in the control group and methanosarcina and syntrophomonas in the dwtr group in the fe2 so4 3 group bacteroide thiobacillus clostridium longilinea and thermomonas were the dominant bacterial genera in comparison the most enriched genus in the control dwtr and fe2 so4 3 groups was bacteroides dwtr and fe2 so4 3 tended to promote enrichment increasing the relative abundances from 6 65 to 8 38 and 12 2 respectively the most enriched genus in the fecl3 group was dok59 with a relative abundance of 27 4 therefore microbial communities in sediments varied with different algae concentrations and the variations changed with the addition of different material 3 4 other properties of sediment in the sediment of the control group fe was mainly found in the residual fraction fig 4 a the addition of dwtr clearly increased the proportions of oxidizable fe by approximately 63 leading to fe being dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions in the dwtr group similar to the raw dwtr accounting for approximately 95 of the total fig s3 the addition of fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 remarkably decreased residual fe and increased acid soluble reducible and oxidizable fe proportions fig 4a indicating that the added fe remained largely in the acid soluble reducible and oxidizable fractions over the period of the experiment increasing algae concentrations had a limited effect on the distributions of fe in the control and dwtr groups in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups however the oxidizable fraction increased by approximately 15 sulfides in the sediments of the different groups were found mainly in the pyrite fraction fig 4b at low algae concentration the total sulfide concentrations were similar in different groups while at high algae concentration total sulfides clearly increased in particular the highest sulfides were observed in the fe2 so4 3 group which was followed by those of the fecl3 dwtr and control groups other sediment properties such as ph and total organic c are presented in table s6 4 discussion similar to previous studies kleeberg et al 2013 bakker et al 2015 increasing doc and decreasing ph and orp were found to increase fe mobility in the microcosm systems of this study table 1 the variations in doc ph and orp of overlying water figs 1g 1l and table 1 could be related to the release of organic acids and sulfoprotein during algal bloom sedimentation the decomposition of organic matter and the reduction of sulfates feng et al 2014 liu et al 2015 the relatively weak correlations between fe and sulfide concentration may be because fe in overlying water comes mainly from sediments while for sulfides algal blooms are also an important source in addition to sediments liu et al 2015 furthermore the transformations of soluble fe to solid fe may occur in the overlying water this inference could be supported by the temporary increase in solid fe at high algae concentration fig 1 the variations in overlying water properties were closely related to algae concentrations fig 1 however the observation of the negative orp the temporarily increased doc and the accumulated sulfides in the overlying water at high algae concentration figs 1g 1l demonstrated that the constructed microcosm systems at high algae concentration were mainly under the effect of a reducing environment organic matter and sulfides such an environment was beneficial to investigate the fe lability in different materials 4 1 the variations in fe stability fecl3 increased the concentrations of various forms of fe in the overlying water figs 1a 1f indicating the increased release of fe from the sediment with the addition of fecl3 as was discussed before in contrast to fecl3 fe2 so4 3 decreased various fe concentrations in the overlying water this decrease could be caused by the increased sulfide concentrations in the fe2 so4 3 group figs 1k and 1l discussions are presented in the next section the added fe from fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 at ph 7 table s2 was mainly in the form of hydroxides exafs analysis fig 2 and table 2 showed that in addition to fe oh 3 contents the contents of fe ha fes and fes2 also clearly increased in the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups compared to the control group this indicates that fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 promoted interactions between fe and organic matter or sulfides in the microcosm tests which indirectly demonstrated the transformations of soluble fe to solid fe in the overlying water these findings were consistent with fe and sulfide fractionation which suggested that increased algae concentrations promoted the formation of oxidizable fe and pyrite sulfides in the surface sediments of the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups fig 4 in fractionation methodology the oxidizable fraction commonly includes organic matter bound metals yuan et al 2004 therefore the lability of fe in fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 tended to increase in the microcosm tests nevertheless a substantial increase in the relative abundances proportions was only observed for fe ha in the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups this may be because the doc which is largely released during algal bloom sedimentation fig 1j promoted the interactions between the added fe and organic matter which may be stronger than those between sulfides and fe in the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups this study also observed a higher relative abundance of fe ha in the fecl3 group compared to the fe2 so4 3 group as well as the highest concentrations of ferrous sulfides fes and fes2 in the fe2 so4 3 group table 2 and figs 2 and 4b such findings occurred because compared to fecl3 the added sulfates in fe2 so4 3 promoted sulfate reduction this resulted in relatively high concentrations of sulfides in the overlying water of the fe2 so4 3 group figs 1k and 1l which could compete with organic matter for fe enhancing the reactions between fe and sulfides and resulting in the lowest various fe concentrations in the overlying water in addition as anaerobic methylation of h2s can produce methyl thiols mtl higgins et al 2006 mtl in overlying water was also detected during the temporary increase of sulfides fig s4 the results indicated that fe2 so4 3 increased mtl production by approximately one order of magnitude which further demonstrated enhanced sulfate reduction the most important finding herein was that although the doses of fe in the dwtr were higher than those in fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 see section 2 2 the addition of dwtr had a limited effect on the variations in fe concentrations and other properties including orp doc ph sulfide concentrations and mtl concentration of the overlying water at low and high algae concentrations figs 1 and s4 the distribution of fe fractions in the sediment of the dwtr group showed little difference at different algae concentrations fig 4a these findings demonstrated the relatively stable nature of fe in the dwtr compared to that in fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 the potential release of organic matter and fe from dwtr has been reported in some studies oliver et al 2011 wang and jiang 2016 for example oliver et al 2011 reported the release of doc and fe from dwtr under anaerobic conditions these results which contradict the present study could have occurred because the doc and fe released from the dwtr were not sufficient to influence the migration and transformation of organic matter and fe in the microcosm herein the dwtr was heterogeneous as the fractionation results suggested that the various fractions of fe were distributed in the dwtr fig s3 nevertheless dwtr addition clearly increased oxidizable fe proportions in sediment by approximately 63 causing fe in the sediment of the dwtr group to be dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions approximately 95 of the total similar to the raw dwtr the distributions of fe fractions were stable at different algae concentrations after the tests indicating that the oxidizable and residual fractions could be the main reason leading to the relatively high stability of fe in the dwtr during the tests furthermore exafs analysis showed that substantially increased relative abundances by 32 3 compared to the control were only observed for fe ha in the sediment of the dwtr group in fact in addition to the oxidizable fraction the residual fraction is also partially composed of organic matter bound metals in fractionation methodology yuan et al 2004 the abovementioned results demonstrated that organic matter stabilized fe leading to relatively stable fe in the dwtr under the effect of organic matter and sulfides in anaerobic conditions in addition exafs analysis did not indicate any fepo4 in the dwtr group although the adsorption of p from the overlying water by the dwtr was observed during microcosm tests fig s5 it could be that a limited amount of p adsorbed by fe in the dwtr was presented as fepo4 due to the limited free state of fe in the dwtr fig s3 for phosphates precipitating in the overlying water for example the adsorbed p may have formed complexes of p fe ha as organic matter fe complexes were one of the dominant fe forms in dwtr but the complexes structures were in fe o coordination with relatively high disorder making them difficult to distinguish from fe ha during exafs analysis 4 2 the responses of microbial communities at low algae concentration the dominant genera 1 were the same across the different groups fig 3 while at high algae concentration the dominant genera in the different groups had some differences among the dominant genera at low algae concentration the genus gouta19 was potentially capable of organic matter degradation wang et al 2018 while desulfococcus was closely related to sulfate reducing processes yan et al 2020 at high algae concentration the genera bacteroides mohamed et al 2018 comamonas wu et al 2010 dok59 song et al 2020 flavobacterium kim and yu 2020 longilinea wu et al 2019 methanosarcina zheng et al 2017 and syntrophomonas yuan et al 2020 have been reported to have the potential capability to degrade organic matter the genus clostridium has the potential to reduce sulfates escoffier et al 2001 furthermore the genera bacteroides rocha and krykunivsky 2017 clostridium dobbin 1999 comamonas wu et al 2010 longilinea li et al 2019 methanosarcina zheng et al 2017 rhodanobacter ma et al 2019 syntrophomonas yuan et al 2020 thiobacillus zhang et al 2018 and thermomonas jensen and webb 1995 are closely related to fe metabolism such information suggested that the largely released doc from algae and the added fe promoted the enrichment of microorganisms potentially related to the migration and transformation of organic c and fe reducing microbial diversities table s5 in addition the genus clostridium enriched in the fe2 so4 3 group at high algae concentration indirectly suggested that sulfates in fe2 so4 3 promoted sulfate reduction rda analyses were performed to identify the relationships between fe species and the structures of microbial communities fig 5 based on the rda model 88 2 of the total variance could be explained by the first canonical axes for the dominant sequences at the genus level methanosarcina and syntrophomonas were positively correlated with fe ha fig 5a longilinea dok59 and thermomonas were positively correlated with fe3 aq and especially fe2o3 thiobacillus clostridium and bacteroides were positively correlated with fe oh 3 and especially fes2 and fes showed clear negative correlations with comamonas flavobacterium and rhodanobacter accordingly fe in the added materials led to variations in the microbial communities and the distributions of the microbial communities were closely related to various fe species further analysis fig 5b showed that the microbial communities were similar between the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and positively correlated with fe2o3 while the communities in the dwtr group were positively correlated with fe ha fig 5a these results suggested that fe2o3 in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fe ha in the dwtr group were the key species affecting the microbial communities in the microcosm ferric oxides have been widely found to be a major contributor to variations in microbial communities under various environmental conditions lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 considering that fe dominated as fe ha it was reasonable to understand that fe ha was one of the major fe species affecting microbial communities in the dwtr group the different effects of fe2o3 and fe ha on the microbial communities may result from their varied impacts on environmental conditions e g fig 1 zhang et al 2020 4 3 environmental applications as described in the introduction the high stability of fe was essential for fe based materials to control pollution according to the findings on the variations of overlying water properties and the distributions of fe in sediment determined by exafs analysis and fe fractionation this study provided direct evidence that the main factors affecting the lability of fe in fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 were organic matter sulfides and a reducing environment however the stabilizing effect of organic matter was found to be the main cause of the relatively high stability of fe in dwtr in fact the relationship between organic matter and fe was a specific focus of researchers when investigating organic matter stability in natural environments riedel et al 2013 several studies also found that the binding of aliphatic c reduced the reduction release of fe from hematite adhikari andyang 2015 organic matter in soil increased the stability of fe based colloids under anaerobic conditions yan et al 2016 accordingly the stabilizing effect of organic matter may be thought of as developing fe based materials to enhance fe stability for environmental remediation materials with relatively high fe stability have been developed for internal sediment p pollution control fuchs et al 2018 reasonably the applicability of fe based materials could be assessed based not only on fe stability but also on the capability for pollutant removal previous studies have fully demonstrated that compared to other p inactivating materials the characteristics of p adsorption by dwtr exhibit long term equilibrium adsorption wang et al 2016 in this study better p removal by dwtr was also observed at the latter stages of microcosm tests fig s5 the binding of organic matter on the one hand occurred at adsorption sites on fe based materials reducing the initial p adsorption capacity gerke 1993 on the other hand the complexes of organic matter and fe could reduce the long term aging effect of fe wang et al 2012b which is beneficial to the formation of abundant micropores and mesopores leading to long term p adsorption makris et al 2005 however the characteristics of the binding between organic matter and fe were closely related to the properties of organic matter riedel et al 2013 which could affect p adsorption and fe stability in the humic acid of the dwtr studied herein the total n and total c were 7 47 and 45 8 respectively please see supporting information and the structures of humic acid determined by ftir fig s6 were dominated by c h bending 868 cm 1 aliphatic c o 1028 cm 1 c o c stretching 1158 cm 1 c c or c o stretching 1604 cm 1 asymmetric c h stretching 2922 cm 1 and o h stretching 3280 cm 1 the findings on the varied effects of fe species on microbial communities also indicated the potential relevance of fe stability for microbial communities therefore the binding of organic matter and fe in association with the effect on fe stability p adsorption capability and microbial communities needs more in depth investigation for developing fe based materials in the future 5 conclusion this study aimed to gain insight into the lability of fe in dwtr compared to fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 the main conclusions are listed below 1 the variations in overlying water properties were closely related to algae concentrations increased fe liability was observed in fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 especially during algal bloom sedimentation at relatively high algae concentration fecl3 significantly increased various fe concentrations in the overlying water while fe2 so4 3 significantly promoted sulfide accumulation both materials enhanced the formation of fe ha and ferrous sulfides 2 relatively stable fe was observed in the dwtr the addition of dwtr had limited effects on various fe concentrations and other properties including orp doc ph sulfide concentrations and mtl concentration of the overlying water at different algae concentrations the addition of dwtr remarkably increased oxidizable fe in sediment causing fe to be dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions approximately 95 of the total exafs analysis also suggested that fe ha substantially increased with dwtr addition and became the main fe species in sediment the fe distributions were stable in sediment with dwtr addition indicating that organic matter stabilized fe in the dwtr 3 responses of microbial communities changed with the addition of different materials dwtr fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 promoted the enrichment of various microorganisms potentially related to fe metabolism fe2o3 in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fe ha in the dwtr group were the key species affecting the microbial communities in summary the stabilizing effect of organic matter could be used to develop fe based materials to enhance fe stability for environmental remediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17384,fe based materials used to adsorb p are commonly considered to be limited by the increased fe lability while fe in drinking water treatment residue dwtr shows stable p adsorption abilities accordingly this study aimed to gain insight into fe lability in dwtr as compared to fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 using fe fractionation exafs and high throughput sequencing technologies the results showed that compared to fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 fe was relatively stable in the dwtr under the effects of organic matter sulfides and anaerobic conditions typically the addition of fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 enhanced fe mobility in sediment and overlying water promoting the formation of fe humin acid and ferrous sulfides fes and fes2 however the addition of dwtr even at relatively high doses of fe has limited impact on fe mobility the addition remarkably increased oxidizable fe in sediment by approximately 63 causing fe to be dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions like those in raw dwtr exafs analysis also suggested that fe humin acid increased substantially with the addition of dwtr becoming the main fe species in sediment with a relative abundance of 50 1 importantly the fe distributions were stable in sediment with dwtr added which demonstrated that organic matter stabilized the fe in the dwtr further analysis indicated that all materials promoted the enrichment of bacterial genera potentially related to fe metabolism e g bacteroides dok59 and methanosarcina fe2o3 in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fe ha in the dwtr group were the key species affecting the microbial communities overall the stabilizing effect of organic matter on fe in dwtr could be used to develop fe based materials to enhance fe stability for environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water treatment residuals iron stability recycling environmental remediation 1 introduction chemical immobilization is often used to control pollution in aquatic ecosystems a typical example is geoengineering in lakes which involves the use of inactivating materials to enhance p deposition for eutrophication control huser et al 2016 lürling et al 2016 materials containing relatively high amounts of p inactivating metals e g la al and zr have been widely applied in lake geoengineering wang and jiang 2016 lin et al 2020 in particular fe e g oxides and hydroxides is one of the recommended inactivating metals to develop such materials wang and jiang 2016 this is because in addition to strong p adsorption capabilities fe based materials have limited toxic effects on the natural environment at appropriate doses randall et al 1999 can enhance microbial processes in aquatic ecosystems zhuang et al 2019 and are relatively easy to obtain facilitating low cost environmental remediation chen et al 2016 however the p adsorption capabilities of fe based materials may be limited by increased fe lability especially under the effect of a reducing environment e g anaerobic conditions organic matter and sulfides kleeberg et al 2013 bakker et al 2015 fe based materials fe salts have been found to have varied results on p retention increasing it or having no effect during internal p loading control in lakes bakker et al 2015 low redox potential and interactions of chemical compounds especially organic matter and sulfides with fe may jeopardize the success of long term p loading control using fe based materials kleeberg et al 2013 bakker et al 2015 immers et al 2015 under anaerobic conditions the reduction of ferric to ferrous fe could reduce fe stability kleeberg et al 2013 while coprecipitation and complexation of fe with organic matter and sulfides could decrease the p adsorption capabilities of fe based materials bakker et al 2015 therefore maintaining fe stability is essential if fe based materials are to be used for environmental remediation drinking water treatment residue dwtr is an inevitable and nonhazardous byproduct of drinking water treatment plants ippolito et al 2011 keeley et al 2016 dwtr is generated in large amounts with a typical plant producing as much as 100 000 tons in a year ahmad et al 2016 in the past three decades dwtr has gradually come to be regarded as a kind of recyclable resource ostrom et al 2019 in particular dwtr has been found to have relatively high p adsorption capabilities and has been recycled to control p pollution for environmental remediation wang and jiang 2016 the high adsorption capability of dwtr is closely related to the amount of amorphous fe and al which come mainly from the flocculants applied during water purification in water treatment plants ippolito et al 2011 interestingly unlike many other fe based materials bakker et al 2015 p immobilized by fe in dwtr exhibited high stability under various conditions typically the immobilized p in dwtr was hard to desorb and no more than 1 12 of the total p was desorbed under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2012a even anaerobic incubation induced the transformation of the immobilized p from al bound to fe bound forms in dwtr wang et al 2012a low molecular weight organic acids citric acid and tartaric acid initially showed inhibitory effects on p adsorption the inhibition became weaker with time however eventually promoting p adsorption by fe in dwtr wang et al 2012b furthermore the p immobilized in sediment by dwtr exhibited high stability under the effect of hydrogen sulfide the sulfide could promote the enrichment of fe bound p in dwtr amended sediment wang et al 2013 these reports potentially indicate the relatively high stability of fe in dwtr considering the importance of maintaining fe stability during environmental remediation processes this study aimed to gain insight into fe lability in dwtr attempting to provide support for developing fe based materials it has been reported that as a typical syndrome of lake eutrophication algal bloom sedimentation can release massive amounts of organic matter leading to a reducing environment and enhancing sulfate reductions feng et al 2014 accordingly to comprehensively determine fe stability in dwtr this study was carried out by simulating algal bloom sedimentation fe fractionation and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs analysis were used and results were compared to two other commercial agents namely fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 which have been widely applied as p adsorbents wang and jiang 2016 responses of microbial communities were also determined using high throughput sequencing technology to assess the potential

grade fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 were used as reagents 2 2 microcosm tests the microcosm tests were conducted using 160 polyethylene bottles 250 ml wet sediments 50 g were added into the bottles followed by lake water 150 ml being careful to avoid sediment resuspension the bottles were equally divided into four groups including one control group for the other three groups dwtr fecl3 or fe2 so4 3 were added to the bottles and then left to stand overnight subsequently algal blooms were added obtaining algae concentrations dry weight of 0 3 and 4 8 g l 1 in overlying water the bottles were covered but not sealed to avoid excessive water evaporation and incubated at 30 1 c in the dark two bottles replications were sampled from each group for analysis and the tests were run until the overlying water properties were steady in this study algae concentrations were adopted according to previous reports feng et al 2014 liu et al 2015 representing low and high concentrations the doses of inactivating materials were calculated based on the amount of mobile p in the sediment table s2 the dosages were 0 051 g g 1 fresh sediment namely 89 0 μmol fe g 1 fresh sediment for the dwtr 3 26

using canoco 4 5 for windows biometris plant research international the netherlands 3 results 3 1 variations in overlying water properties 3 1 1 fe variations the clear variations were found in the soluble fe solid fe and total fe between low and high algae concentrations in the overlying water of each group fig 1 the soluble fe was described based on soluble fe ⅱ as the soluble total fe and fe ⅱ had minor differences at low algae concentration fig 1a the variations in soluble fe ⅱ were minor among different groups and kept at relatively low levels 0 200 mg l 1 except that a temporal increase to 2 89 mg l 1 was observed in the fecl3 group during the first 14 d at high algae concentration fig 1b fe ⅱ varied little between the control and dwtr groups and gradually decreased over time with average concentrations of 7 70 6 30 mg l 1 and 6 61 4 56 mg l 1 for the control and dwtr groups respectively across the entire test the soluble fe ⅱ also showed decreasing trends in the fecl3 group but the concentrations were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the control with an average concentration of 12 6 6 50 mg l 1 during the tests in the fe2 so4 3 group fe ⅱ quickly decreased during the first 7 d with an initial concentration of 19 3 2 5 mg l 1 the concentrations then remained at a relatively low level not detectable in most cases for solid fe at low algae concentration fig 1c there were no significant differences between the groups with concentrations 12 mg l 1 at high algae concentration fig 1d the solid fe was similar among the control dwtr and fe2 so4 3 groups remaining within 30 mg l 1 during the entire test the solid fe concentrations in the fe2 so4 3 group tended to be lower than those in the control and dwtr groups but not significantly different in statistic however in the fecl3 group a temporal increase in solid fe was observed from 0 42 d the concentrations of solid fe during the temporal increase stage were significantly higher than those in the other groups p 0 01 even attaining 105 mg l 1 in the fecl3 group the total fe figs 1e and 1f and solid fe in all groups at different algae concentrations were similar which could be because the total fe in the overlying water was mainly composed of solid fe table s3 these results demonstrated that increasing algae concentrations induced varied responses of fe in overlying water to different material additions dwtr had little effect on fe variations while fe concentrations tended to increase with fecl3 addition and decrease with fe2 so4 3 addition 3 1 2 orp doc sulfides and ph variations the do of the overlying water quickly decreased to extremely low levels near 0 mg l 1 during the first 3 d accordingly orp was adopted to reflect the redox conditions figs 1g and 1h the trends for orp were similar among the different groups at low and high algae concentrations the orp quickly decreased to negative values after algae addition on the 1st d before they stabilized at a certain level and gradually recovered the negative orps were prolonged and reached lower values as algae concentrations increased at high algae concentration negative orps were observed during 1 35 d for the control and dwtr groups during 1 42 d for the fecl3 group and during the whole test for the fe2 so4 3 group the doc concentrations increased with higher algae concentrations and the variations were similar among all groups at different algae concentrations figs 1i and 1j as time increased the doc concentrations clearly increased at the initial stage then decreased at low algae concentration the increase was observed during the first 7 d while it continued to the first 28 d at high algae concentration the sulfides showed similar trends among all groups at low algae concentration measuring approximately 0 03 mg l 1 figs 1k and 1l at high algae concentration a remarkable increase in sulfide concentrations was observed compared to those at low algae concentration the variations were similar to those in the control dwtr and fecl3 groups at high algae concentration the sulfides quickly decreased from 0 400 1 20 to 0 1 mg l 1 during the first 7 d remained constant at approximately 0 100 mg l 1 from 7 35 d and then slightly decreased again however in the fe2 so4 3 group the concentrations temporally increased to 0 770 mg l 1 from 7 35 d during this stage sulfide concentrations were significantly higher than those in the other groups p 0 05 the ph values were similar in all groups at different algae concentrations figs 1m and 1n at low algae concentration the ph was approximately 7 25 while at high algae concentration the ph gradually increased from approximately 5 5 remaining constant at approximately 7 25 in different groups therefore the effects of dwtr fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 on the variations in orp doc sulfide concentration and ph of overlying water were closely related to algae concentrations 3 1 3 relations between different overlying water properties pearson correlation analysis for various overlying water properties table 1 suggested that doc had significantly negative correlations p 0 01 with orp and ph but had significantly positive correlations p 0 01 with sulfide concentration sulfide concentration had significantly negative correlations p 0 01 with orp and ph and orp had significantly positive correlations p 0 01 with ph accordingly the temporarily increase in doc led to the relatively low ph in the initial tests figs 1m and 1n promoted sulfide accumulation and induced a negative orp in the overlying water the negative orp and low ph further enhanced sulfide accumulation among the three forms of fe in overlying water only soluble fe ⅱ had significantly positive correlations p 0 05 with sulfide concentration indicating a relatively weak correlations between fe and sulfides nevertheless soluble fe ⅱ solid fe and total fe in the overlying water had significantly negative correlations p 0 01 with orp and ph but significantly positive correlations p 0 01 with doc therefore increasing doc and decreasing ph and orp tended to increase fe mobility in the microcosm systems 3 2 fe species in sediment surface sediments of the different groups at high algae concentration were sampled for exafs analysis as fe in overlying water mainly differed at high algae concentration fig 1 the spoil values of reference compounds were first determined by principal component analysis table s4 and the fe humin acid ha fepo4 fe2o3 fe oh 3 and fe3 aq measurements were performed for linear combination fitting lcf analysis according to their lowest spoil values fes and fes2 were also used in the analysis because sulfides were detected during the microcosm test the spectra of the reference compounds including fe foil fe3 aq fe2o3 fe oh 3 fes fes2 fe acac 2 feo fe3o4 fef3 fe2 sio4 3 fepo4 and fe ha are presented in fig s2 and the results of lcf analysis are shown in fig 2 a and table 2 fe ha fes fes2 and fe oh 3 were detected in all groups while fe3 aq was detected in the control and fe2 so4 3 groups fe2o3 was detected in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fepo4 was detected in the control fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups compared to the control group the most remarkable changes were that the relative abundances of fe ha in sediments substantially increased from 17 8 3 2 control to 50 1 3 8 in the dwtr group 29 1 4 7 in the fecl3 group and 23 4 5 9 in the fe2 so4 3 group various changes in fes fes2 and fe oh 3 relative abundances were also observed in the three experimental groups but the changes were within 10 0 further calculation based on the relative abundances and the total fe contents table 1 suggested that in addition to fe ha in the three experimental groups the contents of ferrous sulfides including fes and fes2 and fe oh 3 also clearly increased from 9 75 and 10 9 to 13 7 19 3 and 17 2 19 1 mg g 1 respectively the most remarkable increase in ferrous sulfide concentration was found in the fe2 so4 3 group therefore fe species distributions showed different variations with the addition of dwtr fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 exafs shell fitting was performed to verify the reliability of the lcf results and to further investigate the properties of the fe species the results are shown in table 3 and figs 2b and 2c distinguishing p and s was difficult during shell fitting due to the close atomic numbers and similar electronic scattering abilities of the two elements considering the bond lengths of fe p and fe s in crystal fepo4 fes and fes2 however it was reasonable to believe that both fe p and fe s contributed to the shell of 2 3 å while the shell of 3 3 å was mainly the result of fe s the shell fitting results showed that the first shell could be the six coordinated o which mainly resulted from fe in its oxide hydroxids and organic bound forms the coordinated p s and fe in the outer shell further demonstrated that the bond lengths were similar to those in standard crystal structures and coordination numbers were basically consistent with the ratios obtained from lcf analysis these findings suggested that the selected standard reference compounds reflected fe species in solids 3 3 microbial communities in sediment a total of 150632 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained table s5 these sequences were assigned to 12079 otus with a cutoff of 0 03 according to the chao1 observed species shannon and simpson diversity indices the diversity of bacterial communities in all groups at high algae concentration was clearly lower than that at low concentration the pcoa and upgma cluster analysis further showed that the samples could be divided into two distinct clusters figs 3 a and 3b which occurred at low and high algae concentrations respectively from the phylogenetic analysis eighteen phyla were detected in the eight libraries with relative abundances 1 fig 3c compared to groups at low algae concentration the relative abundances of euryarchaeota bacteroidetes and firmicutes increased in groups at high algae concentration while those of crenarchaeota acidobacteria nitrospirae planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia decreased further analysis at the genus level fig 3d showed that the dominant genera in all groups had clear differences between low and high algae concentrations in all groups at low algae concentration the dominant genera were nitrosopumilus gouta19 nitrospira desulfococcus lcp 6 and planctomyces especially nitrosopumilus with relative abundances of 4 16 25 5 at high algae concentration bacteroides and dok59 were the dominant genera in the control dwtr and fecl3 groups other observed dominant genera were flavobacterium in the control and fecl3 groups comamonas and rhodanobacter in the control group and methanosarcina and syntrophomonas in the dwtr group in the fe2 so4 3 group bacteroide thiobacillus clostridium longilinea and thermomonas were the dominant bacterial genera in comparison the most enriched genus in the control dwtr and fe2 so4 3 groups was bacteroides dwtr and fe2 so4 3 tended to promote enrichment increasing the relative abundances from 6 65 to 8 38 and 12 2 respectively the most enriched genus in the fecl3 group was dok59 with a relative abundance of 27 4 therefore microbial communities in sediments varied with different algae concentrations and the variations changed with the addition of different material 3 4 other properties of sediment in the sediment of the control group fe was mainly found in the residual fraction fig 4 a the addition of dwtr clearly increased the proportions of oxidizable fe by approximately 63 leading to fe being dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions in the dwtr group similar to the raw dwtr accounting for approximately 95 of the total fig s3 the addition of fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 remarkably decreased residual fe and increased acid soluble reducible and oxidizable fe proportions fig 4a indicating that the added fe remained largely in the acid soluble reducible and oxidizable fractions over the period of the experiment increasing algae concentrations had a limited effect on the distributions of fe in the control and dwtr groups in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups however the oxidizable fraction increased by approximately 15 sulfides in the sediments of the different groups were found mainly in the pyrite fraction fig 4b at low algae concentration the total sulfide concentrations were similar in different groups while at high algae concentration total sulfides clearly increased in particular the highest sulfides were observed in the fe2 so4 3 group which was followed by those of the fecl3 dwtr and control groups other sediment properties such as ph and total organic c are presented in table s6 4 discussion similar to previous studies kleeberg et al 2013 bakker et al 2015 increasing doc and decreasing ph and orp were found to increase fe mobility in the microcosm systems of this study table 1 the variations in doc ph and orp of overlying water figs 1g 1l and table 1 could be related to the release of organic acids and sulfoprotein during algal bloom sedimentation the decomposition of organic matter and the reduction of sulfates feng et al 2014 liu et al 2015 the relatively weak correlations between fe and sulfide concentration may be because fe in overlying water comes mainly from sediments while for sulfides algal blooms are also an important source in addition to sediments liu et al 2015 furthermore the transformations of soluble fe to solid fe may occur in the overlying water this inference could be supported by the temporary increase in solid fe at high algae concentration fig 1 the variations in overlying water properties were closely related to algae concentrations fig 1 however the observation of the negative orp the temporarily increased doc and the accumulated sulfides in the overlying water at high algae concentration figs 1g 1l demonstrated that the constructed microcosm systems at high algae concentration were mainly under the effect of a reducing environment organic matter and sulfides such an environment was beneficial to investigate the fe lability in different materials 4 1 the variations in fe stability fecl3 increased the concentrations of various forms of fe in the overlying water figs 1a 1f indicating the increased release of fe from the sediment with the addition of fecl3 as was discussed before in contrast to fecl3 fe2 so4 3 decreased various fe concentrations in the overlying water this decrease could be caused by the increased sulfide concentrations in the fe2 so4 3 group figs 1k and 1l discussions are presented in the next section the added fe from fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 at ph 7 table s2 was mainly in the form of hydroxides exafs analysis fig 2 and table 2 showed that in addition to fe oh 3 contents the contents of fe ha fes and fes2 also clearly increased in the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups compared to the control group this indicates that fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 promoted interactions between fe and organic matter or sulfides in the microcosm tests which indirectly demonstrated the transformations of soluble fe to solid fe in the overlying water these findings were consistent with fe and sulfide fractionation which suggested that increased algae concentrations promoted the formation of oxidizable fe and pyrite sulfides in the surface sediments of the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups fig 4 in fractionation methodology the oxidizable fraction commonly includes organic matter bound metals yuan et al 2004 therefore the lability of fe in fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 tended to increase in the microcosm tests nevertheless a substantial increase in the relative abundances proportions was only observed for fe ha in the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups this may be because the doc which is largely released during algal bloom sedimentation fig 1j promoted the interactions between the added fe and organic matter which may be stronger than those between sulfides and fe in the fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 groups this study also observed a higher relative abundance of fe ha in the fecl3 group compared to the fe2 so4 3 group as well as the highest concentrations of ferrous sulfides fes and fes2 in the fe2 so4 3 group table 2 and figs 2 and 4b such findings occurred because compared to fecl3 the added sulfates in fe2 so4 3 promoted sulfate reduction this resulted in relatively high concentrations of sulfides in the overlying water of the fe2 so4 3 group figs 1k and 1l which could compete with organic matter for fe enhancing the reactions between fe and sulfides and resulting in the lowest various fe concentrations in the overlying water in addition as anaerobic methylation of h2s can produce methyl thiols mtl higgins et al 2006 mtl in overlying water was also detected during the temporary increase of sulfides fig s4 the results indicated that fe2 so4 3 increased mtl production by approximately one order of magnitude which further demonstrated enhanced sulfate reduction the most important finding herein was that although the doses of fe in the dwtr were higher than those in fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 see section 2 2 the addition of dwtr had a limited effect on the variations in fe concentrations and other properties including orp doc ph sulfide concentrations and mtl concentration of the overlying water at low and high algae concentrations figs 1 and s4 the distribution of fe fractions in the sediment of the dwtr group showed little difference at different algae concentrations fig 4a these findings demonstrated the relatively stable nature of fe in the dwtr compared to that in fe2 so4 3 and fecl3 the potential release of organic matter and fe from dwtr has been reported in some studies oliver et al 2011 wang and jiang 2016 for example oliver et al 2011 reported the release of doc and fe from dwtr under anaerobic conditions these results which contradict the present study could have occurred because the doc and fe released from the dwtr were not sufficient to influence the migration and transformation of organic matter and fe in the microcosm herein the dwtr was heterogeneous as the fractionation results suggested that the various fractions of fe were distributed in the dwtr fig s3 nevertheless dwtr addition clearly increased oxidizable fe proportions in sediment by approximately 63 causing fe in the sediment of the dwtr group to be dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions approximately 95 of the total similar to the raw dwtr the distributions of fe fractions were stable at different algae concentrations after the tests indicating that the oxidizable and residual fractions could be the main reason leading to the relatively high stability of fe in the dwtr during the tests furthermore exafs analysis showed that substantially increased relative abundances by 32 3 compared to the control were only observed for fe ha in the sediment of the dwtr group in fact in addition to the oxidizable fraction the residual fraction is also partially composed of organic matter bound metals in fractionation methodology yuan et al 2004 the abovementioned results demonstrated that organic matter stabilized fe leading to relatively stable fe in the dwtr under the effect of organic matter and sulfides in anaerobic conditions in addition exafs analysis did not indicate any fepo4 in the dwtr group although the adsorption of p from the overlying water by the dwtr was observed during microcosm tests fig s5 it could be that a limited amount of p adsorbed by fe in the dwtr was presented as fepo4 due to the limited free state of fe in the dwtr fig s3 for phosphates precipitating in the overlying water for example the adsorbed p may have formed complexes of p fe ha as organic matter fe complexes were one of the dominant fe forms in dwtr but the complexes structures were in fe o coordination with relatively high disorder making them difficult to distinguish from fe ha during exafs analysis 4 2 the responses of microbial communities at low algae concentration the dominant genera 1 were the same across the different groups fig 3 while at high algae concentration the dominant genera in the different groups had some differences among the dominant genera at low algae concentration the genus gouta19 was potentially capable of organic matter degradation wang et al 2018 while desulfococcus was closely related to sulfate reducing processes yan et al 2020 at high algae concentration the genera bacteroides mohamed et al 2018 comamonas wu et al 2010 dok59 song et al 2020 flavobacterium kim and yu 2020 longilinea wu et al 2019 methanosarcina zheng et al 2017 and syntrophomonas yuan et al 2020 have been reported to have the potential capability to degrade organic matter the genus clostridium has the potential to reduce sulfates escoffier et al 2001 furthermore the genera bacteroides rocha and krykunivsky 2017 clostridium dobbin 1999 comamonas wu et al 2010 longilinea li et al 2019 methanosarcina zheng et al 2017 rhodanobacter ma et al 2019 syntrophomonas yuan et al 2020 thiobacillus zhang et al 2018 and thermomonas jensen and webb 1995 are closely related to fe metabolism such information suggested that the largely released doc from algae and the added fe promoted the enrichment of microorganisms potentially related to the migration and transformation of organic c and fe reducing microbial diversities table s5 in addition the genus clostridium enriched in the fe2 so4 3 group at high algae concentration indirectly suggested that sulfates in fe2 so4 3 promoted sulfate reduction rda analyses were performed to identify the relationships between fe species and the structures of microbial communities fig 5 based on the rda model 88 2 of the total variance could be explained by the first canonical axes for the dominant sequences at the genus level methanosarcina and syntrophomonas were positively correlated with fe ha fig 5a longilinea dok59 and thermomonas were positively correlated with fe3 aq and especially fe2o3 thiobacillus clostridium and bacteroides were positively correlated with fe oh 3 and especially fes2 and fes showed clear negative correlations with comamonas flavobacterium and rhodanobacter accordingly fe in the added materials led to variations in the microbial communities and the distributions of the microbial communities were closely related to various fe species further analysis fig 5b showed that the microbial communities were similar between the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and positively correlated with fe2o3 while the communities in the dwtr group were positively correlated with fe ha fig 5a these results suggested that fe2o3 in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fe ha in the dwtr group were the key species affecting the microbial communities in the microcosm ferric oxides have been widely found to be a major contributor to variations in microbial communities under various environmental conditions lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 considering that fe dominated as fe ha it was reasonable to understand that fe ha was one of the major fe species affecting microbial communities in the dwtr group the different effects of fe2o3 and fe ha on the microbial communities may result from their varied impacts on environmental conditions e g fig 1 zhang et al 2020 4 3 environmental applications as described in the introduction the high stability of fe was essential for fe based materials to control pollution according to the findings on the variations of overlying water properties and the distributions of fe in sediment determined by exafs analysis and fe fractionation this study provided direct evidence that the main factors affecting the lability of fe in fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 were organic matter sulfides and a reducing environment however the stabilizing effect of organic matter was found to be the main cause of the relatively high stability of fe in dwtr in fact the relationship between organic matter and fe was a specific focus of researchers when investigating organic matter stability in natural environments riedel et al 2013 several studies also found that the binding of aliphatic c reduced the reduction release of fe from hematite adhikari andyang 2015 organic matter in soil increased the stability of fe based colloids under anaerobic conditions yan et al 2016 accordingly the stabilizing effect of organic matter may be thought of as developing fe based materials to enhance fe stability for environmental remediation materials with relatively high fe stability have been developed for internal sediment p pollution control fuchs et al 2018 reasonably the applicability of fe based materials could be assessed based not only on fe stability but also on the capability for pollutant removal previous studies have fully demonstrated that compared to other p inactivating materials the characteristics of p adsorption by dwtr exhibit long term equilibrium adsorption wang et al 2016 in this study better p removal by dwtr was also observed at the latter stages of microcosm tests fig s5 the binding of organic matter on the one hand occurred at adsorption sites on fe based materials reducing the initial p adsorption capacity gerke 1993 on the other hand the complexes of organic matter and fe could reduce the long term aging effect of fe wang et al 2012b which is beneficial to the formation of abundant micropores and mesopores leading to long term p adsorption makris et al 2005 however the characteristics of the binding between organic matter and fe were closely related to the properties of organic matter riedel et al 2013 which could affect p adsorption and fe stability in the humic acid of the dwtr studied herein the total n and total c were 7 47 and 45 8 respectively please see supporting information and the structures of humic acid determined by ftir fig s6 were dominated by c h bending 868 cm 1 aliphatic c o 1028 cm 1 c o c stretching 1158 cm 1 c c or c o stretching 1604 cm 1 asymmetric c h stretching 2922 cm 1 and o h stretching 3280 cm 1 the findings on the varied effects of fe species on microbial communities also indicated the potential relevance of fe stability for microbial communities therefore the binding of organic matter and fe in association with the effect on fe stability p adsorption capability and microbial communities needs more in depth investigation for developing fe based materials in the future 5 conclusion this study aimed to gain insight into the lability of fe in dwtr compared to fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 the main conclusions are listed below 1 the variations in overlying water properties were closely related to algae concentrations increased fe liability was observed in fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 especially during algal bloom sedimentation at relatively high algae concentration fecl3 significantly increased various fe concentrations in the overlying water while fe2 so4 3 significantly promoted sulfide accumulation both materials enhanced the formation of fe ha and ferrous sulfides 2 relatively stable fe was observed in the dwtr the addition of dwtr had limited effects on various fe concentrations and other properties including orp doc ph sulfide concentrations and mtl concentration of the overlying water at different algae concentrations the addition of dwtr remarkably increased oxidizable fe in sediment causing fe to be dominated by oxidizable and residual fractions approximately 95 of the total exafs analysis also suggested that fe ha substantially increased with dwtr addition and became the main fe species in sediment the fe distributions were stable in sediment with dwtr addition indicating that organic matter stabilized fe in the dwtr 3 responses of microbial communities changed with the addition of different materials dwtr fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 promoted the enrichment of various microorganisms potentially related to fe metabolism fe2o3 in the fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 groups and fe ha in the dwtr group were the key species affecting the microbial communities in summary the stabilizing effect of organic matter could be used to develop fe based materials to enhance fe stability for environmental remediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
