5135,bangladesh one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change is threatened by sea level rise slr and land subsidence the tidal river management trm practised in coastal regions of bangladesh has the potential to raise the land by sedimentation to counteract slr and subsidence trm is an indigenous method in which dikes are breached to readmit sediment rich water into a polder which results in sediment being deposited in depressions in the polder called beels while simultaneously preventing silting up of the tidal rivers however after several years of continuous sedimentation from trm deposition has been uneven and less than expected to study the effectiveness of trm this research analyses different scenarios to identify which operation schemes most effectively trap sediment to raise the land surface the scenarios developed considered the number of inlets flow regulation through the beel using open inlets or gated inlets with different operation schemes and seasonality the study area was pakhimara beel in southwest bangladesh where trm is ongoing to simulate the scenarios a two dimensional 2d morphodynamic model with variable cell size was set up calibrated and used the simulation results were analysed for total sediment deposition uniformity of spatial distribution of sediment deposition and trapping efficiency sediment deposition shows clear seasonal variability with greatest deposition in the pre monsoon period less during monsoon and least in the dry season greatest deposition combined with high spatial uniformity was found for trm that uses two inlets located at opposite sides connected to different watercourses regulated flow using successively opened gates resulted in highest sediment deposition in all seasons about double that of the existing situation without gate however given the complexity and cost of gate operation trm with two inlets located at opposite sides of the beel without flow regulation may be considered more feasible and still effective despite 20 30 less sediment deposition to also increase acceptability by local affected stakeholders we propose to restrict this improved trm to the monsoon period to allow crops to be grown on the land in the dry and pre monsoon periods and ensure salinity is minimized such well planned trm has the potential to also counteract sea level rise in sinking deltas elsewhere in the world by enhancing sedimentation keywords sea level rise land subsidence tidal river management sediment deposition morphodynamic modelling 1 introduction bangladesh is one of the most natural disaster prone countries in the world ali et al 2012 according to the long term climate risk index it is the sixth most affected country worldwide kreft et al 2016 with cyclones floods and droughts occurring almost yearly ha and ahmad 2015 climate change will intensify and aggravate the situation in the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm delta of bangladesh even more as under the rcp representative concentration pathways 8 5 scenario the sea level rise slr for the coast of bangladesh is expected to increase to 0 3 m by 2050 relative to global mean sea level gmsl between 1986 and 2005 davis et al 2018 land subsidence rates of more than 5 mm year brown and nicholls 2015 for the coastal areas will further exacerbate the rate of relative slr the coastal zone of bangladesh has an area of about 47 201 km2 ahmad 2019 of which 62 is less than 3 m above msl mean sea level and 86 is less than 5 m above msl mohal et al 2006 the population in the coastal zone was 35 million in 2003 and is projected to have increased to 58 million by 2050 dasgupta et al 2014 relative slr will therefore directly affect tens of millions of people ericson et al 2005 by increasing flood risk intensifying saltwater intrusion and reducing agricultural production brown and nicholls 2015 in the coastal areas of bangladesh there are over 100 polders all created in the 1960s and 1970s ali 2002 with the primary objective of affording protection against tidal flooding mondal et al 2006 ishtiaque et al 2017 found that before the dikes enclosing the polders were built in the 196s the land in the southwest delta of bangladesh was subsiding by 5 7 mm year which was compensated by sedimentation during seasonal flooding of the delta plain since the 1960s the polders have lost up to 1 5 m elevation relative to the mean water level of the surrounding water bodies because the dikes have interrupted sediment accretion and subsidence has occurred auerbach et al 2015 in contrast the elevation in the southern sundarbans an area of unprotected mangrove forest kept up with the mean water level of the surrounding water bodies owing to sedimentation during tidal floods auerbach et al 2015 as dikes interrupt the natural tidal flow and associated overbank deposition the adjacent tidal rivers have silted up causing prolonged water logging and drainage congestion in the polders rashid et al 2013 due to the elevation loss of the polders and siltation of river channels the dikes have become increasingly prone to failure through breaching and overtopping ishtiaque et al 2017 in the lowest parts of the polders called beels surface runoff accumulates through the internal polder drainage channels chakraborty 2009 beels are formed by land erosion and subsidence and are located close to the river channels amir and khan 2019 they are commonly used for agriculture in the dry winter season and for aquaculture during the monsoon when they are flooded by surface runoff chakraborty 2009 dakatia beel northwest of khulna city is the largest beel in southwest bangladesh and is located in polder 25 fig 1 which was constructed in the 1960s van staveren et al 2017 it has faced severe water logging problems since 1982 a mass community mobilization in 1990 resulted in non authorized breaching of the dike of polder 25 to drain the water from inside the polder van staveren et al 2017 the breaching of the dike restored the tidal dynamics between the river and dakatia beel and increased the beel s surface elevation due to renewed sedimentation this event led to the introduction of the concept of tidal river management trm trm involves re opening the connection between the channel and its polder so called depoldering aiming at controlled flooding of polders to re establish sediment accretion auerbach et al 2015 since the rivers in the gbm delta carry more than a billion tons of sediment per year islam et al 1999 trm if implemented properly may have great potential to restore sediment accretion in the polders with trm the surface elevation will rise reducing the flood risks from slr and subsidence rogers and overeem 2017 accordingly the bangladesh water development board bwdb has initiated several trm projects van staveren et al 2017 depoldering and controlled flooding are not new concepts the netherlands the inspiration for the polders in the coastal areas of bangladesh has used depoldering in the room for the river project to facilitate river discharge for flood prevention van staveren et al 2014 van der deijl et al 2018 verschelling 2018 controlled flooding is also used in the mekong delta to reduce the peak discharge in the river and bring sediments and nutrients to the flood plain van staveren et al 2018 an additional benefit is that as a result of the controlled flooding pests and acid in the soils are flushed away kosmas 2014 as demonstrated by the higher food productivity and household income from livestock at former trm sites compared with elsewhere in the region masud and azad 2018 masud et al 2018 a remaining major challenge for trm is to ensure that the polder captures adequate amounts of sediment and the sediment is distributed evenly over the polder cf gain et al 2017 amir et al 2013 a recent survey conducted at pakhimara beel since 2015 an area in southwest bangladesh with active trm revealed that sedimentation mostly occurred close to the inlet iwm 2017 parts of a polder where less sediment accumulates will remain low and experience prolonged flooding during the monsoon the prolonged flooding and uneven sedimentation as well as the lack of alternative livelihoods lack of proper compensation and lack of participation of local residents during the flooding all challenge the effectiveness of trm de die 2013 to achieve a more uniform spreading of sediments inside a beel amir et al 2013 modelled the effects of compartmentalization of a beel with dikes and a gradual removal of the dikes along the connecting canal with unregulated flow additional canals were simulated that connect the beel with the adjacent river network in order to bring water containing suspended sediment into part of the beel further away from the inlet these simulated interventions showed positive results with elevation inside the beel rising more evenly however implementing this scenario would require large investment in compartmentalizing with dikes developing of connecting canals and modifying the dikes along the canal banks it would also require trm to operate continuously for at least 4 years the dependency of sedimentation inside the beel on inlet width and river discharge has been numerically simulated by talchabhadel et al 2017 varying the width of an inlet did not affect the amount of sediment deposition in a beel but more important controls for sedimentation were the angle of flow entering the beel and the water discharge into the beel talchabhadel et al 2016 using two inlets connected to the same river and located several kilometres apart did not increase the amounts of sediment deposition within a beel talchabhadel et al 2018 more generally sedimentation inside a beel was shown to depend on flow velocity particle size van rijn 1993 river discharge verschelling et al 2017 and location of the inlet talchabhadel et al 2017 in spite of these previous studies some critical controls of effectiveness of trm in a beel remain to be investigated these are the effect of using multiple inlets located in opposite corners of the beel and connected to different feeding channels that regulate the flow into and out of the beel by means of gates enlarged and uniform sedimentation combined with making land available during a part of the year may increase the effectiveness of trm and its acceptance by local residents our study therefore aimed to determine whether sediment accumulation in beels of the gbm delta can be optimized using multiple inlets and flow regulation using gates we investigated this for a beel in the southwest gbm delta where trm is currently ongoing using a 2d morphodynamic model to simulate sediment deposition as a function of number of inlets and flow regulation we analysed the effects of these scenarios on sediment deposition in the beel for different seasons to explore whether regulated flooding can be limited to a single season so that the land may be available for the rest of the year 2 study area pakhimara beel located in the southwest of bangladesh has been subjected to trm since 2015 gain et al 2017 and was selected as study area for this research pakhimara beel is under the administrative jurisdiction of tala upazila sub district within satkhira district which is located inside the khulna division in the southwestern region of bangladesh the study area stretches from 22 41 45 27 n 89 13 33 02 e to 22 39 33 93 n 89 15 16 64 e and covers 730 ha gain et al 2017 the river kobadak flows along the beel on the eastern side and a canal called sarulia shalikha khal flows along the western side of the area fig 1 at present pakhimara beel is connected to the kobadak river through an inlet and a connecting canal iwm 2017 the flow through the canal into the beel is not regulated by gates entire pakhimara beel is influenced by tidal cycles the sarulia shalikha khal meets the kobadak river about 10 km downstream of the beel fig 1 before trm started the mean elevation of pakhimara beel was 0 57 m pwd pwd is the datum for the public works department of bangladesh with the zero datum at 0 46 m below msl sarwar 2013 and the beel had an average slope of 0 2 survey conducted by iwm institute of water modelling iwm 2010 pakhimara beel is surrounded by dikes and a 1 5 km long connecting canal with maximum bottom width of 40 m was constructed for this trm project iwm 2010 2017 a cross dam on the kobadak river was constructed just upstream of the inlet of pakhimara beel to ensure that during the dry season and pre monsoon the tidal water flow coming from the south through the kobadak river enters the beel the cross dam was removed during monsoon to drain the flood water from upstream after 1 5 years of trm the land level of pakhimara beel was surveyed by iwm and compared with the pre trm situation which revealed uneven sedimentation and areas with less surface level increment iwm 2017 a land levelling survey by iwm and satellite images made during trm operation demonstrated that most of the suspended sediment entering the beel had settled close to the inlet and had not reached the other side of the beel consequently about 200 ha in the beel with least sediment deposition will remain flooded for a long time during the wet season even after trm has ended 3 methods 3 1 data collection data for understanding and developing of the present situation and for establishing the future scenarios were collected from secondary sources such as governmental and non governmental research organizations reports and published literature table 1 trm started officially in pakhimara beel in august 2015 gain et al 2017 at the inlet canal water level discharge and suspended sediment concentration ssc were recorded by iwm iwm 2017 iwm also carried out a land level survey of pakhimara beel after 1 5 years of trm operation to document the spatial distribution of sediment accumulation the average land level of the study area was 0 57 m pwd before trm and had increased to 1 17 m pwd after 1 5 years of trm although water level data were collected for most of the 1 5 years of trm operation at several locations fig 1 discharge and ssc were measured periodically on only a few days covering one complete tidal cycle 12 h for each day of measurement the water level discharge and ssc monitoring locations of iwm are presented in fig 1 for trm pakhimara beel was connected to the river via a connecting canal and a cross dam was constructed across the river just north of the inlet of the connecting canal to ensure that during high tide the incoming flow through the lower river channel from the coastal zone enters the beel iwm 2017 the connecting canal has a bottom width of 40 m at 1 1 m pwd and is 1 5 km long iwm 2010 the flow through the connecting canal inside the beel is not regulated by gates iwm 2017 flow regimes in bangladesh show seasonality in three periods ahmed et al 2016 pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to october and dry november to february the observed water levels indicated that the river s tidal range varies greatly between seasons average tidal ranges are 2 4 m during the pre monsoon 1 5 m during the monsoon and 2 m during the dry season the sscs measured at balia on kobadak river demonstrate that the ssc also varies with season average ssc is 0 84 kg m3 during the pre monsoon 0 58 kg m3 during the monsoon and 0 37 kg m3 during the dry season with the highest ssc occurring in april sscs were measured by iwm over a two week period to capture the effect of spring and neap tides the suspended sediments are cohesive with a median grain size less than 63 µm average salinity of the water inside pakhimara beel was 8 5 psu during the pre monsoon 1 7 psu during the monsoon and 5 1 psu during the dry season 3 2 setup of the 2d mathematical model a two dimensional 2d numerical morphodynamic model was set up for the study area using mike 21fm developed by dhi in which hydrodynamic processes sediment transport and changes in bed topology are simulated dynamically using a flexible mesh dhi 2012a 2012b mike 21fm uses an approximate riemann solver to calculate the convective fluxes at the interface of the cell of the 2d mesh for the calculation of cohesive sediment transport mike 21 fm uses mud transport mt module this module is used for transport of sediment with grain size less than 63 µm dhi 2012b it uses the advection dispersion equation ade which is solved using the third order finite difference scheme known as the ultimate scheme based on quickest dhi 2012b for morphological simulations the bed topography is updated for each time step by taking account of net sedimentation dhi 2012b a 2d model with the bed topography of pakhimara beel was setup in mike 21fm where the 2d cells are triangular the surface area of the mesh cells varied from 170 5 m2 to 5000 m2 to reduce computational costs finer mesh was used to represent the inlet canal and coarser mesh was used for the floodplain fig 2 as the grain size of the sediment conveyed into the beel is less than 63 µm iwm 2010 the mt module for cohesive sediment transport was used as the mathematical modelling tool settling and re entrainment of fine sediments are simulated using the concepts of krone 1962 and depend on the ratio between actual shear stress of the flow and critical shear stress for deposition and re entrainment of sediment particles the model setup was used for simulating the period for which data were available table 1 the manning coefficient sediment settling velocity and critical shear stress for settling were determined by calibration from the available data table 1 three consecutive 14 day periods were selected representing pre monsoon april monsoon august and dry february seasons for these three periods measured hourly water levels and ssc at the balia measurment point fig 1 were used as input for the model to determine sediment deposition during each of the main hydrological seasons after calibration the model was used for different scenarios to study the sediment dynamics inside the beel and to identify the scenario with maximum sedimentation maximum trapping efficiency and most spatially uniform sediment distribution 3 3 sensitivity analysis and model calibration a sensitivity analysis was carried out to understand how different parameters affect the model results for the hydrodynamic module the sensitivity of discharge and water level to varying roughness coefficient manning coefficient was investigated the hydrodynamic model was simulated by varying the manning coefficient within the range of 0 1 s m1 3 to 0 01 s m1 3 for the morphodynamic module the effects of varying critical shear stress and the settling velocity on the suspended load were determined the critical shear stress for settling was varied from 0 01 n m2 to 0 1 n m2 and settling velocity was varied from 0 0001 m s to 0 001 m s these ranges were selected considering the values presented by barua et al 1994 for the sediments in the meghna estuary the model was calibrated for the present day situation by comparing observed water levels discharge and ssc at the connecting canal to the beel and water levels inside the beel calibration locations in fig 1 to simulated values by the model this was complemented by visual comparison of patterns observed in field surveys iwm 2017 with those generated by the model due to the lack of available observation data no further validation of the model could be performed to quantify the model performance the coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse percentage model bias pb and nash sutcliffe model efficiency me were calculated by comparing the modelled results with the field data for the different variables table 2 and observed vs modelled data were plotted fig 3 the calculated goodness of fit and the plots of observed vs modelled data for the developed model indicate that the calibrated model resulted in good agreement between the observed and simulated data allen et al 2007 and therefore the calibrated model was subsequently used to simulate sediment deposition in the beel for the scenarios 3 4 development of scenarios 21 scenarios were developed to determine how the sediment dynamics inside pakhimara beel depend on the number of inlets one or two the control of water flow and the amount of suspended sediment entering the beel this was investigated for the three main hydrological seasons the scenario matrix developed considering the combination of the different conditions is presented in table 3 we considered the situation with a single inlet at the existing location or at a new location the new inlet was positioned at the opposite side of pakhimara beel farthest away from the existing inlet fig 1 adjacent to the river network with no connecting canal the dimensions of the new inlet were the same as those of the existing inlet moreover the same time series data of water level discharge and ssc was applied for both inlets for the existing inlet a canal 1 5 km long into the beel was assumed to represent the actual situation we also considered a situation with these two inlets working in combination we analysed the regulation of opening of the inlets by assuming there were gates in the inlets and that these remain open for 12 h to allow sediment rich water to flow into the beel and are then closed during the next 12 h so that during the 12 h that the floodwater remains stagnant in the beel the sediment can settle two gate operation schemes were utilized for the scenarios with two inlets simultaneous and successive for simultaneous gate operation the gates were opened and closed simultaneously at both inlets fig 4 for the successive gate operation of two inlets first one gate was opened to admit inflow and then closed to retain the water and later the other gate was opened to release the water fig 5 allowing inflow through one inlet and releasing through the other was done to ensure through flow across pakhimara beel for both situations the water was retained for 12 h in the beel before it was released fig 5 as gates are operated manually in bangladesh in the simulations it was assumed that the opening and closing of the gate requires 1 h 3 5 analysis of the results the existing operation of the trm for pakhimara beel was simulated to calibrate the model further the model results were analysed for different scenarios and compared in terms of i the total mass of sedimentation for the seasons ii trapping efficiency iii the spatial distribution of sediments and iv uniformity of sedimentation sediment deposition for different seasons was estimated using the results of the representative 14 days of simulation and extrapolated for the total number of days in a season trapping efficiency was calculated as the fraction of the incoming suspended sediment that is retained or deposited within the beel cf verschelling et al 2017 the spatial distribution was evaluated using maps of sediment deposition spatial uniformity of sedimentation was analysed by plotting sediment deposition against cumulative percentage of total area covered 4 results 4 1 sensitivity and calibration of the model the sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying the roughness coefficient critical shear stress and settling velocity discharge and water level are clearly affected by the roughness coefficient manning coefficient fig 6 the sscs show little variation for varying critical shear stress fig 7 a but show a stronger dependency on settling velocity fig 7b the best model performance was obtained for a manning coefficient equal to 0 04 s m1 3 and settling velocity equal to 0 05 cm s the manning coefficient used is consistent with the value suggested by talchabhadel et al 2018 for khuksia beel which is adjacent to our study area and the settling velocity used is within the range suggested by hale et al 2019 for the southern gbm delta subsequent model simulations were done using these parameter settings with 10 change in the calibrated value of the manning coefficient the ranges of calculated r2 were 0 57 to 0 63 for water level 0 56 to 0 62 for discharge and 0 75 to 0 78 for ssc with 10 change in the calibrated value of the settling velocity the ranges of r2 were 0 78 to 0 80 for water level 0 77 to 0 79 for discharge and 0 57 to 0 65 for ssc 4 2 sediment deposition the simulated sediment deposition in the beel for different seasons shows clear seasonal variability with the greatest deposition in the pre monsoon period and the least in the dry season fig 8 a simulated total sediment deposition for the pre monsoon scenarios is 20 to 30 more than for the monsoon scenarios in the scenario of two inlets with successive gate operation sediment deposition is about double that of the existing situation without gate for all three seasons fig 8 the location of the inlet does not affect total sediment deposition sediment deposition increases with two inlets regardless of flow regulation with gates however flow regulation results in more sediment deposition with most deposition occurring when using two inlets with successive gates two inlets without gates and simultaneous gates result in similar estimated sediment deposition 4 3 trapping efficiency to understand the differences in potential of sediment deposition among the scenarios trapping efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the amount of sediment retained by the beel over the suspended sediment load delivered into the beel fig 8b calculated trapping efficiency indicates that for the scenarios with flow regulation using gates only 7 23 of the suspended sediment entering the beel is retained the highest value 23 2 is found for the scenario using two inlets with simultaneous gate operation during the dry season using one or two inlets without gates does not affect trapping efficiency but flow regulation increases the trapping efficiency substantially gate operation also affects the trapping efficiency with the simultaneous gate operation scenario resulting in higher efficiency than the scenario with successively opening the gates 4 4 spatial distribution of sediment deposition the spatial variation in simulated sediment deposition for the monsoon scenarios is illustrated in fig 9 sediment deposition occurs in about two thirds of the beel when a single inlet is used regardless of its location or whether flow is regulated when using two inlets sedimentation occurs over the entire pakhimara beel for the two inlet situation flow regulation using gates leads to more sediment deposition fig 8a with a similar extent of sedimentation fig 9 the plot of sediment deposition against cumulative percent area indicates that with a single inlet about 30 of the total area experiences no or little sediment deposition regardless of the inlet position or the flow regulation using gates fig 10 for two inlets about 5 of total area experiences no or little sediment deposition and sediment deposition increases and almost doubles by comparison with the situation with a single inlet fig 8a remarkably applying two inlets with successive gates increases total sediment deposition fig 8a but the spatial uniformity decreases fig 10 two inlets without gates and with simultaneous gates result in similarly uniform sediment accumulation 5 discussion this research explored how to optimize trm to improve its efficiency in trapping sediment a calibrated 2d morphodynamic model was used to simulate multiple scenarios considering the seasonality number of inlets non regulated and regulated flow using gates and different operating regimes for the gates our model results show that there is a strong seasonality in sediment deposition with the greatest deposition occurring during pre monsoon fig 8a this is related to the seasonal variation of the discharge and the ssc of the kodabak river at the inlet which is in accordance with the findings of talchabhadel et al 2016 the tidal range and the ssc in the rivers are highest during the pre monsoon resulting in the water that enters the beel being more sediment rich although the ssc is lower in the monsoon than pre monsoon the total sediment load in the river and into the beel is higher this is due to highest discharge and water level and relatively high ssc in the river during monsoon season however due to tidal range being less in the monsoon than in the pre monsoon season the daily amounts of water and sediment entering the beel were are during the monsoon than during the pre monsoon and therefore sediment deposition in the beel is greatest during pre monsoon the number and location of inlets and the water body that feeds them play a critical role in sediment deposition inside the beel both amir et al 2013 and talchabhadel et al 2018 have indicated that multiple inlets connected to the same river do not substantially increase the sedimentation inside the beel amir et al 2013 show that multiple inlets connected to the same river resulted in a more uniform spatial distribution of sedimentation even though total sedimentation was not substantially higher talchabhadel et al 2018 suggest exploring whether an additional inlet close to the zone of the lowest sedimentation inside the beel would achieve more sediment deposition and a more uniform spatial distribution of deposition our results confirm that using two inlets located at opposite sides of the beel and connected to different watercourses increases both the total sediment deposition fig 8a and the spatial uniformity of sediment deposition fig 9 and fig 10 with a single inlet suspended sediment from the river cannot reach the areas far from the inlet during a tidal cycle our results show that flow regulation into the beel with gates can increase total sediment deposition fig 8a as long as flow velocities and inherent shear stresses in the flow exceed the critical values for deposition the sediment particles will remain in suspension unal 2018 when shear stress decreases as a result of decreasing flow velocity mehta 1988 deposition will start to occur unal 2018 this is particularly the case in the scenarios with gate operation that causes the floodwater to stagnate for 12 h in the beel resulting in high trapping efficiency fig 8b in contrast with two inlets and unregulated flow the water inside the beel is constantly moving with the tides rendering trapping efficiency low still as gates prevent flow from the river from entering the beel for 12 h in cyclic order the total sediment load delivered inside the beel becomes lower than when flow is unregulated the resulting total deposition for two inlets with unregulated flow is roughly the same as that for two inlets with regulated flow with gates operated simultaneously the scenario of two inlets where flow is regulated with successive gate operation results in the lowest average velocity and consequently the greatest total deposition for the successive gate operation schemes the suspended sediment rich water enters through one inlet gate and after a 12 hour period of water stagnancy to allow the sediment to settle the water drains through the other gate it seems that the flow velocities during the drainage stage of the beel are too low for deposited sediment to be resuspended resulting in large sediment deposition however constructing gates is resource intensive and the gates require regular maintenance constructing gates for an inlet 40 m wide may cost over 1 million euros assuming the rates paid for construction work in government of bangladesh development projects gob 2005 ensuring that regular maintenance is carried out may also prove difficult as during the field visits several existing gates were found non operational or in need of maintenance verschelling et al 2017 explored the effect of different variables such as inlet discharge wind speed and direction on the trapping efficiency of a depoldered area similar to a beel with unregulated flow they found that the sediment trapping efficiency in their study area depended largely on the inlet discharge their study indicated that larger inlet discharge results in increase of total amount of sediment retained and reduction in trapping efficiency the larger inlet discharge corresponds to increased influx of sediment and more sedimentation on the tidal flats however the increase of shear stress during high discharge events cause most of the fine sediments to stay in suspension and result in reduction of trapping efficiency in our study area inlet discharge varies seasonally accordingly trapping efficiency from our model results also shows considerable seasonal differences generally ranging from 5 to 15 and with the highest value of 23 for two inlets with simultaneous gates during the dry season fig 8b under current trm practice the flooding of land occurs for several years which dramatically restricts the livelihoods and economic activities of the local people seasonal operation of trm with flow regulation by gates would provide the opportunity to flood the land for only part of the year making the land available for agriculture during the rest of the year although pre monsoonal trm would yield the most sediment deposition monsoonal trm would minimize the salinity of inflowing water and sediment which would have positive effects on crop production sediment deposition would still be high and only 20 30 less than during the pre monsoon making the land available for crop production in the dry and pre monsoon period october to may would greatly enlarge the effectiveness of trm seasonal trm operation was already being practised in the pre polder era in the southwest region referred to as ostomasi badh van staveren et al 2017 data collected throughout the year especially while the trm was ongoing would have provided essential information on the impact of trm on the river and the beel nevertheless our model simulations provide a first understanding of this process and its impacts all the simulations in this research were done for 14 consecutive days covering spring and neap tides furthermore taking 14 day time windows representing different seasons allowed us to quantify and understand seasonality effects in reality sediment deposition will also vary during the seasons along with the variations in ssc and river flow if long term data become available the simulation should be done for at least an entire year the analysis of the reliability of model results revealed that the model was able to replicate the existing conditions fairly well table 2 as the results indicate that the tidal range plays a vital role in sediment dynamics the next step should be to explore more areas closer to the sea as well as inland to study the effects on sediment deposition in beels and as the ssc is an important variable it is essential to further explore the sediment dynamics in the river in relation to seasonality and sediment availability finally it should be investigated to what extent reintroducing of sediment trapping in de poldered areas of the lower gmb delta would affect sediment loads and further silting up of the lower delta river channels converting the simulated amounts of deposition during pre monsoon season to estimates of increase in land elevation thereby assuming an effective soil density of 1300 kg m3 the re introduction of sediment deposition in this beel would result in a rise of the landsurface in the order of 18 mm and 20 mm per year for the scenarios of single inlet without and with flow regulation using gate and 28 mm yr for the scenarios of two inlets without flow regulation 28 mm yr and 31 mm yr for two inlets with simultaneous and successive gate operation these values are about two times for the scenarios of single inlet to three times for the scenarios of two inlets as high as the relative sea level rise considering the yearly rates of subsidence brown and nicholls 2015 and sea level rise davis et al 2018 this implies that seasonal operation of trm indeed may be an efficient strategy to raise the polder land surface to counteract relative sea level rise 6 conclusion to identify the options for improved trm in de poldered floodplain areas in the lower ganges delta in bangladesh we investigated the effect of inlet regulation to enhance sediment trapping in a polder depression a beel our numerical model simulations based on pakhimara beel exploring different scenarios of gate operation and carried out for different hydrological seasons indicate that the amounts and spatial variation of sediment deposition in a beel may differ widely depending on the number of inlets and the flow regulation scheme applied to the beel regulated flow increases sediment trapping efficiency by about 10 leading to larger total sediment deposition inside the beel by about 18 two inlets located at opposite sides of the beel and connected to different watercourses substantially increase both the spatial uniformity of sedimentation by about 30 and the total sediment deposition by about 50 compared to the scenario with one inlet using two inlets with successive gate operation which ensures flow through the beel and provides sufficient time for the sediment to settle further increases total sediment deposition by 25 sediment deposition varies seasonally with the pre monsoon period yielding the highest deposition because the ssc in the river is high and there is large inflow of water and sediment into the beel as the tidal range is high trm during the monsoon period results in 20 to 30 less sediment deposition than during the pre monsoon but has the advantage that the incoming floodwater is much less saline 1 7 psu instead of 8 5 psu during pre monsoon the land level increase as a result of estimated sediment accumulation during pre monsoon season is in the order of 20 mm for single inlet and 30 mm for two inlets which is two to three times as high as than the rate of yearly relative sea level rise up to the year 2050 during monsoon these values are about 5 mm lower but still higher than relative sea level rise our results suggest that using two openings whether with or without flow regulation through gates results in more enhanced total sediment deposition and uniformity of spatial distribution of sediment deposition than is achieved with current practice given the complexity and cost of gate operation the most feasible trm is to have two inlets at opposite sides of the beel without flow regulation even though flow regulation with successive gate operation yields higher sediment deposition moreover we propose trm operation only during the monsoon which is when the river water is least saline thereby leaving the land available during the rest of the year thus enhancing trm acceptability by local stakeholders although the results indicate that flow regulation is advantageous it demands costly maintenance and operation of regulation structures nevertheless as gates also may provide protection against flood hazards and can regulate flow if required it is recommended that inlets include gates and the gates are maintained and operated properly thus well planned effective and stakeholder acceptable e g seasonal operation of trm with efficient sediment trapping and uniform spatial distribution as presented in this study has the potential of counteracting relative sea level rise through raising the land by re introcuding sedimentation this may be not only the case for the lower gmb delta but might support the sinking deltas around the world to counteract slr and land subsidence by utilizing the sediments delivered naturally by the rivers or from the estuary and sea author contributions all the authors contributed to the conceptualization development of methodology writing and editing of the manuscript md feroz islam carried out the model

5135,bangladesh one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change is threatened by sea level rise slr and land subsidence the tidal river management trm practised in coastal regions of bangladesh has the potential to raise the land by sedimentation to counteract slr and subsidence trm is an indigenous method in which dikes are breached to readmit sediment rich water into a polder which results in sediment being deposited in depressions in the polder called beels while simultaneously preventing silting up of the tidal rivers however after several years of continuous sedimentation from trm deposition has been uneven and less than expected to study the effectiveness of trm this research analyses different scenarios to identify which operation schemes most effectively trap sediment to raise the land surface the scenarios developed considered the number of inlets flow regulation through the beel using open inlets or gated inlets with different operation schemes and seasonality the study area was pakhimara beel in southwest bangladesh where trm is ongoing to simulate the scenarios a two dimensional 2d morphodynamic model with variable cell size was set up calibrated and used the simulation results were analysed for total sediment deposition uniformity of spatial distribution of sediment deposition and trapping efficiency sediment deposition shows clear seasonal variability with greatest deposition in the pre monsoon period less during monsoon and least in the dry season greatest deposition combined with high spatial uniformity was found for trm that uses two inlets located at opposite sides connected to different watercourses regulated flow using successively opened gates resulted in highest sediment deposition in all seasons about double that of the existing situation without gate however given the complexity and cost of gate operation trm with two inlets located at opposite sides of the beel without flow regulation may be considered more feasible and still effective despite 20 30 less sediment deposition to also increase acceptability by local affected stakeholders we propose to restrict this improved trm to the monsoon period to allow crops to be grown on the land in the dry and pre monsoon periods and ensure salinity is minimized such well planned trm has the potential to also counteract sea level rise in sinking deltas elsewhere in the world by enhancing sedimentation keywords sea level rise land subsidence tidal river management sediment deposition morphodynamic modelling 1 introduction bangladesh is one of the most natural disaster prone countries in the world ali et al 2012 according to the long term climate risk index it is the sixth most affected country worldwide kreft et al 2016 with cyclones floods and droughts occurring almost yearly ha and ahmad 2015 climate change will intensify and aggravate the situation in the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm delta of bangladesh even more as under the rcp representative concentration pathways 8 5 scenario the sea level rise slr for the coast of bangladesh is expected to increase to 0 3 m by 2050 relative to global mean sea level gmsl between 1986 and 2005 davis et al 2018 land subsidence rates of more than 5 mm year brown and nicholls 2015 for the coastal areas will further exacerbate the rate of relative slr the coastal zone of bangladesh has an area of about 47 201 km2 ahmad 2019 of which 62 is less than 3 m above msl mean sea level and 86 is less than 5 m above msl mohal et al 2006 the population in the coastal zone was 35 million in 2003 and is projected to have increased to 58 million by 2050 dasgupta et al 2014 relative slr will therefore directly affect tens of millions of people ericson et al 2005 by increasing flood risk intensifying saltwater intrusion and reducing agricultural production brown and nicholls 2015 in the coastal areas of bangladesh there are over 100 polders all created in the 1960s and 1970s ali 2002 with the primary objective of affording protection against tidal flooding mondal et al 2006 ishtiaque et al 2017 found that before the dikes enclosing the polders were built in the 196s the land in the southwest delta of bangladesh was subsiding by 5 7 mm year which was compensated by sedimentation during seasonal flooding of the delta plain since the 1960s the polders have lost up to 1 5 m elevation relative to the mean water level of the surrounding water bodies because the dikes have interrupted sediment accretion and subsidence has occurred auerbach et al 2015 in contrast the elevation in the southern sundarbans an area of unprotected mangrove forest kept up with the mean water level of the surrounding water bodies owing to sedimentation during tidal floods auerbach et al 2015 as dikes interrupt the natural tidal flow and associated overbank deposition the adjacent tidal rivers have silted up causing prolonged water logging and drainage congestion in the polders rashid et al 2013 due to the elevation loss of the polders and siltation of river channels the dikes have become increasingly prone to failure through breaching and overtopping ishtiaque et al 2017 in the lowest parts of the polders called beels surface runoff accumulates through the internal polder drainage channels chakraborty 2009 beels are formed by land erosion and subsidence and are located close to the river channels amir and khan 2019 they are commonly used for agriculture in the dry winter season and for aquaculture during the monsoon when they are flooded by surface runoff chakraborty 2009 dakatia beel northwest of khulna city is the largest beel in southwest bangladesh and is located in polder 25 fig 1 which was constructed in the 1960s van staveren et al 2017 it has faced severe water logging problems since 1982 a mass community mobilization in 1990 resulted in non authorized breaching of the dike of polder 25 to drain the water from inside the polder van staveren et al 2017 the breaching of the dike restored the tidal dynamics between the river and dakatia beel and increased the beel s surface elevation due to renewed sedimentation this event led to the introduction of the concept of tidal river management trm trm involves re opening the connection between the channel and its polder so called depoldering aiming at controlled flooding of polders to re establish sediment accretion auerbach et al 2015 since the rivers in the gbm delta carry more than a billion tons of sediment per year islam et al 1999 trm if implemented properly may have great potential to restore sediment accretion in the polders with trm the surface elevation will rise reducing the flood risks from slr and subsidence rogers and overeem 2017 accordingly the bangladesh water development board bwdb has initiated several trm projects van staveren et al 2017 depoldering and controlled flooding are not new concepts the netherlands the inspiration for the polders in the coastal areas of bangladesh has used depoldering in the room for the river project to facilitate river discharge for flood prevention van staveren et al 2014 van der deijl et al 2018 verschelling 2018 controlled flooding is also used in the mekong delta to reduce the peak discharge in the river and bring sediments and nutrients to the flood plain van staveren et al 2018 an additional benefit is that as a result of the controlled flooding pests and acid in the soils are flushed away kosmas 2014 as demonstrated by the higher food productivity and household income from livestock at former trm sites compared with elsewhere in the region masud and azad 2018 masud et al 2018 a remaining major challenge for trm is to ensure that the polder captures adequate amounts of sediment and the sediment is distributed evenly over the polder cf gain et al 2017 amir et al 2013 a recent survey conducted at pakhimara beel since 2015 an area in southwest bangladesh with active trm revealed that sedimentation mostly occurred close to the inlet iwm 2017 parts of a polder where less sediment accumulates will remain low and experience prolonged flooding during the monsoon the prolonged flooding and uneven sedimentation as well as the lack of alternative livelihoods lack of proper compensation and lack of participation of local residents during the flooding all challenge the effectiveness of trm de die 2013 to achieve a more uniform spreading of sediments inside a beel amir et al 2013 modelled the effects of compartmentalization of a beel with dikes and a gradual removal of the dikes along the connecting canal with unregulated flow additional canals were simulated that connect the beel with the adjacent river network in order to bring water containing suspended sediment into part of the beel further away from the inlet these simulated interventions showed positive results with elevation inside the beel rising more evenly however implementing this scenario would require large investment in compartmentalizing with dikes developing of connecting canals and modifying the dikes along the canal banks it would also require trm to operate continuously for at least 4 years the dependency of sedimentation inside the beel on inlet width and river discharge has been numerically simulated by talchabhadel et al 2017 varying the width of an inlet did not affect the amount of sediment deposition in a beel but more important controls for sedimentation were the angle of flow entering the beel and the water discharge into the beel talchabhadel et al 2016 using two inlets connected to the same river and located several kilometres apart did not increase the amounts of sediment deposition within a beel talchabhadel et al 2018 more generally sedimentation inside a beel was shown to depend on flow velocity particle size van rijn 1993 river discharge verschelling et al 2017 and location of the inlet talchabhadel et al 2017 in spite of these previous studies some critical controls of effectiveness of trm in a beel remain to be investigated these are the effect of using multiple inlets located in opposite corners of the beel and connected to different feeding channels that regulate the flow into and out of the beel by means of gates enlarged and uniform sedimentation combined with making land available during a part of the year may increase the effectiveness of trm and its acceptance by local residents our study therefore aimed to determine whether sediment accumulation in beels of the gbm delta can be optimized using multiple inlets and flow regulation using gates we investigated this for a beel in the southwest gbm delta where trm is currently ongoing using a 2d morphodynamic model to simulate sediment deposition as a function of number of inlets and flow regulation we analysed the effects of these scenarios on sediment deposition in the beel for different seasons to explore whether regulated flooding can be limited to a single season so that the land may be available for the rest of the year 2 study area pakhimara beel located in the southwest of bangladesh has been subjected to trm since 2015 gain et al 2017 and was selected as study area for this research pakhimara beel is under the administrative jurisdiction of tala upazila sub district within satkhira district which is located inside the khulna division in the southwestern region of bangladesh the study area stretches from 22 41 45 27 n 89 13 33 02 e to 22 39 33 93 n 89 15 16 64 e and covers 730 ha gain et al 2017 the river kobadak flows along the beel on the eastern side and a canal called sarulia shalikha khal flows along the western side of the area fig 1 at present pakhimara beel is connected to the kobadak river through an inlet and a connecting canal iwm 2017 the flow through the canal into the beel is not regulated by gates entire pakhimara beel is influenced by tidal cycles the sarulia shalikha khal meets the kobadak river about 10 km downstream of the beel fig 1 before trm started the mean elevation of pakhimara beel was 0 57 m pwd pwd is the datum for the public works department of bangladesh with the zero datum at 0 46 m below msl sarwar 2013 and the beel had an average slope of 0 2 survey conducted by iwm institute of water modelling iwm 2010 pakhimara beel is surrounded by dikes and a 1 5 km long connecting canal with maximum bottom width of 40 m was constructed for this trm project iwm 2010 2017 a cross dam on the kobadak river was constructed just upstream of the inlet of pakhimara beel to ensure that during the dry season and pre monsoon the tidal water flow coming from the south through the kobadak river enters the beel the cross dam was removed during monsoon to drain the flood water from upstream after 1 5 years of trm the land level of pakhimara beel was surveyed by iwm and compared with the pre trm situation which revealed uneven sedimentation and areas with less surface level increment iwm 2017 a land levelling survey by iwm and satellite images made during trm operation demonstrated that most of the suspended sediment entering the beel had settled close to the inlet and had not reached the other side of the beel consequently about 200 ha in the beel with least sediment deposition will remain flooded for a long time during the wet season even after trm has ended 3 methods 3 1 data collection data for understanding and developing of the present situation and for establishing the future scenarios were collected from secondary sources such as governmental and non governmental research organizations reports and published literature table 1 trm started officially in pakhimara beel in august 2015 gain et al 2017 at the inlet canal water level discharge and suspended sediment concentration ssc were recorded by iwm iwm 2017 iwm also carried out a land level survey of pakhimara beel after 1 5 years of trm operation to document the spatial distribution of sediment accumulation the average land level of the study area was 0 57 m pwd before trm and had increased to 1 17 m pwd after 1 5 years of trm although water level data were collected for most of the 1 5 years of trm operation at several locations fig 1 discharge and ssc were measured periodically on only a few days covering one complete tidal cycle 12 h for each day of measurement the water level discharge and ssc monitoring locations of iwm are presented in fig 1 for trm pakhimara beel was connected to the river via a connecting canal and a cross dam was constructed across the river just north of the inlet of the connecting canal to ensure that during high tide the incoming flow through the lower river channel from the coastal zone enters the beel iwm 2017 the connecting canal has a bottom width of 40 m at 1 1 m pwd and is 1 5 km long iwm 2010 the flow through the connecting canal inside the beel is not regulated by gates iwm 2017 flow regimes in bangladesh show seasonality in three periods ahmed et al 2016 pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to october and dry november to february the observed water levels indicated that the river s tidal range varies greatly between seasons average tidal ranges are 2 4 m during the pre monsoon 1 5 m during the monsoon and 2 m during the dry season the sscs measured at balia on kobadak river demonstrate that the ssc also varies with season average ssc is 0 84 kg m3 during the pre monsoon 0 58 kg m3 during the monsoon and 0 37 kg m3 during the dry season with the highest ssc occurring in april sscs were measured by iwm over a two week period to capture the effect of spring and neap tides the suspended sediments are cohesive with a median grain size less than 63 µm average salinity of the water inside pakhimara beel was 8 5 psu during the pre monsoon 1 7 psu during the monsoon and 5 1 psu during the dry season 3 2 setup of the 2d mathematical model a two dimensional 2d numerical morphodynamic model was set up for the study area using mike 21fm developed by dhi in which hydrodynamic processes sediment transport and changes in bed topology are simulated dynamically using a flexible mesh dhi 2012a 2012b mike 21fm uses an approximate riemann solver to calculate the convective fluxes at the interface of the cell of the 2d mesh for the calculation of cohesive sediment transport mike 21 fm uses mud transport mt module this module is used for transport of sediment with grain size less than 63 µm dhi 2012b it uses the advection dispersion equation ade which is solved using the third order finite difference scheme known as the ultimate scheme based on quickest dhi 2012b for morphological simulations the bed topography is updated for each time step by taking account of net sedimentation dhi 2012b a 2d model with the bed topography of pakhimara beel was setup in mike 21fm where the 2d cells are triangular the surface area of the mesh cells varied from 170 5 m2 to 5000 m2 to reduce computational costs finer mesh was used to represent the inlet canal and coarser mesh was used for the floodplain fig 2 as the grain size of the sediment conveyed into the beel is less than 63 µm iwm 2010 the mt module for cohesive sediment transport was used as the mathematical modelling tool settling and re entrainment of fine sediments are simulated using the concepts of krone 1962 and depend on the ratio between actual shear stress of the flow and critical shear stress for deposition and re entrainment of sediment particles the model setup was used for simulating the period for which data were available table 1 the manning coefficient sediment settling velocity and critical shear stress for settling were determined by calibration from the available data table 1 three consecutive 14 day periods were selected representing pre monsoon april monsoon august and dry february seasons for these three periods measured hourly water levels and ssc at the balia measurment point fig 1 were used as input for the model to determine sediment deposition during each of the main hydrological seasons after calibration the model was used for different scenarios to study the sediment dynamics inside the beel and to identify the scenario with maximum sedimentation maximum trapping efficiency and most spatially uniform sediment distribution 3 3 sensitivity analysis and model calibration a sensitivity analysis was carried out to understand how different parameters affect the model results for the hydrodynamic module the sensitivity of discharge and water level to varying roughness coefficient manning coefficient was investigated the hydrodynamic model was simulated by varying the manning coefficient within the range of 0 1 s m1 3 to 0 01 s m1 3 for the morphodynamic module the effects of varying critical shear stress and the settling velocity on the suspended load were determined the critical shear stress for settling was varied from 0 01 n m2 to 0 1 n m2 and settling velocity was varied from 0 0001 m s to 0 001 m s these ranges were selected considering the values presented by barua et al 1994 for the sediments in the meghna estuary the model was calibrated for the present day situation by comparing observed water levels discharge and ssc at the connecting canal to the beel and water levels inside the beel calibration locations in fig 1 to simulated values by the model this was complemented by visual comparison of patterns observed in field surveys iwm 2017 with those generated by the model due to the lack of available observation data no further validation of the model could be performed to quantify the model performance the coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse percentage model bias pb and nash sutcliffe model efficiency me were calculated by comparing the modelled results with the field data for the different variables table 2 and observed vs modelled data were plotted fig 3 the calculated goodness of fit and the plots of observed vs modelled data for the developed model indicate that the calibrated model resulted in good agreement between the observed and simulated data allen et al 2007 and therefore the calibrated model was subsequently used to simulate sediment deposition in the beel for the scenarios 3 4 development of scenarios 21 scenarios were developed to determine how the sediment dynamics inside pakhimara beel depend on the number of inlets one or two the control of water flow and the amount of suspended sediment entering the beel this was investigated for the three main hydrological seasons the scenario matrix developed considering the combination of the different conditions is presented in table 3 we considered the situation with a single inlet at the existing location or at a new location the new inlet was positioned at the opposite side of pakhimara beel farthest away from the existing inlet fig 1 adjacent to the river network with no connecting canal the dimensions of the new inlet were the same as those of the existing inlet moreover the same time series data of water level discharge and ssc was applied for both inlets for the existing inlet a canal 1 5 km long into the beel was assumed to represent the actual situation we also considered a situation with these two inlets working in combination we analysed the regulation of opening of the inlets by assuming there were gates in the inlets and that these remain open for 12 h to allow sediment rich water to flow into the beel and are then closed during the next 12 h so that during the 12 h that the floodwater remains stagnant in the beel the sediment can settle two gate operation schemes were utilized for the scenarios with two inlets simultaneous and successive for simultaneous gate operation the gates were opened and closed simultaneously at both inlets fig 4 for the successive gate operation of two inlets first one gate was opened to admit inflow and then closed to retain the water and later the other gate was opened to release the water fig 5 allowing inflow through one inlet and releasing through the other was done to ensure through flow across pakhimara beel for both situations the water was retained for 12 h in the beel before it was released fig 5 as gates are operated manually in bangladesh in the simulations it was assumed that the opening and closing of the gate requires 1 h 3 5 analysis of the results the existing operation of the trm for pakhimara beel was simulated to calibrate the model further the model results were analysed for different scenarios and compared in terms of i the total mass of sedimentation for the seasons ii trapping efficiency iii the spatial distribution of sediments and iv uniformity of sedimentation sediment deposition for different seasons was estimated using the results of the representative 14 days of simulation and extrapolated for the total number of days in a season trapping efficiency was calculated as the fraction of the incoming suspended sediment that is retained or deposited within the beel cf verschelling et al 2017 the spatial distribution was evaluated using maps of sediment deposition spatial uniformity of sedimentation was analysed by plotting sediment deposition against cumulative percentage of total area covered 4 results 4 1 sensitivity and calibration of the model the sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying the roughness coefficient critical shear stress and settling velocity discharge and water level are clearly affected by the roughness coefficient manning coefficient fig 6 the sscs show little variation for varying critical shear stress fig 7 a but show a stronger dependency on settling velocity fig 7b the best model performance was obtained for a manning coefficient equal to 0 04 s m1 3 and settling velocity equal to 0 05 cm s the manning coefficient used is consistent with the value suggested by talchabhadel et al 2018 for khuksia beel which is adjacent to our study area and the settling velocity used is within the range suggested by hale et al 2019 for the southern gbm delta subsequent model simulations were done using these parameter settings with 10 change in the calibrated value of the manning coefficient the ranges of calculated r2 were 0 57 to 0 63 for water level 0 56 to 0 62 for discharge and 0 75 to 0 78 for ssc with 10 change in the calibrated value of the settling velocity the ranges of r2 were 0 78 to 0 80 for water level 0 77 to 0 79 for discharge and 0 57 to 0 65 for ssc 4 2 sediment deposition the simulated sediment deposition in the beel for different seasons shows clear seasonal variability with the greatest deposition in the pre monsoon period and the least in the dry season fig 8 a simulated total sediment deposition for the pre monsoon scenarios is 20 to 30 more than for the monsoon scenarios in the scenario of two inlets with successive gate operation sediment deposition is about double that of the existing situation without gate for all three seasons fig 8 the location of the inlet does not affect total sediment deposition sediment deposition increases with two inlets regardless of flow regulation with gates however flow regulation results in more sediment deposition with most deposition occurring when using two inlets with successive gates two inlets without gates and simultaneous gates result in similar estimated sediment deposition 4 3 trapping efficiency to understand the differences in potential of sediment deposition among the scenarios trapping efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the amount of sediment retained by the beel over the suspended sediment load delivered into the beel fig 8b calculated trapping efficiency indicates that for the scenarios with flow regulation using gates only 7 23 of the suspended sediment entering the beel is retained the highest value 23 2 is found for the scenario using two inlets with simultaneous gate operation during the dry season using one or two inlets without gates does not affect trapping efficiency but flow regulation increases the trapping efficiency substantially gate operation also affects the trapping efficiency with the simultaneous gate operation scenario resulting in higher efficiency than the scenario with successively opening the gates 4 4 spatial distribution of sediment deposition the spatial variation in simulated sediment deposition for the monsoon scenarios is illustrated in fig 9 sediment deposition occurs in about two thirds of the beel when a single inlet is used regardless of its location or whether flow is regulated when using two inlets sedimentation occurs over the entire pakhimara beel for the two inlet situation flow regulation using gates leads to more sediment deposition fig 8a with a similar extent of sedimentation fig 9 the plot of sediment deposition against cumulative percent area indicates that with a single inlet about 30 of the total area experiences no or little sediment deposition regardless of the inlet position or the flow regulation using gates fig 10 for two inlets about 5 of total area experiences no or little sediment deposition and sediment deposition increases and almost doubles by comparison with the situation with a single inlet fig 8a remarkably applying two inlets with successive gates increases total sediment deposition fig 8a but the spatial uniformity decreases fig 10 two inlets without gates and with simultaneous gates result in similarly uniform sediment accumulation 5 discussion this research explored how to optimize trm to improve its efficiency in trapping sediment a calibrated 2d morphodynamic model was used to simulate multiple scenarios considering the seasonality number of inlets non regulated and regulated flow using gates and different operating regimes for the gates our model results show that there is a strong seasonality in sediment deposition with the greatest deposition occurring during pre monsoon fig 8a this is related to the seasonal variation of the discharge and the ssc of the kodabak river at the inlet which is in accordance with the findings of talchabhadel et al 2016 the tidal range and the ssc in the rivers are highest during the pre monsoon resulting in the water that enters the beel being more sediment rich although the ssc is lower in the monsoon than pre monsoon the total sediment load in the river and into the beel is higher this is due to highest discharge and water level and relatively high ssc in the river during monsoon season however due to tidal range being less in the monsoon than in the pre monsoon season the daily amounts of water and sediment entering the beel were are during the monsoon than during the pre monsoon and therefore sediment deposition in the beel is greatest during pre monsoon the number and location of inlets and the water body that feeds them play a critical role in sediment deposition inside the beel both amir et al 2013 and talchabhadel et al 2018 have indicated that multiple inlets connected to the same river do not substantially increase the sedimentation inside the beel amir et al 2013 show that multiple inlets connected to the same river resulted in a more uniform spatial distribution of sedimentation even though total sedimentation was not substantially higher talchabhadel et al 2018 suggest exploring whether an additional inlet close to the zone of the lowest sedimentation inside the beel would achieve more sediment deposition and a more uniform spatial distribution of deposition our results confirm that using two inlets located at opposite sides of the beel and connected to different watercourses increases both the total sediment deposition fig 8a and the spatial uniformity of sediment deposition fig 9 and fig 10 with a single inlet suspended sediment from the river cannot reach the areas far from the inlet during a tidal cycle our results show that flow regulation into the beel with gates can increase total sediment deposition fig 8a as long as flow velocities and inherent shear stresses in the flow exceed the critical values for deposition the sediment particles will remain in suspension unal 2018 when shear stress decreases as a result of decreasing flow velocity mehta 1988 deposition will start to occur unal 2018 this is particularly the case in the scenarios with gate operation that causes the floodwater to stagnate for 12 h in the beel resulting in high trapping efficiency fig 8b in contrast with two inlets and unregulated flow the water inside the beel is constantly moving with the tides rendering trapping efficiency low still as gates prevent flow from the river from entering the beel for 12 h in cyclic order the total sediment load delivered inside the beel becomes lower than when flow is unregulated the resulting total deposition for two inlets with unregulated flow is roughly the same as that for two inlets with regulated flow with gates operated simultaneously the scenario of two inlets where flow is regulated with successive gate operation results in the lowest average velocity and consequently the greatest total deposition for the successive gate operation schemes the suspended sediment rich water enters through one inlet gate and after a 12 hour period of water stagnancy to allow the sediment to settle the water drains through the other gate it seems that the flow velocities during the drainage stage of the beel are too low for deposited sediment to be resuspended resulting in large sediment deposition however constructing gates is resource intensive and the gates require regular maintenance constructing gates for an inlet 40 m wide may cost over 1 million euros assuming the rates paid for construction work in government of bangladesh development projects gob 2005 ensuring that regular maintenance is carried out may also prove difficult as during the field visits several existing gates were found non operational or in need of maintenance verschelling et al 2017 explored the effect of different variables such as inlet discharge wind speed and direction on the trapping efficiency of a depoldered area similar to a beel with unregulated flow they found that the sediment trapping efficiency in their study area depended largely on the inlet discharge their study indicated that larger inlet discharge results in increase of total amount of sediment retained and reduction in trapping efficiency the larger inlet discharge corresponds to increased influx of sediment and more sedimentation on the tidal flats however the increase of shear stress during high discharge events cause most of the fine sediments to stay in suspension and result in reduction of trapping efficiency in our study area inlet discharge varies seasonally accordingly trapping efficiency from our model results also shows considerable seasonal differences generally ranging from 5 to 15 and with the highest value of 23 for two inlets with simultaneous gates during the dry season fig 8b under current trm practice the flooding of land occurs for several years which dramatically restricts the livelihoods and economic activities of the local people seasonal operation of trm with flow regulation by gates would provide the opportunity to flood the land for only part of the year making the land available for agriculture during the rest of the year although pre monsoonal trm would yield the most sediment deposition monsoonal trm would minimize the salinity of inflowing water and sediment which would have positive effects on crop production sediment deposition would still be high and only 20 30 less than during the pre monsoon making the land available for crop production in the dry and pre monsoon period october to may would greatly enlarge the effectiveness of trm seasonal trm operation was already being practised in the pre polder era in the southwest region referred to as ostomasi badh van staveren et al 2017 data collected throughout the year especially while the trm was ongoing would have provided essential information on the impact of trm on the river and the beel nevertheless our model simulations provide a first understanding of this process and its impacts all the simulations in this research were done for 14 consecutive days covering spring and neap tides furthermore taking 14 day time windows representing different seasons allowed us to quantify and understand seasonality effects in reality sediment deposition will also vary during the seasons along with the variations in ssc and river flow if long term data become available the simulation should be done for at least an entire year the analysis of the reliability of model results revealed that the model was able to replicate the existing conditions fairly well table 2 as the results indicate that the tidal range plays a vital role in sediment dynamics the next step should be to explore more areas closer to the sea as well as inland to study the effects on sediment deposition in beels and as the ssc is an important variable it is essential to further explore the sediment dynamics in the river in relation to seasonality and sediment availability finally it should be investigated to what extent reintroducing of sediment trapping in de poldered areas of the lower gmb delta would affect sediment loads and further silting up of the lower delta river channels converting the simulated amounts of deposition during pre monsoon season to estimates of increase in land elevation thereby assuming an effective soil density of 1300 kg m3 the re introduction of sediment deposition in this beel would result in a rise of the landsurface in the order of 18 mm and 20 mm per year for the scenarios of single inlet without and with flow regulation using gate and 28 mm yr for the scenarios of two inlets without flow regulation 28 mm yr and 31 mm yr for two inlets with simultaneous and successive gate operation these values are about two times for the scenarios of single inlet to three times for the scenarios of two inlets as high as the relative sea level rise considering the yearly rates of subsidence brown and nicholls 2015 and sea level rise davis et al 2018 this implies that seasonal operation of trm indeed may be an efficient strategy to raise the polder land surface to counteract relative sea level rise 6 conclusion to identify the options for improved trm in de poldered floodplain areas in the lower ganges delta in bangladesh we investigated the effect of inlet regulation to enhance sediment trapping in a polder depression a beel our numerical model simulations based on pakhimara beel exploring different scenarios of gate operation and carried out for different hydrological seasons indicate that the amounts and spatial variation of sediment deposition in a beel may differ widely depending on the number of inlets and the flow regulation scheme applied to the beel regulated flow increases sediment trapping efficiency by about 10 leading to larger total sediment deposition inside the beel by about 18 two inlets located at opposite sides of the beel and connected to different watercourses substantially increase both the spatial uniformity of sedimentation by about 30 and the total sediment deposition by about 50 compared to the scenario with one inlet using two inlets with successive gate operation which ensures flow through the beel and provides sufficient time for the sediment to settle further increases total sediment deposition by 25 sediment deposition varies seasonally with the pre monsoon period yielding the highest deposition because the ssc in the river is high and there is large inflow of water and sediment into the beel as the tidal range is high trm during the monsoon period results in 20 to 30 less sediment deposition than during the pre monsoon but has the advantage that the incoming floodwater is much less saline 1 7 psu instead of 8 5 psu during pre monsoon the land level increase as a result of estimated sediment accumulation during pre monsoon season is in the order of 20 mm for single inlet and 30 mm for two inlets which is two to three times as high as than the rate of yearly relative sea level rise up to the year 2050 during monsoon these values are about 5 mm lower but still higher than relative sea level rise our results suggest that using two openings whether with or without flow regulation through gates results in more enhanced total sediment deposition and uniformity of spatial distribution of sediment deposition than is achieved with current practice given the complexity and cost of gate operation the most feasible trm is to have two inlets at opposite sides of the beel without flow regulation even though flow regulation with successive gate operation yields higher sediment deposition moreover we propose trm operation only during the monsoon which is when the river water is least saline thereby leaving the land available during the rest of the year thus enhancing trm acceptability by local stakeholders although the results indicate that flow regulation is advantageous it demands costly maintenance and operation of regulation structures nevertheless as gates also may provide protection against flood hazards and can regulate flow if required it is recommended that inlets include gates and the gates are maintained and operated properly thus well planned effective and stakeholder acceptable e g seasonal operation of trm with efficient sediment trapping and uniform spatial distribution as presented in this study has the potential of counteracting relative sea level rise through raising the land by re introcuding sedimentation this may be not only the case for the lower gmb delta but might support the sinking deltas around the world to counteract slr and land subsidence by utilizing the sediments delivered naturally by the rivers or from the estuary and sea author contributions all the authors contributed to the conceptualization development of methodology writing and editing of the manuscript md feroz islam carried out the model

5136,canopy interception loss is a key component of forest hydrological cycle that determine the amount of net rainfall reaching forest floor together with drought climate stressors affecting dryland forest plantations a good understanding of the relationship between canopy interception loss and forest management such as thinning is important for improved watershed management and ecological services in this study we measured event based rainfall partitioning for a thinned th with 38 basal area removed and a control ct robinia pseudoacacia forest plantation during leafed and leafless seasons in 2015 in the semiarid loess plateau region in china interception loss from both forest plots were simulated using the revised gash analytical model rgam and the wimo model the results showed that observed annual throughfall stemflow and interception loss were respectively 80 8 1 7 and 17 5 of the gross rainfall under ct the corresponding values under th were 87 9 0 8 and 11 3 respectively the rgam and wimo models were well calibrated and validated using filed data collected in leafed and leafless seasons the analyses suggested that models accurately predicated interception loss under both ct and th conditions and captured seasonal variations in canopy and meteorological parameters the rgam model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity and canopy storage capacity in leafed season and to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity in leafless season moreover 37 2 and 42 1 of the interception in leafed season evaporated from the canopy respectively during rainfall event and after rainfall the corresponding values for leafless season were respectively 49 3 and 22 4 overall the performance of the optimized rgam and wimo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error 6 9 2 9 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency 0 80 0 94 although that of the optimized rgam model was slightly superior to wimo model the models would facilitate the implementation of water oriented management in semiarid forest plantations through a more accurate simulation of the impact of thinning on interception loss keywords rainfall interception revised gash analytical model wimo model thinning loess plateau 1 introduction over the past few decades extensive afforestation and reforestation efforts have been made in the semiarid and arid regions around the world with the primary purpose of controlling desertification and soil erosion as a way of conserving the ecological environment malagnoux et al 2007 cao et al 2011 fao 2015 for instance in 2000 2010 49 billion ha of land were reforested or afforested with trees in dryland regions of the world accounting for an increase in forest cover of 0 8 14 7 to 15 5 hansen et al 2013 sexton et al 2013 bastin et al 2017 as the forest plantations get increasing important in terms of ecological services woody products soil retention habitat provisioning services carbon sequestration etc so also are criticisms increasing in terms of hydrological impacts farley et al 2005 sadeghi et al 2015 in these naturally water scarce areas annual water consumption of forest plantations can be nearly equal to total rainfall schiller and cohen 1998 this could reduce water yield and create potentially conflicting demands for water resources between humans and the ecosystem sun et al 2006 wang et al 2011 feng et al 2016 moreover most forest plantations grown as part of the reforestation and afforestation drive have suffered from poor forest management due to the low economic incentives compared with conventional forest products cao et al 2011 manrique alba et al 2015 this has resulted in high density stands planted forests high interception loss and high water consumption further substantially reducing water yield in these regions molina and del campo 2012 recently forest cover decline due to forest dieback or even mortality has been reported in some of the plantations this is believed to be caused mainly by drought stress and poor forest management du et al 2012 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 the question therefore arises as to whether silvicultural interventions can increase ecosystem resilience in the face of drought stress and future climate change one frequently discussed option to this rising concern is thinning of forest trees keenan 2015 sohn et al 2016 thinning is a common forest management practice done to reduce forest density and to improve tree quality su et al 2016 over the last decades experimental evidences from different forest ecosystems have confirmed that thinning can promote vigor of residual trees and reduce long term stress due to competition for water nutrients and light it can also increase the resilience and resistance of forest trees to severe drought stress and could therefore be an effective climate adaptation approach martín benito et al 2010 chmura et al 2011 gebhardt et al 2014 sohn et al 2016 cabon et al 2018 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 moreover thinning affects hydrological processes in forest ecosystems including transpiration evaporation rainfall partitioning soil water content and surface flow bréda et al 1995 vesala et al 2005 ganatsios et al 2010 gebhardt et al 2014 lechuga et al 2017 del campo et al 2019 among these canopy interception is an important component of the forest water cycle as it determines the amount of net rainfall reaching forest floor accounting for 9 60 of total rainfall crockford and richardson 2000 sadeghi et al 2015 del campo et al 2019 as interception loss is much lower in open than in dense forest canopies molina and del campo 2012 thinning can be done to reduce canopy interception loss in dense forest plantations due to its importance there have been numerous studies on canopy interception loss however most of these studies have been done in sub humid and tropical forest ecosystems dunkerley 2000 llorens and domingo 2007 molina and del campo 2012 in addition studies regarding the effects of thinning on canopy interception loss in unmanaged dryland forest plantations have rarely been reported as an alternative to direct monitoring of rainfall components i e throughfall and stemflow in the field and using empirical models canopy interception loss can be calculated from conceptual physically based models molina and del campo 2012 among these physically based canopy interception models over 15 of them the original and the revised gash analytical rgam models are most commonly used in estimating interception loss muzylo et al 2009 the original gash model is a simplified version of the rutter model rutter et al 1975 and it usually overestimates interception loss as it predicts overall plot area evaporation rather than canopy area evaporation gash et al 1995 the rgam model is a reformulated version of the original model for predicting sparse forest canopy interception loss gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 to account for the effect of wind speed on interception loss hörmann et al 1996 developed a dynamic wind controlled canopy interception model wimo this model can estimate canopy interception loss in areas where rainfall is influenced by wind the rgam model has been successfully applied extensively in various forest types under different climatic conditions there are applications of it in temperate forest gash et al 1995 herbst et al 2006 klingaman et al 2007 tropical forest fan et al 2014 junqueira junior et al 2019 continental forest carlyle moses and price 1999 and mediterranean forest limousin et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 conditions however the model has rarely been evaluated for dryland forest plantations sadeghi et al 2015 ma et al 2019 compared with rgam model only few studies have tested wimo model in simulating canopy interception loss klingaman et al 2007 fan et al 2014 shinohara et al 2015 in a leafless deciduous forest klingaman et al 2007 tested the abilities of three interception models for predicting interception loss and noted that wimo performed better than rgam model in another study fan et al 2014 compared rgam and wimo models for pine plantation and banksia woodland in australia and found that optimized rgam model performed better than wimo model most recently shinohara et al 2015 compared three interception models for a japanese cedar forest before and after intensive thinning and reported that wimo performed better than rgam model in terms of nash sutcliffe model efficiency the wimo model has not been reported in simulation of dryland forest plantations and comparison between rgam and wimo models are more seldom especially in unmanaged dryland forest plantations in dryland regions of the loess plateau like many other dryland regions in asia and central europe exotic robinia pseudoacacia have been planted with the primary purpose to control soil and water erosion avert desertification and produce timber and fuel wood keresztesi 1988 sadeghi et al 2016 ma et al 2017 vitkova et al 2017 the r pseudoacacia forest plantations in the loess plateau are mainly of the same genotype and coetaneous and have low levels of morphological differentiation the forests have formed even ages and pure stands and often with sparse understory herbaceous vegetation due to the natural conservation policy of the local government these forests have seldom been managed since their established resulting in unmanaged dense forest canopies that intercept more rainfall ma et al 2019 and consume more water than other native tree species wang et al 2008 jian et al 2015 drought induced tree dieback have recently been a frequent phenomenon in these plantations du et al 2011 therefore silvicultural interventions such as thinning could be required in r pseudoacacia plantations to increase resilience in the face of severe drought stress and future climate change in this study event based rainfall partitioning between moderately thinned with 38 basal area removed and the control r pseudoacacia forest plots were measured during both leafed and leafless seasons in 2015 the canopy interception losses were also modeled in leafed and leafless seasons using the two interception models the objectives of the study were to 1 quantify the effect of thinning on rainfall partitioning based on event measurements during leafed and leafless seasons 2 compare and contrast the performance of rgam and wimo models for both control and thinned forest plots in leafed and leafless seasons and 3 explore the underlying causes of the differences in interception loss between the control and thinned plots in leafed and leafless seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site 34 31 76 n 107 54 67 e is located in the yeheshan national forest ynf in fufeng county shannxi province china the landscape is a plateau with low rolling hills and deep valleys and has an elevation range of 449 1662 m a s l the predominant soil type is silt loam classified as inceptisols according to the united states department of agriculture usda it has a textural composition of 73 3 silt 20 9 clay and 5 8 sand the groundwater table sits at an average depth of over 50 m across the study area the climate is semiarid continental with an average temperature range of 1 in january and 23 in july the long term 1958 2016 average annual precipitation varies between 324 and 914 mm with 81 of the precipitation falling in the may october growing season the long term annual potential evapotranspiration in the region is 1217 mm some two times the annual precipitation these calculations are based on the long term climatic records 1958 2016 obtained from the fufeng bureau of meteorology the nearest 10 km meteorology station to the study area the prevailing winds blow from the southeast to the northwest during the growing season and from the northwest to the southeast during the dormant season the vegetation is dominated by deciduous woodlands of r pseudoacacia 75 pine plantation of p tabuliformis 15 and other tree species p orientalis p simonii p davidiana q wutaishansea and q variabili of 10 the r pseudoacacia forest stand in ynf was planted in the 1980 s on former farmlands and had poor management since as protective forests the measurements for this study were carried out in two representative rectangular forest plots 2500 m2 located in the center of the r pseudoacacia forest stand 400 m from each other in an un thinned control forest plot ct and a moderately thinned forest plot th of 38 of basal area removal the thinning was carried out in october 2014 and applied primarily to reduce stressed overtopped and suppressed growth or poor tree quality small sized dying trees this made it possible for a relatively homogeneous distribution and for further development of trees under natural conditions felled logs and branches thinned were removed from the treatment plot the detailed description of the forest plots is given in table 1 in this study the measurement period was divided into leafed season including leaf burst and senescence during the may october period and leafless season november april 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological measurements meteorological conditions were observed from an automatic weather station mounted on a 15 m high mast 2 m above the forest canopy in the center of the control plot ct solar radiation rn w m 2 was measured using a four component radiometer cnr4 kipp zonen netherlands air temperature t and relative humidity rh were measured using a thermohydrometer hmp155 vaisala helsinki finland then wind speed u m s 1 was measured using a 3d sonic anemometer thermometer cast3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to account for the effect of wind speed on canopy storage capacity wind speed in the treatment thinned th plot was also measured with the same type anemometer thermometer mounted on a 15 m high mast in the center of the thinned plot soil heat flux in each forest plot was measured using two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux thermal sensors the netherlands buried 5 cm below the forest floor one plate was placed in the tree row and the other outside the tree row to obtain a good estimate of soil heat flux within each forest plot all data were automatically sampled at 10 s interval and stored in a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa at 10 min interval 2 2 2 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements the measurements of rainfall throughfall and stemflow were conducted simultaneously for both ct and th for the period from 1st january 2015 to 31st december 2015 two procedures were used to avoid rainfall data gap in each forest plot during the measurement period i two automatic monitoring system was conducted using a t 200b type weighing bucket rain gauge geonor eiksmarka norway and ii two manual monitoring technique was performed using a manual rain gauge orifice area of 706 5 cm2 both rain gauges were installed nearby 30 m away each experimental plot at a sufficiently open place and positioned at 0 8 m above the ground to avoid rain splash and prevent damage by wild animals the horizontal angel between the rain gauge and the top of the nearest trees in this study was smaller than 45 this limited any disturbance of the gross rainfall measurement from the surrounding environment asdak et al 1998 fan et al 2014 the weighting bucket rain gauge had a resolution of 0 1 mm and provided rainfall intensity mm h 1 for the subsequent interception model calibration the manual rain gauges were read immediately after each rainfall event and a rain event was defined as a period with 0 2 mm of total rainfall separated by at least 6 h of rain break ma et al 2019 a good relationship was obtained between the weighting bucket rain gauge and manual measurements weight bucket gauge 1 016 manual gauge 0 031 r2 0 97 n 68 and therefore the rainfall data measured by the manual gauges were used to verify inconsistent recordings or missing data from the weighting bucket gauges throughfall was measured in the in between tree spaces in each forest plot using 30 manual rain gauges orifice area of 706 5 cm2 which were identical to those used for rainfall measurement all the gauges were covered by nylon mesh to prevent leaves and other debris from entering the collectors and also to reduce rainwater loss through splashing to account for spatial variability of throughfall the rain gauges were placed along three 50 m long transects 10 m apart on the forest floor with an average distance of 2 5 m between neighbouring gauges and half of those gauges were relocated to a new random position after every three rainfall events crockford and richardson 2000 ritter and regalado 2014 the stand scale throughfall depth was determined as the mean of the 30 collectors in each forest plot stemflow was measured for 13 trees in each forest plot the selected trees were representative of the dbh diameter at breast height range of the trees in the plots stemflow was sampled using spiral type stemflow collars constructed from plastic hoses a garden hose of 20 cm in diameter was attached to the boles and sealed in an upward spiral pattern with small gaps at the bottom of the collar filled with silicone sealant stemflow drippled down tree stems captured by collars and diverted to 50 l buckets placed at the bases of the sampled trees stemflow depth was calculated as 1 sf v sf ca where sf is stemflow depth mm vsf is stemflow volume l and ca is canopy area m2 the tree scale stemflow measurements were next upscaled to stand scale from the number of dbh classes and mean stemflow volume from the trees in each dbh class interception loss mm was calculated as the difference between the amount of rainfall and the sum of the throughfall and stemflow 2 3 model description in this study we tested the application of two canopy interception loss models that take into account the effects of canopy characteristics and climatic conditions on rainfall interception these were the rgam gash et al 1995 and the wimo hörmann et al 1996 models the two models were applied as described by klingaman et al 2007 and shinohara et al 2015 but further details are also given by fan et al 2014 the strategy used in the study was that part of the separate measurements from leafed and leafless seasons were used to calibrate the model and then used the other part of the data for model validation to account for seasonal variations in rainfall intensity and canopy parameters ghimire et al 2012 ma et al 2019 data for june august and october in leafed season dataset 1 and for march april and december in leafless season dataset 1 were used for model calibration the remaining data for may july and september in leafed season dataset 2 and january february and november in leafless season dataset 2 were used for model validation then the model was run continuously for the entire period of leafed and leafless seasons using the calibrated parameters 2 3 1 revised gash analytical model rgam the rgam model used for canopy interception loss assumes that rainfall pg is intercepted as a series of individual rainfall events but with enough time to completely dry on the canopy before the onset of another rainfall event gash 1979 each rainfall can be distinguished by discrete phrases i e wetting phrase saturation phrase and rainfall cessation phrase and is analyzed separately with threshold value of pg to determine whether a canopy is saturated the amount of rainfall necessary to saturate a canopy pg is calculated as 2 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r where r mm h 1 is mean rainfall intensity c is canopy cover ēc mm h 1 is mean evaporation rate per unite area of canopy cover calculated as ēc ē c and sc mm is canopy storage capacity per unit area of cover defined as sc s c for a given rainfall event the components of rainfall interception i mm were calculated as 3 i i un p g p g i w i s i a i t p g p g where i un mm is intercepted rainfall not enough to saturate canopy and is calculated as 4 i un c i 1 m p g i where m is the number of rainfall events that are insufficient to saturate the canopy iw is the evaporation of rainwater during wetting canopy phrase and is determined as 5 i w n c p g s c where n is the number of rainfall events sufficient to saturate the canopy is is the evaporation from saturated canopy during rainfall and is calculated as 6 i s c e c r i 1 n p g i p g and it is evaporation from tree trunk for q events that saturate tree trunk and is determined as 7 i t q s t p t i 1 n q p g i where st mm is trunk storage capacity and pt is rainfall fraction diverted into stemflow a more detailed description of the interception components in the rgam model is documented by gash et al 1995 2 3 2 wimo model the wimo model developed by hörmann et al 1996 accounts for the effect of wind speed on canopy interception loss which process is not considered in rgam model the wimo model uses the same underlaying equations as the gash 1979 model but has the additional function to vary canopy storage capacity per unit canopy area sc with maximum wind speed umax during rainfall event here sc as a function of umax was derived from a regression equation between umax and optimal canopy storage capacity so umax was determined using the collected meteorological data to find so for each rainfall event a bucket model that calculates throughfall tf i at an hourly time step was used table 2 8 t f i 1 c p g i i f c i s c 1 c p g i c i s c i f c i s c where ci is canopy water content and is calculated as 9 c i c i 1 p g i e a i where ea is actual evaporation rate and ci is reset to sc at the end of the time step for which it exceeds sc a fortran program was used to find so for each rainfall event by running the bucket model for each sc of 0 1 4 0 mm in 0 01 mm increments the sc was optimized to have the minimum rmse between observed and simulated throughfall a paired so and umax for each rainfall event was regressed to produce a regression equation for sc as a function of umax 2 4 model parameters 2 4 1 canopy parameters canopy storage capacity s for ct and th was estimated using the regression method wallace and mcjannet 2008 the negative intercept of the regression of the sum of throughfall and stemflow against rainfall large enough to saturate the canopy was assumed to be s following jackson 1975 free throughfall coefficient ρ was estimated as the slope of the linear regression between throughfall and rainfall amount insufficient to give a value exceeding s an alternative way of estimating ρ was also used via hemispherical photographs taken with a nikon d100 digital camera with fish eye lens during leafed and leafless periods and processed with the can eye software version 6 3 to do so 12 photos were taken at each forest plot in each month on cloudy days or close to sunrise or sunset under uniform sky conditions the camera was carefully oriented such that the edges of the photos were perpendicular to the tree row in the forest plot as no significant differences p 0 05 n 144 were detected in ρ values between the two methods used in this study ρ estimated from the regression method was used for canopy interception loss modeling st and pt were estimated following gash and morton 1978 as the negative intercept and slope of the linear regression between gross rainfall and stemflow all the parameters were determined in leafed and leafless seasons for ct and th table 4 2 4 2 wet canopy evaporation rate the mean evaporation rate ē from wet canopy during rainfall was calculated using three different methods i evaporation rate ēpm estimated using the penman monteith equation with canopy conductance set to infinity gash et al 1995 10 e pm δ r n g ρ a c p d g a λ δ γ where δ is slope of saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa k 1 rn is net solar radiation above canopy surface w m 2 g is soil surface heat flux w m 2 ρa is air density kg m 3 cp is specific heat of air j kg 1 k 1 d is vapor pressure deficit kpa λ is latent heat of vaporization of water kpa k 1 γ is psychometric constant j kg 1 and ga is aerodynamic conductance m s 1 determined as 11 g a k 2 u ln z d z 0 2 where k is the von kármán constant 0 41 u is wind speed m s 1 z is height at which wind speed and relative humidity were measured m d is zero plane displacement height m and z0 is roughness length controlling transfer of vapor heat and momentum m usually d and z0 are estimated from mean canopy height h in this study the values of d and z0 for forest plots were assumed to be 0 7 h and 0 1 h respectively fan et al 2014 ma et al 2019 ii the mean wet canopy evaporate ētf was also estimated from the value of e r as derived from the linear regression of gross rainfall versus interception loss iii the mean wet canopy evaporation rate ēopt was finally determined through optimization of e r by minimizing rmse between observed and simulated interception loss marquardt 1963 for the revised gash model the comparison between measured and simulated interception loss was done using the three evaporation rates during both leafed and leafless seasons then for the wimo model the comparison was done by using only optimized wet canopy evaporation rate 2 5 model evaluation the performances of the two canopy interception loss models were evaluated using relative error re and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency metric re is the percent error that quantifies the differences between simulated and observed measurements following muzylo et al 2009 the performance of the interception rainfall model in terms of re is classified as poor re 30 fair 10 re 30 good 5 re 10 very good 1 re 5 and extremely good re 1 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency metric assesses the performance of interception model as compared to the mean these two metrices are usually applied in hydrologic models 2 6 sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the parameters in the rgam model a sensitivity analysis was done with respect to canopy and climate related parameters for the leafed and leafless seasons under ct and th however no sensitivity analysis was done for the parameter s in the wimo model as it was estimated by the model itself in this study canopy related parameters s c pt and st and the meteorological parameter e r were considered their values were increased or decreased by up to 50 of the original values and the simulated values then compared to the filed measured ones 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the mean relative error in pg between two weighting bucket measurements was 2 2 indicating low spatial variability of pg over the study area the average values of measure data e g rainfall amount duration and intensity for the two weighting buckets were therefore used in the subsequent model analysis during the study a total of 85 rainfall events were measured the total rainfall depth was 732 2 mm 537 3 mm 73 4 of total pg in leafed season and 194 9 mm 26 6 of total pg in leafless season the distribution of rainfall amount and intensity during the leafed and leafless seasons are shown in fig 1 generally rainfall events with low depths were more frequent and contributed to the lower percent total pg than large rainfall events fig 1a and 1c rainfall events with low intensity in the range of 0 1 mm h 1 generally had a higher event frequency 50 of total event but with relatively lower percent 27 total rainfall amount in leafed season fig 1b in contrast to leafed season the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity was highly positively skewed in leafless season for both rainfall event and amount fig 1d this suggested that lower intensity rainfall events were much more frequent and had higher percent of the total rainfall 3 2 rainfall partitioning the ct and th plots partitioned rainfall differently for the study period measured annual throughfall was 591 8 mm under ct and 643 5 mm under th accounting respectively for 80 8 and 87 9 of the total pg table 3 the range of the average ratio of throughfall to pg was 78 5 85 5 for leafed season smaller than that observed for leafless season 87 2 94 4 the stand scale estimate of annual stemflow was 5 7 mm under th representing only 0 8 of the annual pg then the estimated stemflow was slightly higher under ct 12 7 mm estimated to be 1 7 of the annual pg similar to throughfall the mean ratio of stemflow to rainfall was slightly higher in leafless season 1 2 2 1 than in leafed season 0 6 1 6 for both forest plots however cumulative stemflow depth was higher in leafed season 3 4 8 7 mm than in leafless season 2 3 4 0 mm interception loss was estimated as the difference between pg and the sum of throughfall and stemflow in this study the estimated annual interception loss was 127 8 mm under ct and 83 0 mm under th respectively accounting for 17 5 and 11 3 of total pg in contrast to throughfall and stemflow the average ratio of interception loss to pg was significantly p 0 01 higher in leafed season than in leafless season under both ct and th 3 3 model parameterization linear regressions for pg and partitioned rainfall components e g throughfall stemflow and throughfall plus stemflow fig 2 and the derived canopy parameters table 4 for the leafed and leafless seasons under ct and th followed changes in canopy structure the estimated average s was 1 51 mm during the leafed season in ct which was about 5 times higher than the 0 28 mm value for leafless season fig 2b and 2f the estimated average s under th was much smaller than that under ct which were respectively 0 94 mm and 0 15 mm in leafed and leafless seasons free throughfall coefficient ρ estimated from regression fitting was significantly p 0 01 higher in leafless season than in leafed season for both forest plots fig 2a and 2e while under ct the calculated mean ρ was 0 19 in leafed season and 0 73 in leafless season the corresponding values under th were respectively 0 38 and 0 81 similar results were obtained for pt under both ct 0 021 in leafless season 0 016 in leafed season and th 0 014 in leafless season and 0 007 in leafed season fig 2c and 2 g in contrast to ρ and pt the estimated mean trunk storage capacity st was slightly higher in leafed season than in leafless season in both study plots fig 2c and 2 g specifically the mean values of st under ct were 0 097 mm in leafed season and 0 067 mm in leafless season and with the corresponding values under th of 0 041 and 0 028 mm respectively wet canopy evaporation rates estimated using the penman monteith equation and regression fitting method differed markedly table 4 the calculated ēpm by the penman monteith equation under ct during rainfall was 0 09 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 04 mm h 1 in leafless season the corresponding values under th were 0 10 mm h 1 and 0 05 mm h 1 respectively the e r values derived from linear regression analysis of rainfall amount against the sum of throughfall and stemflow under ct were 0 19 and 0 14 respectively for leafed and leafless seasons based on mean rainfall intensity of 1 52 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 73 mm h 1 in leafless season the values of the resultant ētf were respectively 0 29 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 10 mm h 1 in leafless season under th e r was estimated at 0 15 in leafed season and 0 08 in leafless season based on the same rainfall intensity under ct the calculated ētf valued were 0 23 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 06 mm h 1 leafless season the effects of wind speed on canopy storage capacity are presented in fig 2d and 2 h significant correlations p 0 05 were found between ux and s under both ct and th in leafed season the estimated s apparently decreased with increasing ux whereas it increased with increasing ux in leafless season in the study a logarithmic regression equation of s 0 687ln ux 1 86 adjusted r 2 0 47 was obtained under ct and a power regression equation of s 1 48e 0 244 ux adjusted r 2 0 51 under th in leafed season these equations were used to determine s in the wimo model fig 2d in leafless season two logarithmic regression equations were derived under ct s 0 151ln ux 0 176 adjusted r 2 0 41 and th s 0 088ln ux 0 071 adjusted r 2 0 48 to determine s in the wimo model fig 2h 3 4 model calibration and validation the individual rainfall events observed during june august and october in leafed season and during march april and december in leafless season were used to calibrate the rgam and wimo models the calibrated models were next validated using measurements in may july and september in leafed season and january february and november in leafless season canopy and climatic parameters derived from the calibration dataset for the rgam and wimo models are given in table 4 the measured and simulated total interception loss in leafed season using three evaporation rates ēpm ētf and ēopt for the rgam model and using the optimized evaporation rate ēopt for the wimo model are summarized in table 5 and plotted in fig 3 on the whole the interception loss was underestimated to varying degrees by the two models table 5 the interception loss was largely underestimated for the rgam model using ēpm by 22 7 under ct and 25 2 under th while much better fits were obtained between simulated and observed values for the rgam model using ētf with the interception loss underestimation of only 9 8 under ct and 10 6 under th a minor underestimation was noted for the rgam model using ēopt with values of 2 9 under ct and 4 2 under th the performance of the rgam model improved a lot when run with ēopt with relative error reduced from 25 2 to 2 9 also the nash sutcliffe model efficiency increased from 0 68 to 0 88 using the system proposed by muzylo et al 2009 for rainfall interception models it indicated that the rgam model with ēopt was a very good model similar to the rgam model with ēopt the underestimation of interception loss by the wimo model was also small with a value of 4 2 under ct and 5 9 under th the wimo model with ēopt thus can be classified as a very good model and a good model for ct and th respectively table 5 the calibrated rgam and wimo models were then used to simulate interception loss for the months of may july and september the simulated interception loss of the rgam model with ēopt and ētf and of the wimo model agreed well with observations in the two plots the relative error was 13 3 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency was 0 71 under both ct and th table 5 the measured and simulated interception loss using ēpm ētf and ēopt for the rgam model and ēopt for the wimo model in leafless season are summarized in table 6 and plotted in fig 4 similar to the modeling results in leafed season interception loss was also underestimated by the two models in leafless season table 6 the underestimated interception loss was highest for rgam model with ēpm which were 34 1 under th and 30 8 under ct by replacing ēpm with ētf the differences between simulated and observed interception loss by the rgam model with underestimations of 11 3 under ct and 13 6 under th the use of ēopt significantly improved the predictions of interception loss by rgam model for both ct and th plots the underestimation reduced from 34 1 to 4 4 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency increased from 0 56 to 0 87 the predicted interception loss by the wimo model was underestimated by 4 8 under ct and 6 0 under th in leafless season the rgam and wimo models with ēopt were respectively classified as very good and good models under ct re 5 and under th 10 re 5 table 6 the calibrated rgam and wimo models were then validated using datasets for january february and november in leafless season similar to the results obtained with ētf and ēopt for rgam and wimo models under calibration the predicted interception loss also agreed well with filed measurements under validation with relative error 12 8 and modeling efficiency 0 79 table 6 different components of predicted interception loss by rgam model with ēopt are listed in table 7 the modeling results indicated that most of the interception evaporated from saturated canopy during and after rainfall in leafed and leafless seasons under both ct and th while in leafed season 37 8 and 41 5 of the predicted interception evaporated during and after rainfall under ct 36 6 and 42 7 respectively evaporated under th in contrast to leafed season more rainwater evaporated during rainfall in leafless season table 7 during leafless season 49 7 and 48 8 of the interception evaporated during rainfall respectively under ct and th only 21 1 and 23 6 evaporated after rainfall respectively under ct and th interception loss from other components were minimal except for tree trunks during leafless season modeling results suggested that 17 0 and 13 4 of the predicted interception evaporated from tree trunks respectively in ct and th plots in leafed season predicted cumulative total interception loss by rgam model with ēopt was 103 3 mm under ct and 71 1 mm under th with underestimations of 3 3 and 4 3 respectively fig 5 and table 7 the corresponding values for the wimo model were 102 mm under ct underestimation of 4 5 and 70 5 mm under th underestimation of 5 1 the rgam and wimo models were therefore classified separately as very good and good model for ct and th plots in leafed season compared with leafed season underestimated interception loss by the rgam model was larger in leafless season the cumulative total interception losses predicted by the rgam model with ēopt were 19 9 mm under ct underestimation of 4 9 and 8 4 mm under th underestimation of 3 0 the corresponding values for wimo model were 19 9 mm under ct underestimation of 4 8 and 8 3 mm under th underestimation of 4 6 fig 5 the rgam and wimo models were therefore classified as very good for leafless season in ct and th plots 3 5 sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the rgam model a sensitivity analysis with respect to five parameters s c pt st and e r was done in this study no sensitivity analysis was done for s in wimo model as it was estimated independently as a function of maximum wind speed fig 6 illustrates the results of the sensitivity analyses on the selected parameters relative to interception loss in rgam model in leafed season e r and s were the most sensitive parameters under both ct and th followed by c pt and st fig 6a and 6b when the values of e r s c pt and st were reduced by 50 the average values of interception loss for ct and th plots decreased respectively by 26 3 17 9 6 5 1 9 and 1 1 in leafless season e r was the most sensitive parameter in both forest plots followed by pt s c and st fig 6c and 6d when the values of e r pt s c and st were reduced by 50 the average values of interception loss for the two plots dropped respectively by 35 6 1 5 2 2 8 and 1 5 on the whole the rgam model was most sensitive to e r and s in leafed season and e r in leafless season for both ct and th plots 4 discussions 4 1 throughfall and stemflow the observed throughfall in the control plot 80 8 of pg for the entire period was similar to that 81 1 of pg reported by ma et al 2019 however it was slightly higher than that record 72 9 of pg by sadeghi et al 2016 for a semiarid r pseudoacacia plantation in iran the larger differences in throughfall percentage between the values in our study and those of sadeghi et al 2016 could be related to the differences in leaf area index and canopy cover the larger leaf area index and canopy cover reported in their study intercepted more rainwater during rainfall than the one noted in our study thereby reducing the amount of rainfall going into throughfall while in the thinned plot the observed annual throughfall 87 9 of pg was larger than that reported above it was slightly lower than the one 89 1 of pg observed by wang et al 2013 in a r pseudoacacia plantation in the semiarid loess plateau region with a similar canopy cover but lower basal area the reason for this slightly difference between our study and that of wang et al 2013 could be due to the higher rainfall intensity 2 82 mm h 1 and lower evaporation rate 0 11 mm h 1 recorded in their study compared to the values recorded in this study rainfall intensity 1 1 mm h 1 and evaporation rate 0 18 mm h 1 thinning can be an important management tool to modify forest throughfall in our forest plots thinning increased throughfall percentage from 80 8 to 87 9 but decreased average canopy cover c from 54 to 41 shinohara et al 2015 compared throughfall percentage for the periods before and after thinning and found a difference of 12 of pg comparable to that in canopy cover 12 5 in this study a difference of 13 in c resulted in a difference of only 7 in throughfall suggesting that there was no comparable relationship between the differences in c and throughfall similar to this study molina and del campo 2012 found that the difference in c was not comparable to that in interception loss with that in c in the range of 19 67 and that in interception in the range of 5 28 this indicated that aside from canopy cover other canopy or meteorological parameters such as leaf area index basal area and wet canopy evaporation rate influence throughfall generation in forest plantations compared with throughfall stemflow in this study represented only a small fraction of the hydrological input to forest floor the observed average annual stemflow of 1 7 of pg in control plot and 0 8 of pg in thinned plot was similar to the ones 1 3 2 3 of pg observed by ma et al 2019 and wang et al 2013 but much smaller than the values 7 1 of pg reported by sadeghi et al 2016 the much higher stemflow percentage reported by sadeghi et al 2016 compared with ours could be related to the higher leaf area index basal area canopy cover and rainfall intensity reported in their study which enhanced stemflow production in this study thinning reduced stemflow percentage from 1 7 to 0 8 nevertheless there was a clear correlation between stemflow and pg for the control and thinned plots fig 2c and 2 g the mean slope of the regression line for the control plot 0 019 was higher than that for the thinned plot 0 011 indicating a higher proportion of rainwater diversion to stemflow in control than in thinned plot moreover at tree scale a higher 20 data not shown stemflow volume per tree was recorded in control plot than in thinned plot stemflow generation is controlled by many factors such as tree species deciduous evergreen etc tree density canopy structure branch angle canopy cover leaf mass etc and meteorological conditions rainfall amount intensity wind speed etc levia and frost 2003 in this study canopy structure at the tree scale did not differ significantly age height leaf mass branch angle etc between the two treatment plots therefore the differences in stemflow between the control and thinned plots could have come from differences in tree density and climatic conditions e g wet canopy evaporation rate and wind speed rather than in tree structure 4 2 factors influencing interception loss although interception loss in semiarid deciduous forests varies with forest species structure and climatic conditions our measurements fitted well into the ranges reported in various studies crockford and richardson 2000 he et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015 fathizadeh et al 2018 moreover the observed annual interception loss in the control plot 17 5 of pg was similar to that 17 6 of pg reported by ma et al 2019 but slightly lower than that 20 of pg noted by sadeghi et al 2016 for the same tree species in semiarid environments the larger canopy interception percentage reported by sadeghi et al 2016 compared with that in study could be explained by the larger basal area 32 1 m2 ha 1 in that study while for the thinned plot interception loss 11 3 of pg was smaller than these previously mentioned values but it was larger than that 8 6 of pg reported by wang et al 2013 for r pseudoacacia plantations of similar canopy cover 0 41 but lower basal area 7 4 m2 ha 1 this indicated that tree basal area is a key factor influencing canopy interception loss limousin et al 2008 pointed out that changes in interception percentage was comparable to changes in basal area in that study limousin et al 2008 observed interception loss in control and thinned plots in holm oak forests it was then noted that 33 of basal area reduction resulted in 34 reduction in interception loss a reduction ratio close to 1 del campo et al 2018 reported that interception loss in holm oak forests dropped by 60 after removing 41 of basal area with interception basal area reduction i ba ratio of 1 5 both of these results suggested that thinning has a higher efficiency in retaining net rainfall for the same basal area in holm oak forests in this study 38 basal area removal resulted in 35 reduction in interception loss with i ba ratio of 0 92 this was slightly lower than the above values but much larger than the ones 0 22 0 84 reported in other studies for more mature or less dense forests knoche 2005 ganatsios et al 2010 molina and del campo 2012 sadeghi et al 2016 in conclusion therefore a reduction in basal area in dense unmanaged forests like in this study can result in a greater retention of rainwater than is the case in more mature or less dense forests even though the i ba ratio was close to 1 in this study canopy rainwater evaporation did not increase or decrease in linear proportion to basal area thus some other factors like canopy related parameters of s c pt and st and climate related parameters like e r could influence canopy interception loss as stated earlier change in interception loss can be strongly driven by change in relative evaporation rate e r sensitivity analysis of the rgam model showed that 50 drop in e r results in 24 28 drop in interception loss in leafed season and 34 35 drop in leafless season however the same degree of reduction in s results in a decrease in predicted interception loss of 18 in leafed season and 5 2 in leafless season generally leaf area index and leaf amount are the main factors influencing s therefore the higher leaf area index and leaf amount in leafed season relative to leafless season were responsible for the higher sensitivity of s to interception loss in leafed season than in leafless season the results of sensitivity analysis of e r and s parameters in the revised gash model in this study were in agreement with those reported by deguchi et al 2006 fathizadeh et al 2018 and šraj et al 2008 it then suggested that interception loss in this study was influenced most by e r and s in leafed season and only by e r in leafless season canopy cover c a forest canopy parameter is also reported to be a sensitive parameter to interception loss as it is linearly correlated with leaf area index s and evaporation rate gash et al 1995 limousin et al 2008 shi et al 2010 muzylo et al 2012 however in this study sensitivity analysis of the gash model showed that 50 drop in c resulted in 6 5 drop in interception loss in leafed season and 2 8 in leafless season this suggested that canopy cover c was less sensitive in robinia pseudoacacia forests consistent with the findings by fan et al 2014 fathizadeh et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 pt and st were the two canopy parameters influencing the generation and depth of stemflow but were less sensitive to interception loss a similar sensitivity pattern was reported by fan et al 2014 and ma et al 2019 on the whole the rgam model was most sensitive to e r and s and then to c but less sensitive to pt and st also tree basal area influenced canopy interception loss 4 3 rgam and wimo model performances in terms of modeling error rgam model generally performed better in control plot than in thinned plot tables 5 and 6 even through the model apparently underestimate interception loss it had a good fit for observed and simulated interception loss and it also captured seasonal variations in both leafed and leafless seasons for the forest plots the 4 underestimation of predicted annual interception loss by rgam model with optimized wet canopy evaporation rate was similar under ct and th conditions within the range reported in other studies fan et al 2014 fathizadeh et al 2018 junqueira junior et al 2019 limousin et al 2008 shinohara et al 2015 muzylo et al 2009 concluded that expected modeling error for interception loss prediction can be as high as 20 in fact the 4 underestimation in this study fell on the lower side of the reported range for other forest ecosystems for small rainfall events interception loss was estimated accurately in both control and thinned plots for both the calibration and validation periods see figs 3 and 4 then for high rainfall events predicted interception loss moved further away from the 1 1 line in both forest plots especially in leafless season see fig 4 thus the modeling errors from high rainfall events were considered to be responsible for the underestimation of total interception loss fathizadeh et al 2018 limousin et al 2008 caution should therefore be exercised when using rgam model in regions with high rainfall events for high underestimation of interception loss like noted here fathizadeh et al 2018 and sadeghi et al 2015 had high estimation errors with rgam model as rainfall increased in terms of model efficiency the derived nash sutcliffe efficiency for the rgam model was higher for control plot 0 64 0 94 than for thinned plot 0 56 0 85 but comparable to some other values 0 44 0 94 reported for other forest ecosystems similar to rgam model the wimo model also underestimated observed interception loss throughout the study fan et al 2014 also observed a similar trend for pine plantation and banksia woodland in australia although for a much smaller relative error although wimo model tended to underestimate interception loss in this study it performed slightly better than rgam model in terms of relative error range of 6 0 to 4 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency range of0 80 to 0 91 tables 5 and 6 a similar result was reported by klingaman et al 2007 from performance comparison of three canopy interception models in a leafless deciduous forest stand in the united states for which nash sutcliffe efficiency was higher for wimo model 0 76 than for gash model 0 50 compared with leafed season underestimation in leafless season by rgam model for optimized wet canopy evaporation rate was higher tables 5 and 6 as mentioned above the higher underestimation in leafless season mainly occurred for high rainfall events this was illustrated in the movement of the predicted values further from the 1 1 line in leafless season for both forest plots figs 3 and 4 besides the underestimation was possibly induced by the overestimation of rainfall intensity during leafless season fan et al 2014 this is because small rainfall events occurred more frequently during this period and actual evaporation apparently occurred this suggested that rgam model predication was good for rainfall events where interception loss was mainly controlled by s and not by relative evaporation e r sadeghi et al 2015 in heavy rainfall events s was rapidly saturated and e r controlled interception loss this resulted in the large bias between measured and simulated values for wimo model however low and close modeling errors were obtained for leafed and leafless seasons tables 5 and table 6 this was probably because wimo model accounts for wind driven rainfall and the empirically derived correlation fig 2d and 2 h was applicable to both leafed and leafless seasons overall the performance of rgam and wimo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error and nash sutcliffe model efficiency the wimo model performed better than rgam model for ētf but performed slightly worse than optimized rgam model for the whole study period tables 5 and 6 the discrepancies in predicted interception loss between the rgam and wimo models was attributed to the basic assumptions in the models the rgam model considers individual rainfall events and assumes that rainfall occurs with sufficient time between events for water on the canopy and trunk to completely dry up gash 1979 the assumptions are questionable when the model is applied in regions with intermittent rainfall where the time intervals between consecutive rainfall events are not long enough for water on the canopy and trunk to completely dry up this caused loss of a large fractional of the rainwater under frequent canopy wetting cycles eventually leading to higher interception loss in excess of the simulated value by rgam model the wimo model has the same underlying equations as rgam model hörmann et al 1996 but accounts for the effect of wind speed on s this is close to what actually obtains for forest canopy and therefore a more accurate estimate of total interception loss moreover the variation in s with maximum wind speed umax was similar to those in forest ecosystems and seasons in a beech forest in northern germany hörmann et al 1996 found that an increase in umax caused a decrease in s also fan et al 2014 reported for pine plantation a native banksia woodland in australia similar findings in leafed season fig 2d the reason for which s decreases with increasing umax is because more intercepted rainwater drips down from the canopy from shaking by strong winds in contrast to these findings a positive correlation existed between s and umax in leafless season with s increasing logarithmically with umax fig 2h this is similar to that reported for leafless mixed deciduous forest stand in united states klingaman et al 2007 in leafless season rainfall intensity was lower and as wind speed increases the angle between rainfall and the horizontal decreased this increased the contact area between rainfall and canopy allowing trunks and branches to capture more rainwater and resulting in increased positive correlation between s and umax 5 conclusions in this study rainfall interception losses were measured and modeled in two robinia pseudoacacia forest plots in semiarid loess plateau region in china there were two plots a moderately thinned plot th with 38 basal area removed and a control plot ct for the study period january december 2015 observed throughfall stemflow and interception loss were respectively 80 8 1 7 and 17 5 of gross rainfall under ct the corresponding values for th were respectively 87 9 0 8 and 11 3 of gross rainfall the optimized rgam and wimo models were well calibrated and validated using filed data for both leafed and leafless seasons the models accurately predicted interception losses under ct and th and also effectively captured seasonal variations in canopy and meteorological parameters and in interception losses the rgam model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and canopy storage capacity in leafed season and to the ratio of mean evaporation to mean rainfall intensity in leafless season other parameters such as canopy cover proportion of rainwater diverted to stemflow and trunk storage capacity had little effect on canopy interception loss moreover 37 2 and 42 1 of the interception in leafed season were respectively evaporated from the canopy during and after rainfall event the corresponding values for the leafless season were respectively 49 3 and 22 4 overall the performance of the optimized rgam and wimo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error 6 9 2 9 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency 0 80 0 94 but the performance of the optimized rgam model was slightly superior to that of the wimo model under

5136,canopy interception loss is a key component of forest hydrological cycle that determine the amount of net rainfall reaching forest floor together with drought climate stressors affecting dryland forest plantations a good understanding of the relationship between canopy interception loss and forest management such as thinning is important for improved watershed management and ecological services in this study we measured event based rainfall partitioning for a thinned th with 38 basal area removed and a control ct robinia pseudoacacia forest plantation during leafed and leafless seasons in 2015 in the semiarid loess plateau region in china interception loss from both forest plots were simulated using the revised gash analytical model rgam and the wimo model the results showed that observed annual throughfall stemflow and interception loss were respectively 80 8 1 7 and 17 5 of the gross rainfall under ct the corresponding values under th were 87 9 0 8 and 11 3 respectively the rgam and wimo models were well calibrated and validated using filed data collected in leafed and leafless seasons the analyses suggested that models accurately predicated interception loss under both ct and th conditions and captured seasonal variations in canopy and meteorological parameters the rgam model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity and canopy storage capacity in leafed season and to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity in leafless season moreover 37 2 and 42 1 of the interception in leafed season evaporated from the canopy respectively during rainfall event and after rainfall the corresponding values for leafless season were respectively 49 3 and 22 4 overall the performance of the optimized rgam and wimo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error 6 9 2 9 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency 0 80 0 94 although that of the optimized rgam model was slightly superior to wimo model the models would facilitate the implementation of water oriented management in semiarid forest plantations through a more accurate simulation of the impact of thinning on interception loss keywords rainfall interception revised gash analytical model wimo model thinning loess plateau 1 introduction over the past few decades extensive afforestation and reforestation efforts have been made in the semiarid and arid regions around the world with the primary purpose of controlling desertification and soil erosion as a way of conserving the ecological environment malagnoux et al 2007 cao et al 2011 fao 2015 for instance in 2000 2010 49 billion ha of land were reforested or afforested with trees in dryland regions of the world accounting for an increase in forest cover of 0 8 14 7 to 15 5 hansen et al 2013 sexton et al 2013 bastin et al 2017 as the forest plantations get increasing important in terms of ecological services woody products soil retention habitat provisioning services carbon sequestration etc so also are criticisms increasing in terms of hydrological impacts farley et al 2005 sadeghi et al 2015 in these naturally water scarce areas annual water consumption of forest plantations can be nearly equal to total rainfall schiller and cohen 1998 this could reduce water yield and create potentially conflicting demands for water resources between humans and the ecosystem sun et al 2006 wang et al 2011 feng et al 2016 moreover most forest plantations grown as part of the reforestation and afforestation drive have suffered from poor forest management due to the low economic incentives compared with conventional forest products cao et al 2011 manrique alba et al 2015 this has resulted in high density stands planted forests high interception loss and high water consumption further substantially reducing water yield in these regions molina and del campo 2012 recently forest cover decline due to forest dieback or even mortality has been reported in some of the plantations this is believed to be caused mainly by drought stress and poor forest management du et al 2012 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 the question therefore arises as to whether silvicultural interventions can increase ecosystem resilience in the face of drought stress and future climate change one frequently discussed option to this rising concern is thinning of forest trees keenan 2015 sohn et al 2016 thinning is a common forest management practice done to reduce forest density and to improve tree quality su et al 2016 over the last decades experimental evidences from different forest ecosystems have confirmed that thinning can promote vigor of residual trees and reduce long term stress due to competition for water nutrients and light it can also increase the resilience and resistance of forest trees to severe drought stress and could therefore be an effective climate adaptation approach martín benito et al 2010 chmura et al 2011 gebhardt et al 2014 sohn et al 2016 cabon et al 2018 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 moreover thinning affects hydrological processes in forest ecosystems including transpiration evaporation rainfall partitioning soil water content and surface flow bréda et al 1995 vesala et al 2005 ganatsios et al 2010 gebhardt et al 2014 lechuga et al 2017 del campo et al 2019 among these canopy interception is an important component of the forest water cycle as it determines the amount of net rainfall reaching forest floor accounting for 9 60 of total rainfall crockford and richardson 2000 sadeghi et al 2015 del campo et al 2019 as interception loss is much lower in open than in dense forest canopies molina and del campo 2012 thinning can be done to reduce canopy interception loss in dense forest plantations due to its importance there have been numerous studies on canopy interception loss however most of these studies have been done in sub humid and tropical forest ecosystems dunkerley 2000 llorens and domingo 2007 molina and del campo 2012 in addition studies regarding the effects of thinning on canopy interception loss in unmanaged dryland forest plantations have rarely been reported as an alternative to direct monitoring of rainfall components i e throughfall and stemflow in the field and using empirical models canopy interception loss can be calculated from conceptual physically based models molina and del campo 2012 among these physically based canopy interception models over 15 of them the original and the revised gash analytical rgam models are most commonly used in estimating interception loss muzylo et al 2009 the original gash model is a simplified version of the rutter model rutter et al 1975 and it usually overestimates interception loss as it predicts overall plot area evaporation rather than canopy area evaporation gash et al 1995 the rgam model is a reformulated version of the original model for predicting sparse forest canopy interception loss gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 to account for the effect of wind speed on interception loss hörmann et al 1996 developed a dynamic wind controlled canopy interception model wimo this model can estimate canopy interception loss in areas where rainfall is influenced by wind the rgam model has been successfully applied extensively in various forest types under different climatic conditions there are applications of it in temperate forest gash et al 1995 herbst et al 2006 klingaman et al 2007 tropical forest fan et al 2014 junqueira junior et al 2019 continental forest carlyle moses and price 1999 and mediterranean forest limousin et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 conditions however the model has rarely been evaluated for dryland forest plantations sadeghi et al 2015 ma et al 2019 compared with rgam model only few studies have tested wimo model in simulating canopy interception loss klingaman et al 2007 fan et al 2014 shinohara et al 2015 in a leafless deciduous forest klingaman et al 2007 tested the abilities of three interception models for predicting interception loss and noted that wimo performed better than rgam model in another study fan et al 2014 compared rgam and wimo models for pine plantation and banksia woodland in australia and found that optimized rgam model performed better than wimo model most recently shinohara et al 2015 compared three interception models for a japanese cedar forest before and after intensive thinning and reported that wimo performed better than rgam model in terms of nash sutcliffe model efficiency the wimo model has not been reported in simulation of dryland forest plantations and comparison between rgam and wimo models are more seldom especially in unmanaged dryland forest plantations in dryland regions of the loess plateau like many other dryland regions in asia and central europe exotic robinia pseudoacacia have been planted with the primary purpose to control soil and water erosion avert desertification and produce timber and fuel wood keresztesi 1988 sadeghi et al 2016 ma et al 2017 vitkova et al 2017 the r pseudoacacia forest plantations in the loess plateau are mainly of the same genotype and coetaneous and have low levels of morphological differentiation the forests have formed even ages and pure stands and often with sparse understory herbaceous vegetation due to the natural conservation policy of the local government these forests have seldom been managed since their established resulting in unmanaged dense forest canopies that intercept more rainfall ma et al 2019 and consume more water than other native tree species wang et al 2008 jian et al 2015 drought induced tree dieback have recently been a frequent phenomenon in these plantations du et al 2011 therefore silvicultural interventions such as thinning could be required in r pseudoacacia plantations to increase resilience in the face of severe drought stress and future climate change in this study event based rainfall partitioning between moderately thinned with 38 basal area removed and the control r pseudoacacia forest plots were measured during both leafed and leafless seasons in 2015 the canopy interception losses were also modeled in leafed and leafless seasons using the two interception models the objectives of the study were to 1 quantify the effect of thinning on rainfall partitioning based on event measurements during leafed and leafless seasons 2 compare and contrast the performance of rgam and wimo models for both control and thinned forest plots in leafed and leafless seasons and 3 explore the underlying causes of the differences in interception loss between the control and thinned plots in leafed and leafless seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site 34 31 76 n 107 54 67 e is located in the yeheshan national forest ynf in fufeng county shannxi province china the landscape is a plateau with low rolling hills and deep valleys and has an elevation range of 449 1662 m a s l the predominant soil type is silt loam classified as inceptisols according to the united states department of agriculture usda it has a textural composition of 73 3 silt 20 9 clay and 5 8 sand the groundwater table sits at an average depth of over 50 m across the study area the climate is semiarid continental with an average temperature range of 1 in january and 23 in july the long term 1958 2016 average annual precipitation varies between 324 and 914 mm with 81 of the precipitation falling in the may october growing season the long term annual potential evapotranspiration in the region is 1217 mm some two times the annual precipitation these calculations are based on the long term climatic records 1958 2016 obtained from the fufeng bureau of meteorology the nearest 10 km meteorology station to the study area the prevailing winds blow from the southeast to the northwest during the growing season and from the northwest to the southeast during the dormant season the vegetation is dominated by deciduous woodlands of r pseudoacacia 75 pine plantation of p tabuliformis 15 and other tree species p orientalis p simonii p davidiana q wutaishansea and q variabili of 10 the r pseudoacacia forest stand in ynf was planted in the 1980 s on former farmlands and had poor management since as protective forests the measurements for this study were carried out in two representative rectangular forest plots 2500 m2 located in the center of the r pseudoacacia forest stand 400 m from each other in an un thinned control forest plot ct and a moderately thinned forest plot th of 38 of basal area removal the thinning was carried out in october 2014 and applied primarily to reduce stressed overtopped and suppressed growth or poor tree quality small sized dying trees this made it possible for a relatively homogeneous distribution and for further development of trees under natural conditions felled logs and branches thinned were removed from the treatment plot the detailed description of the forest plots is given in table 1 in this study the measurement period was divided into leafed season including leaf burst and senescence during the may october period and leafless season november april 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological measurements meteorological conditions were observed from an automatic weather station mounted on a 15 m high mast 2 m above the forest canopy in the center of the control plot ct solar radiation rn w m 2 was measured using a four component radiometer cnr4 kipp zonen netherlands air temperature t and relative humidity rh were measured using a thermohydrometer hmp155 vaisala helsinki finland then wind speed u m s 1 was measured using a 3d sonic anemometer thermometer cast3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to account for the effect of wind speed on canopy storage capacity wind speed in the treatment thinned th plot was also measured with the same type anemometer thermometer mounted on a 15 m high mast in the center of the thinned plot soil heat flux in each forest plot was measured using two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux thermal sensors the netherlands buried 5 cm below the forest floor one plate was placed in the tree row and the other outside the tree row to obtain a good estimate of soil heat flux within each forest plot all data were automatically sampled at 10 s interval and stored in a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa at 10 min interval 2 2 2 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements the measurements of rainfall throughfall and stemflow were conducted simultaneously for both ct and th for the period from 1st january 2015 to 31st december 2015 two procedures were used to avoid rainfall data gap in each forest plot during the measurement period i two automatic monitoring system was conducted using a t 200b type weighing bucket rain gauge geonor eiksmarka norway and ii two manual monitoring technique was performed using a manual rain gauge orifice area of 706 5 cm2 both rain gauges were installed nearby 30 m away each experimental plot at a sufficiently open place and positioned at 0 8 m above the ground to avoid rain splash and prevent damage by wild animals the horizontal angel between the rain gauge and the top of the nearest trees in this study was smaller than 45 this limited any disturbance of the gross rainfall measurement from the surrounding environment asdak et al 1998 fan et al 2014 the weighting bucket rain gauge had a resolution of 0 1 mm and provided rainfall intensity mm h 1 for the subsequent interception model calibration the manual rain gauges were read immediately after each rainfall event and a rain event was defined as a period with 0 2 mm of total rainfall separated by at least 6 h of rain break ma et al 2019 a good relationship was obtained between the weighting bucket rain gauge and manual measurements weight bucket gauge 1 016 manual gauge 0 031 r2 0 97 n 68 and therefore the rainfall data measured by the manual gauges were used to verify inconsistent recordings or missing data from the weighting bucket gauges throughfall was measured in the in between tree spaces in each forest plot using 30 manual rain gauges orifice area of 706 5 cm2 which were identical to those used for rainfall measurement all the gauges were covered by nylon mesh to prevent leaves and other debris from entering the collectors and also to reduce rainwater loss through splashing to account for spatial variability of throughfall the rain gauges were placed along three 50 m long transects 10 m apart on the forest floor with an average distance of 2 5 m between neighbouring gauges and half of those gauges were relocated to a new random position after every three rainfall events crockford and richardson 2000 ritter and regalado 2014 the stand scale throughfall depth was determined as the mean of the 30 collectors in each forest plot stemflow was measured for 13 trees in each forest plot the selected trees were representative of the dbh diameter at breast height range of the trees in the plots stemflow was sampled using spiral type stemflow collars constructed from plastic hoses a garden hose of 20 cm in diameter was attached to the boles and sealed in an upward spiral pattern with small gaps at the bottom of the collar filled with silicone sealant stemflow drippled down tree stems captured by collars and diverted to 50 l buckets placed at the bases of the sampled trees stemflow depth was calculated as 1 sf v sf ca where sf is stemflow depth mm vsf is stemflow volume l and ca is canopy area m2 the tree scale stemflow measurements were next upscaled to stand scale from the number of dbh classes and mean stemflow volume from the trees in each dbh class interception loss mm was calculated as the difference between the amount of rainfall and the sum of the throughfall and stemflow 2 3 model description in this study we tested the application of two canopy interception loss models that take into account the effects of canopy characteristics and climatic conditions on rainfall interception these were the rgam gash et al 1995 and the wimo hörmann et al 1996 models the two models were applied as described by klingaman et al 2007 and shinohara et al 2015 but further details are also given by fan et al 2014 the strategy used in the study was that part of the separate measurements from leafed and leafless seasons were used to calibrate the model and then used the other part of the data for model validation to account for seasonal variations in rainfall intensity and canopy parameters ghimire et al 2012 ma et al 2019 data for june august and october in leafed season dataset 1 and for march april and december in leafless season dataset 1 were used for model calibration the remaining data for may july and september in leafed season dataset 2 and january february and november in leafless season dataset 2 were used for model validation then the model was run continuously for the entire period of leafed and leafless seasons using the calibrated parameters 2 3 1 revised gash analytical model rgam the rgam model used for canopy interception loss assumes that rainfall pg is intercepted as a series of individual rainfall events but with enough time to completely dry on the canopy before the onset of another rainfall event gash 1979 each rainfall can be distinguished by discrete phrases i e wetting phrase saturation phrase and rainfall cessation phrase and is analyzed separately with threshold value of pg to determine whether a canopy is saturated the amount of rainfall necessary to saturate a canopy pg is calculated as 2 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r where r mm h 1 is mean rainfall intensity c is canopy cover ēc mm h 1 is mean evaporation rate per unite area of canopy cover calculated as ēc ē c and sc mm is canopy storage capacity per unit area of cover defined as sc s c for a given rainfall event the components of rainfall interception i mm were calculated as 3 i i un p g p g i w i s i a i t p g p g where i un mm is intercepted rainfall not enough to saturate canopy and is calculated as 4 i un c i 1 m p g i where m is the number of rainfall events that are insufficient to saturate the canopy iw is the evaporation of rainwater during wetting canopy phrase and is determined as 5 i w n c p g s c where n is the number of rainfall events sufficient to saturate the canopy is is the evaporation from saturated canopy during rainfall and is calculated as 6 i s c e c r i 1 n p g i p g and it is evaporation from tree trunk for q events that saturate tree trunk and is determined as 7 i t q s t p t i 1 n q p g i where st mm is trunk storage capacity and pt is rainfall fraction diverted into stemflow a more detailed description of the interception components in the rgam model is documented by gash et al 1995 2 3 2 wimo model the wimo model developed by hörmann et al 1996 accounts for the effect of wind speed on canopy interception loss which process is not considered in rgam model the wimo model uses the same underlaying equations as the gash 1979 model but has the additional function to vary canopy storage capacity per unit canopy area sc with maximum wind speed umax during rainfall event here sc as a function of umax was derived from a regression equation between umax and optimal canopy storage capacity so umax was determined using the collected meteorological data to find so for each rainfall event a bucket model that calculates throughfall tf i at an hourly time step was used table 2 8 t f i 1 c p g i i f c i s c 1 c p g i c i s c i f c i s c where ci is canopy water content and is calculated as 9 c i c i 1 p g i e a i where ea is actual evaporation rate and ci is reset to sc at the end of the time step for which it exceeds sc a fortran program was used to find so for each rainfall event by running the bucket model for each sc of 0 1 4 0 mm in 0 01 mm increments the sc was optimized to have the minimum rmse between observed and simulated throughfall a paired so and umax for each rainfall event was regressed to produce a regression equation for sc as a function of umax 2 4 model parameters 2 4 1 canopy parameters canopy storage capacity s for ct and th was estimated using the regression method wallace and mcjannet 2008 the negative intercept of the regression of the sum of throughfall and stemflow against rainfall large enough to saturate the canopy was assumed to be s following jackson 1975 free throughfall coefficient ρ was estimated as the slope of the linear regression between throughfall and rainfall amount insufficient to give a value exceeding s an alternative way of estimating ρ was also used via hemispherical photographs taken with a nikon d100 digital camera with fish eye lens during leafed and leafless periods and processed with the can eye software version 6 3 to do so 12 photos were taken at each forest plot in each month on cloudy days or close to sunrise or sunset under uniform sky conditions the camera was carefully oriented such that the edges of the photos were perpendicular to the tree row in the forest plot as no significant differences p 0 05 n 144 were detected in ρ values between the two methods used in this study ρ estimated from the regression method was used for canopy interception loss modeling st and pt were estimated following gash and morton 1978 as the negative intercept and slope of the linear regression between gross rainfall and stemflow all the parameters were determined in leafed and leafless seasons for ct and th table 4 2 4 2 wet canopy evaporation rate the mean evaporation rate ē from wet canopy during rainfall was calculated using three different methods i evaporation rate ēpm estimated using the penman monteith equation with canopy conductance set to infinity gash et al 1995 10 e pm δ r n g ρ a c p d g a λ δ γ where δ is slope of saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa k 1 rn is net solar radiation above canopy surface w m 2 g is soil surface heat flux w m 2 ρa is air density kg m 3 cp is specific heat of air j kg 1 k 1 d is vapor pressure deficit kpa λ is latent heat of vaporization of water kpa k 1 γ is psychometric constant j kg 1 and ga is aerodynamic conductance m s 1 determined as 11 g a k 2 u ln z d z 0 2 where k is the von kármán constant 0 41 u is wind speed m s 1 z is height at which wind speed and relative humidity were measured m d is zero plane displacement height m and z0 is roughness length controlling transfer of vapor heat and momentum m usually d and z0 are estimated from mean canopy height h in this study the values of d and z0 for forest plots were assumed to be 0 7 h and 0 1 h respectively fan et al 2014 ma et al 2019 ii the mean wet canopy evaporate ētf was also estimated from the value of e r as derived from the linear regression of gross rainfall versus interception loss iii the mean wet canopy evaporation rate ēopt was finally determined through optimization of e r by minimizing rmse between observed and simulated interception loss marquardt 1963 for the revised gash model the comparison between measured and simulated interception loss was done using the three evaporation rates during both leafed and leafless seasons then for the wimo model the comparison was done by using only optimized wet canopy evaporation rate 2 5 model evaluation the performances of the two canopy interception loss models were evaluated using relative error re and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency metric re is the percent error that quantifies the differences between simulated and observed measurements following muzylo et al 2009 the performance of the interception rainfall model in terms of re is classified as poor re 30 fair 10 re 30 good 5 re 10 very good 1 re 5 and extremely good re 1 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency metric assesses the performance of interception model as compared to the mean these two metrices are usually applied in hydrologic models 2 6 sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the parameters in the rgam model a sensitivity analysis was done with respect to canopy and climate related parameters for the leafed and leafless seasons under ct and th however no sensitivity analysis was done for the parameter s in the wimo model as it was estimated by the model itself in this study canopy related parameters s c pt and st and the meteorological parameter e r were considered their values were increased or decreased by up to 50 of the original values and the simulated values then compared to the filed measured ones 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the mean relative error in pg between two weighting bucket measurements was 2 2 indicating low spatial variability of pg over the study area the average values of measure data e g rainfall amount duration and intensity for the two weighting buckets were therefore used in the subsequent model analysis during the study a total of 85 rainfall events were measured the total rainfall depth was 732 2 mm 537 3 mm 73 4 of total pg in leafed season and 194 9 mm 26 6 of total pg in leafless season the distribution of rainfall amount and intensity during the leafed and leafless seasons are shown in fig 1 generally rainfall events with low depths were more frequent and contributed to the lower percent total pg than large rainfall events fig 1a and 1c rainfall events with low intensity in the range of 0 1 mm h 1 generally had a higher event frequency 50 of total event but with relatively lower percent 27 total rainfall amount in leafed season fig 1b in contrast to leafed season the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity was highly positively skewed in leafless season for both rainfall event and amount fig 1d this suggested that lower intensity rainfall events were much more frequent and had higher percent of the total rainfall 3 2 rainfall partitioning the ct and th plots partitioned rainfall differently for the study period measured annual throughfall was 591 8 mm under ct and 643 5 mm under th accounting respectively for 80 8 and 87 9 of the total pg table 3 the range of the average ratio of throughfall to pg was 78 5 85 5 for leafed season smaller than that observed for leafless season 87 2 94 4 the stand scale estimate of annual stemflow was 5 7 mm under th representing only 0 8 of the annual pg then the estimated stemflow was slightly higher under ct 12 7 mm estimated to be 1 7 of the annual pg similar to throughfall the mean ratio of stemflow to rainfall was slightly higher in leafless season 1 2 2 1 than in leafed season 0 6 1 6 for both forest plots however cumulative stemflow depth was higher in leafed season 3 4 8 7 mm than in leafless season 2 3 4 0 mm interception loss was estimated as the difference between pg and the sum of throughfall and stemflow in this study the estimated annual interception loss was 127 8 mm under ct and 83 0 mm under th respectively accounting for 17 5 and 11 3 of total pg in contrast to throughfall and stemflow the average ratio of interception loss to pg was significantly p 0 01 higher in leafed season than in leafless season under both ct and th 3 3 model parameterization linear regressions for pg and partitioned rainfall components e g throughfall stemflow and throughfall plus stemflow fig 2 and the derived canopy parameters table 4 for the leafed and leafless seasons under ct and th followed changes in canopy structure the estimated average s was 1 51 mm during the leafed season in ct which was about 5 times higher than the 0 28 mm value for leafless season fig 2b and 2f the estimated average s under th was much smaller than that under ct which were respectively 0 94 mm and 0 15 mm in leafed and leafless seasons free throughfall coefficient ρ estimated from regression fitting was significantly p 0 01 higher in leafless season than in leafed season for both forest plots fig 2a and 2e while under ct the calculated mean ρ was 0 19 in leafed season and 0 73 in leafless season the corresponding values under th were respectively 0 38 and 0 81 similar results were obtained for pt under both ct 0 021 in leafless season 0 016 in leafed season and th 0 014 in leafless season and 0 007 in leafed season fig 2c and 2 g in contrast to ρ and pt the estimated mean trunk storage capacity st was slightly higher in leafed season than in leafless season in both study plots fig 2c and 2 g specifically the mean values of st under ct were 0 097 mm in leafed season and 0 067 mm in leafless season and with the corresponding values under th of 0 041 and 0 028 mm respectively wet canopy evaporation rates estimated using the penman monteith equation and regression fitting method differed markedly table 4 the calculated ēpm by the penman monteith equation under ct during rainfall was 0 09 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 04 mm h 1 in leafless season the corresponding values under th were 0 10 mm h 1 and 0 05 mm h 1 respectively the e r values derived from linear regression analysis of rainfall amount against the sum of throughfall and stemflow under ct were 0 19 and 0 14 respectively for leafed and leafless seasons based on mean rainfall intensity of 1 52 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 73 mm h 1 in leafless season the values of the resultant ētf were respectively 0 29 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 10 mm h 1 in leafless season under th e r was estimated at 0 15 in leafed season and 0 08 in leafless season based on the same rainfall intensity under ct the calculated ētf valued were 0 23 mm h 1 in leafed season and 0 06 mm h 1 leafless season the effects of wind speed on canopy storage capacity are presented in fig 2d and 2 h significant correlations p 0 05 were found between ux and s under both ct and th in leafed season the estimated s apparently decreased with increasing ux whereas it increased with increasing ux in leafless season in the study a logarithmic regression equation of s 0 687ln ux 1 86 adjusted r 2 0 47 was obtained under ct and a power regression equation of s 1 48e 0 244 ux adjusted r 2 0 51 under th in leafed season these equations were used to determine s in the wimo model fig 2d in leafless season two logarithmic regression equations were derived under ct s 0 151ln ux 0 176 adjusted r 2 0 41 and th s 0 088ln ux 0 071 adjusted r 2 0 48 to determine s in the wimo model fig 2h 3 4 model calibration and validation the individual rainfall events observed during june august and october in leafed season and during march april and december in leafless season were used to calibrate the rgam and wimo models the calibrated models were next validated using measurements in may july and september in leafed season and january february and november in leafless season canopy and climatic parameters derived from the calibration dataset for the rgam and wimo models are given in table 4 the measured and simulated total interception loss in leafed season using three evaporation rates ēpm ētf and ēopt for the rgam model and using the optimized evaporation rate ēopt for the wimo model are summarized in table 5 and plotted in fig 3 on the whole the interception loss was underestimated to varying degrees by the two models table 5 the interception loss was largely underestimated for the rgam model using ēpm by 22 7 under ct and 25 2 under th while much better fits were obtained between simulated and observed values for the rgam model using ētf with the interception loss underestimation of only 9 8 under ct and 10 6 under th a minor underestimation was noted for the rgam model using ēopt with values of 2 9 under ct and 4 2 under th the performance of the rgam model improved a lot when run with ēopt with relative error reduced from 25 2 to 2 9 also the nash sutcliffe model efficiency increased from 0 68 to 0 88 using the system proposed by muzylo et al 2009 for rainfall interception models it indicated that the rgam model with ēopt was a very good model similar to the rgam model with ēopt the underestimation of interception loss by the wimo model was also small with a value of 4 2 under ct and 5 9 under th the wimo model with ēopt thus can be classified as a very good model and a good model for ct and th respectively table 5 the calibrated rgam and wimo models were then used to simulate interception loss for the months of may july and september the simulated interception loss of the rgam model with ēopt and ētf and of the wimo model agreed well with observations in the two plots the relative error was 13 3 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency was 0 71 under both ct and th table 5 the measured and simulated interception loss using ēpm ētf and ēopt for the rgam model and ēopt for the wimo model in leafless season are summarized in table 6 and plotted in fig 4 similar to the modeling results in leafed season interception loss was also underestimated by the two models in leafless season table 6 the underestimated interception loss was highest for rgam model with ēpm which were 34 1 under th and 30 8 under ct by replacing ēpm with ētf the differences between simulated and observed interception loss by the rgam model with underestimations of 11 3 under ct and 13 6 under th the use of ēopt significantly improved the predictions of interception loss by rgam model for both ct and th plots the underestimation reduced from 34 1 to 4 4 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency increased from 0 56 to 0 87 the predicted interception loss by the wimo model was underestimated by 4 8 under ct and 6 0 under th in leafless season the rgam and wimo models with ēopt were respectively classified as very good and good models under ct re 5 and under th 10 re 5 table 6 the calibrated rgam and wimo models were then validated using datasets for january february and november in leafless season similar to the results obtained with ētf and ēopt for rgam and wimo models under calibration the predicted interception loss also agreed well with filed measurements under validation with relative error 12 8 and modeling efficiency 0 79 table 6 different components of predicted interception loss by rgam model with ēopt are listed in table 7 the modeling results indicated that most of the interception evaporated from saturated canopy during and after rainfall in leafed and leafless seasons under both ct and th while in leafed season 37 8 and 41 5 of the predicted interception evaporated during and after rainfall under ct 36 6 and 42 7 respectively evaporated under th in contrast to leafed season more rainwater evaporated during rainfall in leafless season table 7 during leafless season 49 7 and 48 8 of the interception evaporated during rainfall respectively under ct and th only 21 1 and 23 6 evaporated after rainfall respectively under ct and th interception loss from other components were minimal except for tree trunks during leafless season modeling results suggested that 17 0 and 13 4 of the predicted interception evaporated from tree trunks respectively in ct and th plots in leafed season predicted cumulative total interception loss by rgam model with ēopt was 103 3 mm under ct and 71 1 mm under th with underestimations of 3 3 and 4 3 respectively fig 5 and table 7 the corresponding values for the wimo model were 102 mm under ct underestimation of 4 5 and 70 5 mm under th underestimation of 5 1 the rgam and wimo models were therefore classified separately as very good and good model for ct and th plots in leafed season compared with leafed season underestimated interception loss by the rgam model was larger in leafless season the cumulative total interception losses predicted by the rgam model with ēopt were 19 9 mm under ct underestimation of 4 9 and 8 4 mm under th underestimation of 3 0 the corresponding values for wimo model were 19 9 mm under ct underestimation of 4 8 and 8 3 mm under th underestimation of 4 6 fig 5 the rgam and wimo models were therefore classified as very good for leafless season in ct and th plots 3 5 sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the rgam model a sensitivity analysis with respect to five parameters s c pt st and e r was done in this study no sensitivity analysis was done for s in wimo model as it was estimated independently as a function of maximum wind speed fig 6 illustrates the results of the sensitivity analyses on the selected parameters relative to interception loss in rgam model in leafed season e r and s were the most sensitive parameters under both ct and th followed by c pt and st fig 6a and 6b when the values of e r s c pt and st were reduced by 50 the average values of interception loss for ct and th plots decreased respectively by 26 3 17 9 6 5 1 9 and 1 1 in leafless season e r was the most sensitive parameter in both forest plots followed by pt s c and st fig 6c and 6d when the values of e r pt s c and st were reduced by 50 the average values of interception loss for the two plots dropped respectively by 35 6 1 5 2 2 8 and 1 5 on the whole the rgam model was most sensitive to e r and s in leafed season and e r in leafless season for both ct and th plots 4 discussions 4 1 throughfall and stemflow the observed throughfall in the control plot 80 8 of pg for the entire period was similar to that 81 1 of pg reported by ma et al 2019 however it was slightly higher than that record 72 9 of pg by sadeghi et al 2016 for a semiarid r pseudoacacia plantation in iran the larger differences in throughfall percentage between the values in our study and those of sadeghi et al 2016 could be related to the differences in leaf area index and canopy cover the larger leaf area index and canopy cover reported in their study intercepted more rainwater during rainfall than the one noted in our study thereby reducing the amount of rainfall going into throughfall while in the thinned plot the observed annual throughfall 87 9 of pg was larger than that reported above it was slightly lower than the one 89 1 of pg observed by wang et al 2013 in a r pseudoacacia plantation in the semiarid loess plateau region with a similar canopy cover but lower basal area the reason for this slightly difference between our study and that of wang et al 2013 could be due to the higher rainfall intensity 2 82 mm h 1 and lower evaporation rate 0 11 mm h 1 recorded in their study compared to the values recorded in this study rainfall intensity 1 1 mm h 1 and evaporation rate 0 18 mm h 1 thinning can be an important management tool to modify forest throughfall in our forest plots thinning increased throughfall percentage from 80 8 to 87 9 but decreased average canopy cover c from 54 to 41 shinohara et al 2015 compared throughfall percentage for the periods before and after thinning and found a difference of 12 of pg comparable to that in canopy cover 12 5 in this study a difference of 13 in c resulted in a difference of only 7 in throughfall suggesting that there was no comparable relationship between the differences in c and throughfall similar to this study molina and del campo 2012 found that the difference in c was not comparable to that in interception loss with that in c in the range of 19 67 and that in interception in the range of 5 28 this indicated that aside from canopy cover other canopy or meteorological parameters such as leaf area index basal area and wet canopy evaporation rate influence throughfall generation in forest plantations compared with throughfall stemflow in this study represented only a small fraction of the hydrological input to forest floor the observed average annual stemflow of 1 7 of pg in control plot and 0 8 of pg in thinned plot was similar to the ones 1 3 2 3 of pg observed by ma et al 2019 and wang et al 2013 but much smaller than the values 7 1 of pg reported by sadeghi et al 2016 the much higher stemflow percentage reported by sadeghi et al 2016 compared with ours could be related to the higher leaf area index basal area canopy cover and rainfall intensity reported in their study which enhanced stemflow production in this study thinning reduced stemflow percentage from 1 7 to 0 8 nevertheless there was a clear correlation between stemflow and pg for the control and thinned plots fig 2c and 2 g the mean slope of the regression line for the control plot 0 019 was higher than that for the thinned plot 0 011 indicating a higher proportion of rainwater diversion to stemflow in control than in thinned plot moreover at tree scale a higher 20 data not shown stemflow volume per tree was recorded in control plot than in thinned plot stemflow generation is controlled by many factors such as tree species deciduous evergreen etc tree density canopy structure branch angle canopy cover leaf mass etc and meteorological conditions rainfall amount intensity wind speed etc levia and frost 2003 in this study canopy structure at the tree scale did not differ significantly age height leaf mass branch angle etc between the two treatment plots therefore the differences in stemflow between the control and thinned plots could have come from differences in tree density and climatic conditions e g wet canopy evaporation rate and wind speed rather than in tree structure 4 2 factors influencing interception loss although interception loss in semiarid deciduous forests varies with forest species structure and climatic conditions our measurements fitted well into the ranges reported in various studies crockford and richardson 2000 he et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015 fathizadeh et al 2018 moreover the observed annual interception loss in the control plot 17 5 of pg was similar to that 17 6 of pg reported by ma et al 2019 but slightly lower than that 20 of pg noted by sadeghi et al 2016 for the same tree species in semiarid environments the larger canopy interception percentage reported by sadeghi et al 2016 compared with that in study could be explained by the larger basal area 32 1 m2 ha 1 in that study while for the thinned plot interception loss 11 3 of pg was smaller than these previously mentioned values but it was larger than that 8 6 of pg reported by wang et al 2013 for r pseudoacacia plantations of similar canopy cover 0 41 but lower basal area 7 4 m2 ha 1 this indicated that tree basal area is a key factor influencing canopy interception loss limousin et al 2008 pointed out that changes in interception percentage was comparable to changes in basal area in that study limousin et al 2008 observed interception loss in control and thinned plots in holm oak forests it was then noted that 33 of basal area reduction resulted in 34 reduction in interception loss a reduction ratio close to 1 del campo et al 2018 reported that interception loss in holm oak forests dropped by 60 after removing 41 of basal area with interception basal area reduction i ba ratio of 1 5 both of these results suggested that thinning has a higher efficiency in retaining net rainfall for the same basal area in holm oak forests in this study 38 basal area removal resulted in 35 reduction in interception loss with i ba ratio of 0 92 this was slightly lower than the above values but much larger than the ones 0 22 0 84 reported in other studies for more mature or less dense forests knoche 2005 ganatsios et al 2010 molina and del campo 2012 sadeghi et al 2016 in conclusion therefore a reduction in basal area in dense unmanaged forests like in this study can result in a greater retention of rainwater than is the case in more mature or less dense forests even though the i ba ratio was close to 1 in this study canopy rainwater evaporation did not increase or decrease in linear proportion to basal area thus some other factors like canopy related parameters of s c pt and st and climate related parameters like e r could influence canopy interception loss as stated earlier change in interception loss can be strongly driven by change in relative evaporation rate e r sensitivity analysis of the rgam model showed that 50 drop in e r results in 24 28 drop in interception loss in leafed season and 34 35 drop in leafless season however the same degree of reduction in s results in a decrease in predicted interception loss of 18 in leafed season and 5 2 in leafless season generally leaf area index and leaf amount are the main factors influencing s therefore the higher leaf area index and leaf amount in leafed season relative to leafless season were responsible for the higher sensitivity of s to interception loss in leafed season than in leafless season the results of sensitivity analysis of e r and s parameters in the revised gash model in this study were in agreement with those reported by deguchi et al 2006 fathizadeh et al 2018 and šraj et al 2008 it then suggested that interception loss in this study was influenced most by e r and s in leafed season and only by e r in leafless season canopy cover c a forest canopy parameter is also reported to be a sensitive parameter to interception loss as it is linearly correlated with leaf area index s and evaporation rate gash et al 1995 limousin et al 2008 shi et al 2010 muzylo et al 2012 however in this study sensitivity analysis of the gash model showed that 50 drop in c resulted in 6 5 drop in interception loss in leafed season and 2 8 in leafless season this suggested that canopy cover c was less sensitive in robinia pseudoacacia forests consistent with the findings by fan et al 2014 fathizadeh et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 pt and st were the two canopy parameters influencing the generation and depth of stemflow but were less sensitive to interception loss a similar sensitivity pattern was reported by fan et al 2014 and ma et al 2019 on the whole the rgam model was most sensitive to e r and s and then to c but less sensitive to pt and st also tree basal area influenced canopy interception loss 4 3 rgam and wimo model performances in terms of modeling error rgam model generally performed better in control plot than in thinned plot tables 5 and 6 even through the model apparently underestimate interception loss it had a good fit for observed and simulated interception loss and it also captured seasonal variations in both leafed and leafless seasons for the forest plots the 4 underestimation of predicted annual interception loss by rgam model with optimized wet canopy evaporation rate was similar under ct and th conditions within the range reported in other studies fan et al 2014 fathizadeh et al 2018 junqueira junior et al 2019 limousin et al 2008 shinohara et al 2015 muzylo et al 2009 concluded that expected modeling error for interception loss prediction can be as high as 20 in fact the 4 underestimation in this study fell on the lower side of the reported range for other forest ecosystems for small rainfall events interception loss was estimated accurately in both control and thinned plots for both the calibration and validation periods see figs 3 and 4 then for high rainfall events predicted interception loss moved further away from the 1 1 line in both forest plots especially in leafless season see fig 4 thus the modeling errors from high rainfall events were considered to be responsible for the underestimation of total interception loss fathizadeh et al 2018 limousin et al 2008 caution should therefore be exercised when using rgam model in regions with high rainfall events for high underestimation of interception loss like noted here fathizadeh et al 2018 and sadeghi et al 2015 had high estimation errors with rgam model as rainfall increased in terms of model efficiency the derived nash sutcliffe efficiency for the rgam model was higher for control plot 0 64 0 94 than for thinned plot 0 56 0 85 but comparable to some other values 0 44 0 94 reported for other forest ecosystems similar to rgam model the wimo model also underestimated observed interception loss throughout the study fan et al 2014 also observed a similar trend for pine plantation and banksia woodland in australia although for a much smaller relative error although wimo model tended to underestimate interception loss in this study it performed slightly better than rgam model in terms of relative error range of 6 0 to 4 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency range of0 80 to 0 91 tables 5 and 6 a similar result was reported by klingaman et al 2007 from performance comparison of three canopy interception models in a leafless deciduous forest stand in the united states for which nash sutcliffe efficiency was higher for wimo model 0 76 than for gash model 0 50 compared with leafed season underestimation in leafless season by rgam model for optimized wet canopy evaporation rate was higher tables 5 and 6 as mentioned above the higher underestimation in leafless season mainly occurred for high rainfall events this was illustrated in the movement of the predicted values further from the 1 1 line in leafless season for both forest plots figs 3 and 4 besides the underestimation was possibly induced by the overestimation of rainfall intensity during leafless season fan et al 2014 this is because small rainfall events occurred more frequently during this period and actual evaporation apparently occurred this suggested that rgam model predication was good for rainfall events where interception loss was mainly controlled by s and not by relative evaporation e r sadeghi et al 2015 in heavy rainfall events s was rapidly saturated and e r controlled interception loss this resulted in the large bias between measured and simulated values for wimo model however low and close modeling errors were obtained for leafed and leafless seasons tables 5 and table 6 this was probably because wimo model accounts for wind driven rainfall and the empirically derived correlation fig 2d and 2 h was applicable to both leafed and leafless seasons overall the performance of rgam and wimo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error and nash sutcliffe model efficiency the wimo model performed better than rgam model for ētf but performed slightly worse than optimized rgam model for the whole study period tables 5 and 6 the discrepancies in predicted interception loss between the rgam and wimo models was attributed to the basic assumptions in the models the rgam model considers individual rainfall events and assumes that rainfall occurs with sufficient time between events for water on the canopy and trunk to completely dry up gash 1979 the assumptions are questionable when the model is applied in regions with intermittent rainfall where the time intervals between consecutive rainfall events are not long enough for water on the canopy and trunk to completely dry up this caused loss of a large fractional of the rainwater under frequent canopy wetting cycles eventually leading to higher interception loss in excess of the simulated value by rgam model the wimo model has the same underlying equations as rgam model hörmann et al 1996 but accounts for the effect of wind speed on s this is close to what actually obtains for forest canopy and therefore a more accurate estimate of total interception loss moreover the variation in s with maximum wind speed umax was similar to those in forest ecosystems and seasons in a beech forest in northern germany hörmann et al 1996 found that an increase in umax caused a decrease in s also fan et al 2014 reported for pine plantation a native banksia woodland in australia similar findings in leafed season fig 2d the reason for which s decreases with increasing umax is because more intercepted rainwater drips down from the canopy from shaking by strong winds in contrast to these findings a positive correlation existed between s and umax in leafless season with s increasing logarithmically with umax fig 2h this is similar to that reported for leafless mixed deciduous forest stand in united states klingaman et al 2007 in leafless season rainfall intensity was lower and as wind speed increases the angle between rainfall and the horizontal decreased this increased the contact area between rainfall and canopy allowing trunks and branches to capture more rainwater and resulting in increased positive correlation between s and umax 5 conclusions in this study rainfall interception losses were measured and modeled in two robinia pseudoacacia forest plots in semiarid loess plateau region in china there were two plots a moderately thinned plot th with 38 basal area removed and a control plot ct for the study period january december 2015 observed throughfall stemflow and interception loss were respectively 80 8 1 7 and 17 5 of gross rainfall under ct the corresponding values for th were respectively 87 9 0 8 and 11 3 of gross rainfall the optimized rgam and wimo models were well calibrated and validated using filed data for both leafed and leafless seasons the models accurately predicted interception losses under ct and th and also effectively captured seasonal variations in canopy and meteorological parameters and in interception losses the rgam model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and canopy storage capacity in leafed season and to the ratio of mean evaporation to mean rainfall intensity in leafless season other parameters such as canopy cover proportion of rainwater diverted to stemflow and trunk storage capacity had little effect on canopy interception loss moreover 37 2 and 42 1 of the interception in leafed season were respectively evaporated from the canopy during and after rainfall event the corresponding values for the leafless season were respectively 49 3 and 22 4 overall the performance of the optimized rgam and wimo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error 6 9 2 9 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency 0 80 0 94 but the performance of the optimized rgam model was slightly superior to that of the wimo model under all the treated conditions this study may make a contribution to the implementation of water oriented management in semiarid deciduous forest plantations by explicitly addressing issues related to the magnitude and efficiency of thinning treatments on net rainfall through modeling approaches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

5137,inundation analysis is one of the core aspects of flash flood prevention and control in mountainous area remote sensing technology can conveniently extract submerged region of a large flood but infeasible to dynamically obtain flood inundating process in a high temporal resolution meanwhile it is difficult to establish a suitable hydrodynamics based inundation model under conditions of complex terrain moreover such model usually requires huge input data and long simulation time the bulk method bm can quickly calculate flood inundation extent given the total water yield in the catchment and local digital elevation model dem however the traditional bm is only applicable for relatively flat terrain in order to apply bm to calculation of the flash flood inundation extent in the catchment of large elevation difference the differential bm based on differential element theory is proposed in this paper in the method the main flood channel is divided into a certain number of differential channel segments in which the local elevation difference is relatively small and the bm can be soundly applied the flood inundation extent of the whole channel can be obtained by combining the maximum inundation extents of all differential channel segments furthermore it is the key to determine the optimal number of channel segments by repeating the prior steps of the proposed method until the area change ratio of the total inundation extents calculated in two consecutive loops is less than the specified threshold value taking zharugou catchment as the study area we obtained the approximate maximum inundation extent of a once in 10 year flood occurred there on july 10th 2018 as the calculation results were generally in good agreement with the field measuring data it demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the differential bm in approximately calculating the maximum flood inundation extent in a small ungauged catchment with sharp elevation variation keywords flash flood inundation extent bulk method bm differential channel segment sub catchment 1 introduction flash flood is a local flood of short duration generally resulting from heavy rainfall in the immediate vicinity mish 1998 it is one of the most serious natural disasters in mountainous areas usually causing disasters such as building collapse traffic disruption human and livestock casualties and crop inundation with the increment of extreme rainfall events in recent years the risk of flash floods is also dramatically increasing jonkman 2005 bloeschl et al 2019 the damages caused by flash floods mainly include strong scouring and erosion and widespread inundation it is the basis of flash flood disaster control planning ffdcp to calculate and analyze the inundation region chang et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 burn and whitfield 2015 many efforts have been made to study flood inundation which can be categorized into three types from the perspective of research methods remote sensing extraction hydrodynamic simulation and inundation calculation based on digital elevation model dem satellite remote sensing can conveniently extract the inundation extent of a large flood and analyze its change from time series remotely sensed imagery but limited by the fixed revisit period it cannot obtain the flood extent in a timely manner especially for a flash flood which has small spatial extent and short duration feng et al 2012 schumann and moller 2015 pekel et al 2016 chen et al 2019 psomiadis et al 2019 although aerial remote sensing can be flexibly deployed its applications in flash flood monitoring are still seriously restricted by complex terrain and weather conditions clement et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 tsyganskaya et al 2018 agnihotri et al 2019 based on hydrodynamic models the hydrodynamic methods mathematically express the physical laws of flood movement and then obtain the inundation extent the simulation results can reflect the flow law of flood but the modeling process is complex and a great deal of gauge data is required besides it is difficult to build proper hydrodynamic models under conditions of complex terrain and abrupt floods as requiring large amount of calculation and long simulating time the hydrodynamic models are rarely used for rapid flood forecasting and assessing chen and liu 2014 teng et al 2017 hoch et al 2019 the hydrological method is to delineate the flood inundation extent based on local dem according to the water level or discharge calculated by the adapted hydrological model compared with the hydrodynamic method it requires less calculation and is able to quickly simulate flood inundating process and calculate inundated extent wang 2010 zhang and pan 2014 bermúdez et al 2018 various dem based methods for obtaining flood inundation extent have been proposed in the literature which can be divided into two categories delineation solely based on dem and calculation with known water level or water discharge the sole dem based methods are actually flood hazard zoning and usually used as ancillary data to monitor flooded areas of extreme weather events for example the height above the nearest drainage hand produces the contour map of flood hazard along the drainage network nobre et al 2016 and the geomorphic flood index gfi delineates the flood prone area into different hazard levels according to morphological descriptors of poorly gauged basins samela et al 2017 in water level based calculation methods the flood area is approximately considered as a horizontal plane and all the regions where the topographic elevation are lower than the given water level belong to the inundation extent the specific implementations of water level method include region growing algorithm liu et al 2009 seed spread algorithm liu and liu 2001 xu et al 2018 adaptive water level correction algorithm ding et al 2013 and flood connected domain calculation method zhang et al 2014 these implementations are all based on given flood water level and cannot be applied in ungauged areas the bulk method bm calculates flood inundation extent according to the principle that the volume of water yield of a flood caused by a strong rainfall is equal to that of accumulated flood water in the inundation area jiang et al 2006 li et al 2012 cai et al 2013 the theoretical basis and calculation process of bm are clear however the bm has a precondition for calculating the flood inundation extent the terrain of the target inundation area is relatively flat as flash flood usually occurred in a small catchment with large elevation difference the bm cannot be directly applied taking the bm as an example when it is applied in a small catchment with large elevation difference the flood water will accumulate in the lower reaches of the valley channel while the middle and upper reaches are not inundated this phenomenon is very different from the actual situation and it does not accurately reflect the spatiotemporal characteristics of flood inundating process along the valley of the catchment therefore it is a very challenging and meaningful task to modify existing flood inundation calculation methods and make them suitable for a small catchment with sharp elevation variation in this paper we proposed a differential bm to approximately calculate the maximum inundation extent of the flash flood occurred in a small mountainous catchment with large elevation difference in section 2 the study area of zharugou catchment and the used materials are briefly introduced then the proposed methodology is described in detail in section 3 including estimation of maximum instantaneous flood water volume general inundation extent calculation with the bm modification of bm with differential element theory and determination of the number of differential channel segments the results are presented and analyzed in section 4 including the optimal number of channel segments the estimated maximum instantaneous water volume and the calculated inundation information in each channel segment and the combined inundation extent of the whole flood channel the accuracy assessment of the calculated inundation depths against measured water depths at verification spots is carried out in section 5 and the potential errors and uncertainties are also discussed in section 6 the conclusion is draw that the differential bm is effective in calculating the approximate maximum inundation extent of a flash flood and the particularly applicable conditions are also listed 2 study area and data 2 1 study area zharugou catchment 33 7 48 33 16 5 n 103 55 36 104 3 39 e is located in jiuzhaigou county southwest china fig 1 the catchment has an area of 104 89 km2 and belongs to a humid plateau climate with an average annual precipitation of 690 mm the rain season is mainly from may to september and the extreme rainfall usually occurred in july zhou et al 2006 wang and zhang 2018 wen et al 2019 zharugou valley is a branch of the prestigious scenic area jiuzhaigou valley and the length of its main valley channel is about 20 54 km the elevation of the debouchure of zharugou valley is 2071 m the end of the main channel is 3282 m and their relative elevation is as high as 1211 m the large elevation difference and the intensive rainfall have formed favorable conditions for flash floods there are several settlements in the valley and rexi village is the nearest one to the flood channel when a flash flood breaks out the runoffs from both sides of the valley and from the upstream converge to form a violent torrent that rushes down the valley channel and makes the water level sharply rising up and brings serious damages to the settlements and infrastructures therefore zharugou catchment is an ideal experimental area and the strong flash flood occurred there on july 10th 2018 was taken as an example for studying the calculation of inundation extent 2 2 data and materials the data and materials used in the study includes the local dem the rainfall and flood data of the example flash flood and historical floods and the field measured water depth data 1 dem data as the accurate dem of the zharugou catchment is unavailable we downloaded a workable alternative from google earth wang et al 2017 due to the rough spatial resolution of 8 m and the existence of noise pixels the drainage network of the catchment directly extracted from the dem has the zigzag effect in some segments fig 2 a in the study we did fill resampling and focus statistics to eliminate the zigzag effect and interpolating to improve the spatial resolution of dem to 2 m the corresponding segments of the drainage network extracted from the processed dem were shown in fig 2b 2 rainfall and flood data there are generally three methods to calculate flood peak discharge in ungauged basin hydrologic simulation zhang 2011 regional empirical formula el hames 2012 and rational formula rf dhakal et al 2012 grimaldi and petroselli 2015 rf is the main method for estimating flood peak discharge especially in the small catchment of the mountainous area less than 500 km2 wang et al 2010 according to the historical rainfall and flood records of the study area the return period of the example flash flood occurred on july 10th 2018 was determined as once in 10 years then the peak discharge could be calculated with rf based on the 10 year return period 3 field measured flood depth in order to verify the calculated inundation some places in zharugou valley were selected as verification spots of the example flash flood and their 3d coordinates and inundated depths were recorded through inquiry surveys and field measurements according to the survey there is only one road that enters the valley along the downstream of the zharugou valley this road is cut off at about mid reach because the upper reach is getting steeper and narrower and there are no settlements there it no longer has the conditions and value for road construction therefore it is nearly impossible to obtain upstream field flood data the spatial locations of the six verification spots from s1 to s6 are shown in fig 1 and their specific data are listed in table 1 3 methodology in the study the differential bm is proposed to approximately calculate the maximum inundation extent of a flash flood occurred in a small catchment with large elevation difference first it needs to divide the main valley channel into a certain number of segments according to the assigned elevation difference initialized with the elevation difference of the whole valley channel secondly based on the flood return period determined by historical rainfall and flood records and the parameters extracted from the dem of each sub catchment the peak discharge in each differential channel segment can be calculated with rf method and then the maximum instantaneous flood water volume can be estimated by multiplying the peak discharge with the time when the flash flood flows through the channel segment thirdly the inundation extent in each differential channel segment can be obtained based on the local dem and the flood water volume yielded in the corresponding sub catchment using bm fourthly the tentative inundation extent of the whole valley channel can be achieved by combining all differential inundation extents finally it is necessary to repeat the steps 1 4 according to half of the previous elevation difference until the area change ratio of the tentative inundation extents calculated in two consecutive loops is less than the specified threshold value then the optimal number of differential channel segments is determined and the final inundation extent of the whole valley channel is obtained thus the information of the final inundation extent such as the spatial boundary the area and the water depth distribution can be extracted on demand the detailed flowchart is shown in fig 3 3 1 maximum instantaneous water volume estimation when a flash flood occurred the flood discharge was increasing from upstream to downstream with the continuous collection of runoffs from both sides of the valley as shown in fig 4 for any cross section on the flood channel the local flood hydrograph is an asymmetrical curve with a peak value in the middle part and low values on both sides generally it is around the peak discharge that the inundation extent in a certain segment of the flood channel reaches the maximum one since the accurate flood hydrograph of each channel segment is usually unavailable the maximum instantaneous flood water volume w can be estimated as the area of the gray rectangle in the fig 4 with eq 1 1 w q max t where q max is the flood peak discharge and t is the time when the flash flood flows through the channel segment the flood peak discharge q max is calculated with the rf method and the formula is as follows chen and zhang 1966 2 q max 0 278 φ s τ n f where φ is the runoff coefficient of the flood peak s is the rainfall intensity τ is the runoff confluence time of the rainstorm f is the catchment area n is the attenuation index of the rainstorm and 0 278 is the unit conversion coefficient to calculate the parameters in eq 2 the rainfall data including the 1 hour h 1 6 hour h 6 average rainfall intensities and the corresponding coefficients of variation c v 1 and c v 6 can be obtained based on the rainfall contour maps from the rainstorm and flood calculation manual of medium and small basins in sichuan province shen et al 1984 then φ s τ and n can be computed using the empirical equations in the literature liu et al 2014 which directly or indirectly involve in the modulus coefficients obtained according to the different return periods of flash floods the flood flowing time t in the channel segment is calculated using eq 3 3 t l s v s where ls is the length of the flood channel segment and vs is the flood averaged flowing velocity the flash flood flowing velocity vs can be calculated with manning formula xia et al 2017 4 v s 1 n c r c 2 3 j c 1 2 where r c is the hydraulic radius of the flash flood and is usually replaced by the average water depth j c is the hydraulic slope namely the channel slope and n c is the roughness coefficient and determined from an assignment table which is produced based on the flash flood characteristics and channel conditions 3 2 inundation extent calculation the bm is a simplified inundation model that can quickly calculate the flood inundation extent based on the water yield volume of a flood its principle is that the volume of water yield by a flood is equal to that of the accumulated water in the inundation area given the maximum water yield volume of a flood w the maximum inundation extent and depth distribution can be calculated with the following equation bai 2001 5 w a e w x y e g x y d σ where a is the inundation extent e w x y is the flood surface elevation e g x y is the ground elevation x y a d σ is the differential area element of the inundation extent as the inundation extent calculation is usually based on a raster dem a can be decomposed into a certain number of pixel grid cells each grid cell has its own elevation value in order to facilitate calculation the flood surface which is usually a complex curved surface is simplified to a horizontal plane thus eq 5 can be converted as follows 6 w i 1 k s h e i where s is the real area that a pixel grid cell represents h is the elevation of the flood water level ei is the elevation of the i th pixel grid cell k is the number of pixel grid cells in the inundation extent a relationship can be established between the water yield volume of a flood and the estimated water volume of the inundation extent 7 f h v w v i 1 k s h e i where v is the water yield volume of a flood and f h is the difference between v and w in the above nonlinear equation the values of the two parameters k and h are both undetermined if one specific value is given to one of the two parameters the unique value of the other parameter can be also determined nevertheless it is so inefficient to determine k and h using a general search algorithm which traverses the first possible value to the last one usually an approximation algorithm such as binary search is used to improve the calculation efficiency cai et al 2013 cham et al 2015 argyrios et al 2019 the binary search approximation algorithm will be continuously executed until the f h is less than a threshold value determined by experiments once the values of k and h are determined the inundation depth h i and the total inundation area a can be obtained with eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 h i h e i 9 a k s 3 3 inundation calculation with differential bm although simple and efficient the bm is usually applied to the calculation of the flood inundation in the region where the terrain is relatively flat if the bm is directly applied to calculating the inundation extent of a flash flood occurred in a small catchment with large elevation difference a totally wrong result will be attained inspired by the differential element theory guru and hiziroglu 2009 we divide the main valley channel in the catchment into a certain number of differential channel segments when the differential channel segments are short enough the terrain of each differential channel segment becomes relatively flat enough to apply bm thus the downstream endpoint of each differential channel segment is considered as the outlet of the corresponding sub catchment shown in fig 5 a the bm is applied to each sub catchment to calculate the flood inundation in each corresponding differential channel segment and the inundation extent of the whole valley channel can be finally obtained by combining the inundation extents of all differential channel segments this method is called differential bm as shown in fig 5b the main flood channel is divided into n segments according to a constant elevation difference e the downstream endpoints of channel segments are denoted as p 1 p 2 p n the upstream endpoint of the main channel is p 0 the elevation of p 0 is represented as e 0 the elevation of p 1 is e 1 and similarly the elevation of p n is en then they should satisfy the following formula 10 e e 0 e n n although the channel segments have the same elevation difference e their lengths are various the channel segment length between p 0 and p 1 is l 1 and the channel segment length between p n 1 and p n is l n when n tends to infinity the length of the main flood channel l can be expressed as 11 l n 1 dl where dl is the differential element of the main channel length however n is usually set to a finite integer in consideration of dem resolution and computational cost therefore eq 11 can be further simplified as follows 12 l i 1 n l i as shown in fig 5a the whole catchment is denoted as c then the sub catchment corresponding to outlet p 1 is c1 and the sub catchment corresponding to p n 1 is cn 1 the sub catchment cn corresponding to p n is actually c the whole catchment and all sub catchments have an inclusion relationship in set theory which can be expressed as follows 13 c c n c n 1 c 1 as p 1 p n are the outlets of sub catchments c1 cn the flood peak discharges q 1 q n at p 1 p n can be calculated with various areas of c 1 c n and other shared parameters then the maximum instantaneous flood water volumes w 1 w n can be estimated as the products of q 1 q n and the times t 1 t n when the flash flood flows through the channel segments l 1 l n then the corresponding inundation extents a 1 a n and the water surface elevation h 1 h n can be obtained using the bm finally the inundation extent of the whole valley channel a can be achieved by combining a 1 a n the whole inundation extent and all sub extents have a union relationship which can be expressed as follows 14 a a 1 a n 1 a n according to eq 8 the inundation depth of any spot in a n is the difference between h n and the corresponding ground elevation which is usually acquired from local dem data 3 4 determination of differential channel segment number according to eq 10 the smaller e is the bigger the number of differential channel segments n is with the increasing of n the calculated result of a will gradually increase and converge and the required computational cost is also greatly rising in order to accelerate the convergence process let n increase as 2 i i 0 1 2 and the corresponding a is denoted as a 2 i to find out the optimal n to strike a balance between accuracy and cost a 2 i and a 2 i 1 should satisfy the eq 15 and n should be simultaneously as small as possible 15 r a 2 i a 2 i 1 a 2 i 1 ε where r is the area change ratio of the total inundation extents calculated with two consecutive values of n and ε is the threshold value close to zero although the accuracy of a 2 i is slightly higher than that of a 2 i 1 the calculation cost of a 2 i is nearly twice that of a 2 i 1 therefore we take 2 i 1 as the optimal n and the corresponding optimal e can be also obtained as seen in table 2 the tentative total inundation extent changes rapidly with the increasing of n as the power of 2 and decreasing of e as the quotient of the total elevation difference divided by n 4 results 4 1 optimal number of differential channel segments for the example flash flood occurred in zharugou valley on july 10th 2018 the threshold value of f h in eq 7 was set as 5 m3 according to our experiments and then the inundation extent of each differential channel segment was calculated with the bm the decreasing halved elevation differences and the corresponding areas of the total inundation extents which were calculated with the differential bm proposed in section 3 were shown in fig 6 a distinct converging trend was observed with the area of the total inundation extent from the elevation difference of 4 73 m to determine the optimal n the value of ε in eq 15 was set as 0 01 the values of n that corresponded to the elevation differences of 4 73 m and 2 37 m were 256 and 512 respectively then the value of r in eq 15 was calculated as 0 0097 which was less than ε therefore the optimal elevation difference in zharugou valley was 4 73 m and the corresponding optimal number of differential channel segments was 256 as shown in fig 7 the main channel of zharugou valley was segmented into 256 differential channel segments with the optimal elevation difference of 4 73 m the downstream endpoint of each differential channel segment was the outlet for the corresponding sub catchment all of the outlets were consecutively denoted as no 1 to no 256 from upstream to downstream it could be noted that the outlets were not evenly distributed along the main channel the outlets were sparser where the local terrains were relatively flatter and the outlets were denser where the local terrain became steeper 4 2 estimated maximum instantaneous water volumes according to section 3 1 the channel lengths the flood averaged velocities of the 256 differential channel segments and the peak discharges at the 256 outlets were obtained and shown in fig 8 a c respectively then the times when the flash flood flowed through those differential channel segments were calculated with eq 3 and the maximum instantaneous water volumes were approximately calculated and shown in fig 8d according to eqs 1 and 3 the maximum instantaneous water volume has a positive correlation to the channel segment length and the peak discharge and a negative correlation to the flood averaged velocities fig 8a c showed an increasing trend as fig 8d did on the contrary fig 8b showed a decreasing trend the maximum instantaneous water volumes were generally small in the upstream abbreviated as u in fig 8d outlets from no 1 to no 96 and gradually increased in the midstream and downstream abbreviated as m d in fig 8d nevertheless it could be seen from fig 8d that there were some sharp rises in the outlet range of no 97 to no 256 the reason for the phenomena was that there were relatively longer flat channel segments in the midstream and downstream of the main channel of zharugou valley 4 3 calculated inundation extents in differential channel segments the elevation of flood water level in each differential channel segment was obtained with eq 7 and the inundation depth distribution was acquired with eq 8 by subtracting the ground elevation from the elevation of flood water level the inundation depths at the outlets of the differential channel segments were shown in fig 9 a the outlets had the lowest elevation in the corresponding differential channel segment at which the maximum inundation depth would be formed at the same time the number of submerged grid cells of local dem was also obtained as shown in fig 9b the inundation area of each differential channel segment was calculated with eq 9 along the main channel of zharugou valley the inundation depth at the outlet generally decreased from upstream to downstream and the inundation area showed an increasing trend as a whole this was because the upstream channel was relatively deeper and narrower the downstream channel gradually became wider and shallower in addition the inundation depth and area of each differential channel segment varied irregularly due to the irregular terrain fluctuation along the main channel of zharugou valley according to eq 6 there was a negative correlation between inundation depth and area when the volume of flood water was constant for example the inundation depths in the outlet ranges of a and b in fig 9a had a nearly converse pattern compared with the inundation areas in the same outlet ranges in fig 9b 4 4 combined inundation extent of the whole channel as shown in fig 10 the maximum inundation extent in the main valley channel of zharugou valley was finally obtained by combining the inundation extents of all differential channel segments based on the resulting inundation extent the spatial boundary the total area and the depth distribution of the example flash flood could be conveniently obtained the total inundation area was about 170 984 m2 when the main valley channel was divided into 256 channel segments according to fig 6 there were six zoomed sample segments of the calculated inundation extent listed on both sides of fig 10 from which more details on the inundation extent of the example flash flood could be clearly observed it could be seen that the depth decreased from the midline of the channel to the banks and the depth in low lying areas was deeper than that in other areas these meant that the calculated results were fairly consistent with the actual situation 5 accuracy assessment as the actual maximum inundation extent of the example flash flood was nearly impossible to obtain either by field investigation or by satellite remote sensing we alternatively assessed the accuracy of the calculated inundation depths against the measured water depths at certain verification spots 5 1 verification of inundation depth as shown in the sample segments in fig 10 we selected six spots to verify the calculated flood inundation depths against the corresponding measured depths the specific data were listed in table 3 relative error re was used to show the disparity between the calculated depth and the measured depth which was calculated by dividing the difference between the calculated data and the measured data by the measured data it could be seen from table 3 that the depth res of some verification spots s2 s4 were below 10 absolute value while those of some spots s1 s5 were above 50 in addition the depth res of verification spots s2 s3 s4 and s6 located in the road and the channel were better than those of spots s1 s5 nearby building facilities there were possibly two reasons for this situation the first was that the sediment carried by the flash flood deposited around the buildings making the measured depth less than the truth however the loose matters deposited on the road were timely cleaned up after the flood and those in the channel were substantially washed away by the flood the second was that the accuracy of dem data used for inundation calculation had a greater impact on buildings than on the roads and flood channels it should be also noted that the re of s1 was as high as 202 which was possibly caused by the different measurement baselines of calculated depth and measured depth as s1 was located above the road the measured depth was based on the road elevation while the calculated depth was possibly based on the flood channel the elevation of the channel baseline was about 1 5 m lower than that of the road limited by the dem resolution it was difficult to distinguish the closely connected road and flood channel 5 2 error and uncertainty analysis besides the possible depth measurement error mentioned in the previous subsection many other factors could have also influenced the accuracy of the calculated inundation extent 1 uncertainties in the peak discharge calculation in the study the rf was used to calculate the peak discharge which is suitable for small mountain catchments wang et al 2010 except dem related parameters and flood information the characteristic parameters used in the rf were obtained by consulting the local hydrological handbook the handbook is based on the compilation of recorded historical flood events which is for the purpose of general applications in addition the difference of the ground surfaces was ignored among various catchments for example different catchments frequently have different vegetation and soil types 2 uncertainties in the estimation of the maximum instantaneous flood water volume in practice the average water depth was used to replace the hydraulic radius which is difficult to measure according to the code for hydrologic data compilation liu et al 2012 hence it will possibly cause certain errors in calculating flash flood flowing velocity in addition it could be seen from fig 4 that the maximum instantaneous flood water volume was slightly overestimated because the area of the gray rectangle is slightly bigger than the corresponding integral area of the flood hydrograph 3 uncertainties in the inundation extent calculation according to the principle of bm many processes are simplified first the flood surface is usually a curved surface which is approximately considered as a plane in bm second the optimal threshold value set for solving eq 7 is undetermined third the resolution of dem has a significant influence on calculation results xu et al 2006 saksena and merwade 2015 hsu et al 2016 manfreda and samela 2019 the coarse resolution dem would erase some details of the terrain thus reducing the accuracy of calculated inundation results 4 neglect of scouring and erosion effects besides inundation flash floods are often accompanied by scouring and erosion since the main valley channel of zharugou catchment is steady the scouring and erosion effects of the flash flood were relatively weak therefore the maximum inundation extent was separately studied in the study the benefit was that the calculation efficiency was greatly improved and the maximum inundation extent could be obtained much faster however the neglect of the hydrodynamic process would inevitably introduce some uncertainties or errors into the calculation results 6 conclusion flash floods are one of the most serious natural disasters occurred in mountainous areas and the maximum inundation extent is one of the core concerns in preventing and managing flash floods compared with the remote sensing method and hydrodynamics based inundation model the bm method can efficiently calculate flood inundation extent given the total water volume yielded in the catchment and local dem however the traditional bm is just applicable for the region with relatively flat terrain in order to apply bm to calculation of the flash flood inundation in the catchment with large elevation difference the differential bm is proposed in this paper in the method the main flood channel is segmented so that the elevation difference in each differential channel segment is relatively small and the bm can be well utilized the flood inundation extent of the whole valley channel can be finally obtained by combining inundation extents of all differential channel segments taking zharugou catchment as the study area we calculated the inundation extent of a once in 10 year flood occurred on july 10th 2018 using the differential bm to verify the calculated inundation extent we compared the measured and calculated inundation depths at six verification spots selected along the main flood channel of zharugou valley although they were in good agreement as a whole there were some individual spots with a very high re which was possibly caused by depth measurement error in addition there were some other possible uncertainties or errors in the steps of the maximum inundation extent calculation including the peak discharge calculation the estimation of maximum instantaneous flood water volume and the inundation extent calculation in each channel segment it is also worthy to note that the resulting maximum inundation extent approximates to the actual data as the calculation procedures involved satisfying the specified threshold values for f h and r in eqs 7 and 15 respectively in summary the evaluation results proved the feasibility and effectiveness of the differential bm in approximately calculating the maximum inundation extent of a flash flood in a small catchment with large elevation difference nevertheless the differential bm is particularly applicable under the following conditions a lack of continuously gauged data of rainfall and flood b the inundation extent of a flash flood occurred in a mountainous catchment needs to be quickly estimated c the main valley channel is relatively stable

5137,inundation analysis is one of the core aspects of flash flood prevention and control in mountainous area remote sensing technology can conveniently extract submerged region of a large flood but infeasible to dynamically obtain flood inundating process in a high temporal resolution meanwhile it is difficult to establish a suitable hydrodynamics based inundation model under conditions of complex terrain moreover such model usually requires huge input data and long simulation time the bulk method bm can quickly calculate flood inundation extent given the total water yield in the catchment and local digital elevation model dem however the traditional bm is only applicable for relatively flat terrain in order to apply bm to calculation of the flash flood inundation extent in the catchment of large elevation difference the differential bm based on differential element theory is proposed in this paper in the method the main flood channel is divided into a certain number of differential channel segments in which the local elevation difference is relatively small and the bm can be soundly applied the flood inundation extent of the whole channel can be obtained by combining the maximum inundation extents of all differential channel segments furthermore it is the key to determine the optimal number of channel segments by repeating the prior steps of the proposed method until the area change ratio of the total inundation extents calculated in two consecutive loops is less than the specified threshold value taking zharugou catchment as the study area we obtained the approximate maximum inundation extent of a once in 10 year flood occurred there on july 10th 2018 as the calculation results were generally in good agreement with the field measuring data it demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the differential bm in approximately calculating the maximum flood inundation extent in a small ungauged catchment with sharp elevation variation keywords flash flood inundation extent bulk method bm differential channel segment sub catchment 1 introduction flash flood is a local flood of short duration generally resulting from heavy rainfall in the immediate vicinity mish 1998 it is one of the most serious natural disasters in mountainous areas usually causing disasters such as building collapse traffic disruption human and livestock casualties and crop inundation with the increment of extreme rainfall events in recent years the risk of flash floods is also dramatically increasing jonkman 2005 bloeschl et al 2019 the damages caused by flash floods mainly include strong scouring and erosion and widespread inundation it is the basis of flash flood disaster control planning ffdcp to calculate and analyze the inundation region chang et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 burn and whitfield 2015 many efforts have been made to study flood inundation which can be categorized into three types from the perspective of research methods remote sensing extraction hydrodynamic simulation and inundation calculation based on digital elevation model dem satellite remote sensing can conveniently extract the inundation extent of a large flood and analyze its change from time series remotely sensed imagery but limited by the fixed revisit period it cannot obtain the flood extent in a timely manner especially for a flash flood which has small spatial extent and short duration feng et al 2012 schumann and moller 2015 pekel et al 2016 chen et al 2019 psomiadis et al 2019 although aerial remote sensing can be flexibly deployed its applications in flash flood monitoring are still seriously restricted by complex terrain and weather conditions clement et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 tsyganskaya et al 2018 agnihotri et al 2019 based on hydrodynamic models the hydrodynamic methods mathematically express the physical laws of flood movement and then obtain the inundation extent the simulation results can reflect the flow law of flood but the modeling process is complex and a great deal of gauge data is required besides it is difficult to build proper hydrodynamic models under conditions of complex terrain and abrupt floods as requiring large amount of calculation and long simulating time the hydrodynamic models are rarely used for rapid flood forecasting and assessing chen and liu 2014 teng et al 2017 hoch et al 2019 the hydrological method is to delineate the flood inundation extent based on local dem according to the water level or discharge calculated by the adapted hydrological model compared with the hydrodynamic method it requires less calculation and is able to quickly simulate flood inundating process and calculate inundated extent wang 2010 zhang and pan 2014 bermúdez et al 2018 various dem based methods for obtaining flood inundation extent have been proposed in the literature which can be divided into two categories delineation solely based on dem and calculation with known water level or water discharge the sole dem based methods are actually flood hazard zoning and usually used as ancillary data to monitor flooded areas of extreme weather events for example the height above the nearest drainage hand produces the contour map of flood hazard along the drainage network nobre et al 2016 and the geomorphic flood index gfi delineates the flood prone area into different hazard levels according to morphological descriptors of poorly gauged basins samela et al 2017 in water level based calculation methods the flood area is approximately considered as a horizontal plane and all the regions where the topographic elevation are lower than the given water level belong to the inundation extent the specific implementations of water level method include region growing algorithm liu et al 2009 seed spread algorithm liu and liu 2001 xu et al 2018 adaptive water level correction algorithm ding et al 2013 and flood connected domain calculation method zhang et al 2014 these implementations are all based on given flood water level and cannot be applied in ungauged areas the bulk method bm calculates flood inundation extent according to the principle that the volume of water yield of a flood caused by a strong rainfall is equal to that of accumulated flood water in the inundation area jiang et al 2006 li et al 2012 cai et al 2013 the theoretical basis and calculation process of bm are clear however the bm has a precondition for calculating the flood inundation extent the terrain of the target inundation area is relatively flat as flash flood usually occurred in a small catchment with large elevation difference the bm cannot be directly applied taking the bm as an example when it is applied in a small catchment with large elevation difference the flood water will accumulate in the lower reaches of the valley channel while the middle and upper reaches are not inundated this phenomenon is very different from the actual situation and it does not accurately reflect the spatiotemporal characteristics of flood inundating process along the valley of the catchment therefore it is a very challenging and meaningful task to modify existing flood inundation calculation methods and make them suitable for a small catchment with sharp elevation variation in this paper we proposed a differential bm to approximately calculate the maximum inundation extent of the flash flood occurred in a small mountainous catchment with large elevation difference in section 2 the study area of zharugou catchment and the used materials are briefly introduced then the proposed methodology is described in detail in section 3 including estimation of maximum instantaneous flood water volume general inundation extent calculation with the bm modification of bm with differential element theory and determination of the number of differential channel segments the results are presented and analyzed in section 4 including the optimal number of channel segments the estimated maximum instantaneous water volume and the calculated inundation information in each channel segment and the combined inundation extent of the whole flood channel the accuracy assessment of the calculated inundation depths against measured water depths at verification spots is carried out in section 5 and the potential errors and uncertainties are also discussed in section 6 the conclusion is draw that the differential bm is effective in calculating the approximate maximum inundation extent of a flash flood and the particularly applicable conditions are also listed 2 study area and data 2 1 study area zharugou catchment 33 7 48 33 16 5 n 103 55 36 104 3 39 e is located in jiuzhaigou county southwest china fig 1 the catchment has an area of 104 89 km2 and belongs to a humid plateau climate with an average annual precipitation of 690 mm the rain season is mainly from may to september and the extreme rainfall usually occurred in july zhou et al 2006 wang and zhang 2018 wen et al 2019 zharugou valley is a branch of the prestigious scenic area jiuzhaigou valley and the length of its main valley channel is about 20 54 km the elevation of the debouchure of zharugou valley is 2071 m the end of the main channel is 3282 m and their relative elevation is as high as 1211 m the large elevation difference and the intensive rainfall have formed favorable conditions for flash floods there are several settlements in the valley and rexi village is the nearest one to the flood channel when a flash flood breaks out the runoffs from both sides of the valley and from the upstream converge to form a violent torrent that rushes down the valley channel and makes the water level sharply rising up and brings serious damages to the settlements and infrastructures therefore zharugou catchment is an ideal experimental area and the strong flash flood occurred there on july 10th 2018 was taken as an example for studying the calculation of inundation extent 2 2 data and materials the data and materials used in the study includes the local dem the rainfall and flood data of the example flash flood and historical floods and the field measured water depth data 1 dem data as the accurate dem of the zharugou catchment is unavailable we downloaded a workable alternative from google earth wang et al 2017 due to the rough spatial resolution of 8 m and the existence of noise pixels the drainage network of the catchment directly extracted from the dem has the zigzag effect in some segments fig 2 a in the study we did fill resampling and focus statistics to eliminate the zigzag effect and interpolating to improve the spatial resolution of dem to 2 m the corresponding segments of the drainage network extracted from the processed dem were shown in fig 2b 2 rainfall and flood data there are generally three methods to calculate flood peak discharge in ungauged basin hydrologic simulation zhang 2011 regional empirical formula el hames 2012 and rational formula rf dhakal et al 2012 grimaldi and petroselli 2015 rf is the main method for estimating flood peak discharge especially in the small catchment of the mountainous area less than 500 km2 wang et al 2010 according to the historical rainfall and flood records of the study area the return period of the example flash flood occurred on july 10th 2018 was determined as once in 10 years then the peak discharge could be calculated with rf based on the 10 year return period 3 field measured flood depth in order to verify the calculated inundation some places in zharugou valley were selected as verification spots of the example flash flood and their 3d coordinates and inundated depths were recorded through inquiry surveys and field measurements according to the survey there is only one road that enters the valley along the downstream of the zharugou valley this road is cut off at about mid reach because the upper reach is getting steeper and narrower and there are no settlements there it no longer has the conditions and value for road construction therefore it is nearly impossible to obtain upstream field flood data the spatial locations of the six verification spots from s1 to s6 are shown in fig 1 and their specific data are listed in table 1 3 methodology in the study the differential bm is proposed to approximately calculate the maximum inundation extent of a flash flood occurred in a small catchment with large elevation difference first it needs to divide the main valley channel into a certain number of segments according to the assigned elevation difference initialized with the elevation difference of the whole valley channel secondly based on the flood return period determined by historical rainfall and flood records and the parameters extracted from the dem of each sub catchment the peak discharge in each differential channel segment can be calculated with rf method and then the maximum instantaneous flood water volume can be estimated by multiplying the peak discharge with the time when the flash flood flows through the channel segment thirdly the inundation extent in each differential channel segment can be obtained based on the local dem and the flood water volume yielded in the corresponding sub catchment using bm fourthly the tentative inundation extent of the whole valley channel can be achieved by combining all differential inundation extents finally it is necessary to repeat the steps 1 4 according to half of the previous elevation difference until the area change ratio of the tentative inundation extents calculated in two consecutive loops is less than the specified threshold value then the optimal number of differential channel segments is determined and the final inundation extent of the whole valley channel is obtained thus the information of the final inundation extent such as the spatial boundary the area and the water depth distribution can be extracted on demand the detailed flowchart is shown in fig 3 3 1 maximum instantaneous water volume estimation when a flash flood occurred the flood discharge was increasing from upstream to downstream with the continuous collection of runoffs from both sides of the valley as shown in fig 4 for any cross section on the flood channel the local flood hydrograph is an asymmetrical curve with a peak value in the middle part and low values on both sides generally it is around the peak discharge that the inundation extent in a certain segment of the flood channel reaches the maximum one since the accurate flood hydrograph of each channel segment is usually unavailable the maximum instantaneous flood water volume w can be estimated as the area of the gray rectangle in the fig 4 with eq 1 1 w q max t where q max is the flood peak discharge and t is the time when the flash flood flows through the channel segment the flood peak discharge q max is calculated with the rf method and the formula is as follows chen and zhang 1966 2 q max 0 278 φ s τ n f where φ is the runoff coefficient of the flood peak s is the rainfall intensity τ is the runoff confluence time of the rainstorm f is the catchment area n is the attenuation index of the rainstorm and 0 278 is the unit conversion coefficient to calculate the parameters in eq 2 the rainfall data including the 1 hour h 1 6 hour h 6 average rainfall intensities and the corresponding coefficients of variation c v 1 and c v 6 can be obtained based on the rainfall contour maps from the rainstorm and flood calculation manual of medium and small basins in sichuan province shen et al 1984 then φ s τ and n can be computed using the empirical equations in the literature liu et al 2014 which directly or indirectly involve in the modulus coefficients obtained according to the different return periods of flash floods the flood flowing time t in the channel segment is calculated using eq 3 3 t l s v s where ls is the length of the flood channel segment and vs is the flood averaged flowing velocity the flash flood flowing velocity vs can be calculated with manning formula xia et al 2017 4 v s 1 n c r c 2 3 j c 1 2 where r c is the hydraulic radius of the flash flood and is usually replaced by the average water depth j c is the hydraulic slope namely the channel slope and n c is the roughness coefficient and determined from an assignment table which is produced based on the flash flood characteristics and channel conditions 3 2 inundation extent calculation the bm is a simplified inundation model that can quickly calculate the flood inundation extent based on the water yield volume of a flood its principle is that the volume of water yield by a flood is equal to that of the accumulated water in the inundation area given the maximum water yield volume of a flood w the maximum inundation extent and depth distribution can be calculated with the following equation bai 2001 5 w a e w x y e g x y d σ where a is the inundation extent e w x y is the flood surface elevation e g x y is the ground elevation x y a d σ is the differential area element of the inundation extent as the inundation extent calculation is usually based on a raster dem a can be decomposed into a certain number of pixel grid cells each grid cell has its own elevation value in order to facilitate calculation the flood surface which is usually a complex curved surface is simplified to a horizontal plane thus eq 5 can be converted as follows 6 w i 1 k s h e i where s is the real area that a pixel grid cell represents h is the elevation of the flood water level ei is the elevation of the i th pixel grid cell k is the number of pixel grid cells in the inundation extent a relationship can be established between the water yield volume of a flood and the estimated water volume of the inundation extent 7 f h v w v i 1 k s h e i where v is the water yield volume of a flood and f h is the difference between v and w in the above nonlinear equation the values of the two parameters k and h are both undetermined if one specific value is given to one of the two parameters the unique value of the other parameter can be also determined nevertheless it is so inefficient to determine k and h using a general search algorithm which traverses the first possible value to the last one usually an approximation algorithm such as binary search is used to improve the calculation efficiency cai et al 2013 cham et al 2015 argyrios et al 2019 the binary search approximation algorithm will be continuously executed until the f h is less than a threshold value determined by experiments once the values of k and h are determined the inundation depth h i and the total inundation area a can be obtained with eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 h i h e i 9 a k s 3 3 inundation calculation with differential bm although simple and efficient the bm is usually applied to the calculation of the flood inundation in the region where the terrain is relatively flat if the bm is directly applied to calculating the inundation extent of a flash flood occurred in a small catchment with large elevation difference a totally wrong result will be attained inspired by the differential element theory guru and hiziroglu 2009 we divide the main valley channel in the catchment into a certain number of differential channel segments when the differential channel segments are short enough the terrain of each differential channel segment becomes relatively flat enough to apply bm thus the downstream endpoint of each differential channel segment is considered as the outlet of the corresponding sub catchment shown in fig 5 a the bm is applied to each sub catchment to calculate the flood inundation in each corresponding differential channel segment and the inundation extent of the whole valley channel can be finally obtained by combining the inundation extents of all differential channel segments this method is called differential bm as shown in fig 5b the main flood channel is divided into n segments according to a constant elevation difference e the downstream endpoints of channel segments are denoted as p 1 p 2 p n the upstream endpoint of the main channel is p 0 the elevation of p 0 is represented as e 0 the elevation of p 1 is e 1 and similarly the elevation of p n is en then they should satisfy the following formula 10 e e 0 e n n although the channel segments have the same elevation difference e their lengths are various the channel segment length between p 0 and p 1 is l 1 and the channel segment length between p n 1 and p n is l n when n tends to infinity the length of the main flood channel l can be expressed as 11 l n 1 dl where dl is the differential element of the main channel length however n is usually set to a finite integer in consideration of dem resolution and computational cost therefore eq 11 can be further simplified as follows 12 l i 1 n l i as shown in fig 5a the whole catchment is denoted as c then the sub catchment corresponding to outlet p 1 is c1 and the sub catchment corresponding to p n 1 is cn 1 the sub catchment cn corresponding to p n is actually c the whole catchment and all sub catchments have an inclusion relationship in set theory which can be expressed as follows 13 c c n c n 1 c 1 as p 1 p n are the outlets of sub catchments c1 cn the flood peak discharges q 1 q n at p 1 p n can be calculated with various areas of c 1 c n and other shared parameters then the maximum instantaneous flood water volumes w 1 w n can be estimated as the products of q 1 q n and the times t 1 t n when the flash flood flows through the channel segments l 1 l n then the corresponding inundation extents a 1 a n and the water surface elevation h 1 h n can be obtained using the bm finally the inundation extent of the whole valley channel a can be achieved by combining a 1 a n the whole inundation extent and all sub extents have a union relationship which can be expressed as follows 14 a a 1 a n 1 a n according to eq 8 the inundation depth of any spot in a n is the difference between h n and the corresponding ground elevation which is usually acquired from local dem data 3 4 determination of differential channel segment number according to eq 10 the smaller e is the bigger the number of differential channel segments n is with the increasing of n the calculated result of a will gradually increase and converge and the required computational cost is also greatly rising in order to accelerate the convergence process let n increase as 2 i i 0 1 2 and the corresponding a is denoted as a 2 i to find out the optimal n to strike a balance between accuracy and cost a 2 i and a 2 i 1 should satisfy the eq 15 and n should be simultaneously as small as possible 15 r a 2 i a 2 i 1 a 2 i 1 ε where r is the area change ratio of the total inundation extents calculated with two consecutive values of n and ε is the threshold value close to zero although the accuracy of a 2 i is slightly higher than that of a 2 i 1 the calculation cost of a 2 i is nearly twice that of a 2 i 1 therefore we take 2 i 1 as the optimal n and the corresponding optimal e can be also obtained as seen in table 2 the tentative total inundation extent changes rapidly with the increasing of n as the power of 2 and decreasing of e as the quotient of the total elevation difference divided by n 4 results 4 1 optimal number of differential channel segments for the example flash flood occurred in zharugou valley on july 10th 2018 the threshold value of f h in eq 7 was set as 5 m3 according to our experiments and then the inundation extent of each differential channel segment was calculated with the bm the decreasing halved elevation differences and the corresponding areas of the total inundation extents which were calculated with the differential bm proposed in section 3 were shown in fig 6 a distinct converging trend was observed with the area of the total inundation extent from the elevation difference of 4 73 m to determine the optimal n the value of ε in eq 15 was set as 0 01 the values of n that corresponded to the elevation differences of 4 73 m and 2 37 m were 256 and 512 respectively then the value of r in eq 15 was calculated as 0 0097 which was less than ε therefore the optimal elevation difference in zharugou valley was 4 73 m and the corresponding optimal number of differential channel segments was 256 as shown in fig 7 the main channel of zharugou valley was segmented into 256 differential channel segments with the optimal elevation difference of 4 73 m the downstream endpoint of each differential channel segment was the outlet for the corresponding sub catchment all of the outlets were consecutively denoted as no 1 to no 256 from upstream to downstream it could be noted that the outlets were not evenly distributed along the main channel the outlets were sparser where the local terrains were relatively flatter and the outlets were denser where the local terrain became steeper 4 2 estimated maximum instantaneous water volumes according to section 3 1 the channel lengths the flood averaged velocities of the 256 differential channel segments and the peak discharges at the 256 outlets were obtained and shown in fig 8 a c respectively then the times when the flash flood flowed through those differential channel segments were calculated with eq 3 and the maximum instantaneous water volumes were approximately calculated and shown in fig 8d according to eqs 1 and 3 the maximum instantaneous water volume has a positive correlation to the channel segment length and the peak discharge and a negative correlation to the flood averaged velocities fig 8a c showed an increasing trend as fig 8d did on the contrary fig 8b showed a decreasing trend the maximum instantaneous water volumes were generally small in the upstream abbreviated as u in fig 8d outlets from no 1 to no 96 and gradually increased in the midstream and downstream abbreviated as m d in fig 8d nevertheless it could be seen from fig 8d that there were some sharp rises in the outlet range of no 97 to no 256 the reason for the phenomena was that there were relatively longer flat channel segments in the midstream and downstream of the main channel of zharugou valley 4 3 calculated inundation extents in differential channel segments the elevation of flood water level in each differential channel segment was obtained with eq 7 and the inundation depth distribution was acquired with eq 8 by subtracting the ground elevation from the elevation of flood water level the inundation depths at the outlets of the differential channel segments were shown in fig 9 a the outlets had the lowest elevation in the corresponding differential channel segment at which the maximum inundation depth would be formed at the same time the number of submerged grid cells of local dem was also obtained as shown in fig 9b the inundation area of each differential channel segment was calculated with eq 9 along the main channel of zharugou valley the inundation depth at the outlet generally decreased from upstream to downstream and the inundation area showed an increasing trend as a whole this was because the upstream channel was relatively deeper and narrower the downstream channel gradually became wider and shallower in addition the inundation depth and area of each differential channel segment varied irregularly due to the irregular terrain fluctuation along the main channel of zharugou valley according to eq 6 there was a negative correlation between inundation depth and area when the volume of flood water was constant for example the inundation depths in the outlet ranges of a and b in fig 9a had a nearly converse pattern compared with the inundation areas in the same outlet ranges in fig 9b 4 4 combined inundation extent of the whole channel as shown in fig 10 the maximum inundation extent in the main valley channel of zharugou valley was finally obtained by combining the inundation extents of all differential channel segments based on the resulting inundation extent the spatial boundary the total area and the depth distribution of the example flash flood could be conveniently obtained the total inundation area was about 170 984 m2 when the main valley channel was divided into 256 channel segments according to fig 6 there were six zoomed sample segments of the calculated inundation extent listed on both sides of fig 10 from which more details on the inundation extent of the example flash flood could be clearly observed it could be seen that the depth decreased from the midline of the channel to the banks and the depth in low lying areas was deeper than that in other areas these meant that the calculated results were fairly consistent with the actual situation 5 accuracy assessment as the actual maximum inundation extent of the example flash flood was nearly impossible to obtain either by field investigation or by satellite remote sensing we alternatively assessed the accuracy of the calculated inundation depths against the measured water depths at certain verification spots 5 1 verification of inundation depth as shown in the sample segments in fig 10 we selected six spots to verify the calculated flood inundation depths against the corresponding measured depths the specific data were listed in table 3 relative error re was used to show the disparity between the calculated depth and the measured depth which was calculated by dividing the difference between the calculated data and the measured data by the measured data it could be seen from table 3 that the depth res of some verification spots s2 s4 were below 10 absolute value while those of some spots s1 s5 were above 50 in addition the depth res of verification spots s2 s3 s4 and s6 located in the road and the channel were better than those of spots s1 s5 nearby building facilities there were possibly two reasons for this situation the first was that the sediment carried by the flash flood deposited around the buildings making the measured depth less than the truth however the loose matters deposited on the road were timely cleaned up after the flood and those in the channel were substantially washed away by the flood the second was that the accuracy of dem data used for inundation calculation had a greater impact on buildings than on the roads and flood channels it should be also noted that the re of s1 was as high as 202 which was possibly caused by the different measurement baselines of calculated depth and measured depth as s1 was located above the road the measured depth was based on the road elevation while the calculated depth was possibly based on the flood channel the elevation of the channel baseline was about 1 5 m lower than that of the road limited by the dem resolution it was difficult to distinguish the closely connected road and flood channel 5 2 error and uncertainty analysis besides the possible depth measurement error mentioned in the previous subsection many other factors could have also influenced the accuracy of the calculated inundation extent 1 uncertainties in the peak discharge calculation in the study the rf was used to calculate the peak discharge which is suitable for small mountain catchments wang et al 2010 except dem related parameters and flood information the characteristic parameters used in the rf were obtained by consulting the local hydrological handbook the handbook is based on the compilation of recorded historical flood events which is for the purpose of general applications in addition the difference of the ground surfaces was ignored among various catchments for example different catchments frequently have different vegetation and soil types 2 uncertainties in the estimation of the maximum instantaneous flood water volume in practice the average water depth was used to replace the hydraulic radius which is difficult to measure according to the code for hydrologic data compilation liu et al 2012 hence it will possibly cause certain errors in calculating flash flood flowing velocity in addition it could be seen from fig 4 that the maximum instantaneous flood water volume was slightly overestimated because the area of the gray rectangle is slightly bigger than the corresponding integral area of the flood hydrograph 3 uncertainties in the inundation extent calculation according to the principle of bm many processes are simplified first the flood surface is usually a curved surface which is approximately considered as a plane in bm second the optimal threshold value set for solving eq 7 is undetermined third the resolution of dem has a significant influence on calculation results xu et al 2006 saksena and merwade 2015 hsu et al 2016 manfreda and samela 2019 the coarse resolution dem would erase some details of the terrain thus reducing the accuracy of calculated inundation results 4 neglect of scouring and erosion effects besides inundation flash floods are often accompanied by scouring and erosion since the main valley channel of zharugou catchment is steady the scouring and erosion effects of the flash flood were relatively weak therefore the maximum inundation extent was separately studied in the study the benefit was that the calculation efficiency was greatly improved and the maximum inundation extent could be obtained much faster however the neglect of the hydrodynamic process would inevitably introduce some uncertainties or errors into the calculation results 6 conclusion flash floods are one of the most serious natural disasters occurred in mountainous areas and the maximum inundation extent is one of the core concerns in preventing and managing flash floods compared with the remote sensing method and hydrodynamics based inundation model the bm method can efficiently calculate flood inundation extent given the total water volume yielded in the catchment and local dem however the traditional bm is just applicable for the region with relatively flat terrain in order to apply bm to calculation of the flash flood inundation in the catchment with large elevation difference the differential bm is proposed in this paper in the method the main flood channel is segmented so that the elevation difference in each differential channel segment is relatively small and the bm can be well utilized the flood inundation extent of the whole valley channel can be finally obtained by combining inundation extents of all differential channel segments taking zharugou catchment as the study area we calculated the inundation extent of a once in 10 year flood occurred on july 10th 2018 using the differential bm to verify the calculated inundation extent we compared the measured and calculated inundation depths at six verification spots selected along the main flood channel of zharugou valley although they were in good agreement as a whole there were some individual spots with a very high re which was possibly caused by depth measurement error in addition there were some other possible uncertainties or errors in the steps of the maximum inundation extent calculation including the peak discharge calculation the estimation of maximum instantaneous flood water volume and the inundation extent calculation in each channel segment it is also worthy to note that the resulting maximum inundation extent approximates to the actual data as the calculation procedures involved satisfying the specified threshold values for f h and r in eqs 7 and 15 respectively in summary the evaluation results proved the feasibility and effectiveness of the differential bm in approximately calculating the maximum inundation extent of a flash flood in a small catchment with large elevation difference nevertheless the differential bm is particularly applicable under the following conditions a lack of continuously gauged data of rainfall and flood b the inundation extent of a flash flood occurred in a mountainous catchment needs to be quickly estimated c the main valley channel is relatively stable

5138,the mediterranean region has been identified as one of the most affected global hot spots for climate change which is already manifested by faster increasing temperatures than the global mean and significant decreases in annual precipitation besides over the past decades important land cover changes have occurred such as reforestation agricultural intensification urban expansion and the construction of many reservoirs here we study the impacts of these changes in a typical large mediterranean catchment and focus on relevant ecosystem services i e primary production water supply food production water regulation flood and erosion control and cultural ecosystem services we applied a hydrological model coupled with a soil erosion and sediment transport model for the period 1971 2010 to the entire catchment and for an extended period 1952 2018 with more pronounced land use changes to one of its subcatchments that plays a crucial role for regional drinking water provision climate change in the evaluated period is characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature land use changes included an increase in natural vegetation in the headwaters agricultural intensification and reservoir construction in the central part and urban expansion in the downstream part of the catchment the positive impacts on ecosystem services were quantified by a decrease in hillslope erosion sediment yield sediment concentration and flood discharge which are mainly attributed to climate change and reservoir construction the negative impacts were quantified by an increase in plant water stress and a decrease in reservoir storage for which the latter is mainly attributed to reforestation in the headwater catchments while grey infrastructures like reservoir construction showed important positive impacts on some ecosystem services such as water regulation and flood control they also potentially induce negative impacts such as an increase of water demand and ecological integrity we argue that a shift is needed to green infrastructures and nature based solutions such as reforestation and sustainable land management which may lead to similar benefits on ecosystem services but without the negative impacts caused by grey infrastructures this supports the need for integrated land use management to sustainably protect ecosystem services considering the expected climate change impacts on mediterranean environments and societies keywords land use change climate change reservoirs ecosystem services green infrastructure 1 introduction the mediterranean region has been identified as one of the most affected global hot spots for climate change giorgi et al 2006 recent observations have shown that temperature in the mediterranean region is increasing at a faster rate than the global mean cramer et al 2018 it is expected that this trend will continue under future climate change accompanied by a decrease in annual precipitation sum garcía ruiz et al 2011 leading to an increase in the frequency intensity and duration of droughts and a decrease in stream flow burke et al 2006 impacts of climate change have already been observed in many mediterranean rivers in the last decades gallart and llorens 2004 lópez moreno et al 2006 garcía ruiz et al 2011 buendia et al 2016 pérez cutillas et al 2018 masseroni et al 2020 land use changes such as reforestation deforestation and expansion of intensive agriculture are likely to amplify the impact of climate change on ecosystem services sala et al 2000 garcía ruiz et al 2011 the large scale construction of reservoirs in the mediterranean region has also affected river flow and sediment dynamics over the past century cooper et al 2013 together these changes impacted the most relevant ecosystem services for mediterranean environments including supporting primary production provisioning water supply and food production regulating water regulation flood and erosion control and cultural ecosystem services this illustrates the importance to consider feedbacks between hydrological processes land use society and ecosystems through an interdisciplinary approach connecting hydrological changes with dynamics of socio ecosystems montanari et al 2013 ceola et al 2016 a major part of land use in mediterranean regions is dominated by agricultural areas cooper et al 2013 covering around 40 of the mediterranean basin malek and verburg 2017 while total agricultural area remained stable there has been a shift from rainfed agriculture in headwater catchments to more intensive irrigated agricultural practices in the downstream areas puigdefábregas and mendizabal 1998 garcía ruiz et al 2010 nainggolan et al 2012 abandoned agricultural land and intensified agriculture are both prone to land degradation often leading to increases in surface runoff and soil erosion lesschen et al 2007 garcía ruiz et al 2010 garcía ruiz and lana renault 2011 zink et al 2011 rogger et al 2017 land abandonment took place where irrigation water was not readily available where mechanization was more difficult to implement or in areas further away from the main distribution infrastructure such as in mountainous areas nainggolan et al 2012 while soil erosion often increases in the first years after agricultural lands have been abandoned poesen and hooke 1997 garcía ruiz et al 2008 under favourable environmental conditions these lands are usually occupied by natural vegetation of shrubland and forest cover after several years sirami et al 2010 hansen et al 2013 leading to a decrease in soil erosion alatorre et al 2012 and an increase in soil organic carbon novara et al 2017 the return of natural vegetation especially forest cover may have a significant impact on the hydrological cycle and impacts downstream water availability most importantly forest cover increases rainfall interception and transpiration ultimately leading to a decrease in stream flow andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 nosetto et al 2005 lópez moreno et al 2006 pérez cutillas et al 2018 land use changes often take a relatively long time to have a measurable impact on stream flow and sediment dynamics in rivers whereas the construction of dams as a typical example of grey infrastructures often has an immediate effect wang 2014 over the past century river flow in many mediterranean catchments has been regulated by the construction of dams in the mediterranean basin most dams were built in spain and turkey many with the purpose to store water for irrigation cooper et al 2013 dams can have benefits to some hydrological ecosystem services such as flood control and water regulation thoms and sheldon 2000 cudennec et al 2007 lópez moreno et al 2011 cooper et al 2013 reservoir construction has mitigated the impact of droughts on stream flow at short time scales but amplified the impact on longer time scales because of an increase in water demand after reservoir construction lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 alterations of the flow by dam construction also have negative ecological consequences including a reversal of the seasonal flow pattern affecting the ecological flow regime of rivers belmar et al 2010 the high degree of fragmentation in mediterranean rivers due to dam construction affected ecological processes that depend on longitudinal river connectivity such as transport of organic and inorganic matter and upstream and downstream movements of aquatic and riparian species lehner et al 2011 grill et al 2019 dams alter the sediment transport dynamics of rivers most notably by trapping large amounts of sediments that are transported by the river flow often dams trap almost all sediment that is transported towards the reservoir vörösmarty et al 2003 vericat and batalla 2006 potentially leading to channel incision downstream of dams vericat and batalla 2006 and to morphological changes in the river delta syvitski et al 2009 ibánez et al 2019 because dams trap such large volumes of sediments reservoirs have a limited lifetime it has been estimated that the capacity loss of the world s reservoirs is about 1 wcd et al 2000 wisser et al 2013 which translates to an expected lifetime of 100 years for mediterranean areas even higher annual capacity losses 2 5 are reported leading to even shorter expected reservoir lifetimes vanmaercke et al 2011 given their often high implementation and maintenance costs and undesired side effects there is increasing discussion about the effectiveness of grey infrastructures like dams to control hydrological and sediment fluxes effectively as an alternative there is increasing interest in green infrastructures and nature based solutions based on vegetation land use and land management changes or building with nature to gradually control hydrology and sediment fluxes cohen shacham et al 2019 the mediterranean climate is characterized by high inter annual variability in precipitation summer drought and intense rainfall cortesi et al 2012 merheb et al 2016 the combination of these climate characteristics and the typical steep slopes have resulted in a high frequency of flash floods and high erosion rates in the mediterranean region llasat et al 2010 tarolli et al 2012 over the last few decades discharge observations have shown a decreasing trend in stream flow in many mediterranean catchments lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2019 part of this decline is explained by climate change through a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature from which the latter causes increased evapotranspiration lópez moreno et al 2011 pérez martín et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2014 lutz et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 in mountainous catchments there is a tendency of an earlier peak in spring flow caused by an increase in temperature affecting snow melt garcía ruiz et al 2011 morán tejeda et al 2014 while climate change may have had an important impact on stream flow anthropogenic factors such as water abstractions for irrigation purposes and reforestation have played an important role as well lópez moreno et al 2011 milano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2019 illustrating the feedback between societal changes and hydrological processes ceola et al 2016 some studies projected that stream flow will decrease even more due to decreasing annual precipitation sum and increasing evapotranspiration under climate change garcía ruiz et al 2011 cramer et al 2018 brogli et al 2019 while other studies highlight the expected increase in extreme precipitation tramblay et al 2018 which could lead to increased runoff and discharge to reservoirs under climate change eekhout et al 2018 blöschl et al 2019 in the second half of the 20th century many land use and climate changes have occurred in the mediterranean region significantly altering the hydrological cycle the combination of these changes have led to complex interactions among several ecosystem services doblas miranda et al 2017 for instance reforestation may lead to a decrease in hillslope erosion e g interrill and rill erosion but often leads to a decrease in downstream water availability reflecting benefits and trade offs for different ecosystem services boix fayos et al 2007 2015 ren et al 2014 better understanding of these interactions both from grey and green infrastructures including feedbacks between hydrology and social systems and how they lead to benefits and trade offs for ecosystem services is important to design climate change adaptation strategies through land use and management practices e g montanari et al 2013 cohen shacham et al 2019 the objective of this study is to assess how historical land use and climate change and the construction of a network of large reservoirs in the segura river catchment in the last 70 years have interacted and affected a selection of most relevant ecosystem services by putting emphasis on ecosystem services we aim to contribute to better understanding and prediction of interactions between hydrological and societal changes which are essential to determine water security and to set priorities for environmental management e g montanari et al 2013 eekhout et al 2018 eekhout and de vente 2019 the segura catchment is a typical mediterranean catchment where many of the before mentioned changes have occurred for this assessment we applied a hydrological model coupled with a soil erosion and sediment transport model to study the impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction on the most relevant ecosystem services we applied the model to the segura river catchment for the period 1971 2010 and for an extended period 1952 2018 to the taibilla subcatchment which plays an important role in the provision of drinking water in the region and is characterised by pronounced land use changes in that period with this study we provide a practical example of a methodology to support adaptation of water resources management to the current and future challenges posed by environmental and societal change ceola et al 2016 2 material methods 2 1 study area this study is performed in the segura river catchment 15 955 km2 located in the southeast of spain fig 1 a the elevation ranges between sea level and 2336 masl catchment averaged annual rainfall amounts to 377 mm for the period 1981 2010 serrano notivoli et al 2017 and mean annual temperature ranges between 10 7 and 18 6 c 1981 2010 herrera et al 2016 from the headwaters to the downstream area the climate is mediterranean csa and csb according to the köppen geiger climate classification in the headwaters 21 and semi arid bsk and bsh in the rest of the catchment 79 the main soil classes are calcisols 41 leptosols 35 luvisols 4 and kastanozems 4 hengl et al 2017 it has been estimated that in the segura river catchment water demands exceed supply by 224 sabater and tockner 2009 to meet the demand since the 1980s water from the tagus river is transported to the segura river catchment through an inter basin water transfer over a length of 292 km besides 32 reservoirs have been constructed in the catchment with a total capacity of 1230 hm3 fig 1b and table s1 fourteen reservoirs are allocated exclusively for irrigation purposes the other reservoirs have mixed functions for drinking water supply electricity generation and flood prevention in the segura catchment we assessed the impacts of land use and climate change and the construction of reservoirs for the period 1971 2010 in addition we performed a long term land use change impact assessment in the taibilla subcatchment 595 km2 located in the headwaters of the segura river catchment for the period 1952 2018 the reason for the focus on the taibilla subcatchment is that it is located in a part of the segura river catchment with more pronounced land use changes over the past decades besides the taibilla reservoir constructed in 1979 with a capacity of 9 hm3 plays an essential role in provision of drinking water to approximately 2 5 million people in the provinces murcia albacete and alicante grindlay et al 2011 melgarejo moreno et al 2019 since 1955 water from the taibilla subcatchment is diverted through a water diversion work and transported to downstream areas for domestic use previous research showed that the drinking water supply may be under threat due to a decline of runoff caused by reforestation in this subcatchment quiñonero rubio et al 2016 pérez cutillas et al 2018 the elevation in the taibilla subcatchment ranges between 524 and 2030 masl catchment averaged annual rainfall amounts 514 mm 1981 2010 and mean annual temperature is 12 4 c 1981 2010 the climate is mainly classified as mediterranean csa 88 but the downstream part of the subcatchment is classified as semi arid bsk 12 the main soil classes are leptosols 53 cambisols 17 calcisols 12 and luvisols 10 hengl et al 2017 2 2 model to assess the impacts of reservoir construction and changes in land use and climate we applied the sphy model v3 0 terink et al 2015 eekhout et al 2018 futurewater 2019 a spatially distributed hydrological model fully coupled with a soil erosion and a sediment transport model the model is applied on a cell by cell basis and with a daily time step we employed a model grid resolution of 200 m the hydrological model simulates most relevant hydrological processes such as interception evapotranspiration surface runoff and lateral and vertical soil moisture flow water is routed through the catchment using a single flow algorithm accounting for reservoir operations through the reservoir module the reservoir module determines reservoir outflow based on reservoir capacity and actual storage hanasaki et al 2006 we replaced the fixed exponent 1 5 from the model proposed by hanasaki et al 2006 by a model parameter b to account for the variation in reservoir regulation among the reservoirs in the study area the soil erosion model based on morgan and duzant 2008 simulates most relevant hillslope erosion processes such as soil detachment by raindrop impact and runoff the sediment is transported through the catchment accounting for the transport capacity of the flow and reservoir sedimentation through a trapping efficiency equation the model incorporates a vegetation model based on the spatial and temporal variation of the normalized differenced vegetation index ndvi which determines actual evapotranspiration interception canopy storage throughfall and canopy cover the hydrological model was calibrated in a headwater subcatchment 696 km2 fig 1b for the period 2001 2010 and validated for the period 1987 2000 using daily observed discharge data we applied the spotpy calibration package houska et al 2015 to calibrate the hydrological model using the simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the kling gupta model efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which has an optimum at 1 the calibration resulted in a kge of 0 62 and the validation in a kge of 0 58 for daily discharge fig s2 the reservoir module was calibrated separately and includes two parameters which were optimized for kge for the 18 reservoirs for which storage and outflow observations were available table s3 the median values of the optimized parameters were assigned to the remainder of the reservoirs the soil erosion model was calibrated in two large subcatchments fig 1b for the period 2001 2010 and validated for the period 1981 2000 using literature data for hillslope erosion per land use class maetens et al 2012 table s5 the sediment transport model was calibrated with reservoir sedimentation data from 6 reservoirs avendaño salas et al 1997 and optimized for kge yielding an optimized value for the calibration of 0 89 and for the validation of 0 57 table s6 see the si for a detailed description of the calibration procedure of all model components and the optimized parameter values 2 3 scenarios for the segura river catchment we focussed our analysis on two cases first we analysed how land use change and climate change impacted ecosystem services for this analysis we used two land use maps from the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food for the years 1977 and 2001 ministerio de agricultura pesca y alimentación 2010 we subdivided the climate time series into two periods of 20 years i e 1971 1990 and 1991 2010 in this analysis we used three model runs fig 2 a green boxes i e land use 1977 for the period 1971 1990 land use 2001 for the period 1991 2010 and land use 1977 for the period 1991 2010 this allowed us to study the isolated impact of land use change the isolated impact of climate change and the combined impact of land use and climate change in these scenarios we only considered the reservoirs that were constructed prior to 1971 second we analysed how reservoir construction impacted ecosystem services we applied two scenarios one with only the reservoirs constructed prior to 1971 and one with all the reservoirs that were constructed between 1971 and 2010 furthermore we assessed how the impact of land use change compares with reservoir construction in this analysis we used three model runs considering only the period 1991 2010 fig 2a orange boxes i e land use 1977 without new reservoirs land use 2001 without new reservoirs and land use 2001 with new reservoirs this allowed us to study the isolated impact of land use change the isolated impact of reservoir construction and the combined impact of land use change and reservoir construction the combined impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction was obtained by comparing two model runs i e land use 1977 for the period 1971 1990 without new reservoirs and land use 2001 for the period 1991 2010 with new reservoirs for the taibilla subcatchment we extended our analysis with two additional land use maps i e from 1956 and 2016 these two maps were obtained by aerial photo interpretation applying a digitization scale of approximately 1 5000 the land use maps of 1977 and 2001 were revised with aerial photos for the taibilla subcatchment the analysis for the taibilla catchment focusses on the combined trends in land use and climate change over the period 1952 2018 this period was subdivided into four equally sized periods of 17 years for which we respectively used the land use maps of 1956 1952 1967 1977 1968 1984 2001 1985 2001 and 2016 2002 2018 fig 2b 2 4 input data all input maps were interpolated or resampled to the 200 m model resolution daily precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the spread and serrano notivoli et al 2017 and spain02 herrera et al 2016 daily datasets with a 5 km and 0 11 resolution respectively these climate data were only available until 2012 for the last period in the taibilla subcatchment 2002 2018 we obtained daily data from 39 precipitation and 33 temperature stations surrounding the subcatchment these data were interpolated onto the same grid as used in the spread and spain02 datasets using the interpolation techniques from serrano notivoli et al 2017 and from herrera et al 2016 for precipitation and temperature respectively the digital elevation model was obtained from a spanish national lidar dataset ministerio de fomento de españa 2015 with a 5 m resolution soil texture and organic matter were obtained from the soilgrids global dataset hengl et al 2017 with a 250 m resolution the organic matter map was aggregated per land use class from the land use map of 2001 to obtain average organic matter content per land use class subsequently the aggregated values were applied to all land use maps to obtain specific organic matter maps all soil data were interpolated onto the model grid using bilinear interpolation ndvi images were obtained from bi monthly moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data for the period 2000 2012 no ndvi images were available for the entire historic period considered in this study therefore we separated the ndvi data into inter and intra annual ndvi estimates which were combined to obtain ndvi time series needed for the model runs to determine the inter annual ndvi we applied a land use specific log linear model based on annual precipitation and temperature time series the intra annual ndvi was determined from the long term average ndvi also differentiated per land use class see the si for a detailed description of the methods applied to obtain ndvi time series 2 5 ecosystem services indicators we evaluated the impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction on a selection of ecosystem services that are most relevant for mediterranean environments we quantified these ecosystem services using a number of spatially distributed and station indicators which are related to supporting provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services table 1 our modelling approach allows to evaluate the impact on a series of ecosystem services indicators for which no or limited data are available for the study area and within the study period the spatially distributed indicators include runoff plant water stress and hillslope erosion plant water stress is an indicator of the amount of stress plants experience and ranges between 0 no stress and 1 fully stressed we determined plant water stress according to the formulations by porporato et al 2001 and allen et al 1998 which account for a plant specific stress parameter and the modelled soil moisture content see the si for a detailed description of the plant water stress formulations the station indicators include reservoir sediment yield sediment concentration reservoir storage flood discharge and low flow reservoir sediment yield and reservoir storage were only obtained at the 13 reservoirs that were constructed prior to 1971 and were determined by the annual sum and annual average respectively the other three station indicators were obtained at 19 locations situated near important cities at river bifurcations and at the catchment outlet fig 1b the sediment concentration was determined from the average daily sediment flux divided by the average daily discharge the flood discharge and low flow were determined from the discharge time series and as the median annual maximum and minimum discharge over the 20 year simulation period respectively 2 6 uncertainty analysis to account for uncertainty we evaluated the magnitude of change of the climate change trends and ecosystem services indicators we applied the effect size es to determine the magnitude of change unlike t test statistics the effect size is not affected by the sample size and therefore is an appropriate statistical test to be applied on large datasets lin et al 2013 the effect size is determined according to 1 es μ 1 μ 2 s with μ 1 and μ 2 the mean of the two populations that are being compared and s the pooled standard deviation which is determined by 2 s n 1 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 with n i and s i the size and the standard deviation of the ith population respectively in case of the spatially distributed indicators we determined the effect size per subcatchment where the population consisted of all the grid cells within the subcatchment in case of the station indicators we determined the effect size per station where the population consisted of the annual output an effect size value of 0 2 is considered small 0 5 is considered medium and 0 8 is considered large cohen 1988 in the taibilla subcatchment we evaluated the significance of the trends of the annual climate change and ecosystem services indicators using the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 3

forest and shrubland and tree crops almond trees fruit trees vineyards and olive trees and cereals respectively between 1977 and 2001 land use changed in 33 8 of the catchment and can be characterized by a transformation within natural vegetation and agricultural land uses and urban expansion fig 3 lower row natural vegetation increased in the headwater catchments and decreased in the central and eastern part of the catchment fig s3 while on average forest cover increased and shrubland cover decreased table s7 in the central part of the catchment large areas converted from forest to shrubland fig s3 apart from the most eastern part of the catchment a change in natural vegetation coincides with an opposite change in agricultural land use agricultural expansion is most prominent in the central part of the catchment mainly as a result of an increase in tree crops fruit tree and almond tree orchards and to a lesser extent to an increase in horticulture on the contrary cereal fields have been abandoned resulting in an increase in natural vegetation or have been replaced by other agricultural practices such as tree crops and horticulture as noted before in the eastern part of the catchment the decline in natural vegetation has been the result of urban expansion the first reservoirs in the segura river catchment were constructed in the beginning of the 19th century fig 3 lower right and table s1 these reservoirs were built for a mixed use of flood defence and irrigation purposes and were mostly constructed in the headwater streams of the catchment as typical grey infrastructures half way the 20th century a few hydropower plants were build with a total capacity of around 130 mw confederación hidrolgráfica del segura 2015 since 1971 the number of reservoirs increased from 13 to 33 leading to an increase in the reservoir capacity from 820 to 1230 hm3 in this period some large reservoirs were built with the sole purpose to store water for irrigation but most reservoirs that were built since 1971 have the purpose to reduce flood risk in the downstream parts of the catchment and therefore have a limited storage capacity 3 2 historical climate change annual precipitation sum decreased with 6 5 es 0 15 within the period of consideration from a catchment average of 402 mm to 376 mm fig 4 and table s8 precipitation decreased most in the headwater catchments locally exceeding 100 mm the largest relative decrease occurred in the central part of the catchment with decreases up to 20 which is also emphasized by a large effect size average annual precipitation increased in the southwest part of the catchment locally up to 30 extreme precipitation obtained from the precipitation concentration index pci martin vide 2004 which reflects the precipitation concentration at a daily time scale also decreased in the same period with a catchment average decrease of 4 0 es 0 40 most decrease in extreme precipitation is recorded in the central part of the catchment with a decrease up to 20 similar to the change in annual precipitation extreme precipitation increased in the southwest and northwest part of the catchment with increases up to 10 the average temperature has increased with 0 4 c from a catchment average of 14 8 to 15 2 c es 0 18 most increase in temperature was recorded in the southern eastern and northern part of the catchment with increases locally up to 1 5 c the temperature decreased up to 1 c in the central western part of the catchment 3 3 impacts on ecosystem services indicators climate change had a bigger impact on ecosystem services than land use change over the study period table 2 climate change caused a catchment average decrease in runoff by 12 5 es 0 20 the northern and western part of the catchment were most affected by a decrease in runoff due to climate change fig 5 upper row which coincide with the areas where precipitation sum decreased most land use change had a significantly smaller impact on runoff with a catchment average increase of 0 1 es 0 00 most increase is shown in the downstream part of the catchment and is mostly related to urban expansion where the increase in paved surface caused an increase in surface runoff runoff increased also in some other parts of the catchment related to the change in forest to shrubland fig s3 the combined impact of climate and land use change clearly shows that climate change dominates the impact on runoff although some changes as a result of land use change are visible as well climate and land use change led to a catchment average increase in plant water stress of 2 9 es 0 14 and 1 7 es 0 11 respectively climate change caused an increase in plant water stress in all except the central part of the catchment fig 5 middle row which is related to the decrease in precipitation sum and an increase in temperature in these areas land use change caused an increase in plant water stress on locations where agriculture expanded while plant water stress decreased where land use changed from forest to shrubland fig s3 the impact on plant water stress is amplified by the combination of climate and land use change leading to an increase of 4 6 es 0 25 climate and land use change led to a catchment average decrease in hillslope erosion of 17 5 es 0 02 and 2 3 es 0 00 respectively ultimately leading to combined decrease in hillslope erosion of 19 8 es 0 02 while the relative change in hillslope erosion is high especially as a result of climate change the results are of little statistical significance because changes occurred in a limited part of the catchment mainly in the areas where most water accumulates fig 5 lower row this is particularly the case for the change in hillslope erosion caused by climate change the areas where hillslope erosion increased or decreased due to climate change largely coincide with the areas where runoff increased or decreased land use change had a mixed impact on hillslope erosion hillslope erosion increased in locations where land use changed from natural to agricultural land use or where cereals were replaced by tree crops hillslope erosion decreased in areas of reforestation and urban expansion climate and land use change led to similar relative changes in reservoir sediment yield as hillslope erosion table 2 although with higher statistical significance the sediment concentration at the catchment outlet decreased as a result of climate change which is the combined result of a decrease in runoff and hillslope erosion while land use change resulted in a small increase in catchment average runoff reservoir storage decreased due to land use change the reason for this is that most reservoirs constructed prior to 1971 are located in the headwater catchments where runoff decreased as a result of land use change fig 5 flood discharge and low flow at the catchment outlet show similar results as compared to catchment average runoff with a decrease caused by climate change and a minor change caused by land use change reservoir construction led to a decrease in sediment yield in the reservoirs constructed prior to 1971 and sediment concentration at the stations while land use change only led to minor changes fig 6 reservoir storage is the only indicator where land use change had a bigger impact than reservoir construction because since 1971 only a few reservoirs were built upstream of existing reservoirs reservoir construction notably impacted flood discharge and low flow especially in the most downstream located stations with a decrease in flood discharge and an increase in low flow the combined impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction resulted in distinct responses among the ecosystem services indicators table 2 the decrease in runoff 12 4 es 0 20 was dominated by the changes caused by climate change plant water stress increased with 4 6 es 0 25 which is the combined effect of climate change and land use change all three factors of change attributed to the decrease in hillslope erosion 20 6 es 0 02 and sediment yield 45 4 es 1 40 the decrease in sediment concentration 81 6 es 4 69 is mainly attributed to reservoir construction and the decrease in reservoir storage 6 9 es 0 40 to climate change flood discharge decreased with 45 5 es 1 08 due to the combined effect of climate change and reservoir construction the decrease in low flow due to climate change is counteracted by the increase in low flow due to reservoir construction ultimately resulting in an increase of 7 2 es 0 14 3 4 long term impacts in a mountainous subcatchment land use has significantly changed in the period from 1956 to 2016 in the taibilla subcatchment fig 7 most notably is the increase in forested area from 28 in 1956 to 61 in 2016 the new forested areas have covered land previously used for cereal cultivation and shrubs which decreased from 25 to 7 and from 46 to 27 respectively annual precipitation has not significantly changed in the study period extreme precipitation decreased from around 17 mm to 15 mm average temperature significantly increased with on average 0 23 c per decade the interplay between climate and land use change in the taibilla subcatchment has resulted in a significant decrease in runoff and hillslope erosion and a significant increase in plant water stress fig 8 considering that annual precipitation sum hardly changed over the 67 year study period runoff was mainly impacted by the increase in temperature and increase in forest cover which resulted in an increase in evapotranspiration and consequently an increase in plant water stress the decrease in hillslope erosion is mostly caused by the sharp increase in forest cover although this can also be attributed to the decline in extreme precipitation the taibilla reservoir located in the central part of the catchment was built in 1979 hence due to the relatively short period climate and land use change did lead to significant trends in sediment yield and reservoir storage yet however sediment concentration at the subcatchment outlet significantly decreased which is mainly caused by the construction of the water diversion work in 1955 and the taibilla reservoir in 1979 the decrease in flood discharge is mostly in line with the decrease in runoff 4 discussion 4 1 positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services the changes that have taken place in the segura river catchment from the 1950 s onwards can be characterized by reforestation and agricultural land abandonment in the headwater catchments and reservoir construction agricultural intensification and urban expansion in the central and downstream part of the catchment fig 9 in the headwater catchments agricultural land abandonment and increased forest cover resulted in an overall greening up boix fayos et al 2007 garcía ruiz and lana renault 2011 pérez cutillas et al 2018 van leeuwen et al 2019 these changes led to a decrease in runoff and hillslope erosion comparable with results obtained in other mountainous mediterranean catchments e g lópez moreno et al 2011 lasanta and vicente serrano 2012 buendia et al 2016 runoff significantly decreased in the taibilla subcatchment even though annual precipitation sum did not significantly change for this subcatchment between 1952 and 2018 fig 7 this finding confirms the studies of boix fayos et al 2007 and pérez cutillas et al 2018 who showed from observations that runoff measured at the taibilla reservoir significantly decreased in the last 70 years heavily impacting catchment scale fluvial morphology and channel erosion processes the decrease in runoff led to a decrease in reservoir storage in many headwater reservoirs fig 6 plant water stress increased in the headwaters which is mostly the result of decreasing annual precipitation and increasing temperatures in parts of the headwaters figs 4 and 5 but also as a result of an increase in forest cover due to higher evaporative water demand of forest as compared to arable land hillslope erosion in the headwaters decreased on average due to the increase in natural vegetation at the expense of arable land the land use changes that have occurred in the headwaters had a positive impact on regulating ecosystem services such as erosion control but with trade offs affecting other ecosystems services such as water supply due to decreased runoff and primary production due to increased plant water stress table 3 confirming previous findings on the complex interactions and potential trade offs that arise after land use change doblas miranda et al 2017 requena mullor et al 2018 land use changes in the central and downstream areas are characterised by an increase in intensive agriculture horticulture and tree crops and urban expansion replacing rainfed cereals and natural vegetation similar land use changes have occurred in other mediterranean areas e g lasanta and vicente serrano 2012 requena mullor et al 2018 the urban expansion in the downstream areas of the segura river catchment follows the general trend of the increase in urban areas in the mediterranean basin over the last decades underwood et al 2009 while urban expansion had a positive impact on water supply and erosion control table 3 it is likely that these changes contributed to an increase in flood discharge and hillslope erosion downstream from new urban areas trimble 1997 nelson and booth 2002 urban expansion reduces infiltration due to a significant increase in paved surface this causes an increase in plant water stress a function of soil moisture see si negatively affecting cultural ecosystem services such as aesthetics and recreation this illustrates the importance of accounting for interactions between hydrological processes and societal changes montanari et al 2013 the increase in agriculture in the central part of the catchment resulted in an increase in plant water stress fig 5 which is the result of a change in plant specific parameters describing stress depletion fraction agricultural intensification is most likely related to the construction of reservoirs in this area di baldassarre et al 2018 although the main purpose of these reservoirs is flood control rather than irrigation water provision reservoir construction resulted in several positive impacts like a significant increase in low flow and a significant decrease in flood discharge and sediment concentration fig 6 positively affecting several ecosystem services such as erosion and flood control and water regulation these positive consequences converge with the objectives of the hydrological control works by building a large network of grey infrastructures consisting of check dams in several parts of the catchment since the 1970 s to regulate floods and control erosion boix fayos et al 2008 quiñonero rubio et al 2016 4 2 green infrastructure vs grey infrastructure due to continuing population growth urbanization and an increase in intensive irrigated agriculture water demand and soil erosion are likely to intensify in the mediterranean basin in the future underwood et al 2009 cooper et al 2013 moreover climate change is expected to cause a decrease in annual precipitation sum and an increase in temperature and extreme precipitation in the mediterranean region leading to an additional increase in plant water stress and hillslope erosion garcía ruiz et al 2011 eekhout et al 2018 in the same study area eekhout et al 2018 showed that the projected increase in extreme precipitation may lead to a redistribution of water within the catchment from green water water stored in the soil to blue water water stored in reservoirs this will most likely promote the shift from rainfed to irrigated agriculture and increase the dependency on reservoir storage and significantly increases the pressure on groundwater resources aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 integrated and catchment wide measures based on interdisciplinary assessments are needed to mitigate the expected negative impacts of future land use and climate change on provisioning and regulating ecosystem services such as water supply and flood and erosion control e g ceola et al 2016 measures are broadly subdivided into two categories 1 green infrastructures such as reforestation afforestation and sustainable land management and 2 grey infrastructures such as construction of reservoirs and check dams in the past a combination of green and grey infrastructures has been implemented in many mediterranean catchments for example it is still a common practice in headwater catchments to combine reforestations with the construction of erosion control works such as check dams to decrease sediment yield in downstream located reservoirs grey infrastructures are however often short lived e g 30 years for check dams quiñonero rubio et al 2016 due to the trapping of sediment and damage during floods besides on the medium long run they may lose their effectiveness by provoking downstream channel erosion boix fayos et al 2007 a recent study performed in the taibilla subcatchment confirmed the preference of green infrastructures over grey infrastructures considering costs and benefits of optimizing the provision of several ecosystem services i e climate regulation moderation of extreme events soil condition and erosion control boix fayos et al 2020 the construction of large reservoirs has similar effects as check dams by retaining large volumes of sediments affecting downstream hydrological and channel morphological processes vericat and batalla 2006 syvitski and saito 2007 syvitski et al 2009 syvitski and kettner 2011 bergillos et al 2016 here we show that reservoir construction as a representative example of grey infrastructure has a potential positive impact on several ecosystem services such as flood and erosion control and water regulation table 3 nevertheless past research has shown that grey infrastructure like reservoirs and check dams is often not a sustainable solution to address ecosystem services lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 di baldassarre et al 2018 the short term effect of reservoir construction is an increase in irrigation water availability but with important socioeconomic and environmental trade offs this increased availability often increases the demand and the dependency on water stored in reservoirs di baldassarre et al 2018 specifically this dependency on water from reservoirs could cause water users to lose the notion of climate change where reservoirs cause a delay in the impact of climate change on water availability lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 in the segura river catchment this is even more amplified by the inter basin water transfer from the tagus river central spain lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 which compensates for exceeding the water demand in the segura river catchment by more than 200 sabater and tockner 2009 additionally when water from reservoirs is not available due to prolonged periods of drought or due to loss of capacity by sedimentation the water demand will be satisfied with groundwater extractions leading to significant aquifer depletion gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 a process that is already unfolding in the study area rupérez moreno et al 2017 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 in the long term reservoir capacity is threatened by sediment trapping vörösmarty et al 2003 affecting channel morphology vericat and batalla 2006 and river delta morphodynamics syvitski et al 2009 ibánez et al 2019 reservoirs also reduce the connectivity within the stream network seriously affecting habitat conditions for stream ecology kondolf et al 2006 hence the positive impacts are counterbalanced by negative impacts such as an increase in water demand and habitat loss which are more difficult to quantify but are equally important the results from the taibilla subcatchment demonstrate that a significant increase in green infrastructure i e forest cover through reforestation can have significant positive impacts on ecosystem services such as erosion and flood control quantified here by a decrease of hillslope erosion sediment concentration and flood discharge fig 8 reforestation also leads to trade offs in water supply and primary production ecosystem services quantified here by decreased runoff and increased plant water stress respectively affecting downstream water availability the negative impacts may be even stronger under future climate change due to longer periods of drought and higher temperatures garcía ruiz et al 2011 climate change will also affect the development of native mediterranean vegetation and ecosystems bussotti et al 2014 riordan et al 2015 prieto and querejeta 2019 león sánchez et al 2020 which urges to invest in drought and heat resistant species to be used in future reforestation projects we argue that integrated land use planning and spatial optimisation of green infrastructures such as sustainable land management slm and nature based solutions are needed to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on ecosystem services world bank 2008 chabbi et al 2017 sanz et al 2017 where land use planning refers to changes in land use slm includes a range of technologies policies and activities that aim to integrate biophysical socio cultural and economic needs and values to support the long term productivity of ecosystems dumanski and smyth 1993 schwilch et al 2009 plot scale and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that slm enhances on site soil quality and consequently reduces runoff and soil erosion and increases water use efficiency and food production verhulst et al 2010 maetens et al 2012 delgado et al 2013 palm et al 2014 almagro et al 2016 slm also affects the off site impact on ecosystem services indicators such as a decrease in flood discharge and reservoir sediment yield azari et al 2017 eekhout and de vente 2019 well balanced implementation of spatial land use planning and application of slm practices in collaboration with stakeholders is needed to optimise the delivery of ecosystem services a previous study in the segura river catchment demonstrated that slm applied in rainfed agriculture can offset the negative impact of future climate change on ecosystem services positively affecting both on site and off site indicators eekhout and de vente 2019 but similar to reforestation large scale implementation of slm also leads to a decrease in runoff and subsequently a decrease in downstream water availability however since green infrastructure increases water stored in the soil green water it also decreases the dependency on reservoir storage blue water arguably making the green infrastructures more sustainable in time while a wide range of green infrastructures exist that can all have different impacts we argue that due to the principal role of vegetation in green infrastructures similar effects can be expected on the interaction between green and blue water in mediterranean environments furthermore the benefits of green infrastructure over grey infrastructure and the possible trade offs between up and downstream water availability supports the claim for integrated land use management in which balanced decisions are taken to optimize the spatial configuration of land use and management practices considering interactions with future climate projections and expected land use change 5 conclusions here we present a study on the impacts of climate and land use change and reservoir construction on ecosystem services in a large mediterranean catchment in the southeast of spain the changes that have occurred over the past 70 years can be considered typical for many mediterranean catchments climate change in this period is characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature land use change is characterized by two opposing trends natural vegetation increased in the headwaters due to agricultural land abandonment and reforestation while at the same time agriculture intensified in the central part of the catchment which most likely is related to the construction of reservoirs and increased demand for food production the downstream part of the catchment is characterized by urban expansion while land use changed in more than 30 of the catchment most impact on ecosystem services can be attributed to climate change and reservoir construction this can in part also be explained by the contrasting impacts of greening up and agricultural intensification at different locations in the catchment greening up that dominated land use change in the headwaters resulted in a decrease in hillslope erosion flood discharge and sediment concentration but also in an increase in plant water stress due to higher water demands of reforested areas as compared to rainfed agriculture at the same time agricultural intensification and urbanisation in the central and downstream parts of the catchment resulted in opposite impacts for most indicators all these changes had positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services relevant for mediterranean environments like water supply and flood and erosion control the positive impacts were quantified by a decrease in hillslope erosion sediment yield sediment concentration and flood discharge which are all mainly attributed to climate change and reservoir construction the negative impacts were quantified by an increase in plant water stress and a decrease in reservoir storage for which the latter is mainly attributed to reforestation in the headwater catchments the decrease in low flow caused by land use change was counteracted by an increase in low flow by reservoir construction grey infrastructure i e reservoir construction may have had a relatively positive impact on some of the ecosystem services considered here however it also increases the dependency on reservoir storage and may have attributed to an increase of irrigated agriculture increasing the pressure on reservoir storage and groundwater resources we argue that a shift is needed to green infrastructure such as reforestation and sustainable land management which may lead to similar benefits on ecosystem services but without the negative impacts caused by grey infrastructure such as habitat loss and an increase of water demand furthermore green infrastructures decrease the dependency on reservoir storage this supports the claim for integrated land use management as strategy for climate change adaptation optimizing the delivery of ecosystem services to society in mediterranean environments credit authorship contribution

5138,the mediterranean region has been identified as one of the most affected global hot spots for climate change which is already manifested by faster increasing temperatures than the global mean and significant decreases in annual precipitation besides over the past decades important land cover changes have occurred such as reforestation agricultural intensification urban expansion and the construction of many reservoirs here we study the impacts of these changes in a typical large mediterranean catchment and focus on relevant ecosystem services i e primary production water supply food production water regulation flood and erosion control and cultural ecosystem services we applied a hydrological model coupled with a soil erosion and sediment transport model for the period 1971 2010 to the entire catchment and for an extended period 1952 2018 with more pronounced land use changes to one of its subcatchments that plays a crucial role for regional drinking water provision climate change in the evaluated period is characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature land use changes included an increase in natural vegetation in the headwaters agricultural intensification and reservoir construction in the central part and urban expansion in the downstream part of the catchment the positive impacts on ecosystem services were quantified by a decrease in hillslope erosion sediment yield sediment concentration and flood discharge which are mainly attributed to climate change and reservoir construction the negative impacts were quantified by an increase in plant water stress and a decrease in reservoir storage for which the latter is mainly attributed to reforestation in the headwater catchments while grey infrastructures like reservoir construction showed important positive impacts on some ecosystem services such as water regulation and flood control they also potentially induce negative impacts such as an increase of water demand and ecological integrity we argue that a shift is needed to green infrastructures and nature based solutions such as reforestation and sustainable land management which may lead to similar benefits on ecosystem services but without the negative impacts caused by grey infrastructures this supports the need for integrated land use management to sustainably protect ecosystem services considering the expected climate change impacts on mediterranean environments and societies keywords land use change climate change reservoirs ecosystem services green infrastructure 1 introduction the mediterranean region has been identified as one of the most affected global hot spots for climate change giorgi et al 2006 recent observations have shown that temperature in the mediterranean region is increasing at a faster rate than the global mean cramer et al 2018 it is expected that this trend will continue under future climate change accompanied by a decrease in annual precipitation sum garcía ruiz et al 2011 leading to an increase in the frequency intensity and duration of droughts and a decrease in stream flow burke et al 2006 impacts of climate change have already been observed in many mediterranean rivers in the last decades gallart and llorens 2004 lópez moreno et al 2006 garcía ruiz et al 2011 buendia et al 2016 pérez cutillas et al 2018 masseroni et al 2020 land use changes such as reforestation deforestation and expansion of intensive agriculture are likely to amplify the impact of climate change on ecosystem services sala et al 2000 garcía ruiz et al 2011 the large scale construction of reservoirs in the mediterranean region has also affected river flow and sediment dynamics over the past century cooper et al 2013 together these changes impacted the most relevant ecosystem services for mediterranean environments including supporting primary production provisioning water supply and food production regulating water regulation flood and erosion control and cultural ecosystem services this illustrates the importance to consider feedbacks between hydrological processes land use society and ecosystems through an interdisciplinary approach connecting hydrological changes with dynamics of socio ecosystems montanari et al 2013 ceola et al 2016 a major part of land use in mediterranean regions is dominated by agricultural areas cooper et al 2013 covering around 40 of the mediterranean basin malek and verburg 2017 while total agricultural area remained stable there has been a shift from rainfed agriculture in headwater catchments to more intensive irrigated agricultural practices in the downstream areas puigdefábregas and mendizabal 1998 garcía ruiz et al 2010 nainggolan et al 2012 abandoned agricultural land and intensified agriculture are both prone to land degradation often leading to increases in surface runoff and soil erosion lesschen et al 2007 garcía ruiz et al 2010 garcía ruiz and lana renault 2011 zink et al 2011 rogger et al 2017 land abandonment took place where irrigation water was not readily available where mechanization was more difficult to implement or in areas further away from the main distribution infrastructure such as in mountainous areas nainggolan et al 2012 while soil erosion often increases in the first years after agricultural lands have been abandoned poesen and hooke 1997 garcía ruiz et al 2008 under favourable environmental conditions these lands are usually occupied by natural vegetation of shrubland and forest cover after several years sirami et al 2010 hansen et al 2013 leading to a decrease in soil erosion alatorre et al 2012 and an increase in soil organic carbon novara et al 2017 the return of natural vegetation especially forest cover may have a significant impact on the hydrological cycle and impacts downstream water availability most importantly forest cover increases rainfall interception and transpiration ultimately leading to a decrease in stream flow andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 nosetto et al 2005 lópez moreno et al 2006 pérez cutillas et al 2018 land use changes often take a relatively long time to have a measurable impact on stream flow and sediment dynamics in rivers whereas the construction of dams as a typical example of grey infrastructures often has an immediate effect wang 2014 over the past century river flow in many mediterranean catchments has been regulated by the construction of dams in the mediterranean basin most dams were built in spain and turkey many with the purpose to store water for irrigation cooper et al 2013 dams can have benefits to some hydrological ecosystem services such as flood control and water regulation thoms and sheldon 2000 cudennec et al 2007 lópez moreno et al 2011 cooper et al 2013 reservoir construction has mitigated the impact of droughts on stream flow at short time scales but amplified the impact on longer time scales because of an increase in water demand after reservoir construction lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 alterations of the flow by dam construction also have negative ecological consequences including a reversal of the seasonal flow pattern affecting the ecological flow regime of rivers belmar et al 2010 the high degree of fragmentation in mediterranean rivers due to dam construction affected ecological processes that depend on longitudinal river connectivity such as transport of organic and inorganic matter and upstream and downstream movements of aquatic and riparian species lehner et al 2011 grill et al 2019 dams alter the sediment transport dynamics of rivers most notably by trapping large amounts of sediments that are transported by the river flow often dams trap almost all sediment that is transported towards the reservoir vörösmarty et al 2003 vericat and batalla 2006 potentially leading to channel incision downstream of dams vericat and batalla 2006 and to morphological changes in the river delta syvitski et al 2009 ibánez et al 2019 because dams trap such large volumes of sediments reservoirs have a limited lifetime it has been estimated that the capacity loss of the world s reservoirs is about 1 wcd et al 2000 wisser et al 2013 which translates to an expected lifetime of 100 years for mediterranean areas even higher annual capacity losses 2 5 are reported leading to even shorter expected reservoir lifetimes vanmaercke et al 2011 given their often high implementation and maintenance costs and undesired side effects there is increasing discussion about the effectiveness of grey infrastructures like dams to control hydrological and sediment fluxes effectively as an alternative there is increasing interest in green infrastructures and nature based solutions based on vegetation land use and land management changes or building with nature to gradually control hydrology and sediment fluxes cohen shacham et al 2019 the mediterranean climate is characterized by high inter annual variability in precipitation summer drought and intense rainfall cortesi et al 2012 merheb et al 2016 the combination of these climate characteristics and the typical steep slopes have resulted in a high frequency of flash floods and high erosion rates in the mediterranean region llasat et al 2010 tarolli et al 2012 over the last few decades discharge observations have shown a decreasing trend in stream flow in many mediterranean catchments lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2019 part of this decline is explained by climate change through a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature from which the latter causes increased evapotranspiration lópez moreno et al 2011 pérez martín et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2014 lutz et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 in mountainous catchments there is a tendency of an earlier peak in spring flow caused by an increase in temperature affecting snow melt garcía ruiz et al 2011 morán tejeda et al 2014 while climate change may have had an important impact on stream flow anthropogenic factors such as water abstractions for irrigation purposes and reforestation have played an important role as well lópez moreno et al 2011 milano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2019 illustrating the feedback between societal changes and hydrological processes ceola et al 2016 some studies projected that stream flow will decrease even more due to decreasing annual precipitation sum and increasing evapotranspiration under climate change garcía ruiz et al 2011 cramer et al 2018 brogli et al 2019 while other studies highlight the expected increase in extreme precipitation tramblay et al 2018 which could lead to increased runoff and discharge to reservoirs under climate change eekhout et al 2018 blöschl et al 2019 in the second half of the 20th century many land use and climate changes have occurred in the mediterranean region significantly altering the hydrological cycle the combination of these changes have led to complex interactions among several ecosystem services doblas miranda et al 2017 for instance reforestation may lead to a decrease in hillslope erosion e g interrill and rill erosion but often leads to a decrease in downstream water availability reflecting benefits and trade offs for different ecosystem services boix fayos et al 2007 2015 ren et al 2014 better understanding of these interactions both from grey and green infrastructures including feedbacks between hydrology and social systems and how they lead to benefits and trade offs for ecosystem services is important to design climate change adaptation strategies through land use and management practices e g montanari et al 2013 cohen shacham et al 2019 the objective of this study is to assess how historical land use and climate change and the construction of a network of large reservoirs in the segura river catchment in the last 70 years have interacted and affected a selection of most relevant ecosystem services by putting emphasis on ecosystem services we aim to contribute to better understanding and prediction of interactions between hydrological and societal changes which are essential to determine water security and to set priorities for environmental management e g montanari et al 2013 eekhout et al 2018 eekhout and de vente 2019 the segura catchment is a typical mediterranean catchment where many of the before mentioned changes have occurred for this assessment we applied a hydrological model coupled with a soil erosion and sediment transport model to study the impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction on the most relevant ecosystem services we applied the model to the segura river catchment for the period 1971 2010 and for an extended period 1952 2018 to the taibilla subcatchment which plays an important role in the provision of drinking water in the region and is characterised by pronounced land use changes in that period with this study we provide a practical example of a methodology to support adaptation of water resources management to the current and future challenges posed by environmental and societal change ceola et al 2016 2 material methods 2 1 study area this study is performed in the segura river catchment 15 955 km2 located in the southeast of spain fig 1 a the elevation ranges between sea level and 2336 masl catchment averaged annual rainfall amounts to 377 mm for the period 1981 2010 serrano notivoli et al 2017 and mean annual temperature ranges between 10 7 and 18 6 c 1981 2010 herrera et al 2016 from the headwaters to the downstream area the climate is mediterranean csa and csb according to the köppen geiger climate classification in the headwaters 21 and semi arid bsk and bsh in the rest of the catchment 79 the main soil classes are calcisols 41 leptosols 35 luvisols 4 and kastanozems 4 hengl et al 2017 it has been estimated that in the segura river catchment water demands exceed supply by 224 sabater and tockner 2009 to meet the demand since the 1980s water from the tagus river is transported to the segura river catchment through an inter basin water transfer over a length of 292 km besides 32 reservoirs have been constructed in the catchment with a total capacity of 1230 hm3 fig 1b and table s1 fourteen reservoirs are allocated exclusively for irrigation purposes the other reservoirs have mixed functions for drinking water supply electricity generation and flood prevention in the segura catchment we assessed the impacts of land use and climate change and the construction of reservoirs for the period 1971 2010 in addition we performed a long term land use change impact assessment in the taibilla subcatchment 595 km2 located in the headwaters of the segura river catchment for the period 1952 2018 the reason for the focus on the taibilla subcatchment is that it is located in a part of the segura river catchment with more pronounced land use changes over the past decades besides the taibilla reservoir constructed in 1979 with a capacity of 9 hm3 plays an essential role in provision of drinking water to approximately 2 5 million people in the provinces murcia albacete and alicante grindlay et al 2011 melgarejo moreno et al 2019 since 1955 water from the taibilla subcatchment is diverted through a water diversion work and transported to downstream areas for domestic use previous research showed that the drinking water supply may be under threat due to a decline of runoff caused by reforestation in this subcatchment quiñonero rubio et al 2016 pérez cutillas et al 2018 the elevation in the taibilla subcatchment ranges between 524 and 2030 masl catchment averaged annual rainfall amounts 514 mm 1981 2010 and mean annual temperature is 12 4 c 1981 2010 the climate is mainly classified as mediterranean csa 88 but the downstream part of the subcatchment is classified as semi arid bsk 12 the main soil classes are leptosols 53 cambisols 17 calcisols 12 and luvisols 10 hengl et al 2017 2 2 model to assess the impacts of reservoir construction and changes in land use and climate we applied the sphy model v3 0 terink et al 2015 eekhout et al 2018 futurewater 2019 a spatially distributed hydrological model fully coupled with a soil erosion and a sediment transport model the model is applied on a cell by cell basis and with a daily time step we employed a model grid resolution of 200 m the hydrological model simulates most relevant hydrological processes such as interception evapotranspiration surface runoff and lateral and vertical soil moisture flow water is routed through the catchment using a single flow algorithm accounting for reservoir operations through the reservoir module the reservoir module determines reservoir outflow based on reservoir capacity and actual storage hanasaki et al 2006 we replaced the fixed exponent 1 5 from the model proposed by hanasaki et al 2006 by a model parameter b to account for the variation in reservoir regulation among the reservoirs in the study area the soil erosion model based on morgan and duzant 2008 simulates most relevant hillslope erosion processes such as soil detachment by raindrop impact and runoff the sediment is transported through the catchment accounting for the transport capacity of the flow and reservoir sedimentation through a trapping efficiency equation the model incorporates a vegetation model based on the spatial and temporal variation of the normalized differenced vegetation index ndvi which determines actual evapotranspiration interception canopy storage throughfall and canopy cover the hydrological model was calibrated in a headwater subcatchment 696 km2 fig 1b for the period 2001 2010 and validated for the period 1987 2000 using daily observed discharge data we applied the spotpy calibration package houska et al 2015 to calibrate the hydrological model using the simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the kling gupta model efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which has an optimum at 1 the calibration resulted in a kge of 0 62 and the validation in a kge of 0 58 for daily discharge fig s2 the reservoir module was calibrated separately and includes two parameters which were optimized for kge for the 18 reservoirs for which storage and outflow observations were available table s3 the median values of the optimized parameters were assigned to the remainder of the reservoirs the soil erosion model was calibrated in two large subcatchments fig 1b for the period 2001 2010 and validated for the period 1981 2000 using literature data for hillslope erosion per land use class maetens et al 2012 table s5 the sediment transport model was calibrated with reservoir sedimentation data from 6 reservoirs avendaño salas et al 1997 and optimized for kge yielding an optimized value for the calibration of 0 89 and for the validation of 0 57 table s6 see the si for a detailed description of the calibration procedure of all model components and the optimized parameter values 2 3 scenarios for the segura river catchment we focussed our analysis on two cases first we analysed how land use change and climate change impacted ecosystem services for this analysis we used two land use maps from the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food for the years 1977 and 2001 ministerio de agricultura pesca y alimentación 2010 we subdivided the climate time series into two periods of 20 years i e 1971 1990 and 1991 2010 in this analysis we used three model runs fig 2 a green boxes i e land use 1977 for the period 1971 1990 land use 2001 for the period 1991 2010 and land use 1977 for the period 1991 2010 this allowed us to study the isolated impact of land use change the isolated impact of climate change and the combined impact of land use and climate change in these scenarios we only considered the reservoirs that were constructed prior to 1971 second we analysed how reservoir construction impacted ecosystem services we applied two scenarios one with only the reservoirs constructed prior to 1971 and one with all the reservoirs that were constructed between 1971 and 2010 furthermore we assessed how the impact of land use change compares with reservoir construction in this analysis we used three model runs considering only the period 1991 2010 fig 2a orange boxes i e land use 1977 without new reservoirs land use 2001 without new reservoirs and land use 2001 with new reservoirs this allowed us to study the isolated impact of land use change the isolated impact of reservoir construction and the combined impact of land use change and reservoir construction the combined impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction was obtained by comparing two model runs i e land use 1977 for the period 1971 1990 without new reservoirs and land use 2001 for the period 1991 2010 with new reservoirs for the taibilla subcatchment we extended our analysis with two additional land use maps i e from 1956 and 2016 these two maps were obtained by aerial photo interpretation applying a digitization scale of approximately 1 5000 the land use maps of 1977 and 2001 were revised with aerial photos for the taibilla subcatchment the analysis for the taibilla catchment focusses on the combined trends in land use and climate change over the period 1952 2018 this period was subdivided into four equally sized periods of 17 years for which we respectively used the land use maps of 1956 1952 1967 1977 1968 1984 2001 1985 2001 and 2016 2002 2018 fig 2b 2 4 input data all input maps were interpolated or resampled to the 200 m model resolution daily precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the spread and serrano notivoli et al 2017 and spain02 herrera et al 2016 daily datasets with a 5 km and 0 11 resolution respectively these climate data were only available until 2012 for the last period in the taibilla subcatchment 2002 2018 we obtained daily data from 39 precipitation and 33 temperature stations surrounding the subcatchment these data were interpolated onto the same grid as used in the spread and spain02 datasets using the interpolation techniques from serrano notivoli et al 2017 and from herrera et al 2016 for precipitation and temperature respectively the digital elevation model was obtained from a spanish national lidar dataset ministerio de fomento de españa 2015 with a 5 m resolution soil texture and organic matter were obtained from the soilgrids global dataset hengl et al 2017 with a 250 m resolution the organic matter map was aggregated per land use class from the land use map of 2001 to obtain average organic matter content per land use class subsequently the aggregated values were applied to all land use maps to obtain specific organic matter maps all soil data were interpolated onto the model grid using bilinear interpolation ndvi images were obtained from bi monthly moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data for the period 2000 2012 no ndvi images were available for the entire historic period considered in this study therefore we separated the ndvi data into inter and intra annual ndvi estimates which were combined to obtain ndvi time series needed for the model runs to determine the inter annual ndvi we applied a land use specific log linear model based on annual precipitation and temperature time series the intra annual ndvi was determined from the long term average ndvi also differentiated per land use class see the si for a detailed description of the methods applied to obtain ndvi time series 2 5 ecosystem services indicators we evaluated the impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction on a selection of ecosystem services that are most relevant for mediterranean environments we quantified these ecosystem services using a number of spatially distributed and station indicators which are related to supporting provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services table 1 our modelling approach allows to evaluate the impact on a series of ecosystem services indicators for which no or limited data are available for the study area and within the study period the spatially distributed indicators include runoff plant water stress and hillslope erosion plant water stress is an indicator of the amount of stress plants experience and ranges between 0 no stress and 1 fully stressed we determined plant water stress according to the formulations by porporato et al 2001 and allen et al 1998 which account for a plant specific stress parameter and the modelled soil moisture content see the si for a detailed description of the plant water stress formulations the station indicators include reservoir sediment yield sediment concentration reservoir storage flood discharge and low flow reservoir sediment yield and reservoir storage were only obtained at the 13 reservoirs that were constructed prior to 1971 and were determined by the annual sum and annual average respectively the other three station indicators were obtained at 19 locations situated near important cities at river bifurcations and at the catchment outlet fig 1b the sediment concentration was determined from the average daily sediment flux divided by the average daily discharge the flood discharge and low flow were determined from the discharge time series and as the median annual maximum and minimum discharge over the 20 year simulation period respectively 2 6 uncertainty analysis to account for uncertainty we evaluated the magnitude of change of the climate change trends and ecosystem services indicators we applied the effect size es to determine the magnitude of change unlike t test statistics the effect size is not affected by the sample size and therefore is an appropriate statistical test to be applied on large datasets lin et al 2013 the effect size is determined according to 1 es μ 1 μ 2 s with μ 1 and μ 2 the mean of the two populations that are being compared and s the pooled standard deviation which is determined by 2 s n 1 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 with n i and s i the size and the standard deviation of the ith population respectively in case of the spatially distributed indicators we determined the effect size per subcatchment where the population consisted of all the grid cells within the subcatchment in case of the station indicators we determined the effect size per station where the population consisted of the annual output an effect size value of 0 2 is considered small 0 5 is considered medium and 0 8 is considered large cohen 1988 in the taibilla subcatchment we evaluated the significance of the trends of the annual climate change and ecosystem services indicators using the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 results 3 1 land use change and reservoir construction the land use in the segura river catchment is dominated by natural 53 and agricultural land use 45 fig 3 upper row and table s7 divided over forest and shrubland and tree crops almond trees fruit trees vineyards and olive trees and cereals respectively between 1977 and 2001 land use changed in 33 8 of the catchment and can be characterized by a transformation within natural vegetation and agricultural land uses and urban expansion fig 3 lower row natural vegetation increased in the headwater catchments and decreased in the central and eastern part of the catchment fig s3 while on average forest cover increased and shrubland cover decreased table s7 in the central part of the catchment large areas converted from forest to shrubland fig s3 apart from the most eastern part of the catchment a change in natural vegetation coincides with an opposite change in agricultural land use agricultural expansion is most prominent in the central part of the catchment mainly as a result of an increase in tree crops fruit tree and almond tree orchards and to a lesser extent to an increase in horticulture on the contrary cereal fields have been abandoned resulting in an increase in natural vegetation or have been replaced by other agricultural practices such as tree crops and horticulture as noted before in the eastern part of the catchment the decline in natural vegetation has been the result of urban expansion the first reservoirs in the segura river catchment were constructed in the beginning of the 19th century fig 3 lower right and table s1 these reservoirs were built for a mixed use of flood defence and irrigation purposes and were mostly constructed in the headwater streams of the catchment as typical grey infrastructures half way the 20th century a few hydropower plants were build with a total capacity of around 130 mw confederación hidrolgráfica del segura 2015 since 1971 the number of reservoirs increased from 13 to 33 leading to an increase in the reservoir capacity from 820 to 1230 hm3 in this period some large reservoirs were built with the sole purpose to store water for irrigation but most reservoirs that were built since 1971 have the purpose to reduce flood risk in the downstream parts of the catchment and therefore have a limited storage capacity 3 2 historical climate change annual precipitation sum decreased with 6 5 es 0 15 within the period of consideration from a catchment average of 402 mm to 376 mm fig 4 and table s8 precipitation decreased most in the headwater catchments locally exceeding 100 mm the largest relative decrease occurred in the central part of the catchment with decreases up to 20 which is also emphasized by a large effect size average annual precipitation increased in the southwest part of the catchment locally up to 30 extreme precipitation obtained from the precipitation concentration index pci martin vide 2004 which reflects the precipitation concentration at a daily time scale also decreased in the same period with a catchment average decrease of 4 0 es 0 40 most decrease in extreme precipitation is recorded in the central part of the catchment with a decrease up to 20 similar to the change in annual precipitation extreme precipitation increased in the southwest and northwest part of the catchment with increases up to 10 the average temperature has increased with 0 4 c from a catchment average of 14 8 to 15 2 c es 0 18 most increase in temperature was recorded in the southern eastern and northern part of the catchment with increases locally up to 1 5 c the temperature decreased up to 1 c in the central western part of the catchment 3 3 impacts on ecosystem services indicators climate change had a bigger impact on ecosystem services than land use change over the study period table 2 climate change caused a catchment average decrease in runoff by 12 5 es 0 20 the northern and western part of the catchment were most affected by a decrease in runoff due to climate change fig 5 upper row which coincide with the areas where precipitation sum decreased most land use change had a significantly smaller impact on runoff with a catchment average increase of 0 1 es 0 00 most increase is shown in the downstream part of the catchment and is mostly related to urban expansion where the increase in paved surface caused an increase in surface runoff runoff increased also in some other parts of the catchment related to the change in forest to shrubland fig s3 the combined impact of climate and land use change clearly shows that climate change dominates the impact on runoff although some changes as a result of land use change are visible as well climate and land use change led to a catchment average increase in plant water stress of 2 9 es 0 14 and 1 7 es 0 11 respectively climate change caused an increase in plant water stress in all except the central part of the catchment fig 5 middle row which is related to the decrease in precipitation sum and an increase in temperature in these areas land use change caused an increase in plant water stress on locations where agriculture expanded while plant water stress decreased where land use changed from forest to shrubland fig s3 the impact on plant water stress is amplified by the combination of climate and land use change leading to an increase of 4 6 es 0 25 climate and land use change led to a catchment average decrease in hillslope erosion of 17 5 es 0 02 and 2 3 es 0 00 respectively ultimately leading to combined decrease in hillslope erosion of 19 8 es 0 02 while the relative change in hillslope erosion is high especially as a result of climate change the results are of little statistical significance because changes occurred in a limited part of the catchment mainly in the areas where most water accumulates fig 5 lower row this is particularly the case for the change in hillslope erosion caused by climate change the areas where hillslope erosion increased or decreased due to climate change largely coincide with the areas where runoff increased or decreased land use change had a mixed impact on hillslope erosion hillslope erosion increased in locations where land use changed from natural to agricultural land use or where cereals were replaced by tree crops hillslope erosion decreased in areas of reforestation and urban expansion climate and land use change led to similar relative changes in reservoir sediment yield as hillslope erosion table 2 although with higher statistical significance the sediment concentration at the catchment outlet decreased as a result of climate change which is the combined result of a decrease in runoff and hillslope erosion while land use change resulted in a small increase in catchment average runoff reservoir storage decreased due to land use change the reason for this is that most reservoirs constructed prior to 1971 are located in the headwater catchments where runoff decreased as a result of land use change fig 5 flood discharge and low flow at the catchment outlet show similar results as compared to catchment average runoff with a decrease caused by climate change and a minor change caused by land use change reservoir construction led to a decrease in sediment yield in the reservoirs constructed prior to 1971 and sediment concentration at the stations while land use change only led to minor changes fig 6 reservoir storage is the only indicator where land use change had a bigger impact than reservoir construction because since 1971 only a few reservoirs were built upstream of existing reservoirs reservoir construction notably impacted flood discharge and low flow especially in the most downstream located stations with a decrease in flood discharge and an increase in low flow the combined impact of climate change land use change and reservoir construction resulted in distinct responses among the ecosystem services indicators table 2 the decrease in runoff 12 4 es 0 20 was dominated by the changes caused by climate change plant water stress increased with 4 6 es 0 25 which is the combined effect of climate change and land use change all three factors of change attributed to the decrease in hillslope erosion 20 6 es 0 02 and sediment yield 45 4 es 1 40 the decrease in sediment concentration 81 6 es 4 69 is mainly attributed to reservoir construction and the decrease in reservoir storage 6 9 es 0 40 to climate change flood discharge decreased with 45 5 es 1 08 due to the combined effect of climate change and reservoir construction the decrease in low flow due to climate change is counteracted by the increase in low flow due to reservoir construction ultimately resulting in an increase of 7 2 es 0 14 3 4 long term impacts in a mountainous subcatchment land use has significantly changed in the period from 1956 to 2016 in the taibilla subcatchment fig 7 most notably is the increase in forested area from 28 in 1956 to 61 in 2016 the new forested areas have covered land previously used for cereal cultivation and shrubs which decreased from 25 to 7 and from 46 to 27 respectively annual precipitation has not significantly changed in the study period extreme precipitation decreased from around 17 mm to 15 mm average temperature significantly increased with on average 0 23 c per decade the interplay between climate and land use change in the taibilla subcatchment has resulted in a significant decrease in runoff and hillslope erosion and a significant increase in plant water stress fig 8 considering that annual precipitation sum hardly changed over the 67 year study period runoff was mainly impacted by the increase in temperature and increase in forest cover which resulted in an increase in evapotranspiration and consequently an increase in plant water stress the decrease in hillslope erosion is mostly caused by the sharp increase in forest cover although this can also be attributed to the decline in extreme precipitation the taibilla reservoir located in the central part of the catchment was built in 1979 hence due to the relatively short period climate and land use change did lead to significant trends in sediment yield and reservoir storage yet however sediment concentration at the subcatchment outlet significantly decreased which is mainly caused by the construction of the water diversion work in 1955 and the taibilla reservoir in 1979 the decrease in flood discharge is mostly in line with the decrease in runoff 4 discussion 4 1 positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services the changes that have taken place in the segura river catchment from the 1950 s onwards can be characterized by reforestation and agricultural land abandonment in the headwater catchments and reservoir construction agricultural intensification and urban expansion in the central and downstream part of the catchment fig 9 in the headwater catchments agricultural land abandonment and increased forest cover resulted in an overall greening up boix fayos et al 2007 garcía ruiz and lana renault 2011 pérez cutillas et al 2018 van leeuwen et al 2019 these changes led to a decrease in runoff and hillslope erosion comparable with results obtained in other mountainous mediterranean catchments e g lópez moreno et al 2011 lasanta and vicente serrano 2012 buendia et al 2016 runoff significantly decreased in the taibilla subcatchment even though annual precipitation sum did not significantly change for this subcatchment between 1952 and 2018 fig 7 this finding confirms the studies of boix fayos et al 2007 and pérez cutillas et al 2018 who showed from observations that runoff measured at the taibilla reservoir significantly decreased in the last 70 years heavily impacting catchment scale fluvial morphology and channel erosion processes the decrease in runoff led to a decrease in reservoir storage in many headwater reservoirs fig 6 plant water stress increased in the headwaters which is mostly the result of decreasing annual precipitation and increasing temperatures in parts of the headwaters figs 4 and 5 but also as a result of an increase in forest cover due to higher evaporative water demand of forest as compared to arable land hillslope erosion in the headwaters decreased on average due to the increase in natural vegetation at the expense of arable land the land use changes that have occurred in the headwaters had a positive impact on regulating ecosystem services such as erosion control but with trade offs affecting other ecosystems services such as water supply due to decreased runoff and primary production due to increased plant water stress table 3 confirming previous findings on the complex interactions and potential trade offs that arise after land use change doblas miranda et al 2017 requena mullor et al 2018 land use changes in the central and downstream areas are characterised by an increase in intensive agriculture horticulture and tree crops and urban expansion replacing rainfed cereals and natural vegetation similar land use changes have occurred in other mediterranean areas e g lasanta and vicente serrano 2012 requena mullor et al 2018 the urban expansion in the downstream areas of the segura river catchment follows the general trend of the increase in urban areas in the mediterranean basin over the last decades underwood et al 2009 while urban expansion had a positive impact on water supply and erosion control table 3 it is likely that these changes contributed to an increase in flood discharge and hillslope erosion downstream from new urban areas trimble 1997 nelson and booth 2002 urban expansion reduces infiltration due to a significant increase in paved surface this causes an increase in plant water stress a function of soil moisture see si negatively affecting cultural ecosystem services such as aesthetics and recreation this illustrates the importance of accounting for interactions between hydrological processes and societal changes montanari et al 2013 the increase in agriculture in the central part of the catchment resulted in an increase in plant water stress fig 5 which is the result of a change in plant specific parameters describing stress depletion fraction agricultural intensification is most likely related to the construction of reservoirs in this area di baldassarre et al 2018 although the main purpose of these reservoirs is flood control rather than irrigation water provision reservoir construction resulted in several positive impacts like a significant increase in low flow and a significant decrease in flood discharge and sediment concentration fig 6 positively affecting several ecosystem services such as erosion and flood control and water regulation these positive consequences converge with the objectives of the hydrological control works by building a large network of grey infrastructures consisting of check dams in several parts of the catchment since the 1970 s to regulate floods and control erosion boix fayos et al 2008 quiñonero rubio et al 2016 4 2 green infrastructure vs grey infrastructure due to continuing population growth urbanization and an increase in intensive irrigated agriculture water demand and soil erosion are likely to intensify in the mediterranean basin in the future underwood et al 2009 cooper et al 2013 moreover climate change is expected to cause a decrease in annual precipitation sum and an increase in temperature and extreme precipitation in the mediterranean region leading to an additional increase in plant water stress and hillslope erosion garcía ruiz et al 2011 eekhout et al 2018 in the same study area eekhout et al 2018 showed that the projected increase in extreme precipitation may lead to a redistribution of water within the catchment from green water water stored in the soil to blue water water stored in reservoirs this will most likely promote the shift from rainfed to irrigated agriculture and increase the dependency on reservoir storage and significantly increases the pressure on groundwater resources aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 integrated and catchment wide measures based on interdisciplinary assessments are needed to mitigate the expected negative impacts of future land use and climate change on provisioning and regulating ecosystem services such as water supply and flood and erosion control e g ceola et al 2016 measures are broadly subdivided into two categories 1 green infrastructures such as reforestation afforestation and sustainable land management and 2 grey infrastructures such as construction of reservoirs and check dams in the past a combination of green and grey infrastructures has been implemented in many mediterranean catchments for example it is still a common practice in headwater catchments to combine reforestations with the construction of erosion control works such as check dams to decrease sediment yield in downstream located reservoirs grey infrastructures are however often short lived e g 30 years for check dams quiñonero rubio et al 2016 due to the trapping of sediment and damage during floods besides on the medium long run they may lose their effectiveness by provoking downstream channel erosion boix fayos et al 2007 a recent study performed in the taibilla subcatchment confirmed the preference of green infrastructures over grey infrastructures considering costs and benefits of optimizing the provision of several ecosystem services i e climate regulation moderation of extreme events soil condition and erosion control boix fayos et al 2020 the construction of large reservoirs has similar effects as check dams by retaining large volumes of sediments affecting downstream hydrological and channel morphological processes vericat and batalla 2006 syvitski and saito 2007 syvitski et al 2009 syvitski and kettner 2011 bergillos et al 2016 here we show that reservoir construction as a representative example of grey infrastructure has a potential positive impact on several ecosystem services such as flood and erosion control and water regulation table 3 nevertheless past research has shown that grey infrastructure like reservoirs and check dams is often not a sustainable solution to address ecosystem services lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 di baldassarre et al 2018 the short term effect of reservoir construction is an increase in irrigation water availability but with important socioeconomic and environmental trade offs this increased availability often increases the demand and the dependency on water stored in reservoirs di baldassarre et al 2018 specifically this dependency on water from reservoirs could cause water users to lose the notion of climate change where reservoirs cause a delay in the impact of climate change on water availability lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 in the segura river catchment this is even more amplified by the inter basin water transfer from the tagus river central spain lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 which compensates for exceeding the water demand in the segura river catchment by more than 200 sabater and tockner 2009 additionally when water from reservoirs is not available due to prolonged periods of drought or due to loss of capacity by sedimentation the water demand will be satisfied with groundwater extractions leading to significant aquifer depletion gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 a process that is already unfolding in the study area rupérez moreno et al 2017 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 in the long term reservoir capacity is threatened by sediment trapping vörösmarty et al 2003 affecting channel morphology vericat and batalla 2006 and river delta morphodynamics syvitski et al 2009 ibánez et al 2019 reservoirs also reduce the connectivity within the stream network seriously affecting habitat conditions for stream ecology kondolf et al 2006 hence the positive impacts are counterbalanced by negative impacts such as an increase in water demand and habitat loss which are more difficult to quantify but are equally important the results from the taibilla subcatchment demonstrate that a significant increase in green infrastructure i e forest cover through reforestation can have significant positive impacts on ecosystem services such as erosion and flood control quantified here by a decrease of hillslope erosion sediment concentration and flood discharge fig 8 reforestation also leads to trade offs in water supply and primary production ecosystem services quantified here by decreased runoff and increased plant water stress respectively affecting downstream water availability the negative impacts may be even stronger under future climate change due to longer periods of drought and higher temperatures garcía ruiz et al 2011 climate change will also affect the development of native mediterranean vegetation and ecosystems bussotti et al 2014 riordan et al 2015 prieto and querejeta 2019 león sánchez et al 2020 which urges to invest in drought and heat resistant species to be used in future reforestation projects we argue that integrated land use planning and spatial optimisation of green infrastructures such as sustainable land management slm and nature based solutions are needed to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on ecosystem services world bank 2008 chabbi et al 2017 sanz et al 2017 where land use planning refers to changes in land use slm includes a range of technologies policies and activities that aim to integrate biophysical socio cultural and economic needs and values to support the long term productivity of ecosystems dumanski and smyth 1993 schwilch et al 2009 plot scale and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that slm enhances on site soil quality and consequently reduces runoff and soil erosion and increases water use efficiency and food production verhulst et al 2010 maetens et al 2012 delgado et al 2013 palm et al 2014 almagro et al 2016 slm also affects the off site impact on ecosystem services indicators such as a decrease in flood discharge and reservoir sediment yield azari et al 2017 eekhout and de vente 2019 well balanced implementation of spatial land use planning and application of slm practices in collaboration with stakeholders is needed to optimise the delivery of ecosystem services a previous study in the segura river catchment demonstrated that slm applied in rainfed agriculture can offset the negative impact of future climate change on ecosystem services positively affecting both on site and off site indicators eekhout and de vente 2019 but similar to reforestation large scale implementation of slm also leads to a decrease in runoff and subsequently a decrease in downstream water availability however since green infrastructure increases water stored in the soil green water it also decreases the dependency on reservoir storage blue water arguably making the green infrastructures more sustainable in time while a wide range of green infrastructures exist that can all have different impacts we argue that due to the principal role of vegetation in green infrastructures similar effects can be expected on the interaction between green and blue water in mediterranean environments furthermore the benefits of green infrastructure over grey infrastructure and the possible trade offs between up and downstream water availability supports the claim for integrated land use management in which balanced decisions are taken to optimize the spatial configuration of land use and management practices considering interactions with future climate projections and expected land use change 5 conclusions here we present a study on the impacts of climate and land use change and reservoir construction on ecosystem services in a large mediterranean catchment in the southeast of spain the changes that have occurred over the past 70 years can be considered typical for many mediterranean catchments climate change in this period is characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature land use change is characterized by two opposing trends natural vegetation increased in the headwaters due to agricultural land abandonment and reforestation while at the same time agriculture intensified in the central part of the catchment which most likely is related to the construction of reservoirs and increased demand for food production the downstream part of the catchment is characterized by urban expansion while land use changed in more than 30 of the catchment most impact on ecosystem services can be attributed to climate change and reservoir construction this can in part also be explained by the contrasting impacts of greening up and agricultural intensification at different locations in the catchment greening up that dominated land use change in the headwaters resulted in a decrease in hillslope erosion flood discharge and sediment concentration but also in an increase in plant water stress due to higher water demands of reforested areas as compared to rainfed agriculture at the same time agricultural intensification and urbanisation in the central and downstream parts of the catchment resulted in opposite impacts for most indicators all these changes had positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services relevant for mediterranean environments like water supply and flood and erosion control the positive impacts were quantified by a decrease in hillslope erosion sediment yield sediment concentration and flood discharge which are all mainly attributed to climate change and reservoir construction the negative impacts were quantified by an increase in plant water stress and a decrease in reservoir storage for which the latter is mainly attributed to reforestation in the headwater catchments the decrease in low flow caused by land use change was counteracted by an increase in low flow by reservoir construction grey infrastructure i e reservoir construction may have had a relatively positive impact on some of the ecosystem services considered here however it also increases the dependency on reservoir storage and may have attributed to an increase of irrigated agriculture increasing the pressure on reservoir storage and groundwater resources we argue that a shift is needed to green infrastructure such as reforestation and sustainable land management which may lead to similar benefits on ecosystem services but without the negative impacts caused by grey infrastructure such as habitat loss and an increase of water demand furthermore green infrastructures decrease the dependency on reservoir storage this supports the claim for integrated land use management as strategy for climate change adaptation optimizing the delivery of ecosystem services to society in mediterranean environments credit authorship contribution

5139,recently the multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization is attracting rising concerns from researchers and engineers since it can not only improve the utilization efficiency of water resource but also increase the generation benefit of hydropower enterprises mathematically the reservoir operation problem is a typical multistage constrained optimization problem coupled with numerous decision variables and physical constraints sine cosine algorithm sca a new swarm based method has the merits of clear principle and easy implementation but suffers from the premature convergence and falling into local optima to improve the sca performance this paper proposes an adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca where the elite mutation strategy is used to increase the population diversity the simplex dynamic search strategy is used to enhance the solution quality while the neighborhood search strategy is used to improve the convergence rate the simulations of 25 test functions show that asca outperforms several existing methods in both convergence rate and solution quality the results of a real world hydropower system in china demonstrate that asca betters the sca method with obvious increase in power generation thus the main contribution of this study is to provide an effective optimizer for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation keywords reservoir operation sine cosine algorithm elite mutation strategy simplex dynamic search strategy neighborhood search strategy 1 introduction over the past decades the booming economic development has promoted the rapid increase of water and energy demands all over the world feng et al 2019a wang et al 2009 yan et al 2017 reservoir is recognized as one of the most effective engineering measures to improve the utilization efficiency of water energy resources yang et al 2016 feng et al 2020a niu et al 2018 2020 zhang et al 2017 yin et al 2014 thus far a large number of hydropower projects have been put into operation hui et al 2016 pang et al 2018a b xu et al 2019 in china the representatives are the world s biggest inter basin water transfer project south north water transfer project and hydropower project three gorges liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 and about a quarter of the total installed electricity capacity is provided by reservoirs equipped with huge hydropower turbines chen et al 2013 feng et al 2020b ming et al 2017 at the present stage reservoirs are playing an increasingly important role in raising the people s living standards by providing comprehensive benefits like power generation flood control navigation ecological protection and water supply thus researchers and engineers are paying more and more attention to the reservoir operation problem bai et al 2017 li and huang 2008 li et al 2009 mathematically the reservoir operation problem is a complex constrained optimization problem involved numerous decision variables and physical constraints like water balance equations and turbine discharge limits madani 2010 2011 chen et al 2014 yang et al 2017 in order to effectively resolve this problem various optimization methods have been successfully developed by scholars all over the world he et al 2004 feng et al 2019b ji et al 2014 li et al 2010 yang et al 2017 including linear programming nonlinear programming dynamic programming network based methods swarm intelligence methods however some defects have greatly limited the widespread application of the above methods in practical engineering problems li et al 2009 liu et al 2019 zeng et al 2013 feng et al 2018 for instance linear programming cannot address the nonlinearity in both objective function and physical constraints cai et al 2001 xie et al 2018 due to the expensive computational overhead nonlinear programming may fail to produce the global optimal solution for non differentiable or discontinuous optimization problems catalao et al 2009 catalão et al 2012 xu et al 2014 the dynamic programming family methods often suffer from the severe curse of dimensionality in the multidimensional hydropower operation problem feng et al 2020c li et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 for network based methods it is still difficult to determine the rational parameters and stopping criterion wen et al 2019 cao et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the swarm intelligence methods are usually limited by the premature convergence and unstable solution samadi koucheksaraee et al 2019 wu and chau 2010 zheng et al 2017 thus scholars try to develop more effective optimization tools suitable for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation problem ahmadianfar et al 2017 2019a b azizi et al 2019a taghian and ahmadianfar 2018 duan 2019 sine cosine algorithm sca is a brand new swarm intelligence method inspired by both sine and cosine functions mirjalili 2016 in sca a set of solutions are randomly produced in the problem space and then iteratively update their positions from generation to generation during the evolutionary process the sine and cosine functions are adopted to achieve a balance between global exploration and local exploitation and thereby the probability of capturing the global optima will be increased when the amount of iterations becomes sufficient gupta and deep 2019 nenavath et al 2018 fu et al 2019 with the merits of simple evolutionary mode and easy implementation sca has been widely used to solve various real world application cases like wind speeding forecasting and optimal power flow long et al 2018 however for all we know there are still a few reports about using sca to address the power generation operation of multiple hydropower reservoirs in order to fill this research gap this paper tries to verify the feasibility of sca in the reservoir operation field from the experimental analysis it is unfortunately observed that like other swarm based methods sca usually falls into local optima with a high probability due to the loss of swarm diversity therefore this paper aims at developing a sca variant named as adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca to resolve the reservoir operation problem in asca three modified strategies are incorporated into the standard sca approach including the elite mutation strategy for increasing the individual diversity the simplex dynamic search strategy for enhancing the solution quality and the neighborhood search strategy for improving the search rate the results from numerical experiments and real world simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method to sum up the main contributions of this research lie in 1 a practical optimization model is developed for power generation of multiple hydropower reservoirs 2 the asca algorithm based on mutation operator neighborhood and simplex search strategies are presented to effectively improve the sca performance 3 the developed method can produce better results as compared with several existing methods in numerical experiments and real world simulations providing a practical method for the complicated engineering optimization problems the rest of this paper is organized as below section 2 gives the optimization model for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation section 3 presents the asca method section 4 tests the asca feasibility in 25

adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca 3 1 overview of sine cosine algorithm sca with the rapid development of computer technology the swarm based approaches simulating the biological evolution in nature have been successfully proposed by scholars in recent years as a brand new swarm evolutionary algorithm sca can dynamically adjust the search range of the population to achieve the desired optimization effect rizk allah 2018 liu et al 2019b fu et al 2018 generally sca starts from a set of solutions randomly placed in the decision space and then uses the oscillating search mode to find the global optimal solution as showed in fig 1 the optimization process of sca can be roughly divided into two different phases one is the global exploration phase where all the individuals traverse the whole solution space another is the local exploitation phase where the oscillating range is gradually decreased to enhance the local search ability of the swarm the search principle of the sca method is relatively simple compared with other swarm based methods like genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization making it possesses stronger search capability for the minimization problem the updating mode of the ith solution at the kth iteration in the standard sca method can be expressed as below 11 x i k 1 x i k a sin r 1 r 2 g b e s t k x i k i f r 3 0 5 x i k a cos r 1 r 2 g b e s t k x i k i f r 3 0 5 12 a 2 1 k k 13 gbes t k arg min f x 1 k f x i k f x m k f gbes t k 1 where k and m is the number of iterations and solution x i k denotes the position of the ith solution at the kth iteration gbes t k denotes the position of the global best known solution found from the beginning to the kth iteration r 1 is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 2π which is used to determine the moving direction r 2 is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 2 which is used to dynamically adjust the search range r 3 is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 1 which is employed to equally choose sine and cosine function a in eq 6 plays an important role in balancing global exploration and local exploitation if a has a large value sca traverses in a relatively wide space otherwise the local search frequency is enhanced f x in eq 1 denotes the fitness value of the solution x at hand which is obtained by combining the constraint violation value v x into the original objective function value f x of the minimization problem with a variety of equality or inequality constraints 14 f x f x v x v x y 1 y max g y x 0 e 1 e h e x where y and e denotes the number of inequality and equality constraints g y x 0 denotes the yth inequality constraint while h e x 0 denotes the eth equality constraint 3 2 adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca in practice it was found that the standard sca method suffers from the premature convergence to improve the sca performance this section proposes an adaptive sine cosine algorithm where the elite mutation strategy simplex dynamic search strategy and neighborhood search strategy are incorporated into the evolutionary process of the standard sca method 3 2 1 strategy 1 elite mutation strategy to increase the swarm diversity as used to resolve complex problems the sca method easily falls into local optimum with the decrease of the swarm diversity as one of the most important modules in differential evolution de the mutation operator is able to effectively increase the individual difference and improve the solution accuracy lei et al 2018 qu et al 2016 yuan et al 2014 however the mutation operator may fail to fully consider the inner relationship of different individuals in the current swarm which will reduce the search efficiency of the swarm to some extent yang et al 2015 hence an elite mutation strategy in eq 15 is used to achieve the sake of increasing the population diversity where the newly obtained solution will replace its parent one once the objective value gets better as drawn in fig 2 the elite mutation can help the solution learn useful information from leader solutions while the swarm is given memory function which will promote the increase of individual diversity and exploitation search ability 15 h i k g b e s t k n 0 1 a i k p b e s t p k a i k ϕ p b e s t i k 1 ϕ g b e s t k 16 pbes t i k arg min f x i k f pbes t i k 1 where p i is the index randomly chosen from the set of 1 2 m pbes t i k is the best known position of the ith solution at the kth iteration ϕ is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 1 n 0 1 denotes the random number obeying the normal distribution 3 2 2 strategy 2 simplex dynamic search strategy to enhance the solution quality as a classical gradient free local optimizer the nelder mead simplex search method is able to effectively improve the solution quality by using four operators including reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage kang et al 2009 xia et al 2019 chen et al 2019 the principle of the simplex algorithm is drawn in fig 3 it can be found that the nelder mead simplex search method is able to enhance the objective value by dynamically adjusting the size of the constructed simplex then this paper tries to incorporate the simplex dynamic search strategy into the sca method so as to improve the local exploration when a uniform random number r 0 2 a and k k 2 the simplex dynamic search will be started otherwise nothing is done then the brief procedures of the nelder mead simplex search method for the d variable optimization problem with is given as below 1 define the computational parameters including the reflection coefficient α the expansion coefficient β the contraction coefficient γ and the shrinkage coefficient ζ then randomly generate d 1 different points in the search space 2 calculate the fitness values of all the points to find the worst point x h second worst point x s and the best point x l 3 execute the reflection operator use eqs 17 and 18 to calculate the center point x and the reflection point x r then if f x r f x l go to step 4 if f x r f x s turn to step 5 if f x l f x r f x s set x h x r and go to step 7 17 x 1 d i 1 i h d 1 x i 18 x r x α x x h 4 execute the expansion operator use eq 19 to calculate the expansion point x e if f x e f x l set x h x e otherwise set x h x r then go to step 7 19 x e x β x r x 5 execute the contraction operator if f x r f x s and f x r f x h set x h x r then use eq 20 to calculate the contraction point x c and if f x c f x h set x h x c and go to step 7 otherwise go to step 6 20 x c x γ x r x 6 execute the shrinkage operator the position of the best point remains unchanged while the remaining points will be shrined by 21 x i ζ x i 1 ζ x l 7 if the stopping criteria are met stop the iteration process otherwise go to step 2 3 2 3 strategy 3 neighborhood search strategy to improve the convergence rate as a famous social animal in nature a single bee can only work in a relatively simple pattern but the swarm with numerous bees has rather complex social behaviors chen et al 2015 specially speaking the whole bee colony has a clear labor division to improve the gathering honey efficiency based on the search mechanism of bees the artificial bee colony algorithm with fast convergence speed and strong global search ability is proposed to solve the complex optimization problems kang et al 2013 liao et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 feng et al 2020d as a key element in the artificial bee colony the neighborhood search strategy can help the followers generate a new honey source around the old one increasing the guiding role of elite solutions and convergence rate of the swarm thus the neighborhood search strategy drawn in fig 4 is used to improve the convergence rate where the newly obtained solution v i k in eq 22 will replace its parent solution x i k once the objective value gets better 22 v i k g b e s t k 1 ϕ ϕ 0 5 a ψ 1 1 ψ 0 1 gbes t k p b e s t i k ψ 0 1 gbes t k x i k where ψ 1 1 is the function to generate the random number uniformly distributed in 1 1 3 3 execution procedure of the proposed method fig 5 shows the sketch map of the presented method it can be seen that the main difference between asca and sca lies in the combination three modified strategies for the asca method the standard sca method is the basic evolutionary framework and three introduced strategies are used to further improve the search ability of the swarm specially with the increasing number of iterations three strategies can enhance the leadership ability of excellent individuals so that all the elements can quickly move to the small neighborhood of the global optima which will effectively enhance the swarm diversity and solution quality in such a way the swarm can easily jump out of the local minimum and produce solutions with higher quality for the asca method two kinds of parameters should be determined by the practical necessity 1 the number of solutions and iterations 2 five additional parameters in the simplex search strategy obviously the asca method with fewer control parameters can be easily executed if the second group of parameters are fixed thus based on previous literatures kang et al 2009 xia et al 2019 chen et al 2019 and numerical experiments it is suggested that the reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage coefficients in the simplex strategy are set as 1 0 2 0 0 5 and 0 5 while the search times is set as 3 10 to balance execution efficiency and solution quality the pseudocode of the asca method for global optimization problem is given as below set the computation parameters for the target problem initialization for each solution i 1 m m and i are the solution set and index randomly determine the position of the ith feasible solution end for while stopping criteria not met do for each solution i 1 m evaluate the fitness value of the ith feasible solution end for update the personal best known positions of all solutions update the global best known position of the population for each solution i 1 m sca optimizer x i k update the position of all the solutions by eqs 11 12 all the elements in x i k are modified to the feasible space end for for each solution i 1 m strategy 1 h i k obtain the feasible mutatnt solution by eq 15 if h i k is better than x i k x i k will be replaced by h i k end if end for if the starting condition is met strategy 2 set s d 1 solutions with inferior fitness values from the swarm set s 1 simplex dynamic search is executed w times on s solutions in s 1 are replaced by solutions in s 1 in home positions end if for each solution i 1 m strategy 3 v i k obtain the feasible neighborhood solution by eq 22 if v i k is better than x i k x i k will be replaced by v i k end if end for end while the global best known position of the swarm is seen as the final solution 4 numerical experiments to verify the asca performance in benchmark functions 4 1 benchmark functions generally 25 test functions listed in tables 1 and 2 can be roughly divided into two different kinds of groups unimodal functions f 1 f 11 with one global optimal solution and multimodal functions f 12 f 25 with multiple local optimal solution the unimodal function can test the search speed of the evolutionary algorithm while the multimodal function can prove the robust ability of avoiding local minimum in the following sections the asca performance in two kinds of test functions will be fully compared with several classical methods 4 2 parameter settings here several famous methods are introduced to demonstrate the asca performance including genetic algorithm ga differential evolution de particle swarm optimization pso sine cosine algorithm sca gravitational search algorithm gsa whale optimization algorithm woa upgraded whale optimization algorithm uwoa azizi et al 2019c grey wolf optimizer gwo teaching learning based optimization tlbo hybrid ant lion optimizer and jaya algorithm alo jaya azizi et al 2019b the above methods are encoded in java language and executed on a personal computer with 3 3 ghz processor and 8 gb ram to ensure the fairness all the methods will use the same parameters as far as possible talatahari et al 2019 here the swarm size and maximum iterations are set as 50 and 500 while the other parameters are given as below ga the mutation and crossover probability are set as 0 05 and 0 8 de the crossover probability is set to 0 6 while the scaling factor is set to 0 5 pso the inertia weight decreases from 0 9 to 0 1 while two learning factors are set as 2 0 sca the parameter a 0 value is set as 2 0 gsa the acceleration coefficient and initial gravitational constant are set as 20 and 100 woa the parameter a 0 value decreases from 2 to 0 uwoa the parameter a 0 value decreases from 2 to 0 gwo the parameter a 0 value decreases from 2 to 0 tlbo the teaching factor is randomly chosen from the set of 1 2 alo jaya the roulette wheel strategy is used in the random walk asca the simplex dynamic search is executed 5 times while the related parameters are set as α 1 β 2 γ 0 5 and ζ 0 5 4 3 experimental results 4 3 1 result comparison in 30 independent runs tables 3 and 4 give the statistical results of several algorithms for both unimodal and multimodal functions including the best mean and standard deviation std for short of the objective value from tables 3 and 4 the following analysis can be obtained 1 for 11 unimodal benchmark functions f 1 f 12 the solutions found by asca is superior to the others methods in the standard deviation and mean of objective value demonstrating its strong search ability and high solution precision 2 for most multimodal benchmark functions f 13 f 25 asca can obtain satisfying optimization results and excels others approaches in most indexes proving the effectiveness of three introduced tools to sum up it can be concluded that the proposed approach has satisfying performance as employed to address the complex numerical optimization problems 4 3 2 box and whisker test here the box and whisker test is chosen to exhibit the detailed information of various methods including the maximum second quartile median third quartile and minimum of the target value fig 6 shows the box plot of sca and asca for different test functions in 30 independent runs it can be found that the asca approach yields less outliers smaller distribution and better objective values than the standard sca method demonstrating its superior and stable search performance in all the test functions from this case it can be concluded that the asca method has competitive performance in the complex numerical optimization problem 4 3 3 wilcoxon nonparametric test here the famous wilcoxon nonparametric test method is chosen to verify the significance level of any two algorithms in 25 test functions the wilcoxon test results with statistically significance level at alpha 0 05 are given in table 5 the win tie and lose symbol denotes the total number of functions where the asca method is better equal or worse than the control method from table 5 it can be found that the proposed method can yield better results than other methods because the occurrence number of win is obviously larger than tie and lose besides the r value is larger than r value while the p value is less than 0 05 in all the comparison test thus it can be concluded that asca outperforms the contrast methods in a statistical manner 4 3 4 convergence trajectory analysis fig 7 illustrates the convergence trajectories of several methods for different test functions it can be clearly observed that for most test functions asca is superior to the other methods in not only convergence rate but also final objective value for instance as the iteration is less than 100 the asca method can quickly approximate the global optimal solution of 16 functions f 1 f 16 while other methods fail to make it hence this case proves that the asca method is obviously superior to the control methods with respect to search rate and solution quality fig 8 draws the convergence trajectories of the asca method for several 2 variable functions where the first subfigure denotes the function s response surface the subfigures a c denotes the positions of all the solutions at the initial middle and late phase the last subfigure denotes the changing fitness values it can be found that the selected functions have different characteristics like multi modality and roughness which can help fully verify the performance of evolutionary method besides the asca method can quickly convergence to the global optimal solutions of the selected functions demonstrating high execution efficiency and strong search ability 4 3 5 comparison of the improved sca methods with different strategies here the results of several sca based methods are compared to verify the effectiveness of the modified strategies including sca sca i sca based on strategy 1 sca ii sca based on strategy 2 sca iii sca based on strategy 3 and asca table 6 shows the statistical values of several sca variants in 30 independent runs while table 7 gives the wilcoxon test results with statistical significance level at alpha 0 05 it can be seen that the asca and sca method have the best and worst performances in most test functions demonstrating the necessity of improving search principle three sca variants sca i sca ii and sca iii is better than the standard sca demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed modified strategies hence it can be concluded that three strategies can improve the sca performance at different levels while asca combining the merits of three strategies can produce the best results 5 asca for solving multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization problem due to the complexity of practical engineering problems it is often difficult to directly use the asca approach to solve the optimal operation of multiple hydropower reservoirs problem hence the information of the asca method for hydropower operation is given in detail 5 1 individual coding strategy in order to effectively handle the reservoir operation problem the water levels during the entire scheduling horizon is chosen as the decision variable since it well reflects the complex hydraulic and electrical relationship between upstream reservoirs and downstream reservoirs hence the ith solution at the kth iteration x i k for short can be expressed as below 23 x i k z 1 1 k z 1 2 k z 1 t k z n t k z n 1 k z n 2 k z n t k where z n t k is the water level of the nth hydropower reservoir at the tth period in solution x i k 5 2 population initiation the initial swarm has an important effect on the solution feasibility thus the elements for each solution in the initial swarm k 1 are randomly determined in the feasible water level limits by 24 z n t k z n t down ψ 0 1 z n t up z n t down 5 3 constraint handling strategy for the constrained optimization problems it is necessary to deal with the complex constraints because the newly produced variables may fall into infeasible scope in the evolutionary process here the following strategies are used to address this case firstly for each solution the variables violating its limits will be modified to the feasible scope by 25 z n t k z n t up if z n t k z n t up z n t k if z n t down z n t k z n t up z n t down if z n t k z n t down secondary the water based electricity mode is used to satisfy the equality constraints like water balance equations of the cascade hydropower system ma et al 2011 2013 ming et al 2018 feng et al 2017 while the penalty coefficient method is adopted to address the inequality constraints like turbine discharge and power output limits in the scheduling horizon which is described as below 26 f x i k n 1 n t 1 t p n t δ t λ 1 d c λ a λ a λ min g λ up g λ g λ g λ down 0 where d is the number of physical constraints a λ is the violation degree of the λ th constraint c λ is the penalty coefficient of the λ th constraint which can be a relatively large positive value to effectively identify the solution feasibility in practice the carefully selected penalty coefficient should vary with the considered constraints of the target problem g λ is the possible value of the λ th constraint in the solution x i k g λ up and g λ down are the upper and lower limits of the λ th constraint respectively 5 4 detailed procedures the execution procedures of the asca algorithm for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization problem are given as below step 1 determine all the necessary computational parameters and the encoding strategy step 2 use eq 24 to randomly generate the initial swarm in the feasible water levels step 3 use the sca method in eqs 11 and 12 to update the positions of all the solutions step 4 use eqs 25 and 26 to obtain the fitness values of all the solutions update the personal best known positions of each solution and the global best known position of the swarm step 5 use the elite mutation strategy in section 3 2 1 to increase the population diversity step 6 use the simplex dynamic search strategy in section 3 2 2 to enhance the solution quality once the starting condition is met step 7 use the neighborhood search strategy in section 3 2 3 to improve the convergence rate step 8 if the maximum iteration is not reached turn to step 3 otherwise the global best known solution is regarded as the final scheme for the reservoir operation problem 6 case studies 6 1 study area the wu river cascade hydropower system in southwest china is chosen to test the performance of the asca method as the largest tributary on the right bank of the upper yangtze river this river is originated from the eastern part of the censer mountain and flows through four provinces before injecting into the yangtze river with enormous hydropower potential and huge head drop the wu river has become one of the largest hydropower bases in china here five reservoirs on the wu river s mainstream is chosen as the study object including hongjiadu hjd dongfeng df suofengying sfy wujiangdu wjd and goupitan gpt the topological structure and basic parameters of the selected hydropower reservoirs are given in fig 9 and table 8 in practice operators are asked to make the monthly plan to guide the generation production of hydropower reservoirs in wu river considering this actual demand the scheduling horizon is set as 1 year with 1 month per interval 6 2 simulations 6 2 1 case 1 robustness testing in section 4 the asca performance in benchmark functions has been validated but it is still difficult for asca to optimize reservoir operation problem with high dimensionality and plentiful constraints using the 50 year historical inflow duration curve the local inflows of the considered reservoirs in different typical runoff years can be easily obtained via interpolation calculation then six typical runoffs are used to verify the robustness of the developed algorithms in reservoir operation problem including extremely wet 10th percentile relatively wet 25th percentile a little wet 40th percentile normal 50th percentile a little dry 60th percentile and extremely dry 90th percentile for the sake of comparison five famous evolutionary methods are used to solve the reservoir operation problem under the same environment including ga de pso gsa and sca table 9 shows the statistical results of five method in 30 independent runs including the best worst mean standard deviation and range of total power generation the distributions of objective values by six methods in different runoff scenarios are given in fig 10 from table 9 it can be clearly observed that in different cases the asca method is obviously better than other methods due to the larger power generations proving its satisfying optimization performance and solution accuracy for instance the power generation of the worst solution found by asca is close to or better than the best solutions of the gsa method from fig 10 it can be observed that the results of the asca method are more stable than ga de pso gsa and sca due to the smaller variation range and fewer outliers thus this case successfully shows that for reservoir operation problem three modifies strategies can effectively improve the global search capability of the sca method while the asca method can effectively avoid falling into local optimum and sharply improve the solution stability at the same time 6 2 2 case 2 best scheduling results table 10 lists the generations of each hydropower reservoir in the best scheduling result by each algorithm it can be seen that due to the severe premature convergence problem the standard sca and gsa method has the lowest power generation in almost all the runoff scenarios besides the results of the asca algorithm in different cases are obviously better than five other swarm based approaches for instance compared with ga de pso gsa and sca the power generation of asca are respectively increased by 4 24 4 36 1 05 4 83 and 3 5 108 kw h in the extremely dry year while the improvements of power generation obtained by the asca method are reached up to 3 58 6 78 0 43 9 24 and 6 48 108 kw h in normal year respectively this case proves that the global search ability of asca is superior to the traditional methods demonstrating the feasibility of three introduced strategies in improving the quality of the scheduling results hence asca has good prospect engineering applications in the cascade reservoir operation field to further show the feasibility of the solution obtained by the asca method fig 11 shows the scheduling process including water level and power output obtained by several methods in the extremely wet case it can be seen that due to the relaxation of total power output limit almost all the reservoirs tend to reduce the power output for storing energy at the beginning and then keep water at a relatively high level for increasing operation efficiency in the later stage which will improve the total synergistic effect and generation benefit of cascade hydropower system in the long run besides the contribution proportion in the total produced electricity varies with the installed capacity per reservoir for instance about 50 power generation is provided by the gpt hydropower plant that has the largest installed capacity in summary as an effective method for reservoir operation the asca method can produce feasible scheduling results that are in line with the reality demonstrating its strong engineering practicality 6 2 3 case 3 different number of hydropower reservoirs table 11 lists the statistical results of the power generation by several methods with different number of reservoirs as the number of reservoirs increase the power generation obtained by each method will be quickly increased while the generation gap between asca and other methods tend to increase besides the asca method always the best performances in different cases for instance as the number of reservoirs grow from 1 to 5 the generation gap between de and asca is increased from 0 01 108 kw h to 5 3 108 kw h when there are 5 reservoirs in the hydropower system the total power generation of gsa and sca are reduced by 15 68 and 18 56 108 kw h as compared with asca the key reason lies in that both the problem space and state variables grow rapidly with the increasing number of reservoirs while the search ability of ga de pso gsa and sca are inferior to the asca method thus the superiority of the developed method is again proved by the statistical results of different sized hydropower system 6 2 4 case 4 different number of individuals in this section the performance of the proposed method with different pop size is verified fig 12 shows the best power generation of various methods with different population sizes it can be found that as the population size increases the power generation of almost all the swarm based methods is gradually increased demonstrating the importance of enough iterations for instance the best power generation obtained by the sca method increases from 134 3 108 kw h in the 60 individual environment to 147 8 108 kw h in the 300 individual environment with the same iterations the asca performance is obviously better than other methods due to the largest power generation for instance the power generation of the asca method is increased by 6 7 1 3 and 13 7 108 kw h compared with de pso and sca in the 100 individual environment hence this case again proves that asca has more strong robustness in the changing computing environment 6 3 discussion as proved in the above sections the asca method outperforms the existing methods and its original version under different runoff scenarios the key reason lies in three modified strategies linked into sca where the elite mutation strategy can effectively increase the swarm diversity the neighborhood search strategy can improve the convergence rate while the simplex dynamic search strategy improves the accuracy of the obtained solution besides from the reservoir point of view the following information can be learned from the simulations for hydropower reservoir there is a positive correlation between runoff volume and power generation which means that the generation benefit in wet case is obviously larger than the dry case for hydropower system it is better to take the operation policy that the leader reservoir should help downstream reservoirs operate at high level as long as possible which can increase the total benefit in the scheduling horizon the inflow is affected by the human activities and climate change and it is important to keep a certain amount of water to avoid the extremely dry year then the potential limitations and future directions deserving deep research should be pointed out 1 the constraint handling method incorporated into asca is not suitable for all the water resources problems because each issue usually has some unique attributes like nonlinearity or nonconvexity in order to guarantee the solution feasibility it is of great necessity to seek out the appropriate constraint handling tool before using the asca to address the target problem 2 no free lunch theory is a famous popular golden rule in the evolutionary optimization field which indicates that the incoming strategies gain the convergence improvements at the cost of relatively large computation burden to alleviate this defect the parallel technology in high performance computing environments can provide new possibility 3 for many hydropower reservoirs the management requirements from two or more stakeholders like anti flooding department power grids and power enterprises will be involved in the scheduling process while the asca method cannot well solve this kind of multi objective decision making problem hence it is necessary to develop the multi objective version of this method by hybridizing with other effective strategies 7 conclusion in this study a practical population based method called adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca is developed to address the numerical optimization and multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization problem in asca three modified strategies are used to improve the performances of the standard sine cosine algorithm sca including elite mutation strategy simplex dynamic search strategy and neighborhood search strategy the results of 25 famous test functions show that the presented method outperforms the standard sca method and several existing evolutionary methods because it can provide better objective results and smaller standard deviations in different independent runs the experiments from the wu hydropower system in china show that compared with several control methods the asca method can produce better scheduling results in different runoff cases demonstrating its strong robust performance and global search capability thus an effective tool is provided to solve the complicated engineering optimization problems which can provide certain technical reference for similar problems in other

5139,recently the multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization is attracting rising concerns from researchers and engineers since it can not only improve the utilization efficiency of water resource but also increase the generation benefit of hydropower enterprises mathematically the reservoir operation problem is a typical multistage constrained optimization problem coupled with numerous decision variables and physical constraints sine cosine algorithm sca a new swarm based method has the merits of clear principle and easy implementation but suffers from the premature convergence and falling into local optima to improve the sca performance this paper proposes an adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca where the elite mutation strategy is used to increase the population diversity the simplex dynamic search strategy is used to enhance the solution quality while the neighborhood search strategy is used to improve the convergence rate the simulations of 25 test functions show that asca outperforms several existing methods in both convergence rate and solution quality the results of a real world hydropower system in china demonstrate that asca betters the sca method with obvious increase in power generation thus the main contribution of this study is to provide an effective optimizer for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation keywords reservoir operation sine cosine algorithm elite mutation strategy simplex dynamic search strategy neighborhood search strategy 1 introduction over the past decades the booming economic development has promoted the rapid increase of water and energy demands all over the world feng et al 2019a wang et al 2009 yan et al 2017 reservoir is recognized as one of the most effective engineering measures to improve the utilization efficiency of water energy resources yang et al 2016 feng et al 2020a niu et al 2018 2020 zhang et al 2017 yin et al 2014 thus far a large number of hydropower projects have been put into operation hui et al 2016 pang et al 2018a b xu et al 2019 in china the representatives are the world s biggest inter basin water transfer project south north water transfer project and hydropower project three gorges liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 and about a quarter of the total installed electricity capacity is provided by reservoirs equipped with huge hydropower turbines chen et al 2013 feng et al 2020b ming et al 2017 at the present stage reservoirs are playing an increasingly important role in raising the people s living standards by providing comprehensive benefits like power generation flood control navigation ecological protection and water supply thus researchers and engineers are paying more and more attention to the reservoir operation problem bai et al 2017 li and huang 2008 li et al 2009 mathematically the reservoir operation problem is a complex constrained optimization problem involved numerous decision variables and physical constraints like water balance equations and turbine discharge limits madani 2010 2011 chen et al 2014 yang et al 2017 in order to effectively resolve this problem various optimization methods have been successfully developed by scholars all over the world he et al 2004 feng et al 2019b ji et al 2014 li et al 2010 yang et al 2017 including linear programming nonlinear programming dynamic programming network based methods swarm intelligence methods however some defects have greatly limited the widespread application of the above methods in practical engineering problems li et al 2009 liu et al 2019 zeng et al 2013 feng et al 2018 for instance linear programming cannot address the nonlinearity in both objective function and physical constraints cai et al 2001 xie et al 2018 due to the expensive computational overhead nonlinear programming may fail to produce the global optimal solution for non differentiable or discontinuous optimization problems catalao et al 2009 catalão et al 2012 xu et al 2014 the dynamic programming family methods often suffer from the severe curse of dimensionality in the multidimensional hydropower operation problem feng et al 2020c li et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 for network based methods it is still difficult to determine the rational parameters and stopping criterion wen et al 2019 cao et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the swarm intelligence methods are usually limited by the premature convergence and unstable solution samadi koucheksaraee et al 2019 wu and chau 2010 zheng et al 2017 thus scholars try to develop more effective optimization tools suitable for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation problem ahmadianfar et al 2017 2019a b azizi et al 2019a taghian and ahmadianfar 2018 duan 2019 sine cosine algorithm sca is a brand new swarm intelligence method inspired by both sine and cosine functions mirjalili 2016 in sca a set of solutions are randomly produced in the problem space and then iteratively update their positions from generation to generation during the evolutionary process the sine and cosine functions are adopted to achieve a balance between global exploration and local exploitation and thereby the probability of capturing the global optima will be increased when the amount of iterations becomes sufficient gupta and deep 2019 nenavath et al 2018 fu et al 2019 with the merits of simple evolutionary mode and easy implementation sca has been widely used to solve various real world application cases like wind speeding forecasting and optimal power flow long et al 2018 however for all we know there are still a few reports about using sca to address the power generation operation of multiple hydropower reservoirs in order to fill this research gap this paper tries to verify the feasibility of sca in the reservoir operation field from the experimental analysis it is unfortunately observed that like other swarm based methods sca usually falls into local optima with a high probability due to the loss of swarm diversity therefore this paper aims at developing a sca variant named as adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca to resolve the reservoir operation problem in asca three modified strategies are incorporated into the standard sca approach including the elite mutation strategy for increasing the individual diversity the simplex dynamic search strategy for enhancing the solution quality and the neighborhood search strategy for improving the search rate the results from numerical experiments and real world simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method to sum up the main contributions of this research lie in 1 a practical optimization model is developed for power generation of multiple hydropower reservoirs 2 the asca algorithm based on mutation operator neighborhood and simplex search strategies are presented to effectively improve the sca performance 3 the developed method can produce better

adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca 3 1 overview of sine cosine algorithm sca with the rapid development of computer technology the swarm based approaches simulating the biological evolution in nature have been successfully proposed by scholars in recent years as a brand new swarm evolutionary algorithm sca can dynamically adjust the search range of the population to achieve the desired optimization effect rizk allah 2018 liu et al 2019b fu et al 2018 generally sca starts from a set of solutions randomly placed in the decision space and then uses the oscillating search mode to find the global optimal solution as showed in fig 1 the optimization process of sca can be roughly divided into two different phases one is the global exploration phase where all the individuals traverse the whole solution space another is the local exploitation phase where the oscillating range is gradually decreased to enhance the local search ability of the swarm the search principle of the sca method is relatively simple compared with other swarm based methods like genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization making it possesses stronger search capability for the minimization problem the updating mode of the ith solution at the kth iteration in the standard sca method can be expressed as below 11 x i k 1 x i k a sin r 1 r 2 g b e s t k x i k i f r 3 0 5 x i k a cos r 1 r 2 g b e s t k x i k i f r 3 0 5 12 a 2 1 k k 13 gbes t k arg min f x 1 k f x i k f x m k f gbes t k 1 where k and m is the number of iterations and solution x i k denotes the position of the ith solution at the kth iteration gbes t k denotes the position of the global best known solution found from the beginning to the kth iteration r 1 is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 2π which is used to determine the moving direction r 2 is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 2 which is used to dynamically adjust the search range r 3 is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 1 which is employed to equally choose sine and cosine function a in eq 6 plays an important role in balancing global exploration and local exploitation if a has a large value sca traverses in a relatively wide space otherwise the local search frequency is enhanced f x in eq 1 denotes the fitness value of the solution x at hand which is obtained by combining the constraint violation value v x into the original objective function value f x of the minimization problem with a variety of equality or inequality constraints 14 f x f x v x v x y 1 y max g y x 0 e 1 e h e x where y and e denotes the number of inequality and equality constraints g y x 0 denotes the yth inequality constraint while h e x 0 denotes the eth equality constraint 3 2 adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca in practice it was found that the standard sca method suffers from the premature convergence to improve the sca performance this section proposes an adaptive sine cosine algorithm where the elite mutation strategy simplex dynamic search strategy and neighborhood search strategy are incorporated into the evolutionary process of the standard sca method 3 2 1 strategy 1 elite mutation strategy to increase the swarm diversity as used to resolve complex problems the sca method easily falls into local optimum with the decrease of the swarm diversity as one of the most important modules in differential evolution de the mutation operator is able to effectively increase the individual difference and improve the solution accuracy lei et al 2018 qu et al 2016 yuan et al 2014 however the mutation operator may fail to fully consider the inner relationship of different individuals in the current swarm which will reduce the search efficiency of the swarm to some extent yang et al 2015 hence an elite mutation strategy in eq 15 is used to achieve the sake of increasing the population diversity where the newly obtained solution will replace its parent one once the objective value gets better as drawn in fig 2 the elite mutation can help the solution learn useful information from leader solutions while the swarm is given memory function which will promote the increase of individual diversity and exploitation search ability 15 h i k g b e s t k n 0 1 a i k p b e s t p k a i k ϕ p b e s t i k 1 ϕ g b e s t k 16 pbes t i k arg min f x i k f pbes t i k 1 where p i is the index randomly chosen from the set of 1 2 m pbes t i k is the best known position of the ith solution at the kth iteration ϕ is the random number uniformly distributed in 0 1 n 0 1 denotes the random number obeying the normal distribution 3 2 2 strategy 2 simplex dynamic search strategy to enhance the solution quality as a classical gradient free local optimizer the nelder mead simplex search method is able to effectively improve the solution quality by using four operators including reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage kang et al 2009 xia et al 2019 chen et al 2019 the principle of the simplex algorithm is drawn in fig 3 it can be found that the nelder mead simplex search method is able to enhance the objective value by dynamically adjusting the size of the constructed simplex then this paper tries to incorporate the simplex dynamic search strategy into the sca method so as to improve the local exploration when a uniform random number r 0 2 a and k k 2 the simplex dynamic search will be started otherwise nothing is done then the brief procedures of the nelder mead simplex search method for the d variable optimization problem with is given as below 1 define the computational parameters including the reflection coefficient α the expansion coefficient β the contraction coefficient γ and the shrinkage coefficient ζ then randomly generate d 1 different points in the search space 2 calculate the fitness values of all the points to find the worst point x h second worst point x s and the best point x l 3 execute the reflection operator use eqs 17 and 18 to calculate the center point x and the reflection point x r then if f x r f x l go to step 4 if f x r f x s turn to step 5 if f x l f x r f x s set x h x r and go to step 7 17 x 1 d i 1 i h d 1 x i 18 x r x α x x h 4 execute the expansion operator use eq 19 to calculate the expansion point x e if f x e f x l set x h x e otherwise set x h x r then go to step 7 19 x e x β x r x 5 execute the contraction operator if f x r f x s and f x r f x h set x h x r then use eq 20 to calculate the contraction point x c and if f x c f x h set x h x c and go to step 7 otherwise go to step 6 20 x c x γ x r x 6 execute the shrinkage operator the position of the best point remains unchanged while the remaining points will be shrined by 21 x i ζ x i 1 ζ x l 7 if the stopping criteria are met stop the iteration process otherwise go to step 2 3 2 3 strategy 3 neighborhood search strategy to improve the convergence rate as a famous social animal in nature a single bee can only work in a relatively simple pattern but the swarm with numerous bees has rather complex social behaviors chen et al 2015 specially speaking the whole bee colony has a clear labor division to improve the gathering honey efficiency based on the search mechanism of bees the artificial bee colony algorithm with fast convergence speed and strong global search ability is proposed to solve the complex optimization problems kang et al 2013 liao et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 feng et al 2020d as a key element in the artificial bee colony the neighborhood search strategy can help the followers generate a new honey source around the old one increasing the guiding role of elite solutions and convergence rate of the swarm thus the neighborhood search strategy drawn in fig 4 is used to improve the convergence rate where the newly obtained solution v i k in eq 22 will replace its parent solution x i k once the objective value gets better 22 v i k g b e s t k 1 ϕ ϕ 0 5 a ψ 1 1 ψ 0 1 gbes t k p b e s t i k ψ 0 1 gbes t k x i k where ψ 1 1 is the function to generate the random number uniformly distributed in 1 1 3 3 execution procedure of the proposed method fig 5 shows the sketch map of the presented method it can be seen that the main difference between asca and sca lies in the combination three modified strategies for the asca method the standard sca method is the basic evolutionary framework and three introduced strategies are used to further improve the search ability of the swarm specially with the increasing number of iterations three strategies can enhance the leadership ability of excellent individuals so that all the elements can quickly move to the small neighborhood of the global optima which will effectively enhance the swarm diversity and solution quality in such a way the swarm can easily jump out of the local minimum and produce solutions with higher quality for the asca method two kinds of parameters should be determined by the practical necessity 1 the number of solutions and iterations 2 five additional parameters in the simplex search strategy obviously the asca method with fewer control parameters can be easily executed if the second group of parameters are fixed thus based on previous literatures kang et al 2009 xia et al 2019 chen et al 2019 and numerical experiments it is suggested that the reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage coefficients in the simplex strategy are set as 1 0 2 0 0 5 and 0 5 while the search times is set as 3 10 to balance execution efficiency and solution quality the pseudocode of the asca method for global optimization problem is given as below set the computation parameters for the target problem initialization for each solution i 1 m m and i are the solution set and index randomly determine the position of the ith feasible solution end for while stopping criteria not met do for each solution i 1 m evaluate the fitness value of the ith feasible solution end for update the personal best known positions of all solutions update the global best known position of the population for each solution i 1 m sca optimizer x i k update the position of all the solutions by eqs 11 12 all the elements in x i k are modified to the feasible space end for for each solution i 1 m strategy 1 h i k obtain the feasible mutatnt solution by eq 15 if h i k is better than x i k x i k will be replaced by h i k end if end for if the starting condition is met strategy 2 set s d 1 solutions with inferior fitness values from the swarm set s 1 simplex dynamic search is executed w times on s solutions in s 1 are replaced by solutions in s 1 in home positions end if for each solution i 1 m strategy 3 v i k obtain the feasible neighborhood solution by eq 22 if v i k is better than x i k x i k will be replaced by v i k end if end for end while the global best known position of the swarm is seen as the final solution 4 numerical experiments to verify the asca performance in benchmark functions 4 1 benchmark functions generally 25 test functions listed in tables 1 and 2 can be roughly divided into two different kinds of groups unimodal functions f 1 f 11 with one global optimal solution and multimodal functions f 12 f 25 with multiple local optimal solution the unimodal function can test the search speed of the evolutionary algorithm while the multimodal function can prove the robust ability of avoiding local minimum in the following sections the asca performance in two kinds of test functions will be fully compared with several classical methods 4 2 parameter settings here several famous methods are introduced to demonstrate the asca performance including genetic algorithm ga differential evolution de particle swarm optimization pso sine cosine algorithm sca gravitational search algorithm gsa whale optimization algorithm woa

the above methods are encoded in java language and executed on a personal computer with 3 3 ghz processor and 8 gb ram to ensure the fairness all the methods will use the same parameters as far as possible talatahari et al 2019 here the swarm size and maximum iterations are set as 50 and 500 while the other parameters are given as below ga the mutation and crossover probability are set as 0 05 and 0 8 de the crossover probability is set to 0 6 while the scaling factor is set to 0 5 pso the inertia weight decreases from 0 9 to 0 1 while two learning factors are set as 2 0 sca the parameter a

from 2 to 0 gwo the parameter a 0 value decreases from 2 to 0 tlbo the teaching factor is randomly chosen from the set of 1 2 alo jaya the roulette wheel strategy is used in the random walk asca the simplex dynamic search is executed 5 times while the related parameters are set as α 1 β 2 γ 0 5 and ζ 0 5 4 3 experimental results 4 3 1 result comparison in 30 independent runs tables 3 and 4 give the statistical results of several algorithms for both unimodal and multimodal functions including the best mean and standard deviation std for short of the objective value from tables 3 and 4 the following analysis can be obtained 1 for 11 unimodal benchmark functions f 1 f 12 the solutions found by asca is superior to the others methods in the standard deviation and mean of objective value demonstrating its strong search ability and high solution precision 2 for most multimodal benchmark functions f 13 f 25 asca can obtain satisfying optimization results and excels others approaches in most indexes proving the effectiveness of three introduced tools to sum up it can be concluded that the proposed approach has satisfying performance as employed to address the complex numerical optimization problems 4 3 2 box and whisker test here the box and whisker test is chosen to exhibit the detailed information of various methods including the maximum second quartile median third quartile and minimum of the target value fig 6 shows the box plot of sca and asca for different test functions in 30 independent runs it can be found that the asca approach yields less outliers smaller distribution and better objective values than the standard sca method demonstrating its superior and stable search performance in all the test functions from this case it can be concluded that the asca method has competitive performance in the complex numerical optimization problem 4 3 3 wilcoxon nonparametric test here the famous wilcoxon nonparametric test method is chosen to verify the significance level of any two algorithms in 25 test functions the wilcoxon test results with statistically significance level at alpha 0 05 are given in table 5 the win tie and lose symbol denotes the total number of functions where the asca method is better equal or worse than the control method from table 5 it can be found that the proposed method can yield better results than other methods because the occurrence number of win is obviously larger than tie and lose besides the r value is larger than r value while the p value is less than 0 05 in all the comparison test thus it can be concluded that asca outperforms the contrast methods in a statistical manner 4 3 4 convergence trajectory analysis fig 7 illustrates the convergence trajectories of several methods for different test functions it can be clearly observed that for most test functions asca is superior to the other methods in not only convergence rate but also final objective value for instance as the iteration is less than 100 the asca method can quickly approximate the global optimal solution of 16 functions f 1 f 16 while other methods fail to make it hence this case proves that the asca method is obviously superior to the control methods with respect to search rate and solution quality fig 8 draws the convergence trajectories of the asca method for several 2 variable functions where the first subfigure denotes the function s response surface the subfigures a c denotes the positions of all the solutions at the initial middle and late phase the last subfigure denotes the changing fitness values it can be found that the selected functions have different characteristics like multi modality and roughness which can help fully verify the performance of evolutionary method besides the asca method can quickly convergence to the global optimal solutions of the selected functions demonstrating high execution efficiency and strong search ability 4 3 5 comparison of the improved sca methods with different strategies here the results of several sca based methods are compared to verify the effectiveness of the modified strategies including sca sca i sca based on strategy 1 sca ii sca based on strategy 2 sca iii sca based on strategy 3 and asca table 6 shows the statistical values of several sca variants in 30 independent runs while table 7 gives the wilcoxon test results with statistical significance level at alpha 0 05 it can be seen that the asca and sca method have the best and worst performances in most test functions demonstrating the necessity of improving search principle three sca variants sca i sca ii and sca iii is better than the standard sca demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed modified strategies hence it can be concluded that three strategies can improve the sca performance at different levels while asca combining the merits of three strategies can produce the best results 5 asca for solving multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization problem due to the complexity of practical engineering problems it is often difficult to directly use the asca approach to solve the optimal operation of multiple hydropower reservoirs problem hence the information of the asca method for hydropower operation is given in detail 5 1 individual coding strategy in order to effectively handle the reservoir operation problem the water levels during the entire scheduling horizon is chosen as the decision variable since it well reflects the complex hydraulic and electrical relationship between upstream reservoirs and downstream reservoirs hence the ith solution at the kth iteration x i k for short can be expressed as below 23 x i k z 1 1 k z 1 2 k z 1 t k z n t k z n 1 k z n 2 k z n t k where z n t k is the water level of the nth hydropower reservoir at the tth period in solution x i k 5 2 population initiation the initial swarm has an important effect on the solution feasibility thus the elements for each solution in the initial swarm k 1 are randomly determined in the feasible water level limits by 24 z n t k z n t down ψ 0 1 z n t up z n t down 5 3 constraint handling strategy for the constrained optimization problems it is necessary to deal with the complex constraints because the newly produced variables may fall into infeasible scope in the evolutionary process here the following strategies are used to address this case firstly for each solution the variables violating its limits will be modified to the feasible scope by 25 z n t k z n t up if z n t k z n t up z n t k if z n t down z n t k z n t up z n t down if z n t k z n t down secondary the water based electricity mode is used to satisfy the equality constraints like water balance equations of the cascade hydropower system ma et al 2011 2013 ming et al 2018 feng et al 2017 while the penalty coefficient method is adopted to address the inequality constraints like turbine discharge and power output limits in the scheduling horizon which is described as below 26 f x i k n 1 n t 1 t p n t δ t λ 1 d c λ a λ a λ min g λ up g λ g λ g λ down 0 where d is the number of physical constraints a λ is the violation degree of the λ th constraint c λ is the penalty coefficient of the λ th constraint which can be a relatively large positive value to effectively identify the solution feasibility in practice the carefully selected penalty coefficient should vary with the considered constraints of the target problem g λ is the possible value of the λ th constraint in the solution x i k g λ up and g λ down are the upper and lower limits of the λ th constraint respectively 5 4 detailed procedures the execution procedures of the asca algorithm for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization problem are given as below step 1 determine all the necessary computational parameters and the encoding strategy step 2 use eq 24 to randomly generate the initial swarm in the feasible water levels step 3 use the sca method in eqs 11 and 12 to update the positions of all the solutions step 4 use eqs 25 and 26 to obtain the fitness values of all the solutions update the personal best known positions of each solution and the global best known position of the swarm step 5 use the elite mutation strategy in section 3 2 1 to increase the population diversity step 6 use the simplex dynamic search strategy in section 3 2 2 to enhance the solution quality once the starting condition is met step 7 use the neighborhood search strategy in section 3 2 3 to improve the convergence rate step 8 if the maximum iteration is not reached turn to step 3 otherwise the global best known solution is regarded as the final scheme for the reservoir operation problem 6 case studies 6 1 study area the wu river cascade hydropower system in southwest china is chosen to test the performance of the asca method as the largest tributary on the right bank of the upper yangtze river this river is originated from the eastern part of the censer mountain and flows through four provinces before injecting into the yangtze river with enormous hydropower potential and huge head drop the wu river has become one of the largest hydropower bases in china here five reservoirs on the wu river s mainstream is chosen as the study object including hongjiadu hjd dongfeng df suofengying sfy wujiangdu wjd and goupitan gpt the topological structure and basic parameters of the selected hydropower reservoirs are given in fig 9 and table 8 in practice operators are asked to make the monthly plan to guide the generation production of hydropower reservoirs in wu river considering this actual demand the scheduling horizon is set as 1 year with 1 month per interval 6 2 simulations 6 2 1 case 1 robustness testing in section 4 the asca performance in benchmark functions has been validated but it is still difficult for asca to optimize reservoir operation problem with high dimensionality and plentiful constraints using the 50 year historical inflow duration curve the local inflows of the considered reservoirs in different typical runoff years can be easily obtained via interpolation calculation then six typical runoffs are used to verify the robustness of the developed algorithms in reservoir operation problem including extremely wet 10th percentile relatively wet 25th percentile a little wet 40th percentile normal 50th percentile a little dry 60th percentile and extremely dry 90th percentile for the sake of comparison five famous evolutionary methods are used to solve the reservoir operation problem under the same environment including ga de pso gsa and sca table 9 shows the statistical results of five method in 30 independent runs including the best worst mean standard deviation and range of total power generation the distributions of objective values by six methods in different runoff scenarios are given in fig 10 from table 9 it can be clearly observed that in different cases the asca method is obviously better than other methods due to the larger power generations proving its satisfying optimization performance and solution accuracy for instance the power generation of the worst solution found by asca is close to or better than the best solutions of the gsa method from fig 10 it can be observed that the results of the asca method are more stable than ga de pso gsa and sca due to the smaller variation range and fewer outliers thus this case successfully shows that for reservoir operation problem three modifies strategies can effectively improve the global search capability of the sca method while the asca method can effectively avoid falling into local optimum and sharply improve the solution stability at the same time 6 2 2 case 2 best scheduling results table 10 lists the generations of each hydropower reservoir in the best scheduling result by each algorithm it can be seen that due to the severe premature convergence problem the standard sca and gsa method has the lowest power generation in almost all the runoff scenarios besides the results of the asca algorithm in different cases are obviously better than five other swarm based approaches for instance compared with ga de pso gsa and sca the power generation of asca are respectively increased by 4 24 4 36 1 05 4 83 and 3 5 108 kw h in the extremely dry year while the improvements of power generation obtained by the asca method are reached up to 3 58 6 78 0 43 9 24 and 6 48 108 kw h in normal year respectively this case proves that the global search ability of asca is superior to the traditional methods demonstrating the feasibility of three introduced strategies in improving the quality of the scheduling results hence asca has good prospect engineering applications in the cascade reservoir operation field to further show the feasibility of the solution obtained by the asca method fig 11 shows the scheduling process including water level and power output obtained by several methods in the extremely wet case it can be seen that due to the relaxation of total power output limit almost all the reservoirs tend to reduce the power output for storing energy at the beginning and then keep water at a relatively high level for increasing operation efficiency in the later stage which will improve the total synergistic effect and generation benefit of cascade hydropower system in the long run besides the contribution proportion in the total produced electricity varies with the installed capacity per reservoir for instance about 50 power generation is provided by the gpt hydropower plant that has the largest installed capacity in summary as an effective method for reservoir operation the asca method can produce feasible scheduling results that are in line with the reality demonstrating its strong engineering practicality 6 2 3 case 3 different number of hydropower reservoirs table 11 lists the statistical results of the power generation by several methods with different number of reservoirs as the number of reservoirs increase the power generation obtained by each method will be quickly increased while the generation gap between asca and other methods tend to increase besides the asca method always the best performances in different cases for instance as the number of reservoirs grow from 1 to 5 the generation gap between de and asca is increased from 0 01 108 kw h to 5 3 108 kw h when there are 5 reservoirs in the hydropower system the total power generation of gsa and sca are reduced by 15 68 and 18 56 108 kw h as compared with asca the key reason lies in that both the problem space and state variables grow rapidly with the increasing number of reservoirs while the search ability of ga de pso gsa and sca are inferior to the asca method thus the superiority of the developed method is again proved by the statistical results of different sized hydropower system 6 2 4 case 4 different number of individuals in this section the performance of the proposed method with different pop size is verified fig 12 shows the best power generation of various methods with different population sizes it can be found that as the population size increases the power generation of almost all the swarm based methods is gradually increased demonstrating the importance of enough iterations for instance the best power generation obtained by the sca method increases from 134 3 108 kw h in the 60 individual environment to 147 8 108 kw h in the 300 individual environment with the same iterations the asca performance is obviously better than other methods due to the largest power generation for instance the power generation of the asca method is increased by 6 7 1 3 and 13 7 108 kw h compared with de pso and sca in the 100 individual environment hence this case again proves that asca has more strong robustness in the changing computing environment 6 3 discussion as proved in the above sections the asca method outperforms the existing methods and its original version under different runoff scenarios the key reason lies in three modified strategies linked into sca where the elite mutation strategy can effectively increase the swarm diversity the neighborhood search strategy can improve the convergence rate while the simplex dynamic search strategy improves the accuracy of the obtained solution besides from the reservoir point of view the following information can be learned from the simulations for hydropower reservoir there is a positive correlation between runoff volume and power generation which means that the generation benefit in wet case is obviously larger than the dry case for hydropower system it is better to take the operation policy that the leader reservoir should help downstream reservoirs operate at high level as long as possible which can increase the total benefit in the scheduling horizon the inflow is affected by the human activities and climate change and it is important to keep a certain amount of water to avoid the extremely dry year then the potential limitations and future directions deserving deep research should be pointed out 1 the constraint handling method incorporated into asca is not suitable for all the water resources problems because each issue usually has some unique attributes like nonlinearity or nonconvexity in order to guarantee the solution feasibility it is of great necessity to seek out the appropriate constraint handling tool before using the asca to address the target problem 2 no free lunch theory is a famous popular golden rule in the evolutionary optimization field which indicates that the incoming strategies gain the convergence improvements at the cost of relatively large computation burden to alleviate this defect the parallel technology in high performance computing environments can provide new possibility 3 for many hydropower reservoirs the management requirements from two or more stakeholders like anti flooding department power grids and power enterprises will be involved in the scheduling process while the asca method cannot well solve this kind of multi objective decision making problem hence it is necessary to develop the multi objective version of this method by hybridizing with other effective strategies 7 conclusion in this study a practical population based method called adaptive sine cosine algorithm asca is developed to address the numerical optimization and multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization problem in asca three modified strategies are used to improve the performances of the standard sine cosine algorithm sca including elite mutation strategy simplex dynamic search strategy and neighborhood search strategy the results of 25 famous test functions show that the presented method outperforms the standard sca method and several existing evolutionary methods because it can provide better objective results and smaller standard deviations in different independent runs the experiments from the wu hydropower system in china show that compared with several control methods the asca method can produce better scheduling results in different runoff cases demonstrating its strong robust performance and global search capability thus an effective tool is provided to solve the complicated engineering optimization problems which can provide certain technical reference for similar problems in other
