19705,the fate of fourteen target perfluoroalkyl substances pfass are described within a small stream affected by a sewage treatment plant stp effluent concentrations of target pfass in samples of water benthic macroinvertebrates and brown trout salmo trutta are presented two hundred brown trout individuals originating from clean sites within the same stream were tagged and stocked into an experimental site affected by the stp s effluent as a passive sampling approach polar organic chemical integrative samplers pocis were deployed in the water to reveal the water macroinvertebrates fish biotransformation processes of pfass bioconcentration bioaccumulation of target compounds was monitored one three and six months after stocking twelve of the fourteen target pfass were found in concentration above the loq in at least one of the studied matrices the compound pattern varied significantly between both the studied species and water samples concerning the accumulation of pfass in fish the highest concentrations were found in the liver of individuals sampled after three months of exposure these concentrations rapidly decreased after six months although the water concentrations were slightly increasing during experiment graphical abstract image 1 keywords pfas pfos macroinvertebrates fish trophic transfer pocis 1 introduction extensive use of perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in the last sixty years has resulted in their presence in various environments water sediment air or biota worldwide two decades after the first publication giesy and kannan 2001 describing the worldwide distribution of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos there is a growing concern regarding the fate of these compounds in the environment due to the unique chemical properties of pfass including the thermal stability and water oil resistance they are extensively used in wide range of industry processes and household applications pfass are typically used in automotive and aircraft industry as a lubricant for bearings in the electronics industry in semiconductors transformers and wire coating in many herbicide and insecticide formulations in cosmetics and household cleaners in the application of products to improve stain water and oil resistance furniture clothes food packaging and in firefighting foams and flame retardants kissa 2001 paul et al 2009 some pfass e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa or perfluorononanoic acid pfna are used as a carrier particles in an electro photographic processes and in fluoropolymer s manufacture to increase a rate of polymerization paul et al 2009 buck et al 2011 the unique characteristics of these compounds are mostly due to their chemical structure a carbon backbone where all the hydrogen substituents have been replaced by fluorine atoms buck et al 2011 unfortunately the c f bond is extremely strong and stable smart 1994 which results in high persistence of pfass in the environment also bioaccumulation goeritz et al 2013 pan et al 2014 and biomagnification martin et al 2004 kannan et al 2005 potential was described in some pfass which increases with the length of the perfluoroalkyl chain and takes place usually in the liver martin et al 2003 fang et al 2014 higher bioaccumulation potential has been described in perfluoroalkyl sulfonates relative to carboxylates of the same chain length martin et al 2003 the pfos is usually found as a predominant compound in aquatic environmental samples elevated concentrations of pfos can be found even in muscle tissue of fish miege et al 2012 squadrone et al 2015 cerveny et al 2016 which determines this important and popular part of a human s diet as a potential source of contamination by pfos in human ye et al 2008 berger et al 2009 vassiliadou et al 2015 compared to other pfass higher levels of pfos in the environment refer to the fact that pfos represents a breakdown product of many other compounds within this group kaserzon et al 2012 rahman et al 2014 a variety of toxicology assays were used to describe the adverse effects of pfass on wildlife pfos and pfoa were found to be a factor influencing the biodiversity of zooplanktonic communities sanderson et al 2004 concentrations of pfas in fish blood plasma were found to be correlated with vitellogenin gene expression in the liver houde et al 2013 in addition neonatal exposure to pfos and pfoa negatively affect the brain development in mice johansson et al 2009 while embryonic exposure to pfos disrupt pancreatic organogenesis sant et al 2017 pfos was also found to alter the protein excretion in zebrafish shi et al 2009 pfos was added to annex b of the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants in 2009 as fulfilling all criteria to be pop additionally pfos was identified as a priority hazardous substance and an environmental quality standard eqs of 9 1 μg kg 1 of wet weight w w for water biota fish was set by the directive of the european parliament and of the council in 2013 european parliament and council 2013 in addition to industrial sites military fire training areas civilian airports and sewage treatment plants stps represent important sources of pfas contamination in aquatic environments guo et al 2010 bach et al 2016 hu et al 2016 kwon et al 2017 pfas were found to be largely resistant to both biological degradation in stps guo et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 and treatment processes in production of potable water for human consumption rahman et al 2014 pramanik 2015 the overall aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of local stp as an important source of pfass contamination in the aquatic environments on fauna of a small stream as pfass were previously recognized as having bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential we aimed to describe this process with application of a time defined experiment in real field conditions we compared the pfas concentrations and compound pattern across sampled water prey and predator species to find out the fate of these contaminants in an aquatic food web 2 material and methods 2 1 design of experiment and sampling procedure the experiment took place at zivny stream czech republic which is a small water course that receives the prachatice stp s effluent serves 11 000 inhabitants several light industry companies and a hospital which contributes approx 25 of its total flow more detailed characteristics of experimental stream and treatment conditions of stp prachatice can be found in grabicova et al 2015 two sections were established within the experimental site upstream of the prachatice town control and downstream of the stp s effluent release point macroinvertebrates and water were sampled at three sampling points e b and r at the downstream locality to determine how concentrations of target compounds differ in these matrices according to the distance from the stp s effluent fig 1 the control site and the effluent site are separated by several weirs that prevent migration of fish the same migration barrier exists at the end of downstream locality close to the confluence with blanice river experimental fish were handled in accordance with the national and institutional guidelines for the protection of human subjects and animal welfare european parliament and council 2010 the unit conducting the experiment is licensed no 53100 2013 mze 17214 according to the czech national directive no 246 1992 the law against animal cruelty the experiment ran from october 2012 to april 2013 at the beginning of the experiment twelve individuals of resident brown trout salmo trutta inhabiting the zivny stream were caught at each section by electrofishing all fish were sampled and analysed for target pfas content in the liver macroinvertebrates were analysed for pfas content to evaluate a possible dietary exposure of fish to pfas kick sampling using a standard 1 mm mesh hand net was used to collect benthic macroinvertebrates two benthic organisms erpobdella octoculata and hydropsyche sp were identified as being representative of natural food resources for trout and were sampled in april 2013 six parallel pooled samples each consisting of three individuals at each sampling point larvae of hydropsyche can be characterised as a net spinning omnivore hellmann et al 2013 while erpobdella represents a typical benthic predator feeding especially on oligochates and chironomid larvae schenková et al 2007 these macroinvertebrates species were selected according to their abundance at the downstream locality and as a result of resident fish digestive tract examination after initial sampling of resident fish two hundred brown trout salmo trutta individuals were caught at the control site and tagged with visible implant elastomer tags vie northwest marine technology inc usa the tags were implanted beneath thin and transparent skin of the gill cover and lower jaw using a syringe after tagging fish were released into the downstream locality and recaptured one three and six months after stocking a minimum of twelve fish were caught at both control and downstream localities within each sampling campaign and target pfass were determined in liver tissue data regarding the characteristics of sampled fish are presented in supplementary material table s1 2 2 biota samples pre treatment and extraction methods described by

divinylbenzene resin isolute env and a carbonaceous adsorbent ambersorb 1500 dispersed on a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer s x3 bio beads were used nya exposmeter ab tavelsjö sweden the samplers were deployed in each stream section for three weeks prior to each sampling campaign after the exposure period the samplers were retrieved cleaned with ultrapure water and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were stored at 20 c until the analysis target compounds were analysed in passive samplers after standardized extraction procedures alvarez et al 2005 briefly sorbent was

formic acid used for acidification of mobile phase was purchased from labicom olomouc czech republic ultrapure water was obtained from an aqua max ultra system younglin kyounggi do korea 2 5 lc hrms analysis a hybrid quadrupole orbital trap mass spectrometer qexactive thermo fisher scientific san jose ca usa coupled to an accela 1250 lc pump thermo fisher scientific san jose ca usa and a hts xt ctc autosampler ctc analytics ag zwingen switzerland was used for the analysis a cogent bidentate c18 column 50 mm 2 1 mm id 4 μm particles microsolv technology corporation eatontown nj usa was used for the separation of the target analytes the gradient and flow of the mobile phase and the basic set up of the electrospray ionization interface are described in the supplementary material tables s3

pfas analysis was validated for linearity repeatability quantification limit loq and recovery cerveny et al 2016 in this study an instrumental loq was derived from the calibration curve the peak area corresponding to this loq was used to calculate the loqs in individual samples the resulting values reflect the differences among is recovery sample weight and final volume of the extract the mean loq for the target compounds ranged from 0 08 to 2 3 ng g 1 for fish liver and from 0 30 to 8 2 ng g 1 with exception of pfteda 18 5 ng g 1 for benthos the method performance for pocis extracts analysis was also published previously together with field calibration experiment fedorova et al 2013 the mean loq within this study lay between 0 025 and 5 0 ng pocis 1 with exception of pfoa 29 ng pocis 1 the high loq in case of pfoa in pocis was caused by using a new stock of formic acid during the analysis that was contaminated from a producer this contamination led to a high concentration of pfoa in all samples of pocis and thus we had to exclude the pfoa from our pocis data analysis as internal qa qc a solvent blank was prepared with each series of samples in case of pocis a field blanks were also prepared from the samplers that were exposed to the environment of the sampling site not in the water for the time usually needed for installing and retrieving the sampler the field blanks were then stored extracted and analysed in the same way as other samplers several samples of biota were fortified and recoveries were calculated to verify the analytical method none of the target compounds were found in concentration above the loq in blank samples of biota and pocis extracts within the study recoveries of target analytes based on fortified samples concentration level of 100 ng g 1 were in range from 86 to 123 fish liver and from 87 to 139 for benthos with exception of pftrda and pfteda where higher recovery rates were achieved detailed information are presented in supplementary material table s2 2 7 statistical analysis statistical evaluation of the data was performed using the statistica 12 software statsoft inc usa one way analysis of variance anova was used to compare contamination of indicator organisms between the control and effluent affected environment under the stp data were tested for normality with a shapiro wilk test prior to statistical analysis for statistical analysis a one half of sample loq value was used in cases where concentration of target compound was below the loq in the sample concerning the impact of the stp on the stream recipient statistical analysis compared the data originating from the downstream sites and from the control site within each sampling campaign 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial sampling of resident fish prior to experiment resident fish occupying both control and downstream sections of zivny stream were sampled in autumn 2012 prior to experiment only pfos in concentrations above the loq was found in fish liver at the control site with a mean concentration of 1 7 ng g 1 downstream of the stp s locality four of target pfass were detected in fish liver with range of sum pfas s concentration from 1 3 to 21 ng g 1 where perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa represents the dominant compound fig 2 supplement material table s5 compared to previously reported data kannan et al 2005 cerveny et al 2016 concentrations of pfass found in resident fish in this study were low even at the locality affected by the stp s effluent in our previous study cerveny et al 2016 where six different localities within the czech republic were investigated a mean n 6 sum pfas s concentration same target compounds in range from 97 to 520 ng g 1 was found in the liver of chub squalius cephalus pfos in mean concentration of 100 and 67 ng g 1 was present in liver of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha and lake whitefish coregonus clupeaformis respectively that were sampled at great lakes michigan usa kannan et al 2005 results from initial sampling indicate significantly higher contamination of resident fish from downstream site compared to the fish from the control site this difference was verified by passive sampling as well and indicates that stp s effluent represents a significant source of pfass in this experimental area on the basis of these results we can also confirm that fish from the control site were almost free of pfas s contamination before the start of experiment 3 2 sampling of macroinvertebrates two organisms erpobdella octoculata and hydropsyche sp were chosen as the representatives of natural food resources for resident fish and sampled in april 2013 unfortunately only hydropsyche sp was also present at the control site where perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and pfos in mean sum of 4 1 ng g 1 was found in whole body homogenates at the downstream sites six of the target compounds were found in concentrations above the loq in benthos samples differences in both concentration level and compound pattern were described between indicator benthic species as higher concentrations were found in e octoculata compare to hydropsyche sp fig 3 concerning the compound pattern perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs in concentrations from 1 5 to 19 ng g 1 was found in e octoculata 100 of positive samples while it was below the loq in all samples of hydropsyche sp this finding may indicate different metabolic pathways for degradation of parental pfas compounds in these two organisms as was suggested previously in the case of marine top predators galatius et al 2013 another possible explanation is differences in feeding behaviour as organisms occupied directly the stream sediments represent a typical prey of erpobdela sediments have been recognized as an important sink for pfass prevedouros et al 2006 gao et al 2015 and pfhxs can represent a prevalent compound from this group of contaminants in sediments lam et al 2017 complete information about concentrations of target pfass can be found in the supplementary material table s6 macroinvertebrates also express a decrease in concentrations of some pfass according to the distance from stp s effluent fig 3 but statistical significance in this trend was found only in e octoculata unfortunately no data about pfas s contamination of macroinvertebrates of similar taxa or position in food web of freshwater ecosystems are available from other regions of the czech republic or worldwide in scientific literature 3 3 sampling of water pocis passive sampling was carried out to assess the occurrence of pfass in water soluble fraction over the course of the experiment as concentrations of these compounds in grab water samples are usually below the loq at this locality combining passive water sampling and biota sampling can illuminate exposure pathways that contribute to the total body burden of studied organisms even at localities with low water concentrations of target compounds the reliability of using pocis for monitoring of various contaminants in the aquatic environments was confirmed by several authors tapie et al 2011 vrana et al 2016 tumova et al 2017 yang et al 2017 only perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa was present in pocis extracts from the control site in concentrations close to loq in downstream sites five of the target pfass were detected in concentrations from 0 19 to 3 1 ng pocis 1 similar to macroinvertebrates a decrease in pfas concentrations according to the distance from the stp s effluent was observed but this trend could not be statistically analysed as each sampling point is represented by one sample of pocis extract different patterns of target pfass were observed in pocis extracts compared to both fish and macroinvertebrates perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa was found as a dominant compound in pocis and was also detected in macroinvertebrates it was not however detected in fish and pfhpa attending pfhxa in pocis was not detected in any of biota samples conversely the pfhxs dominating erpobdela samples was not present in pocis and same situation was observed for pfdoa dominating fish liver samples but not detected in pocis differences in compound pattern between passive samplers and biota was previously described cerveny et al 2016 in the case of fish and can be related to the excretion and metabolic activity of living organisms also bioaccumulation through the ingestion of natural food plays a role as some organisms utilize food resources that can contain specific pfass pattern pfos as a breakdown product of many other pfass kaserzon et al 2012 rahman et al 2014 was present at relatively high concentration in biota but it was only minor in pocis extracts fig 2 we assume that difference in pfos concentration between pocis and studied organisms is result of ingestion of natural food and a self production through metabolism of former compounds in biota however it should be stated that results based on analysis of pocis extracts account for the concentrations of target compounds present in water soluble fraction only particles and partially colloids are removed from the sample due to boundary membrane 0 1 μm pores of pocis 3 4 accumulation of target compounds in stocked fish besides the pfos that was found in control fish prior to experiment another ten compounds were found in fish liver one month after stocking supplementary material table s5 seven target compounds were found in more than 50 of samples including pfdoa pfteda that were present also in resident fish from downstream locality during initial sampling and pftrda that was present in samples of macroinvertebrates fig 4 mentioned three pfass significantly differed from control site but were not detected in pocis and thus we can assume that these represent metabolic products of another parental compounds or were bioaccumulated via the food web the sum of pfas s concentrations increased more than three times during the first month of exposure compare to initial contamination of stocked fish with mean value of 44 ng g 1 we registered a significant difference in accumulation of target compounds related to the gender of fish during the first sampling campaign supplementary material figure s3 concerning the sum of pfass a twofold higher mean concentration was found in males compare to females this difference was most likely a result of different feeding behaviour of females during the first month of exposure in second sampling campaign continuous increase of target compounds in fish liver was detected besides the pfos and pfhxs concentrations of all other detected compounds significantly increased compare to previous sampling with exception of pfhxs also significant difference from control site sampled at the same time was found concerning pfas s content in fish liver the sum of pfas s concentrations reach the mean value of 58 ng g 1 after three months that fish spent in stp s affected environment passive sampling did not show significant changes in concentration of target compounds in water compare to previous sampling campaign fig 4 completely different results were brought by analysis of fish liver sampled six months after stocking concentrations of most target pfass fell down at levels even lower than those analysed after one month of exposure fig 4 mean sum of pfas s concentrations in fish liver of 29 ng g 1 represents a 50 decrease compare to the previous sampling campaign and 34 decrease compare to sampling after one month of exposure only pfos concentrations in fish liver did not express any significant changes over time during the experiment as mean value ranged from 8 0 to 11 ng g 1 concentrations of pfass in water seem to remain relatively stable across the whole six month period with a slight increase at the end of experiment when pfna was detected in elevated concentrations compared to previous two sampling campaigns fig 4 similar trends can be seen in previously published work grabicova et al 2017 for some pharmaceuticals after initial increase of pharmaceuticals concentrations in fish tissues levels fall below the loq given longer periods spend in contaminated environments contrary to our initial suggestions pfos concentration did not change in the liver of exposed fish over the time spent in stp s affected environment in works of many other authors giesy and kannan 2001 berger et al 2009 yeung et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 naile et al 2013 pfos was identified as a prevalent compound in biota samples with the ability to bioaccumulate because of the fact that pfos represents a breakdown product of some other pfass we expected increasing concentrations of this compound over time however two of six localities showed a pfos to total pfass contribution of 8 and 19 in the liver of european chub squalius cephalus cerveny et al 2016 thus this relationship appears to be highly spatially dependent based on current data we suggest that pfos contribution to the total pfass loading in river fish depends on the distance from the source of pfas contamination as far from the source as higher content of pfos could be found in fish compare to parent compounds because of metabolic processes that occur in whole aquatic food chain monitoring of water concentrations was carried out three weeks before each sampling of fish which represents 70 of exposure time for first sampling 50 for sampling after three months of exposure and 35 during the whole experiment six months of exposure we cannot exclude the possibility that pfass water concentrations varied during the experiment but as these not varied significantly in pocis between all three sampling campaigns we assumed that our passive sampling data represent the long term average at the locality moreover as the passive sampling covered the period of three weeks directly before each sampling of fish the tissue concentrations should not be affected by exceptional increase or decrease of pfass concentrations in the water before sampling thus we assumed that explanation for decrease in fish liver concentrations during the last sampling campaign is a change in metabolic activity of the fish enzymes of cytochrome p450 cyp family are known to catalyse oxidative biotransformation across a wide range of xenobiotics in fish široká et al 2005 corcoran et al 2012 yu et al 2014 and a temperature dependent relationship was described in the activity of some cyp enzymes ricciardi et al 2006 gonzález mira et al 2016 consequently one possible explanation is a change in water temperature as this could lead to increased activity of these enzymes and higher biotransformation and excretion processes within the experiment the temperature was measured during the pocis installation in the water mean temperatures in the downstream section were 9 2 c 2 9 c and 10 7 c at one three and six months after stocking respective it is possible that temperature was the key factor affecting the level of pfass in fish during the experiment as it correlates with measured concentrations of pfass in fish liver within each sampling campaign however when comparing data from the last sampling event 6 months of exposure with resident fish that were exposed long term to stp s affected environment we can see more than two fold higher sum of pfas s concentration in stocked fish even though the temperature was similar as such there is likely an addition factor that plays a role in this result which could be a physiological adaptation to the polluted environment in general little is known regarding the physiological basis of this phenomenon but it was observed that wild fish living in a polluted environment are less sensitive to contaminants that typically occur at such locality moreover it was described that these differences in tolerance to certain contaminants can be heritable nacci et al 1999 ownby et al 2002 one of the possible mechanisms for coping with water contamination is alteration in the expression of the xenobiotic metabolism e g cyp enzymes hamilton et al 2017 uren webster et al 2017 our data indicate that resident fish inhabiting the stp s affected environment of zivny stream are more effective in metabolism and excretion of target pfass compared to fish that were introduced to this environment from the control site 3 5 additional sampling of fish in 2016 compared to the initial sampling event elevated concentrations of some target pfass were found in fish liver from the control site one three and six months after the start of experiment concentrations of individual compounds were relatively low with sum of pfass from 11 to 16 ng g 1 reasons why pfas s concentrations increased in fish liver at the control site remains unclear but two suggestions are possible the first is that initial sampling was done prior to natural reproduction of brown trout when feeding rates are significantly reduced and thus intake of target compounds occur only via the water this suggestion is supported by the fact that this differences were not found in water samples where pfhpa remained the only compound found in pocis extracts from the control site during the whole experiment the second possible explanation is occurrence of a small skiing resort close to the control site that was operating during the winter period as this kind of activity represents a possible source of pfas s contamination due to presence of these compounds in ski waxes paul et al 2009 however we have no data to confirm this suggestion to reveal the reason of change in pfas concentrations in fish from control site as well as relatively low concentrations of these compounds found in resident fish from downstream locality sampled in october 2012 additional sampling of residents was done in april of 2016 another ten resident fish were caught at both the control site and downstream of stp concentrations of analysed pfass in control fish sampled in 2016 were lower than in control fish sampled in november 2012 january and april 2013 however four of the target compounds were found above the loq with mean pfass sum concentration of 7 ng g 1 in fish liver concerning the fish from downstream locality compound pattern and concentrations of target compounds analysed in april 2016 were almost identical with those analysed in october 2012 results of this additional sampling are reported in the supplementary material figure s4 although we have not sampled water in april 2016 it seems that short term reduction of feeding rate that often precede the reproduction season of trout had not significantly impacted the results of our experiment this affirmation was necessary especially in the case of downstream residents that were sampled only in october 2012 prior to experiment 4 conclusion within the presented work we conducted a unique field experiment focused on the fate of selected pfass released into a small stream by local stp we confirmed that stps represent an important source of these contaminants in the aquatic environments thanks to this novel approach time and spatial exposure of fish in effluent affected sites was described we found out that accumulation of pfass in fish is not linear and could be affected by activity of enzymes responsible for detoxification processes according to water temperature moreover we suggest that process of adaptation to polluted environment occurs in fish attention must be also given to the gender of experimental fish in such experiments as we found significant differences in concentrations of target compounds between males and females these differences were most likely caused by different feeding behaviour during the first month of experiment and might led to misinterpretation of results if remained unseen combining the passive sampling and biota sampling approaches clearly demonstrated that food chain is very important pathway of fish exposure to pfass moreover we reveal that significant differences in compound pattern can be found across trophic levels and even between the species of the same level as the result of different food resources exploitation this experimental design allowed us to study the fate of real mixture of contaminants in real conditions within aquatic environments acknowledgements the study was financially supported

19705,the fate of fourteen target perfluoroalkyl substances pfass are described within a small stream affected by a sewage treatment plant stp effluent concentrations of target pfass in samples of water benthic macroinvertebrates and brown trout salmo trutta are presented two hundred brown trout individuals originating from clean sites within the same stream were tagged and stocked into an experimental site affected by the stp s effluent as a passive sampling approach polar organic chemical integrative samplers pocis were deployed in the water to reveal the water macroinvertebrates fish biotransformation processes of pfass bioconcentration bioaccumulation of target compounds was monitored one three and six months after stocking twelve of the fourteen target pfass were found in concentration above the loq in at least one of the studied matrices the compound pattern varied significantly between both the studied species and water samples concerning the accumulation of pfass in fish the highest concentrations were found in the liver of individuals sampled after three months of exposure these concentrations rapidly decreased after six months although the water concentrations were slightly increasing during experiment graphical abstract image 1 keywords pfas pfos macroinvertebrates fish trophic transfer pocis 1 introduction extensive use of perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in the last sixty years has resulted in their presence in various environments water sediment air or biota worldwide two decades after the first publication giesy and kannan 2001 describing the worldwide distribution of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos there is a growing concern regarding the fate of these compounds in the environment due to the unique chemical properties of pfass including the thermal stability and water oil resistance they are extensively used in wide range of industry processes and household applications pfass are typically used in automotive and aircraft industry as a lubricant for bearings in the electronics industry in semiconductors transformers and wire coating in many herbicide and insecticide formulations in cosmetics and household cleaners in the application of products to improve stain water and oil resistance furniture clothes food packaging and in firefighting foams and flame retardants kissa 2001 paul et al 2009 some pfass e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa or perfluorononanoic acid pfna are used as a carrier particles in an electro photographic processes and in fluoropolymer s manufacture to increase a rate of polymerization paul et al 2009 buck et al 2011 the unique characteristics of these compounds are mostly due to their chemical structure a carbon backbone where all the hydrogen substituents have been replaced by fluorine atoms buck et al 2011 unfortunately the c f bond is extremely strong and stable smart 1994 which results in high persistence of pfass in the environment also bioaccumulation goeritz et al 2013 pan et al 2014 and biomagnification martin et al 2004 kannan et al 2005 potential was described in some pfass which increases with the length of the perfluoroalkyl chain and takes place usually in the liver martin et al 2003 fang et al 2014 higher bioaccumulation potential has been described in perfluoroalkyl sulfonates relative to carboxylates of the same chain length martin et al 2003 the pfos is usually found as a predominant compound in aquatic environmental samples elevated concentrations of pfos can be found even in muscle tissue of fish miege et al 2012 squadrone et al 2015 cerveny et al 2016 which determines this important and popular part of a human s diet as a potential source of contamination by pfos in human ye et al 2008 berger et al 2009 vassiliadou et al 2015 compared to other pfass higher levels of pfos in the environment refer to the fact that pfos represents a breakdown product of many other compounds within this group kaserzon et al 2012 rahman et al 2014 a variety of toxicology assays were used to describe the adverse effects of pfass on wildlife pfos and pfoa were found to be a factor influencing the biodiversity of zooplanktonic communities sanderson et al 2004 concentrations of pfas in fish blood plasma were found to be correlated with vitellogenin gene expression in the liver houde et al 2013 in addition neonatal exposure to pfos and pfoa negatively affect the brain development in mice johansson et al 2009 while embryonic exposure to pfos disrupt pancreatic organogenesis sant et al 2017 pfos was also found to alter the protein excretion in zebrafish shi et al 2009 pfos was added to annex b of the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants in 2009 as fulfilling all criteria to be pop additionally pfos was identified as a priority hazardous substance and an environmental quality standard eqs of 9 1 μg kg 1 of wet weight w w for water biota fish was set by the directive of the european parliament and of the council in 2013 european parliament and council 2013 in addition to industrial sites military fire training areas civilian airports and sewage treatment plants stps represent important sources of pfas contamination in aquatic environments guo et al 2010 bach et al 2016 hu et al 2016 kwon et al 2017 pfas were found to be largely resistant to both biological degradation in stps guo et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 and treatment processes in production of potable water for human consumption rahman et al 2014 pramanik 2015 the overall aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of local stp as an important source of pfass contamination in the aquatic environments on fauna of a small stream as pfass were previously recognized as having bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential we aimed to describe this process with application of a time defined experiment in real field conditions we compared the pfas concentrations and compound pattern across sampled water prey and predator species to find out the fate of these contaminants in an aquatic food web 2 material and methods 2 1 design of experiment and sampling procedure the experiment took place at zivny stream czech republic which is a small water course that receives the prachatice stp s effluent serves 11 000 inhabitants several light industry companies and a hospital which contributes approx 25 of its total flow more detailed characteristics of experimental stream and treatment conditions of stp prachatice can be found in grabicova et al 2015 two sections were established within the experimental site upstream of the prachatice town control and downstream of the stp s effluent release point macroinvertebrates and water were sampled at three sampling points e b and r at the downstream locality to determine how concentrations of target compounds differ in these matrices according to the distance from the stp s effluent fig 1 the control site and the effluent site are separated by several weirs that prevent migration of fish the same migration barrier exists at the end of downstream locality close to the confluence with blanice river experimental fish were handled in accordance with the national and institutional guidelines for the protection of human subjects and animal welfare european parliament and council 2010 the unit conducting the experiment is licensed no 53100 2013 mze 17214 according to the czech national directive no 246 1992 the law against animal cruelty the experiment ran from october 2012 to april 2013 at the beginning of the experiment twelve individuals of resident brown trout salmo trutta inhabiting the zivny stream were caught at each section by electrofishing all fish were sampled and analysed for target pfas content in the liver macroinvertebrates were analysed for pfas content to evaluate a possible dietary exposure of fish to pfas kick sampling using a standard 1 mm mesh hand net was used to collect benthic macroinvertebrates two benthic organisms erpobdella octoculata and hydropsyche sp were identified as being representative of natural food resources for trout and were sampled in april 2013 six parallel pooled samples each consisting of three individuals at each sampling point larvae of hydropsyche can be characterised as a net spinning omnivore hellmann et al 2013 while erpobdella represents a typical benthic predator feeding especially on oligochates and chironomid larvae schenková et al 2007 these macroinvertebrates species were selected according to their abundance at the downstream locality and as a result of resident fish digestive tract examination after initial sampling of resident fish two hundred brown trout salmo trutta individuals were caught at the control site and tagged with visible implant elastomer tags vie northwest marine technology inc usa the tags were implanted beneath thin and transparent skin of the gill cover and lower jaw using a syringe after tagging fish were released into the downstream locality and recaptured one three and six months after stocking a minimum of twelve fish were caught at both control and downstream localities within each sampling campaign and target pfass were determined in liver tissue data regarding the characteristics of sampled fish are presented in supplementary material table s1 2 2 biota samples pre treatment and extraction methods described by

precipitation the final extract was then centrifuged again at 10 000 x g for 10 min and an aliquot was taken and analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms 2 3 passive sampler deployment and extraction a passive sampling approach was used to compare occurrence of target chemicals in water and biota samples based on passive sampler calibration results published by fedorova et al 2013 polar organic chemical integrative samplers in the pesticide configuration pest pocis consisted of triphasic admixture of a hydroxylated polystyrene divinylbenzene resin isolute env and a carbonaceous adsorbent ambersorb 1500 dispersed on a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer s x3 bio beads were used nya exposmeter ab tavelsjö sweden the samplers were deployed in each stream section for three weeks prior to each sampling campaign after the exposure period the samplers were retrieved cleaned with ultrapure water and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were stored at 20 c until the analysis target compounds were analysed in passive samplers after standardized extraction procedures alvarez et al 2005 briefly sorbent was transferred into glass gravity flow chromatography columns filled with glass wool 2 cm layer target analytes were recovered from the sorbent by elution with 50 ml of a dichloromethane methanol toluene mixture 8 1 1 v v v extracts were reduced to 2 ml by rotary evaporation the internal standards 2 ng were added to the 100 μl sample aliquots in autosampler vials diluted with ultrapure water 1 1 and

all samples of biota and pocis extracts a complete list of target compounds is presented in supplementary material table s2 mixtures of seventeen native pfac mxb and nine mass labelled mpfac mxa perfluorinated acids and perfluoroalkyl sulphonates were purchased from wellington laboratories inc guelph on canada working mixtures of native compounds and surrogate standards were prepared in methanol at 1 μg ml 1 and stored at 20 c methanol lichrosolv hypergrade acetonitrile lichrosolv hypergrade toluene suprasolv and dichloromethane suprasolv were purchased from merck darmstadt germany formic acid used for acidification of mobile phase was purchased from labicom olomouc czech republic ultrapure water was obtained from an aqua max ultra system younglin kyounggi do korea 2 5 lc hrms analysis a hybrid quadrupole orbital trap mass spectrometer qexactive thermo fisher scientific san jose ca usa coupled to an accela 1250 lc pump thermo fisher scientific san jose ca usa and a hts xt ctc autosampler ctc analytics ag zwingen switzerland was used for the analysis a cogent bidentate c18 column 50 mm 2 1 mm id 4 μm particles microsolv technology corporation eatontown nj usa was used for the separation of the target analytes the gradient and flow of the mobile phase and the basic set up of the electrospray ionization interface are described in the supplementary material tables s3

chromatograms of target compounds in calibration curve and in real samples are presented in the supplementary material figures s1 and s2 respectively six point from 0 5 to 50 ng ml calibration curve was prepared by spiking 200 μl of water methanol mixture 1 1 v v a consistent amount 2 ng of surrogate standard was added 2 6 quality assurance quality control of lc hrms analysis the method for biota pfas analysis was validated for linearity repeatability quantification limit loq and recovery cerveny et al 2016 in this study an instrumental loq was derived from the calibration curve the peak area corresponding to this loq was used to calculate the loqs in individual samples the resulting values reflect the differences among is recovery sample weight and final volume of the extract the mean loq for the target compounds ranged from 0 08 to 2 3 ng g 1 for fish liver and from 0 30 to 8 2 ng g 1 with exception of pfteda 18 5 ng g 1 for benthos the method performance for pocis extracts analysis was also published previously together with field calibration experiment fedorova et al 2013 the mean loq within this study lay between 0 025 and 5 0 ng pocis 1 with exception of pfoa 29 ng pocis 1 the high loq in case of pfoa in pocis was caused by using a new stock of formic acid during the analysis that was contaminated from a producer this contamination led to a high concentration of pfoa in all samples of pocis and thus we had to exclude the pfoa from our pocis data analysis as internal qa qc a solvent blank was prepared with each series of samples in case of pocis a field blanks were also prepared from the samplers that were exposed to the environment of the sampling site not in the water for the time usually needed for installing and retrieving the sampler the field blanks were then stored extracted and analysed in the same way as other samplers several samples of biota were fortified and recoveries were calculated to verify the analytical method none of the target compounds were found in concentration above the loq in blank samples of biota and pocis extracts within the study recoveries of target analytes based on fortified samples concentration level of 100 ng g 1 were in range from 86 to 123 fish liver and from 87 to 139 for benthos with exception of pftrda and pfteda where higher recovery rates were achieved detailed information are presented in supplementary material table s2 2 7 statistical analysis statistical evaluation of the data was performed using the statistica 12 software statsoft inc usa one way analysis of variance anova was used to compare contamination of indicator organisms between the control and effluent affected environment under the stp data were tested for normality with a shapiro wilk test prior to statistical analysis for statistical analysis a one half of sample loq value was used in cases where concentration of target compound was below the loq in the sample concerning the impact of the stp on the stream recipient statistical analysis compared the data originating from the downstream sites and from the control site within each sampling campaign 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial sampling of resident fish prior to experiment resident fish occupying both control and downstream sections of zivny stream were sampled in autumn 2012 prior to experiment only pfos in concentrations above the loq was found in fish liver at the control site with a mean concentration of 1 7 ng g 1 downstream of the stp s locality four of target pfass were detected in fish liver with range of sum pfas s concentration from 1 3 to 21 ng g 1 where perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa represents the dominant compound fig 2 supplement material table s5 compared to previously reported data kannan et al 2005 cerveny et al 2016 concentrations of pfass found in resident fish in this study were low even at the locality affected by the stp s effluent in our previous study cerveny et al 2016 where six different localities within the czech republic were investigated a mean n 6 sum pfas s concentration same target compounds in range from 97 to 520 ng g 1 was found in the liver of chub squalius cephalus pfos in mean concentration of 100 and 67 ng g 1 was present in liver of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha and lake whitefish coregonus clupeaformis respectively that were sampled at great lakes michigan usa kannan et al 2005 results from initial sampling indicate significantly higher contamination of resident fish from downstream site compared to the fish from the control site this difference was verified by passive sampling as well and indicates that stp s effluent represents a significant source of pfass in this experimental area on the basis of these results we can also confirm that fish from the control site were almost free of pfas s contamination before the start of experiment 3 2 sampling of macroinvertebrates two organisms erpobdella octoculata and hydropsyche sp were chosen as the representatives of natural food resources for resident fish and sampled in april 2013 unfortunately only hydropsyche sp was also present at the control site where perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and pfos in mean sum of 4 1 ng g 1 was found in whole body homogenates at the downstream sites six of the target compounds were found in concentrations above the loq in benthos samples differences in both concentration level and compound pattern were described between indicator benthic species as higher concentrations were found in e octoculata compare to hydropsyche sp fig 3 concerning the compound pattern perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs in concentrations from 1 5 to 19 ng g 1 was found in e octoculata 100 of positive samples while it was below the loq in all samples of hydropsyche sp this finding may indicate different metabolic pathways for degradation of parental pfas compounds in these two organisms as was suggested previously in the case of marine top predators galatius et al 2013 another possible explanation is differences in feeding behaviour as organisms occupied directly the stream sediments represent a typical prey of erpobdela sediments have been recognized as an important sink for pfass prevedouros et al 2006 gao et al 2015 and pfhxs can represent a prevalent compound from this group of contaminants in sediments lam et al 2017 complete information about concentrations of target pfass can be found in the supplementary material table s6 macroinvertebrates also express a decrease in concentrations of some pfass according to the distance from stp s effluent fig 3 but statistical significance in this trend was found only in e octoculata unfortunately no data about pfas s contamination of macroinvertebrates of similar taxa or position in food web of freshwater ecosystems are available from other regions of the czech republic or worldwide in scientific literature 3 3 sampling of water pocis passive sampling was carried out to assess the occurrence of pfass in water soluble fraction over the course of the experiment as concentrations of these compounds in grab water samples are usually below the loq at this locality combining passive water sampling and biota sampling can illuminate exposure pathways that contribute to the total body burden of studied organisms even at localities with low water concentrations of target compounds the reliability of using pocis for monitoring of various contaminants in the aquatic environments was confirmed by several authors tapie et al 2011 vrana et al 2016 tumova et al 2017 yang et al 2017 only perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa was present in pocis extracts from the control site in concentrations close to loq in downstream sites five of the target pfass were detected in concentrations from 0 19 to 3 1 ng pocis 1 similar to macroinvertebrates a decrease in pfas concentrations according to the distance from the stp s effluent was observed but this trend could not be statistically analysed as each sampling point is represented by one sample of pocis extract different patterns of target pfass were observed in pocis extracts compared to both fish and macroinvertebrates perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa was found as a dominant compound in pocis and was also detected in macroinvertebrates it was not however detected in fish and pfhpa attending pfhxa in pocis was not detected in any of biota samples conversely the pfhxs dominating erpobdela samples was not present in pocis and same situation was observed for pfdoa dominating fish liver samples but not detected in pocis differences in compound pattern between passive samplers and biota was previously described cerveny et al 2016 in the case of fish and can be related to the excretion and metabolic activity of living organisms also bioaccumulation through the ingestion of natural food plays a role as some organisms utilize food resources that can contain specific pfass pattern pfos as a breakdown product of many other pfass kaserzon et al 2012 rahman et al 2014 was present at relatively high concentration in biota but it was only minor in pocis extracts fig 2 we assume that difference in pfos concentration between pocis and studied organisms is result of ingestion of natural food and a self production through metabolism of former compounds in biota however it should be stated that results based on analysis of pocis extracts account for the concentrations of target compounds present in water soluble fraction only particles and partially colloids are removed from the sample due to boundary membrane 0 1 μm pores of pocis 3 4 accumulation of target compounds in stocked fish besides the pfos that was found in control fish prior to experiment another ten compounds were found in fish liver one month after stocking supplementary material table s5 seven target compounds were found in more than 50 of samples including pfdoa pfteda that were present also in resident fish from downstream locality during initial sampling and pftrda that was present in samples of macroinvertebrates fig 4 mentioned three pfass significantly differed from control site but were not detected in pocis and thus we can assume that these represent metabolic products of another parental compounds or were bioaccumulated via the food web the sum of pfas s concentrations increased more than three times during the first month of exposure compare to initial contamination of stocked fish with mean value of 44 ng g 1 we registered a significant difference in accumulation of target compounds related to the gender of fish during the first sampling campaign supplementary material figure s3 concerning the sum of pfass a twofold higher mean concentration was found in males compare to females this difference was most likely a result of different feeding behaviour of females during the first month of exposure in second sampling campaign continuous increase of target compounds in fish liver was detected besides the pfos and pfhxs concentrations of all other detected compounds significantly increased compare to previous sampling with exception of pfhxs also significant difference from control site sampled at the same time was found concerning pfas s content in fish liver the sum of pfas s concentrations reach the mean value of 58 ng g 1 after three months that fish spent in stp s affected environment passive sampling did not show significant changes in concentration of target compounds in water compare to previous sampling campaign fig 4 completely different results were brought by analysis of fish liver sampled six months after stocking concentrations of most target pfass fell down at levels even lower than those analysed after one month of exposure fig 4 mean sum of pfas s concentrations in fish liver of 29 ng g 1 represents a 50 decrease compare to the previous sampling campaign and 34 decrease compare to sampling after one month of exposure only pfos concentrations in fish liver did not express any significant changes over time during the experiment as mean value ranged from 8 0 to 11 ng g 1 concentrations of pfass in water seem to remain relatively stable across the whole six month period with a slight increase at the end of experiment when pfna was detected in elevated concentrations compared to previous two sampling campaigns fig 4 similar trends can be seen in previously published work grabicova et al 2017 for some pharmaceuticals after initial increase of pharmaceuticals concentrations in fish tissues levels fall below the loq given longer periods spend in contaminated environments contrary to our initial suggestions pfos concentration did not change in the liver of exposed fish over the time spent in stp s affected environment in works of many other authors giesy and kannan 2001 berger et al 2009 yeung et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 naile et al 2013 pfos was identified as a prevalent compound in biota samples with the ability to bioaccumulate because of the fact that pfos represents a breakdown product of some other pfass we expected increasing concentrations of this compound over time however two of six localities showed a pfos to total pfass contribution of 8 and 19 in the liver of european chub squalius cephalus cerveny et al 2016 thus this relationship appears to be highly spatially dependent based on current data we suggest that pfos contribution to the total pfass loading in river fish depends on the distance from the source of pfas contamination as far from the source as higher content of pfos could be found in fish compare to parent compounds because of metabolic processes that occur in whole aquatic food chain monitoring of water concentrations was carried out three weeks before each sampling of fish which represents 70 of exposure time for first sampling 50 for sampling after three months of exposure and 35 during the whole experiment six months of exposure we cannot exclude the possibility that pfass water concentrations varied during the experiment but as these not varied significantly in pocis between all three sampling campaigns we assumed that our passive sampling data represent the long term average at the locality moreover as the passive sampling covered the period of three weeks directly before each sampling of fish the tissue concentrations should not be affected by exceptional increase or decrease of pfass concentrations in the water before sampling thus we assumed that explanation for decrease in fish liver concentrations during the last sampling campaign is a change in metabolic activity of the fish enzymes of cytochrome p450 cyp family are known to catalyse oxidative biotransformation across a wide range of xenobiotics in fish široká et al 2005 corcoran et al 2012 yu et al 2014 and a temperature dependent relationship was described in the activity of some cyp enzymes ricciardi et al 2006 gonzález mira et al 2016 consequently one possible explanation is a change in water temperature as this could lead to increased activity of these enzymes and higher biotransformation and excretion processes within the experiment the temperature was measured during the pocis installation in the water mean temperatures in the downstream section were 9 2 c 2 9 c and 10 7 c at one three and six months after stocking respective it is possible that temperature was the key factor affecting the level of pfass in fish during the experiment as it correlates with measured concentrations of pfass in fish liver within each sampling campaign however when comparing data from the last sampling event 6 months of exposure with resident fish that were exposed long term to stp s affected environment we can see more than two fold higher sum of pfas s concentration in stocked fish even though the temperature was similar as such there is likely an addition factor that plays a role in this result which could be a physiological adaptation to the polluted environment in general little is known regarding the physiological basis of this phenomenon but it was observed that wild fish living in a polluted environment are less sensitive to contaminants that typically occur at such locality moreover it was described that these differences in tolerance to certain contaminants can be heritable nacci et al 1999 ownby et al 2002 one of the possible mechanisms for coping with water contamination is alteration in the expression of the xenobiotic metabolism e g cyp enzymes hamilton et al 2017 uren webster et al 2017 our data indicate that resident fish inhabiting the stp s affected environment of zivny stream are more effective in metabolism and excretion of target pfass compared to fish that were introduced to this environment from the control site 3 5 additional sampling of fish in 2016 compared to the initial sampling event elevated concentrations of some target pfass were found in fish liver from the control site one three and six months after the start of experiment concentrations of individual compounds were relatively low with sum of pfass from 11 to 16 ng g 1 reasons why pfas s concentrations increased in fish liver at the control site remains unclear but two suggestions are possible the first is that initial sampling was done prior to natural reproduction of brown trout when feeding rates are significantly reduced and thus intake of target compounds occur only via the water this suggestion is supported by the fact that this differences were not found in water samples where pfhpa remained the only compound found in pocis extracts from the control site during the whole experiment the second possible explanation is occurrence of a small skiing resort close to the control site that was operating during the winter period as this kind of activity represents a possible source of pfas s contamination due to presence of these compounds in ski waxes paul et al 2009 however we have no data to confirm this suggestion to reveal the reason of change in pfas concentrations in fish from control site as well as relatively low concentrations of these compounds found in resident fish from downstream locality sampled in october 2012 additional sampling of residents was done in april of 2016 another ten resident fish were caught at both the control site and downstream of stp concentrations of analysed pfass in control fish sampled in 2016 were lower than in control fish sampled in november 2012 january and april 2013 however four of the target compounds were found above the loq with mean pfass sum concentration of 7 ng g 1 in fish liver concerning the fish from downstream locality compound pattern and concentrations of target compounds analysed in april 2016 were almost identical with those analysed in october 2012 results of this additional sampling are reported in the supplementary material figure s4 although we have not sampled water in april 2016 it seems that short term reduction of feeding rate that often precede the reproduction season of trout had not significantly impacted the results of our experiment this affirmation was necessary especially in the case of downstream residents that were sampled only in october 2012 prior to experiment 4 conclusion within the presented work we conducted a unique field experiment focused on the fate of selected pfass released into a small stream by local stp we confirmed that stps represent an important source of these contaminants in the aquatic environments thanks to this novel approach time and spatial exposure of fish in effluent affected sites was described we found out that accumulation of pfass in fish is not linear and could be affected by activity of enzymes responsible for detoxification processes according to water temperature moreover we suggest that process of adaptation to polluted environment occurs in fish attention must be also given to the gender of experimental fish in such experiments as we found significant differences in concentrations of target compounds between males and females these differences were most likely caused by different feeding behaviour during the first month of experiment and might led to misinterpretation of results if remained unseen combining the passive sampling and biota sampling approaches clearly demonstrated that food chain is very important pathway of fish exposure to pfass moreover we reveal that significant differences in compound pattern can be found across trophic levels and even between the species of the same level as the result of different food resources exploitation this experimental design allowed us to study the fate of real mixture of contaminants in real conditions within aquatic environments acknowledgements the study was financially supported

the resulting configurations are then evaluated by an analyst sanna that uses monetary and non monetary criteria with weights assigned to appropriate metrics by a decision maker to identify a preferred configuration to illustrate the structure assumptions and use of iript we apply it to a case study for the city of golden co the criteria weightings provided by a local decision maker lead to a preference for a centralized configuration in this case the golden case study demonstrates that iript can efficiently analyze centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations and rank them

of system configurations that capture and treat wastewater and distribute it to customers while also satisfying a diverse set of technological environmental social and economic constraints woods et al 2013 the appropriate scale of water reclamation is a critical design variable typically wastewater is captured at the scale of a catchment the service area of a centralized wastewater treatment plant ctp but it can also be captured at the scale of a cluster a subdivision of a catchment in which case it can be treated at one or more satellite treatment plants stps lee et al 2013 reclaimed water systems may also be nested with small water reuse systems contained within a larger water reuse boundary or with provisions for export of water to locations outside the catchment changes in the service area of a treatment plant affect plant sizing pipeline routes and sizes and pump sizes and locations because these design elements are linked and interactive and because treatment plants at different locations can be combined with service areas of differing size an enormous number of water reuse configurations and design combinations are possible even for seemingly small systems decision

addresses the following questions 1 which customers should receive reclaimed water when delivery of water to all potential customers is not economically justified or feasible i e which customers should be included and which should be excluded for a given configuration 2 for hybrid configurations how should customers be grouped to ensure that each customer is supplied with reclaimed water from a treatment plant and 3 how can the numerous design factors be integrated to achieve an optimal spatial configuration to test the utility of iript we apply it to a case study city of golden co and demonstrate that it enhances the decision making process by comprehensively and automatically assessing various design options and identifying a water reuse configuration that satisfies decision maker priorities all steps are transparent to the toolkit user intermediate design results and performance metrics used for multi criteria decision analysis mcda are readily accessible the user can also access data used for computation of performance metrics including capital and o m costs for each design element energy usage and savings and supplies of reclaimed water 2 implementation of decision support software tools fig 1 is an overview of the decision making tools implemented in iript for planning of water reuse infrastructure inputs include criteria and metrics for evaluation of different reclaimed water configurations weights for each criterion metric and the choice of a multi criteria decision methodology for ranking and selecting a preferred configuration additional detailed data requirements include locations and flowrates for the ctp wastewater flowrates throughout the sewer network customer locations and projected reclaimed water demands four tools developed by us red boxes are used to site satellite treatment plants and associated wastewater diversions locstp select appropriate treatment trains selwtp optimize pipeline routes and designs for wastewater capture and reclaimed water distribution prodot and calculate fees revenues and subsidies calcbenefit the configurations identified by these tools are inputs to a mcda tool developed by a third party blue box jablonský 2009 all five tools are nested within a system integrator toolintegrator the sections that follow describe the capabilities and implementation of each of these tools 2 1 locator for satellite treatment plants and associated wastewater diversions locstp treatment systems are designed with local conditions in mind a gis based methodology can help system designers decide on potential locations for stps with different local requirements a key concept implemented in locstp is the idea of a threshold stp capacity required for economic viability referred to here as a

delivery m3 a mp unit maintenance costs of the pipe networks for the wastewater diversion and reclaimed water delivery m3 and δt op annual duration of operation days yr in equation 1 the numerator terms for treatment system costs have units of year and are obtained from selwtp fig 1 and section 2 3 the amortized capital cost of pumps c p is a nonlinear function of flowrate a qb c and is calculated by toolintegrator fig 1 where a a parameter calibrated to local pump station costs and c a parameter set by empirical or statistical data a factor in the denominator δt op accounts for the number of days of operation per year and the remaining terms in the denominator have units of m3 the brwf calculation assumes one pump station per stp for distribution of reclaimed water it also assumes that some costs with high uncertainty are much smaller than the major system costs and can be neglected these costs include installation and o m costs for diversion pipes that convey wastewater to stps and o m costs for reclaimed water distribution systems as shown in fig 2 locstp identifies candidate locations for stps and associated wastewater diversions the algorithm is executed as follows 1 wastewater and organic mass flows for the sewer network are estimated 2 sewer manholes with sufficient wastewater flow to meet the brwf eq 1 are identified 3 unacceptable stp locations based on user supplied geographic criteria table 1 are excluded 4 user defined stp locations for exclusion and inclusion are added 5 stp location closest to each reclaimed water rw customer are identified 6 potential stp locations closest to each sewer manhole selected in step 2 are identified and 7 each stp location is paired with the closest sewer manhole 2 2 pipeline designer prodot pipeline design is accomplished using a tool pipeline routing and design optimization tool prodot described in detail elsewhere lee et al 2016 briefly prodot identifies near minimum cost pipeline routes using a minimum steiner tree algorithm accounting for existing infrastructure environmental and safety concerns trade offs in pipeline length installation method and traffic congestion during construction prodot also optimizes pump station locations pumping energy pipe diameters and pressure classes using mixed integer non linear programming minlp to minimize the sum of amortized pipe and pump capital costs and annual pumping energy cost one prodot feature added for integration within iript is flexible weighting of capital and o m costs using non negative weights α and β in the pipeline design optimization function of eq 2 minimize α amortized capital cost β annual pumping energy cost 2 where 0 α β 1 and α β 1 a second capacity added to prodot is code that computes the fraction of total flow within each pipe segment allocated to each reclaimed water customer fig s1 this fraction is used to estimate the incremental capital cost of the pipeline network for each potential customer more details are provided in section s1 of the supplemental material sm 2 3 selector for wastewater treatment process selwtp the selwtp tool is a modification of the coalbed methane produced water treatment and beneficial use screening tool plumlee et al 2014 this dst was originally developed for selection of process trains for treatment and reuse of produced water generated by the upstream oil and gas industry rpsea 2010 in the original tool simple additive weighting was used to select treatment trains for beneficial reuse selwtp uses a multi objective optimization for selection of treatment trains and includes a database of treatment methods that are applicable to municipal wastewater reclamation the treatment methods include both individual technologies and commonly bundled technologies that constitute small standardized treatment trains e g coagulation flocculation sedimentation selwtp distinguishes between desalination technologies and conventional technologies that can also serve as pre treatment or post treatment to the desalination technologies selwtp first compares influent water quality to the target effluent quality for specific reuse applications e g indirect potable use crop irrigation stream flow augmentation livestock watering and then generates an internal roster of constituents that require removal and their required percent removal an expert defined matrix was created in selwtp that assigns percent removals of multiple constituents to each treatment technology or bundle of technologies the expert defined database also includes cost curves for each technology that correlates unit cost of treatment m3 and unit chemical demand monetized m3 to size capacity of system m3 day selwtp then uses a set of objective functions to assemble optimized treatment trains that will first achieve the treatment goal and then comply with economic i e capital and annual o m costs and technical i e ability to automate operation flexibility footprint current commercial status mobility modularity robustness waste management and ability to recover energy and nutrients criteria while the selwtp always searches for the least expensive treatment solution user assigned weights ranging from 1 lowest importance to 5 highest importance dictate selection of processes with the desired levels of the technical criteria listed above the user can also specifically dictate inclusion or exclusion of one or more technologies from the process trains that will be assembled by selwtp the conceptual flowchart of selwtp is illustrated in fig 3 selwtp automatically assembles treatment methods into treatment trains and scores the treatment trains the score for each treatment train is the sumproduct of user weighting and expert ranking for each treatment method within the train a non linear optimization is then used to select a final treatment train from among the constructed treatment trains additional details are provided in section s2 of the sm as outputs selwtp sizes and estimates the costs of storage tanks at the treatment site based on a user defined time requirement for storage for stps it calculates flowrates and concentrations of residual biosolids returned to the sewer network energy recovery at the stps is computed assuming anaerobic digestion which may be followed by sidestream nitrogen management options 2 4 calculator of fees revenues and subsidies calcbenefit fig 4 illustrates the monetary exchanges assumed by calcbenefit for a system containing a single ctp and a variable number of stps could be zero calcbenefit considers three different facility owner scenarios for water reclamation facilities fig 4 a shows the case in which all wastewater treatment and water reclamation facilities are owned and operated by a single entity we assume that the revenues for the owner come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for the conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the existing ctp ctpww and stps 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the centralized water reclamation facility for advanced treatment ctprw and stps and delivered to ctprw and stp customers and 3 subsidies from a government or other sources to promote water reuse fig 4 b shows the case in which the owner of the water reclamation facilities does not own the ctpww but does own a ctprw that upgrades ctpww effluent to the water quality standards required for reuse the reclaimed water distribution system and all stp water reclamation facilities we assume that the revenues for this owner come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the stps 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the ctprw and stps and delivered to ctprw and stp customers and 3 subsidies from governmental and other sources to promote water reuse also we assume that the owner of the water reclamation facilities ctprw and stps pays 1 fees for residual management at the ctpww caused by the stps and 2 fees for reduction in wastewater flow to the ctpww caused by the stps we assume that the fees collected from wastewater generators connected to the ctpww are unchanged by the reuse system fig 4 c shows the case in which one entity owns all ctp water reclamation facilities ctpww and ctprw and another entity owns all stp water reclamation facilities we assume that the revenues for the former entity come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the ctpww 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the ctprw and delivered to ctprw customers 3 subsidies from governmental and other sources to promote water reuse 4 fees for residual management at the ctpww caused by the stps and 5 fees for reduction in wastewater flow to the ctpww caused by the stps and we assume that the revenues for the stp entity come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the stps 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the stps and delivered to stp customers and 3 subsidies from governmental and other sources to promote water reuse also we assume that the stp owner pays 1 fees for residual management at the ctpww and 2 fees for reduction in wastewater flow to the ctpww we also compute as a separate indicator potential cost savings to customers resulting from replacement of potable water with reclaimed water i e the cost of avoided potable water minus the cost of reclaimed water more details are provided in section s3 of the sm 2 5 analyst for multi criteria decision analysis sanna planning of reclaimed water infrastructure typically requires consideration of multiple criteria some of which may conflict to implement multi criteria decision analysis mcda we use the system for analysis of alternatives sanna developed by josef jablonský 2009 we choose this tool because it is available on line and supports several mcda methods e g electre roy 1968 promethee brans 1982 and topsis hwang and yoon 1981 that are widely used for real world problems the current iript version uses promethee to compare criteria that have incomparable or incommensurate metrics because of e g different measurement scales such as monetary and nonmonetary metrics linkov 2005 key steps of promethee are as follows lee et al 2013 step 1 configurations are compared in pairs for each criterion and a preference function score for each comparison is calculated using the usual preference function a preference score of 1 is given to a configuration alternative if its performance is superior to the paired alternative and a score of 0 is given otherwise step 2 each score is multiplied by a normalized weight assigned to the corresponding criterion the weighted scores are summed across the criteria and comparisons for each configuration and divided by the number of alternative configurations to obtain the positive outranking flows and negative outranking flows step 3 the final ranking is determined by the net outranking flows which are defined as the positive outranking flow minus the negative outranking flow and range between 1 and 1 these steps are performed by sanna which is a tool for mcda of iript 2 6 applications used for tool implementation locstp was developed using python and geoprocessing tools in arcgis prodot was developed using python general algebraic modeling system gams and arcgis lee et al 2016 calcbenefit was developed using microsoft excel selwtp and sanna were developed using vba visual basic for applications in microsoft excel 3 integration of decision support software tools each of the component tools described in section 2 has unique functionalities with rich features and can be run independently as a stand alone tool however the decision making process involves more than simply executing each tool sequentially careful integration and iteration between tools are necessary to generate wastewater reuse configurations that satisfy the design requirements thus an integrated dst that considers a number of critical factors in the decision making process and orchestrates the tools accordingly is essential the components described above are integrated into iript using the python environment within arcgis iript directly controls dataflow between tools and generates recommendations based on user input a third party python extension package pywin32 interacts with microsoft windows and launches external software applications 4 structure of decision making process applied to iript this section describes the decision making process used to identify optimal centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations for three different cases in case 1 the objective is to maximize the volume of reclaimed water supplied to customers in case 2 the objective is to maximize reclaimed water supplied to customers while ensuring a positive system net benefit in case 3 the objective is to maximize the system net benefit fig 5 illustrates the algorithm used to identify centralized configurations that maximize the reclaimed water supplied to customers case 1 in step 1 1 selwtp identifies supplemental treatment methods needed at the ctp to meet water quality standards for a specified beneficial use and the sizes and costs of storage tanks are computed a user defined storage time is used to compute storage volumes prodot then creates an optimized reclaimed water distribution network pipeline routing pump station locations and pipe sizes designed to serve all reclaimed water customers in step 1 2 calcbenefit computes revenues from the sale of reclaimed water based upon a user specified unit price m3 these unit prices are assumed uniform for all customers calcbenefit also computes subsidies and potential savings to customers using these steps the toolkit user can identify the configuration that maximizes reclaimed water supplied to customers given the assumed unit prices and subsidies an iript algorithm calculates system net benefit using data from table s2 to determine subsequent execution of the program if negative iript proceeds to case 2 and if positive iript proceeds to case 3 fig 6 illustrates the algorithm used to identify the centralized water reuse configuration that maximizes reclaimed water supply for the available wastewater flow while also providing a positive net benefit for the reclaimed water system case 2 this involves trimming steps 2 1 2 3 followed by checking steps 2 4 2 6 toolintegrator sorts all customers in order of their unit net benefit m3 from smallest to largest then systematically eliminates the set of customers with the smallest unit net benefits step 2 1 the unit net benefit for a given customer m3 is defined as the incremental system net benefit δ for the system that results when a known volume of reclaimed water m3 is delivered to that customer as customers are removed selwtp upgrades the ctp prodot optimizes pipeline design and calcbenefit calculates fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for the remaining customers steps 2 2 2 3 steps 2 1 2 3 iterate until the configuration system net benefit is positive at each iteration the toolkit reports the breakeven price of reclaimed water m3 for each system configuration that results in zero net benefits this information gives insight into the impacts of reclaimed water pricing on system size i e volume of reclaimed water supplied no customers after iript has identified a configuration with a positive system net benefit it checks customers that were excluded in the last trimming step to determine whether they can be added back into the system while still enabling positive net benefits the customer with the least negative net benefit will be added back in first steps 2 4 2 6 are repeated until the system net benefit is negative the checking process stops when the system net benefit is negative after a customer is added back in and the final selected configuration is the configuration obtained before addition of that customer fig 7 illustrates trimming for a simple example iript first removes the two customers who have the lowest unit net benefits the toolkit user controls this process by initially multiplying the system net benefit resulting from the final configuration of the previous case 100 by a user selected trimming factor 0 3 the trimming factor enables rapid exclusion of customers based upon economic considerations and avoids exhaustive enumeration iript optimizes the system design for the remaining customers resulting in a new configuration and a new system net benefit if the system net benefit after this optimization is positive 3 in this example no more customers are excluded if system net benefit remains negative additional trimming is required and steps 2 1 2 3 are repeated if this trimming eliminates all customers then water reuse is deemed infeasible for the assumed unit price of reclaimed water fig 8 illustrates the algorithm used to identify centralized water reuse configurations that maximize the system net benefit case 3 as before we use trimming steps 3 1 3 4 followed by checking steps 3 5 3 7 step 3 1 ranks customers in order of their unit net benefit m3 and eliminates the set of customers with the smallest unit net benefits after application of a trimming factor that has a value greater than one value selected initially by the toolkit user this factor is initially multiplied by the system net benefit resulting from the final configuration of the previous case if all customers are eliminated by trimming and one or more of the eliminated customers have negative unit net benefits iript automatically decreases the trimming factor and repeats step 3 1 if all the eliminated customers have positive unit net benefits iript eliminates the customer with the smallest unit net benefit if customers remain after trimming selwtp upgrades the ctp prodot optimizes pipeline design and calcbenefit calculates fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for the remaining customers in steps 3 2 3 3 if there are remaining customers but the system net benefit becomes negative iript executes the trimming process of case 2 in fig 6 until a configuration with a positive system net benefit is obtained iteration of steps 3 1 3 3 continues until there are no remaining customers this results in a series of intermediate configurations iript compares these intermediate configurations and selects the configuration with the greatest system net benefit step 3 4 for further analysis in the checking step iript checks the most promising intermediate configuration by adding back customers that were excluded in the trimming step that resulted in the most promising intermediate configuration beginning with the customer with the largest unit net benefit after addition of this customer selwtp upgrades the ctp prodot optimizes pipeline design and calcbenefit computes fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for those customers iript uses all of this information to determine the system net benefit that results from inclusion of this customer if the system net benefit increases the process is repeated with the customer that has the next largest unit net benefit and so on the checking process stops when the system net benefit decreases after a customer is added back in and the final selected configuration is the configuration obtained before addition of that customer fig 9 illustrates the algorithm used to identify hybrid water reuse configurations that maximize reclaimed water supply case 1h reclaimed water supply while also providing a positive net benefit case 2h and system net benefit case 3h steps 4 1 4 4 in fig 9 summarize the initialization steps used to analyze a hybrid configuration in step 4 1 the toolkit user selects clusters of customers that could be served by a single stp this step is enabled by a pause in the execution of the program toolintegrator then calculates unit pipe costs m3 for each cluster using the pipe network of the centralized configuration created in step 1 1 of fig 5 three such clusters are illustrated in fig 10 toolintegrator then selects the cluster with the lowest unit pipe cost 0 40 m3 in this example this value is calculated by dividing the amortized pipeline cost by the annual reclaimed water flow to the cluster using the lowest unit pipe cost step 4 1 and data from selwtp and calcbenefit toolintegrator performs a breakeven flowrate analysis eq 1 to identify the minimum flowrates needed for an stp step 4 2 in step 4 3 locstp estimates baseline wastewater and contaminant mass flows in the direction of the wastewater flow by summing mass flows throughout the sewer network this is the minimum flowrate for each pipeline in the sewer network i e the flowrate that is available at all times locstp then identifies potential stp and wastewater diversion locations as described in section 2 1 step 4 4 the algorithm used to configure hybrid systems case 1h 2h and 3h is similar to the algorithm used to configure centralized systems figs 5 6 and 8 with two important differences 1 hybrid configurations allow for monetary exchanges between a ctp and stps section 2 4 and 2 customers are divided into non overlapping stp and ctp configurations that ensure service to all potential customers and adequate flow to the stp this is accomplished in the matching step fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a iript initially generates reuse configurations for each treatment plant in which each plant is assumed to serve all customers unit net benefits m3 are then compared for each customer and for each configuration fig 11 a1 a3 customers with negative unit net benefits for all of the treatment plant locations are assigned to the treatment plant with the least negative unit net benefit and the customers with positive unit net benefits for one or more of the treatment plant locations are assigned to all the treatment plants with positive unit net benefits after assignment of all customers to treatment plants flowrates are checked throughout the system to ensure that reclaimed water can be recovered economically stps with flows that are less than the brwf are excluded e g stp1 in fig 11 a2 iript then automatically redesigns the system to enable new connections between each treatment plant and its prospective consumers based on prior assignments fig 11 b1 and b2 for customers connected to more than one treatment plant unit net benefits m3 are compared for each treatment plant and each customer is assigned to the plant that results in the largest unit net benefit iript then redesigns the system yielding a non overlapping configuration of stp and ctp customers where each treatment plant serves the customers with the largest unit net benefits this configuration serves all potential customers given the wastewater available for diversion to stps fig 11 c fig 12 illustrates use of mcda to select the final preferred configuration toolintegrator calculates performance metrics for each of the three centralized configurations and for each of the three hybrid configurations sanna then ranks these six configurations using calculated performance metrics and weights assigned by decision makers calcbenefit also calculates the cost savings to the reclaimed water customer i e the cost of avoided potable water purchase minus the cost of reclaimed water 5 case study 5 1 background the city of golden is located in jefferson county colorado the city does not operate its own ctp relying instead on a treatment plant operated by millercoors llc fig 13 the effluent from the treatment plant discharges to clear creek because golden s existing contract with millercoors does not include provisions for water reuse a new contract would be needed with provisions for golden to install and operate a reclaimed water distribution system upstream of the millercoors treatment plant along with one or more stps the city of golden would likely be required to compensate millercoors for the reduction in treatment plant inflow personal communication with ms anne beierle deputy director water utilities city of golden fig 4 b illustrates the monetary exchanges of the golden case study where the owner of ctpww is millercoors and the owner of both the ctprw and the stps is assumed to be the city of golden golden is located in a semi arid region city of golden 2015 with an irrigation season normally extending from april through october personal communication with mr les major utilities superintendent city of golden at present golden does not use reclaimed water we chose golden for this case study because of the city s expressed interest in water reuse and their willingness to share water infrastructure data for the following analysis we assume that the current reclaimed water regulations in colorado apply reclaimed water reuse currently allowed under colorado reclaimed water control regulation 84 includes landscape irrigation and various commercial and industrial uses such as cooling street cleaning fire protection and zoo operations co water quality control commission 2013 direct potable reuse is not considered in this analysis 5 2 application of iript integrated decision making 5 2 1 input data 5 2 1 1 inputs for mcda the golden case study demonstrates how iript improves the decision making process by incorporating user input into selection of a single preferred infrastructure configuration that satisfies decision maker priorities this case study identifies and ranks water reuse infrastructure configurations at different geographic scales while considering the sensitivity to different design parameters e g the unit price of reclaimed water subsidy rate and ctp compensation for reduced flow criteria and metrics for mcda are summarized in table 2 the promethee preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations i and ii methods are used for the mcda in the same way as in lee et al 2013 ms anne beierle of the city of golden provided weights for each of the criteria in table 3 using a scale of 0 lowest preference to 10 highest preference 5 2 1 2 reclaimed water demand and customer locations we assume that reclaimed water usage in golden will be limited to outdoor irrigation including both unrestricted access landscape irrigation with a high degree of public contact and resident controlled landscape irrigation on residential property both uses require secondary treatment with filtration and disinfection according to colorado reclaimed water control regulations co water quality control commission 2013 local public parks currently irrigated with river water were selected as the primary set of potential reclaimed water customers residential commercial and industrial customers with relatively high landscape water demands 3 5 m3 d are a second potential customer group we selected the subset of such customers located between golden s existing ctp and the parks more details are available in section s4 of the sm during the landscape irrigation season april to october the total potential reclaimed water demand for all of the potential customers is 2730 m3 day 0 72 mgd we assume that reclaimed water facilities would only be operated during this period of time eliminating the need for inter seasonal or inter annual carryover storage we assume that irrigation is carried out from 6 p m to 10 a m denver water 2017 with pumps and pipes sized for peak hour the locations of potential reclaimed water customers and their demands are shown in fig 14 the height of the bar at each location indicates the potential daily reclaimed water demand 5 2 2 baseline wastewater flowrates throughout the sewer network to estimate baseline wastewater flowrates throughout the sewer network we assume that february water use is non consumptive and therefore available for wastewater capture in any month each year golden establishes its sewer billing for the year based upon water use during the month of february personal communication with ms kim soulliere gis coordinator city of golden this value is multiplied by 3 for quarterly billings using the february flowrate data locstp performs a series of mass balances to estimate winter season baseline flowrates m3 d at manholes throughout the sewer system fig 15 5 2 3 breakeven reclaimed water flowrate using the methodology of sections 2 1 and 4 the calculated brwf for a stp providing reclaimed water to a cluster of customers in golden is 1240 m3 day 0 33 mgd this assumes an unit pipe cost of 0 50 m3 for the reclaimed water distribution pipelines for individual customers the brwf for an onsite water reuse system is 500 m3 day 0 13 mgd but the maximum reclaimed water demand is only 400 m3 day 0 1 mgd this implies that onsite water reuse is not economically viable 5 2 4 identify locations for satellite treatment plants and associated wastewater diversions using the methodology described in sections 2 1 and 4 locstp identifies two potential locations for stps and their associated wastewater diversion points the results are illustrated in fig 16 5 2 5 select wastewater treatment and energy recovery processes because the only use of reclaimed water is landscaping selwtp selects a wastewater treatment train consisting of screening grit removal microscreen filtration aerobic biological treatment in a sequencing batch reactor microfiltration and chemical disinfection this treatment train selection is based upon expert rankings included in selwtp and default weights assigned for domestic wastewater treatment this expected effluent satisfies reclaimed water control regulations of the state of colorado co water quality control commission 2013 selwtp also assesses the feasibility of energy recovery during wastewater treatment for the case of golden treatment trains without energy recovery process are chosen because systems with energy recovery incur high capital and o m costs and because the default weights assigned to capital and o m costs are higher than the default weight assigned to ability to recover energy therefore all stp residuals are returned to the wastewater collection system for digestion at the ctp the existing centralized wastewater treatment processes consist of a bar screen a grit collection system equalization surge tanks primary clarifiers an activated sludge system secondary clarifiers sand filters a post aeration basin and chlorination personal communication mr chris naber environmental specialist city of golden we assume that no additional treatment process is needed at the ctp we also assume that all storage tanks have a two day residence time 5 2 6 select pipeline route and optimize pipe and pump systems as shown in fig 16 there are 2 potential stp locations in golden using prodot near optimal pipeline routes are identified that capture wastewater and deliver reclaimed water from each treatment plant including the ctp to customers served by that plant pump locations and pipe sizes are optimized for each pipeline system pumps are sized to deliver reclaimed water to customer connections at delivery pressures of 390 1240 kpa 57 180 psi rmc water and environment 2008 usepa 2004 5 2 7 economically favorable water reuse configurations for the city of golden figs 17 and 18 illustrate how centralized water reuse configurations are identified by iript these configurations all assume a unit price of reclaimed water of 1 32 m3 5 1000gal and a subsidy of 0 20 m3 0 75 1000gal over 30 years we assume that competitive pricing of reclaimed water requires sale of reclaimed water at a value less than the potable water price 1 39 m3 5 26 1000gal also we assume that a subsidy provider would provide financial support to enable installation and operation of centralized and hybrid systems with positive system net benefits when reclaimed water is delivered to all potential customers thereby maximizing reclaimed water supply for the available wastewater iript recommends the configuration of fig 17 a the annual system net benefit for this configuration is 108k implying that this design is not economically viable in order to achieve a positive net benefit the reclaimed water rate must be increased to 1 51 m3 5 72 1000gal a value that exceeds the current potable water rate of 1 39 m3 5 26 1000gal for golden alternatively the external subsidy must be increased by 0 39 m3 1 47 1000gal if a higher water rate is not acceptable iript can be used to eliminate a set of customers that have the lowest unit net benefits customers within the solid circles of fig 17 b are excluded and a new system is recommended the annual system net benefit decreases from 108k to 41k but is still less than zero in order to achieve a positive net benefit with this configuration the reclaimed water rate would need to be 1 39 m3 5 26 1000gal the current potable water rate in golden or the external subsidy must be increased to 0 27 m3 1 01 1000gal with one additional iteration removing the lowest unit net benefit customers the annual system net benefit becomes greater than zero 50k fig 17 c as expected excluded customers tend to be farther away from the ctp at locations with relatively small water demand near the ends of pipeline branches because this removal algorithm is heuristic iript rechecks customers excluded in the steps leading to fig 17 c to determine whether they can be added back into the system while still maintaining a positive system net benefit in this case one of the previously excluded customers can be re incorporated yielding a annual system net benefit greater than zero 35k but less than the annual system net benefit of fig 17 c this configuration supplies 2670 m3 day to 183 reclaimed water customers and excludes 8 customers whose total demand is 60 m3 day fig 17 d table s3 provides the detailed iript output for each configuration of fig 17 after generating the optimal configuration for case 2 iript proceeds to case 3 by trimming customers until no customers remain and selects the centralized configuration that has the largest system net benefit iript also checks to determine whether customers should be added back in fig 18 is the configuration that maximizes the system net benefit figs 19 21 illustrate hybrid water reuse configurations identified by iript in addition to the assumptions implemented for the centralized configuration we assume that 10 of the current wastewater volume charge is paid to the ctp for diversion of wastewater to an stp beginning with a set of potential stp and sewer capture locations fig 16 and a database of locations and reclaimed water demands for all potential customers iript creates non overlapping subsystems which in combination serve all potential customers i e maximizing reclaimed water supply for the available wastewater fig 19 a shows the set of water reuse configurations resulting from the assumption that each treatment plant ctp or stp serves all potential customers in the system fig 19 b then illustrates the redesigned system where customers with negative unit net benefits for all of the treatment plant locations a1 a2 and a3 are assigned to the treatment plant with the least negative unit net benefit and the customers with positive unit net benefits for one or more of the treatment plant locations are assigned to all the treatment plants with positive unit net benefits in this process the stp in fig 19 a2 is excluded because it has insufficient reclaimed water flow i e less than the brwf fig 19 c shows the non overlapping configuration of stp and ctp customers where each treatment plant serves the customers with the largest unit net benefits this configuration serves all potential customers given the wastewater flow available for diversion to stps if the total demand of the customers assigned to an stp fig 19 b2 exceeds the capacity of the stp customers initially assigned to the stp are re assigned to the ctp starting with the customer with the shortest pipeline distance to the ctp this re assignment ensures that the demand at the stp is less than its capacity and results in a separation of service areas for the ctp and stp fig 19 c additional iterations are next used to trim the non overlapping service areas to ensure positive net benefits for the system while maximizing water delivery to customers fig 20 illustrates how iript uses additional iterations to trim customers and to identify the optimal hybrid water reuse configuration beginning with the configuration from fig 19 c iript trims the network through seven more iterations removing customers with the lowest unit net benefits and ultimately enabling maximizing reclaimed water use and ensuring a positive system net benefit a checking step is not required in this case because the final iteration excludes one customer fig 20 a d illustrate three intermediate configurations a c and the final configuration d from these further iterations isolated customers located far from the source of reclaimed water are excluded as are low demand customers located at or near the end of a pipeline and far from a treatment plant the net result is an increase in the annual system net benefit from 165k fig 19 c to 1k fig 20 d details of the changes in system configuration during the trimming process are summarized in table s4 after generating the optimal configuration for case 2 iript proceeds to case 3 by trimming customers until no customers remain and selects the hybrid configuration that has the largest system net benefit iript also checks to determine whether customers should be added back in fig 21 is the configuration that maximizes the system net benefit 5 2 8 performance metrics for each configuration table 4 summarizes performance metrics for six configurations three for a centralized and three for a hybrid system where the objectives are to 1 maximize reclaimed water supply 2 maximize reclaimed water supply while ensuring a positive system net benefit and 3 maximize system net benefit values of the performance metrics in table 4 are readily understood but the low o m cost for the centralized configuration needs explanation these low costs are due to the fact that system net benefits are computed for the owner of the reclaimed water facility which in this case is the city of golden because the city of golden does not own and operate the ctp o m costs to the city for ctp treatment are zero but the costs of o m for the reclaimed water distribution system are not zero expansion of the ctp could potentially incur o m costs for golden if needed to meet water quality standards however in this case this is not required 5 2 9 ranking of alternatives implementing the mcda algorithm described earlier the centralized configuration shown in fig 18 receives the highest rank table 4 this is primarily because of the high weighting of the system net benefit criterion where it scores highest in terms of performance and also because of its relatively low investment and o m costs and low annual energy requirement the three hybrid configurations ranked lower than the three centralized configurations this was because of the poor performance of the hybrid system with respect to o m costs and annual energy requirements 5 2 10 sensitivity analyses to assess the relative importance of unit prices of reclaimed water subsidy rates and ctp compensation for lower wastewater revenues due to the diversion and treatment of wastewater at stps we carried out a sensitivity analysis in which we varied each of these factors one at a time and evaluated the resulting changes in relative ranking of alternative configurations the results are summarized in section s5 of the sm 6 results and discussion for the city of golden case study iript shows that under a set of realistic assumptions a centralized configuration is preferred over a hybrid configuration the results also suggest why a centralized configuration may be a better choice for golden the localization advantages of a satellite system are diminished because golden is a relatively small city and the distance from the ctp to the farthest water reuse locations is only 3 4 km this factor affects the pipe length requirements and energy for pumping for hybrid configurations this results in pipe costs that are not sufficiently low to offset the costs of multiple treatment plants the case study also demonstrates that iript can automatically generate water reuse configurations using user specified site specific data that are commonly available for urban populations the reasons why a certain configuration may be preferred over another are made transparent to the toolkit user the short turn around time for analysis of different configurations allows on the fly adjustments of input data enabling the toolkit user to explore the consequences of such changes also calculation of the breakeven reclaimed water price at each iteration enables toolkit users to understand how water pricing impacts the size of the system and number of reclaimed water consumers the tools developed through this research have produced reasonable results and useful insights for reclaimed water infrastructure planning but obtaining input data in a digitized format is a significant challenge our experience shows that some assumptions may be needed in the absence of data in the case of golden for example the limited number of sewer flow meters within the sewer system made it necessary for us to use potable water usage data as a surrogate for wastewater flows 7 conclusion an integrated decision support toolkit iript developed for planning of water reuse infrastructure supports a diverse range of design functions including siting of stps and associated wastewater diversions optimal pipeline routing and sizing selection of wastewater treatment processes and calculation of fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for customers iript identifies centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations that meet three potential planning objectives 1 maximizing reclaimed water supply 2 maximizing reclaimed water supply while ensuring a positive system net benefit and 3 maximizing system net benefit the resulting configurations include critical design details that satisfy diverse technological environmental social and economic constraints the toolkit also ranks configurations using multiple criteria and input from decision makers we expect that the ipipt toolkit will give decision makers the ability to analyze many configurations across a wide range of scales facilitating more transparent decisions

19706,planning of water reuse systems is a complex endeavor we have developed a software toolkit iript i ntegrated urban r eclaimed water i nfrastructure p lanning t oolkit that facilitates planning and design of reclaimed water infrastructure for both centralized and hybrid configurations that incorporate satellite treatment plants stps the toolkit includes a pipeline designer prodot that optimizes routing and sizing of pipelines for wastewater capture and reclaimed water distribution a selector selwtp that assembles and optimizes wastewater treatment trains and a calculator calcbenefit that estimates fees revenues and subsidies of alternative designs for hybrid configurations a locator locstp optimizes siting of stps and associated wastewater diversions by identifying manhole locations where the flowrates are sufficient to ensure that wastewater extracted and treated at an adjacent stp can generate the revenue needed to pay for treatment and delivery to customers practical local constraints are also applied to screen and identify stp locations once suitable sites are selected system integrator toolintegrator identifies a set of centralized and hybrid configurations that 1 maximize reclaimed water supply 2 maximize reclaimed water supply while also ensuring a financial benefit for the system and 3 maximize the net financial benefit for the system the resulting configurations are then evaluated by an analyst sanna that uses monetary and non monetary criteria with weights assigned to appropriate metrics by a decision maker to identify a preferred configuration to illustrate the structure assumptions and use of iript we apply it to a case study for the city of golden co the criteria weightings provided by a local decision maker lead to a preference for a centralized configuration in this case the golden case study demonstrates that iript can efficiently analyze centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations and rank them according to decision makers preferences graphical abstract image 1 keywords decision support tool water reuse reclaimed water system optimization integrated planning tool multi criteria decision analysis 1 introduction and background demand for reclaimed water and for reclaimed water infrastructure is increasing in regions susceptible to drought and water shortage drivers include population and economic growth accompanied by increased water demand and increased pressure on local water supplies usepa 2012 2004 increased risk of drought and water scarcity due to climate change diffenbaugh et al 2015 the need to mitigate decrease or eliminate environmental impacts resulting from water diversions and wastewater discharges usepa 2005 and potential for financial savings and revenue from the sale of reclaimed water ring et al 2016 the intelligent planning needed to develop infrastructure that can meet local demands for reclaimed water requires site specific assessment of a wide range of system configurations that capture and treat wastewater and distribute it to customers while also satisfying a diverse set of technological environmental social and economic constraints woods et al 2013 the appropriate scale of water reclamation is a critical design variable typically wastewater is captured at the scale of a catchment the service area of a centralized wastewater treatment plant ctp but it can also be captured at the scale of a cluster a subdivision of a catchment in which case it can be treated at one or more satellite treatment plants stps lee et al 2013 reclaimed water systems may also be nested with small water reuse systems contained within a larger water reuse boundary or with provisions for export of water to locations outside the catchment changes in the service area of a treatment plant affect plant sizing pipeline routes and sizes and pump sizes and locations because these design elements are linked and interactive and because treatment plants at different locations can be combined with service areas of differing size an enormous number of water reuse configurations and design combinations are possible even for seemingly small systems decision support tools dsts are needed to effectively and systematically integrate design elements and to assist decision makers in evaluating a wide range of configurations across scale commercial dsts are already available to assist with conceptual design of stormwater management systems music model for urban stormwater improvement conceptualisation a dst developed by ewater solutions enables conceptual design of urban stormwater management systems with capabilities for simulation of stormwater flows and water quality at differing scales wong et al 2002 urban developer another ewater solutions dst ensures water balances and simulates water transportation networks for all elements of the water cycle including potable water stormwater and wastewater hardy et al 2011 both music and urban developer can simulate various water management scenarios and assist in the evaluation of specified system configurations but many design details e g pipe diameters lengths and slopes must be specified a priori integrated dsts have also been developed for planning of reclaimed water systems like the dsts for stormwater management these systems require a large number of a priori design decisions as input data e g pipeline routes distances and elevations between treatment plants and customers and locations for pumps treatment plants and storage tanks joksimovic et al 2008 stephen davis 2009 recently gikas et al 2015 developed software that optimizes water reuse infrastructure regionally by minimizing annualized total capital and operating costs their analysis does not consider local reclaimed water distribution and wastewater collection systems input data include a priori specification of pairwise pumping distances and elevations based on the given locations of potential treatment plants and population centers guo and englehardt 2015 also used modeling to scale distributed direct potable reuse systems with the goal of minimizing treatment and conveyance costs the design process is simplified by connecting sources to demands based on straight line distances from one building to the next without considering practical constraints such as rights of way to date no tool for reclaimed water planning has integrated siting and design of stps and wastewater diversions design of pipeline networks selection of wastewater treatment trains analysis of fees revenues and subsidies and other important considerations such as different facility ownership scenarios in this work we introduce an integrated package of decision support tools termed iript i ntegrated urban r eclaimed water i nfrastructure p lanning t oolkit for the design of urban reclaimed water infrastructure iript analyzes both centralized configurations where a single ctp delivers reclaimed water to the entire service area and hybrid configurations where reclaimed water is delivered from a ctp and one or more stps or from stps alone these configurations are then ranked using decision maker weights across a set of criteria both monetary and non monetary the toolkit includes provisions for design of system elements that in previous dsts required a priori definition by the toolkit user such as siting and design of stps and associated wastewater diversions and routing of wastewater and reclaimed water pipeline networks configurations are identified that 1 maximize reclaimed water supply from the available wastewater flow 2 maximize reclaimed water supply from the available wastewater flow while ensuring a financial benefit for the system and 3 maximize the financial net benefit for the system system configurations are then ranked in accord with decision maker weightings across multiple performance criteria in order to identify attractive reuse configurations iript addresses the following questions 1 which customers should receive reclaimed water when delivery of water to all potential customers is not economically justified or feasible i e which customers should be included and which should be excluded for a given configuration 2 for hybrid configurations how should customers be grouped to ensure that each customer is supplied with reclaimed water from a treatment plant and 3 how can the numerous design factors be integrated to achieve an optimal spatial configuration to test the utility of iript we apply it to a case study city of golden co and demonstrate that it enhances the decision making process by comprehensively and automatically assessing various design options and identifying a water reuse configuration that satisfies decision maker priorities all steps are transparent to the toolkit user intermediate design results and performance metrics used for multi criteria decision analysis mcda are readily accessible the user can also access data used for computation of performance metrics including capital and o m costs for each design element energy usage and savings and supplies of reclaimed water 2 implementation of decision support software tools fig 1 is an overview of the decision making tools implemented in iript for planning of water reuse infrastructure inputs include criteria and metrics for evaluation of different reclaimed water configurations weights for each criterion metric and the choice of a multi criteria decision methodology for ranking and selecting a preferred configuration additional detailed data requirements include locations and flowrates for the ctp wastewater flowrates throughout the sewer network customer locations and projected reclaimed water demands four tools developed by us red boxes are used to site satellite treatment plants and associated wastewater diversions locstp select appropriate treatment trains selwtp optimize pipeline routes and designs for wastewater capture and reclaimed water distribution prodot and calculate fees revenues and subsidies calcbenefit the configurations identified by these tools are inputs to a mcda tool developed by a third party blue box jablonský 2009 all five tools are nested within a system integrator toolintegrator the sections that follow describe the capabilities and implementation of each of these tools 2 1 locator for satellite treatment plants and associated wastewater diversions locstp treatment systems are designed with local conditions in mind a gis based methodology can help system designers decide on potential locations for stps with different local requirements a key concept implemented in locstp is the idea of a threshold stp capacity required for economic viability referred to here as a breakeven reclaimed water flowrate brwf defined as follows 1 q b c t s c s t c p c o m t s c m p r s f a c p a m p δ t o p equation 1 is derived from a balance on unit costs and unit benefits for an

delivery m3 a mp unit maintenance costs of the pipe networks for the wastewater diversion and reclaimed water delivery m3 and δt op annual duration of operation days yr in equation 1 the numerator terms for treatment system costs have units of year and are obtained from selwtp fig 1 and section 2 3 the amortized capital cost of pumps c p is a nonlinear function of flowrate a qb c and is calculated by toolintegrator fig 1 where a a parameter calibrated to local pump station costs and c a parameter set by empirical or statistical data a factor in the denominator δt op accounts for the number of days of operation per year and the remaining terms in the denominator have units of m3 the brwf calculation assumes one pump station per stp for distribution of reclaimed water it also assumes that some costs with high uncertainty are much smaller than the major system costs and can be neglected these costs include installation and o m costs for diversion pipes that convey wastewater to stps and o m costs for reclaimed water distribution systems as shown in fig 2 locstp identifies candidate locations for stps and associated wastewater diversions the algorithm is executed as follows 1 wastewater and organic mass flows for the sewer network are estimated 2 sewer manholes with sufficient wastewater flow to meet the brwf eq 1 are identified 3 unacceptable stp locations based on user supplied geographic criteria table 1 are excluded 4 user defined stp locations for exclusion and inclusion are added 5 stp location closest to each reclaimed water rw customer are identified 6 potential stp locations closest to each sewer manhole selected in step 2 are identified and 7 each stp location is paired with the closest sewer manhole 2 2 pipeline designer prodot pipeline design is accomplished using a tool pipeline routing and design optimization tool prodot described in detail elsewhere lee et al 2016 briefly prodot identifies near minimum cost pipeline routes using a minimum steiner tree algorithm accounting for existing infrastructure environmental and safety concerns trade offs in pipeline length installation method and traffic congestion during construction prodot also optimizes pump station locations pumping energy pipe diameters and pressure classes using mixed integer non linear programming minlp to minimize the sum of amortized pipe and pump capital costs and annual pumping energy cost one prodot feature added for integration within iript is flexible weighting of capital and o m costs using non negative weights α and β in the pipeline design optimization function of eq 2 minimize α amortized capital cost β annual pumping energy cost 2 where 0 α β 1 and α β 1 a second capacity added to prodot is code that computes the fraction of total flow within each pipe segment allocated to each reclaimed water customer fig s1 this fraction is used to estimate the incremental capital cost of the pipeline network for each potential customer more details are provided in section s1 of the supplemental material sm 2 3 selector for wastewater treatment process selwtp the selwtp tool is a modification of the coalbed methane produced water treatment and beneficial use screening tool plumlee et al 2014 this dst was originally developed for selection of process trains for treatment and reuse of produced water generated by the upstream oil and gas industry rpsea 2010 in the original tool simple additive weighting was used to select treatment trains for beneficial reuse selwtp uses a multi objective optimization for selection of treatment trains and includes a database of treatment methods that are applicable to municipal wastewater reclamation the treatment methods include both individual technologies and commonly bundled technologies that constitute small standardized treatment trains e g coagulation flocculation sedimentation selwtp distinguishes between desalination technologies and conventional technologies that can also serve as pre treatment or post treatment to the desalination technologies selwtp first compares influent water quality to the target effluent quality for specific reuse applications e g indirect potable use crop irrigation stream flow augmentation livestock watering and then generates an internal roster of constituents that require removal and their required percent removal an expert defined matrix was created in selwtp that assigns percent removals of multiple constituents to each treatment technology or bundle of technologies the expert defined database also includes cost curves for each technology that correlates unit cost of treatment m3 and unit chemical demand monetized m3 to size capacity of system m3 day selwtp then uses a set of objective functions to assemble optimized treatment trains that will first achieve the treatment goal and then comply with economic i e capital and annual o m costs and technical i e ability to automate operation flexibility footprint current commercial status mobility modularity robustness waste management and ability to recover energy and nutrients criteria while the selwtp always searches for the least expensive treatment solution user assigned weights ranging from 1 lowest importance to 5 highest importance dictate selection of processes with the desired levels of the technical criteria listed above the user can also specifically dictate inclusion or exclusion of one or more technologies from the process trains that will be assembled by selwtp the conceptual flowchart of selwtp is illustrated in fig 3 selwtp automatically assembles treatment methods into treatment trains and scores the treatment trains the score for each treatment train is the sumproduct of user weighting and expert ranking for each treatment method within the train a non linear optimization is then used to select a final treatment train from among the constructed treatment trains additional details are provided in section s2 of the sm as outputs selwtp sizes and estimates the costs of storage tanks at the treatment site based on a user defined time requirement for storage for stps it calculates flowrates and concentrations of residual biosolids returned to the sewer network energy recovery at the stps is computed assuming anaerobic digestion which may be followed by sidestream nitrogen management options 2 4 calculator of fees revenues and subsidies calcbenefit fig 4 illustrates the monetary exchanges assumed by calcbenefit for a system containing a single ctp and a variable number of stps could be zero calcbenefit considers three different facility owner scenarios for water reclamation facilities fig 4 a shows the case in which all wastewater treatment and water reclamation facilities are owned and operated by a single entity we assume that the revenues for the owner come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for the conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the existing ctp ctpww and stps 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the centralized water reclamation facility for advanced treatment ctprw and stps and delivered to ctprw and stp customers and 3 subsidies from a government or other sources to promote water reuse fig 4 b shows the case in which the owner of the water reclamation facilities does not own the ctpww but does own a ctprw that upgrades ctpww effluent to the water quality standards required for reuse the reclaimed water distribution system and all stp water reclamation facilities we assume that the revenues for this owner come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the stps 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the ctprw and stps and delivered to ctprw and stp customers and 3 subsidies from governmental and other sources to promote water reuse also we assume that the owner of the water reclamation facilities ctprw and stps pays 1 fees for residual management at the ctpww caused by the stps and 2 fees for reduction in wastewater flow to the ctpww caused by the stps we assume that the fees collected from wastewater generators connected to the ctpww are unchanged by the reuse system fig 4 c shows the case in which one entity owns all ctp water reclamation facilities ctpww and ctprw and another entity owns all stp water reclamation facilities we assume that the revenues for the former entity come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the ctpww 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the ctprw and delivered to ctprw customers 3 subsidies from governmental and other sources to promote water reuse 4 fees for residual management at the ctpww caused by the stps and 5 fees for reduction in wastewater flow to the ctpww caused by the stps and we assume that the revenues for the stp entity come from 1 fees collected from wastewater generators for conveyance of wastewater to and its treatment at the stps 2 revenue from the sale of reclaimed water produced at the stps and delivered to stp customers and 3 subsidies from governmental and other sources to promote water reuse also we assume that the stp owner pays 1 fees for residual management at the ctpww and 2 fees for reduction in wastewater flow to the ctpww we also compute as a separate indicator potential cost savings to customers resulting from replacement of potable water with reclaimed water i e the cost of avoided potable water minus the cost of reclaimed water more details are provided in section s3 of the sm 2 5 analyst for multi criteria decision analysis sanna planning of reclaimed water infrastructure typically requires consideration of multiple criteria some of which may conflict to implement multi criteria decision analysis mcda we use the system for analysis of alternatives sanna developed by josef jablonský 2009 we choose this tool because it is available on line and supports several mcda methods e g electre roy 1968 promethee brans 1982 and topsis hwang and yoon 1981 that are widely used for real world problems the current iript version uses promethee to compare criteria that have incomparable or incommensurate metrics because of e g different measurement scales such as monetary and nonmonetary metrics linkov 2005 key steps of promethee are as follows lee et al 2013 step 1 configurations are compared in pairs for each criterion and a preference function score for each comparison is calculated using the usual preference function a preference score of 1 is given to a configuration alternative if its performance is superior to the paired alternative and a score of 0 is given otherwise step 2 each score is multiplied by a normalized weight assigned to the corresponding criterion the weighted scores are summed across the criteria and comparisons for each configuration and divided by the number of alternative configurations to obtain the positive outranking flows and negative outranking flows step 3 the final ranking is determined by the net outranking flows which are defined as the positive outranking flow minus the negative outranking flow and range between 1 and 1 these steps are performed by sanna which is a tool for mcda of iript 2 6 applications used for tool implementation locstp was developed using python and geoprocessing tools in arcgis prodot was developed using python general algebraic modeling system gams and arcgis lee et al 2016 calcbenefit was developed using microsoft excel selwtp and sanna were developed using vba visual basic for applications in microsoft excel 3 integration of decision support software tools each of the component tools described in section 2 has unique functionalities with rich features and can be run independently as a stand alone tool however the decision making process involves more than simply executing each tool sequentially careful integration and iteration between tools are necessary to generate wastewater reuse configurations that satisfy the design requirements thus an integrated dst that considers a number of critical factors in the decision making process and orchestrates the tools accordingly is essential the components described above are integrated into iript using the python environment within arcgis iript directly controls dataflow between tools and generates recommendations based on user input a third party python extension package pywin32 interacts with microsoft windows and launches external software applications 4 structure of decision making process applied to iript this section describes the decision making process used to identify optimal centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations for three different cases in case 1 the objective is to maximize the volume of reclaimed water supplied to customers in case 2 the objective is to maximize reclaimed water supplied to customers while ensuring a positive system net benefit in case 3 the objective is to maximize the system net benefit fig 5 illustrates the algorithm used to identify centralized configurations that maximize the reclaimed water supplied to customers case 1 in step 1 1 selwtp identifies supplemental treatment methods needed at the ctp to meet water quality standards for a specified beneficial use and the sizes and costs of storage tanks are computed a user defined storage time is used to compute storage volumes prodot then creates an optimized reclaimed water distribution network pipeline routing pump station locations and pipe sizes designed to serve all reclaimed water customers in step 1 2 calcbenefit computes revenues from the sale of reclaimed water based upon a user specified unit price m3 these unit prices are assumed uniform for all customers calcbenefit also computes subsidies and potential savings to customers using these steps the toolkit user can identify the configuration that maximizes reclaimed water supplied to customers given the assumed unit prices and subsidies an iript algorithm calculates system net benefit using data from table s2 to determine subsequent execution of the program if negative iript proceeds to case 2 and if positive iript proceeds to case 3 fig 6 illustrates the algorithm used to identify the centralized water reuse configuration that maximizes reclaimed water supply for the available wastewater flow while also providing a positive net benefit for the reclaimed water system case 2 this involves trimming steps 2 1 2 3 followed by checking steps 2 4 2 6 toolintegrator sorts all customers in order of their unit net benefit m3 from smallest to largest then systematically eliminates the set of customers with the smallest unit net benefits step 2 1 the unit net benefit for a given customer m3 is defined as the incremental system net benefit δ for the system that results when a known volume of reclaimed water m3 is delivered to that customer as customers are removed selwtp upgrades the ctp prodot optimizes pipeline design and calcbenefit calculates fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for the remaining customers steps 2 2 2 3 steps 2 1 2 3 iterate until the configuration system net benefit is positive at each iteration the toolkit reports the breakeven price of reclaimed water m3 for each system configuration that results in zero net benefits this information gives insight into the impacts of reclaimed water pricing on system size i e volume of reclaimed water supplied no customers after iript has identified a configuration with a positive system net benefit it checks customers that were excluded in the last trimming step to determine whether they can be added back into the system while still enabling positive net benefits the customer with the least negative net benefit will be added back in first steps 2 4 2 6 are repeated until the system net benefit is negative the checking process stops when the system net benefit is negative after a customer is added back in and the final selected configuration is the configuration obtained before addition of that customer fig 7 illustrates trimming for a simple example iript first removes the two customers who have the lowest unit net benefits the toolkit user controls this process by initially multiplying the system net benefit resulting from the final configuration of the previous case 100 by a user selected trimming factor 0 3 the trimming factor enables rapid exclusion of customers based upon economic considerations and avoids exhaustive enumeration iript optimizes the system design for the remaining customers resulting in a new configuration and a new system net benefit if the system net benefit after this optimization is positive 3 in this example no more customers are excluded if system net benefit remains negative additional trimming is required and steps 2 1 2 3 are repeated if this trimming eliminates all customers then water reuse is deemed infeasible for the assumed unit price of reclaimed water fig 8 illustrates the algorithm used to identify centralized water reuse configurations that maximize the system net benefit case 3 as before we use trimming steps 3 1 3 4 followed by checking steps 3 5 3 7 step 3 1 ranks customers in order of their unit net benefit m3 and eliminates the set of customers with the smallest unit net benefits after application of a trimming factor that has a value greater than one value selected initially by the toolkit user this factor is initially multiplied by the system net benefit resulting from the final configuration of the previous case if all customers are eliminated by trimming and one or more of the eliminated customers have negative unit net benefits iript automatically decreases the trimming factor and repeats step 3 1 if all the eliminated customers have positive unit net benefits iript eliminates the customer with the smallest unit net benefit if customers remain after trimming selwtp upgrades the ctp prodot optimizes pipeline design and calcbenefit calculates fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for the remaining customers in steps 3 2 3 3 if there are remaining customers but the system net benefit becomes negative iript executes the trimming process of case 2 in fig 6 until a configuration with a positive system net benefit is obtained iteration of steps 3 1 3 3 continues until there are no remaining customers this results in a series of intermediate configurations iript compares these intermediate configurations and selects the configuration with the greatest system net benefit step 3 4 for further analysis in the checking step iript checks the most promising intermediate configuration by adding back customers that were excluded in the trimming step that resulted in the most promising intermediate configuration beginning with the customer with the largest unit net benefit after addition of this customer selwtp upgrades the ctp prodot optimizes pipeline design and calcbenefit computes fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for those customers iript uses all of this information to determine the system net benefit that results from inclusion of this customer if the system net benefit increases the process is repeated with the customer that has the next largest unit net benefit and so on the checking process stops when the system net benefit decreases after a customer is added back in and the final selected configuration is the configuration obtained before addition of that customer fig 9 illustrates the algorithm used to identify hybrid water reuse configurations that maximize reclaimed water supply case 1h reclaimed water supply while also providing a positive net benefit case 2h and system net benefit case 3h steps 4 1 4 4 in fig 9 summarize the initialization steps used to analyze a hybrid configuration in step 4 1 the toolkit user selects clusters of customers that could be served by a single stp this step is enabled by a pause in the execution of the program toolintegrator then calculates unit pipe costs m3 for each cluster using the pipe network of the centralized configuration created in step 1 1 of fig 5 three such clusters are illustrated in fig 10 toolintegrator then selects the cluster with the lowest unit pipe cost 0 40 m3 in this example this value is calculated by dividing the amortized pipeline cost by the annual reclaimed water flow to the cluster using the lowest unit pipe cost step 4 1 and data from selwtp and calcbenefit toolintegrator performs a breakeven flowrate analysis eq 1 to identify the minimum flowrates needed for an stp step 4 2 in step 4 3 locstp estimates baseline wastewater and contaminant mass flows in the direction of the wastewater flow by summing mass flows throughout the sewer network this is the minimum flowrate for each pipeline in the sewer network i e the flowrate that is available at all times locstp then identifies potential stp and wastewater diversion locations as described in section 2 1 step 4 4 the algorithm used to configure hybrid systems case 1h 2h and 3h is similar to the algorithm used to configure centralized systems figs 5 6 and 8 with two important differences 1 hybrid configurations allow for monetary exchanges between a ctp and stps section 2 4 and 2 customers are divided into non overlapping stp and ctp configurations that ensure service to all potential customers and adequate flow to the stp this is accomplished in the matching step fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a iript initially generates reuse configurations for each treatment plant in which each plant is assumed to serve all customers unit net benefits m3 are then compared for each customer and for each configuration fig 11 a1 a3 customers with negative unit net benefits for all of the treatment plant locations are assigned to the treatment plant with the least negative unit net benefit and the customers with positive unit net benefits for one or more of the treatment plant locations are assigned to all the treatment plants with positive unit net benefits after assignment of all customers to treatment plants flowrates are checked throughout the system to ensure that reclaimed water can be recovered economically stps with flows that are less than the brwf are excluded e g stp1 in fig 11 a2 iript then automatically redesigns the system to enable new connections between each treatment plant and its prospective consumers based on prior assignments fig 11 b1 and b2 for customers connected to more than one treatment plant unit net benefits m3 are compared for each treatment plant and each customer is assigned to the plant that results in the largest unit net benefit iript then redesigns the system yielding a non overlapping configuration of stp and ctp customers where each treatment plant serves the customers with the largest unit net benefits this configuration serves all potential customers given the wastewater available for diversion to stps fig 11 c fig 12 illustrates use of mcda to select the final preferred configuration toolintegrator calculates performance metrics for each of the three centralized configurations and for each of the three hybrid configurations sanna then ranks these six configurations using calculated performance metrics and weights assigned by decision makers calcbenefit also calculates the cost savings to the reclaimed water customer i e the cost of avoided potable water purchase minus the cost of reclaimed water 5 case study 5 1 background the city of golden is located in jefferson county colorado the city does not operate its own ctp relying instead on a treatment plant operated by millercoors llc fig 13 the effluent from the treatment plant discharges to clear creek because golden s existing contract with millercoors does not include provisions for water reuse a new contract would be needed with provisions for golden to install and operate a reclaimed water distribution system upstream of the millercoors treatment plant along with one or more stps the city of golden would likely be required to compensate millercoors for the reduction in treatment plant inflow personal communication with ms anne beierle deputy director water utilities city of golden fig 4 b illustrates the monetary exchanges of the golden case study where the owner of ctpww is millercoors and the owner of both the ctprw and the stps is assumed to be the city of golden golden is located in a semi arid region city of golden 2015 with an irrigation season normally extending from april through october personal communication with mr les major utilities superintendent city of golden at present golden does not use reclaimed water we chose golden for this case study because of the city s expressed interest in water reuse and their willingness to share water infrastructure data for the following analysis we assume that the current reclaimed water regulations in colorado apply reclaimed water reuse currently allowed under colorado reclaimed water control regulation 84 includes landscape irrigation and various commercial and industrial uses such as cooling street cleaning fire protection and zoo operations co water quality control commission 2013 direct potable reuse is not considered in this analysis 5 2 application of iript integrated decision making 5 2 1 input data 5 2 1 1 inputs for mcda the golden case study demonstrates how iript improves the decision making process by incorporating user input into selection of a single preferred infrastructure configuration that satisfies decision maker priorities this case study identifies and ranks water reuse infrastructure configurations at different geographic scales while considering the sensitivity to different design parameters e g the unit price of reclaimed water subsidy rate and ctp compensation for reduced flow criteria and metrics for mcda are summarized in table 2 the promethee preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations i and ii methods are used for the mcda in the same way as in lee et al 2013 ms anne beierle of the city of golden provided weights for each of the criteria in table 3 using a scale of 0 lowest preference to 10 highest preference 5 2 1 2 reclaimed water demand and customer locations we assume that reclaimed water usage in golden will be limited to outdoor irrigation including both unrestricted access landscape irrigation with a high degree of public contact and resident controlled landscape irrigation on residential property both uses require secondary treatment with filtration and disinfection according to colorado reclaimed water control regulations co water quality control commission 2013 local public parks currently irrigated with river water were selected as the primary set of potential reclaimed water customers residential commercial and industrial customers with relatively high landscape water demands 3 5 m3 d are a second potential customer group we selected the subset of such customers located between golden s existing ctp and the parks more details are available in section s4 of the sm during the landscape irrigation season april to october the total potential reclaimed water demand for all of the potential customers is 2730 m3 day 0 72 mgd we assume that reclaimed water facilities would only be operated during this period of time eliminating the need for inter seasonal or inter annual carryover storage we assume that irrigation is carried out from 6 p m to 10 a m denver water 2017 with pumps and pipes sized for peak hour the locations of potential reclaimed water customers and their demands are shown in fig 14 the height of the bar at each location indicates the potential daily reclaimed water demand 5 2 2 baseline wastewater flowrates throughout the sewer network to estimate baseline wastewater flowrates throughout the sewer network we assume that february water use is non consumptive and therefore available for wastewater capture in any month each year golden establishes its sewer billing for the year based upon water use during the month of february personal communication with ms kim soulliere gis coordinator city of golden this value is multiplied by 3 for quarterly billings using the february flowrate data locstp performs a series of mass balances to estimate winter season baseline flowrates m3 d at manholes throughout the sewer system fig 15 5 2 3 breakeven reclaimed water flowrate using the methodology of sections 2 1 and 4 the calculated brwf for a stp providing reclaimed water to a cluster of customers in golden is 1240 m3 day 0 33 mgd this assumes an unit pipe cost of 0 50 m3 for the reclaimed water distribution pipelines for individual customers the brwf for an onsite water reuse system is 500 m3 day 0 13 mgd but the maximum reclaimed water demand is only 400 m3 day 0 1 mgd this implies that onsite water reuse is not economically viable 5 2 4 identify locations for satellite treatment plants and associated wastewater diversions using the methodology described in sections 2 1 and 4 locstp identifies two potential locations for stps and their associated wastewater diversion points the results are illustrated in fig 16 5 2 5 select wastewater treatment and energy recovery processes because the only use of reclaimed water is landscaping selwtp selects a wastewater treatment train consisting of screening grit removal microscreen filtration aerobic biological treatment in a sequencing batch reactor microfiltration and chemical disinfection this treatment train selection is based upon expert rankings included in selwtp and default weights assigned for domestic wastewater treatment this expected effluent satisfies reclaimed water control regulations of the state of colorado co water quality control commission 2013 selwtp also assesses the feasibility of energy recovery during wastewater treatment for the case of golden treatment trains without energy recovery process are chosen because systems with energy recovery incur high capital and o m costs and because the default weights assigned to capital and o m costs are higher than the default weight assigned to ability to recover energy therefore all stp residuals are returned to the wastewater collection system for digestion at the ctp the existing centralized wastewater treatment processes consist of a bar screen a grit collection system equalization surge tanks primary clarifiers an activated sludge system secondary clarifiers sand filters a post aeration basin and chlorination personal communication mr chris naber environmental specialist city of golden we assume that no additional treatment process is needed at the ctp we also assume that all storage tanks have a two day residence time 5 2 6 select pipeline route and optimize pipe and pump systems as shown in fig 16 there are 2 potential stp locations in golden using prodot near optimal pipeline routes are identified that capture wastewater and deliver reclaimed water from each treatment plant including the ctp to customers served by that plant pump locations and pipe sizes are optimized for each pipeline system pumps are sized to deliver reclaimed water to customer connections at delivery pressures of 390 1240 kpa 57 180 psi rmc water and environment 2008 usepa 2004 5 2 7 economically favorable water reuse configurations for the city of golden figs 17 and 18 illustrate how centralized water reuse configurations are identified by iript these configurations all assume a unit price of reclaimed water of 1 32 m3 5 1000gal and a subsidy of 0 20 m3 0 75 1000gal over 30 years we assume that competitive pricing of reclaimed water requires sale of reclaimed water at a value less than the potable water price 1 39 m3 5 26 1000gal also we assume that a subsidy provider would provide financial support to enable installation and operation of centralized and hybrid systems with positive system net benefits when reclaimed water is delivered to all potential customers thereby maximizing reclaimed water supply for the available wastewater iript recommends the configuration of fig 17 a the annual system net benefit for this configuration is 108k implying that this design is not economically viable in order to achieve a positive net benefit the reclaimed water rate must be increased to 1 51 m3 5 72 1000gal a value that exceeds the current potable water rate of 1 39 m3 5 26 1000gal for golden alternatively the external subsidy must be increased by 0 39 m3 1 47 1000gal if a higher water rate is not acceptable iript can be used to eliminate a set of customers that have the lowest unit net benefits customers within the solid circles of fig 17 b are excluded and a new system is recommended the annual system net benefit decreases from 108k to 41k but is still less than zero in order to achieve a positive net benefit with this configuration the reclaimed water rate would need to be 1 39 m3 5 26 1000gal the current potable water rate in golden or the external subsidy must be increased to 0 27 m3 1 01 1000gal with one additional iteration removing the lowest unit net benefit customers the annual system net benefit becomes greater than zero 50k fig 17 c as expected excluded customers tend to be farther away from the ctp at locations with relatively small water demand near the ends of pipeline branches because this removal algorithm is heuristic iript rechecks customers excluded in the steps leading to fig 17 c to determine whether they can be added back into the system while still maintaining a positive system net benefit in this case one of the previously excluded customers can be re incorporated yielding a annual system net benefit greater than zero 35k but less than the annual system net benefit of fig 17 c this configuration supplies 2670 m3 day to 183 reclaimed water customers and excludes 8 customers whose total demand is 60 m3 day fig 17 d table s3 provides the detailed iript output for each configuration of fig 17 after generating the optimal configuration for case 2 iript proceeds to case 3 by trimming customers until no customers remain and selects the centralized configuration that has the largest system net benefit iript also checks to determine whether customers should be added back in fig 18 is the configuration that maximizes the system net benefit figs 19 21 illustrate hybrid water reuse configurations identified by iript in addition to the assumptions implemented for the centralized configuration we assume that 10 of the current wastewater volume charge is paid to the ctp for diversion of wastewater to an stp beginning with a set of potential stp and sewer capture locations fig 16 and a database of locations and reclaimed water demands for all potential customers iript creates non overlapping subsystems which in combination serve all potential customers i e maximizing reclaimed water supply for the available wastewater fig 19 a shows the set of water reuse configurations resulting from the assumption that each treatment plant ctp or stp serves all potential customers in the system fig 19 b then illustrates the redesigned system where customers with negative unit net benefits for all of the treatment plant locations a1 a2 and a3 are assigned to the treatment plant with the least negative unit net benefit and the customers with positive unit net benefits for one or more of the treatment plant locations are assigned to all the treatment plants with positive unit net benefits in this process the stp in fig 19 a2 is excluded because it has insufficient reclaimed water flow i e less than the brwf fig 19 c shows the non overlapping configuration of stp and ctp customers where each treatment plant serves the customers with the largest unit net benefits this configuration serves all potential customers given the wastewater flow available for diversion to stps if the total demand of the customers assigned to an stp fig 19 b2 exceeds the capacity of the stp customers initially assigned to the stp are re assigned to the ctp starting with the customer with the shortest pipeline distance to the ctp this re assignment ensures that the demand at the stp is less than its capacity and results in a separation of service areas for the ctp and stp fig 19 c additional iterations are next used to trim the non overlapping service areas to ensure positive net benefits for the system while maximizing water delivery to customers fig 20 illustrates how iript uses additional iterations to trim customers and to identify the optimal hybrid water reuse configuration beginning with the configuration from fig 19 c iript trims the network through seven more iterations removing customers with the lowest unit net benefits and ultimately enabling maximizing reclaimed water use and ensuring a positive system net benefit a checking step is not required in this case because the final iteration excludes one customer fig 20 a d illustrate three intermediate configurations a c and the final configuration d from these further iterations isolated customers located far from the source of reclaimed water are excluded as are low demand customers located at or near the end of a pipeline and far from a treatment plant the net result is an increase in the annual system net benefit from 165k fig 19 c to 1k fig 20 d details of the changes in system configuration during the trimming process are summarized in table s4 after generating the optimal configuration for case 2 iript proceeds to case 3 by trimming customers until no customers remain and selects the hybrid configuration that has the largest system net benefit iript also checks to determine whether customers should be added back in fig 21 is the configuration that maximizes the system net benefit 5 2 8 performance metrics for each configuration table 4 summarizes performance metrics for six configurations three for a centralized and three for a hybrid system where the objectives are to 1 maximize reclaimed water supply 2 maximize reclaimed water supply while ensuring a positive system net benefit and 3 maximize system net benefit values of the performance metrics in table 4 are readily understood but the low o m cost for the centralized configuration needs explanation these low costs are due to the fact that system net benefits are computed for the owner of the reclaimed water facility which in this case is the city of golden because the city of golden does not own and operate the ctp o m costs to the city for ctp treatment are zero but the costs of o m for the reclaimed water distribution system are not zero expansion of the ctp could potentially incur o m costs for golden if needed to meet water quality standards however in this case this is not required 5 2 9 ranking of alternatives implementing the mcda algorithm described earlier the centralized configuration shown in fig 18 receives the highest rank table 4 this is primarily because of the high weighting of the system net benefit criterion where it scores highest in terms of performance and also because of its relatively low investment and o m costs and low annual energy requirement the three hybrid configurations ranked lower than the three centralized configurations this was because of the poor performance of the hybrid system with respect to o m costs and annual energy requirements 5 2 10 sensitivity analyses to assess the relative importance of unit prices of reclaimed water subsidy rates and ctp compensation for lower wastewater revenues due to the diversion and treatment of wastewater at stps we carried out a sensitivity analysis in which we varied each of these factors one at a time and evaluated the resulting changes in relative ranking of alternative configurations the results are summarized in section s5 of the sm 6 results and discussion for the city of golden case study iript shows that under a set of realistic assumptions a centralized configuration is preferred over a hybrid configuration the results also suggest why a centralized configuration may be a better choice for golden the localization advantages of a satellite system are diminished because golden is a relatively small city and the distance from the ctp to the farthest water reuse locations is only 3 4 km this factor affects the pipe length requirements and energy for pumping for hybrid configurations this results in pipe costs that are not sufficiently low to offset the costs of multiple treatment plants the case study also demonstrates that iript can automatically generate water reuse configurations using user specified site specific data that are commonly available for urban populations the reasons why a certain configuration may be preferred over another are made transparent to the toolkit user the short turn around time for analysis of different configurations allows on the fly adjustments of input data enabling the toolkit user to explore the consequences of such changes also calculation of the breakeven reclaimed water price at each iteration enables toolkit users to understand how water pricing impacts the size of the system and number of reclaimed water consumers the tools developed through this research have produced reasonable results and useful insights for reclaimed water infrastructure planning but obtaining input data in a digitized format is a significant challenge our experience shows that some assumptions may be needed in the absence of data in the case of golden for example the limited number of sewer flow meters within the sewer system made it necessary for us to use potable water usage data as a surrogate for wastewater flows 7 conclusion an integrated decision support toolkit iript developed for planning of water reuse infrastructure supports a diverse range of design functions including siting of stps and associated wastewater diversions optimal pipeline routing and sizing selection of wastewater treatment processes and calculation of fees revenues subsidies and potential savings for customers iript identifies centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations that meet three potential planning objectives 1 maximizing reclaimed water supply 2 maximizing reclaimed water supply while ensuring a positive system net benefit and 3 maximizing system net benefit the resulting configurations include critical design details that satisfy diverse technological environmental social and economic constraints the toolkit also ranks configurations using multiple criteria and input from decision makers we expect that the ipipt toolkit will give decision makers the ability to analyze many configurations across a wide range of scales facilitating more transparent decisions engaging stakeholders and increasing chances of socially acceptable and equitable solutions that satisfy many needs simultaneously acknowledgement this work was supported by nsf engineering research

19707,lately special attention has been given to veterinary cephalosporin antibiotics due to their broad activity spectrum and significant consumption indeed the determination of hydrolytic and photolytic kinetics provides a better comprehension of the undesired persistence of cephalosporins in aqueous matrices in this work the two widely used veterinary antibiotics ceftiofur cef and cefapirin cepa showed high instability under alkaline conditions degrading in few minutes at ph 11 in buffered solutions at neutral ph and natural temperature t 22 1 c both drugs presented moderate stability t½ 3 d cepa and 1 4 d cef our study also demonstrated that cepa and cef speciation did not significantly influence the direct photolysis rates using a simulated water disinfection set up λ 254 nm all ionic species of cef and cepa presented fast and similar pseudo first order degradation rates kapp 0 0095 0 0004 and 0 0092 0 001 cm2 mj 1 respectively furthermore using surface water in hydrolysis experiments cef demonstrated significant matrix dependent stability with a half life t½ 14 7 d tenfold higher than in buffered solutions in contrast cepa presented a very similar hydrolysis rate in river water t½ 4 2 d and a subtle faster photo degradation rate in this same matrix kapp 0 0128 0 001 cm2 mj 1 highlighting the importance of disinfection radiation for cephalosporin depletion in aqueous environments keywords photo transformation hydrolysis speciation ceftiofur cefapirin 1 introduction cephalosporin antibiotics as other pharmaceuticals have been reported to be present in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 in aqueous matrices cha et al 2006 lin et al 2008 besides the potential effects in non target organisms wang and lin 2012 alexandrino et al 2017 the observed increase of bacterial resistance in the last years has been linked to the presence of antibiotics in the environment boxall 2004 kümmerer 2009 especially the ones employed in veterinary medicine zhang et al 2017 in this context cephalosporin antibiotics are of environmental concern due to their high consumption sadeghi sefidmazgi et al 2011 significant activity against gram negative bacteria emea 1999 and unclear fate in complex matrixes gilbertson et al 1990 peterson et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 indeed investigations of abiotic transformation processes i e hydrolysis photolysis and partitioning sorption as well as biotic data i e aerobic and anaerobic degradation rates are incomplete or non existent for several pharmaceuticals however previous studies suggest that abiotic transformations as hydrolysis and photolysis may be more important than biodegradation for the environmental depletion of cephalosporins gilbertson et al 1990 jiang et al 2010 li et al 2011 wang and lin 2012 mitchell et al 2014 alexandrino et al 2017 besides the modeling study provided by fabbri et al 2015 suggested direct photolysis of cephalosporins in surface water as a potential trigger of toxic compounds as for other penicillin derivatives relative fast hydrolysis rates of cephalosporins are expected due to side chain degradation and beta lactam ring cleavage yamana and tsuji 1976 however hydrolytic half life times of days have been reported for this antibiotic group at ph 7 and 20 25 c gilbertson et al 1990 jiang et al 2010 mitchell et al 2014 consequently the presence of such compounds in aquatic systems cannot be neglected the semi synthetic antibiotics ceftiofur cef and cefapirin cepa have significant usage in veterinary clinic due to their broad activity spectrum against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria and high efficiency in the treatment of respiratory urinal dermatologic and infectious diseases gilbertson et al 1990 emea 1999 berendsen et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 cef has been widely used to treat respiratory and dermatologic diseases in dairy and beef cattle swine equines and chicks sunkara et al 1999 zhang et al 2017 in vivo studies demonstrated that intramuscularly applied cef is metabolized to the equally biologically active desfuroyl ceftiofur dfc desfuroyl ceftiofur cysteine disulphide and furoic acid emea 1999 li et al 2011 suggested dfc as the major hydrolysis product of cef presenting similar bioactivity and effectiveness than its precursor on the other hand ceftiofur aldehyde is the main cef biodegradation transformation product being formed by the beta lactam ring cleavage which induces reduced or neutralized antimicrobial activity li et al 2011 considered as one of the most important dairy cattle medicines cepa is mainly used for the treatment of mastitis one recurrent and economically relevant intramammary infection sadeghi sefidmazgi et al 2011 desacetyl cefapirin dac is the main cepa metabolite sharing similar structure stability and antimicrobial activity with its parental drug berendsen et al 2009 recently the occurrence of cepa and other cephalosporins in aquatic environments has been reported cha et al 2006 lin et al 2008 the average detected concentrations of cepa were 5 and 9 ng l 1 respectively obtained in hospital wastewater of taiwan lin et al 2008 and in an agriculturally influenced river in usa cha et al 2006 however little information is available about the environmental fate of those important antibiotics such as hydrolysis rates and photolysis in fact temperature ph and matrix composition are important parameters for hydrolysis of organic compounds mabey and mill 1978 schwarzenbach et al 2003 oecd 2004 likewise chemical speciation can play a significant role in the photo transformation of active products canonica et al 2008 baeza and knappe 2011 specifically in multifunctional antibiotics avisar et al 2010 hydrolysis kinetic data are hardly available for cepa where only body temperature was considered i e 37 c berendsen et al 2009 meanwhile other authors already studied ph and temperature effects on the degradation of cef gilbertson et al 1990 koshy and cazers 1997 sunkara et al 1999 however the reported data gives conflicting evidence the only consensus is the complexity of cef hydrolysis koshy and cazers 1997 stated that dfc the major cef hydrolysis product is later converted to dimers of desfuroylceftiofur thiolactone among other more complex structures recently ribeiro and schmidt 2017 reported on the ph dependent ionization of cepa and cef including their expected speciation yields in aqueous solution at ph values typical for water treatment 6 8 it was observed that both compounds are mainly present as anions i e cepa and cef or as zwitterions i e cepa and cef particularly wang and lin 2012 carried out the only available study approaching ph effects on cephalosporin photo transformation using simulated sunlight induced photolysis 290 nm 700 nm these authors studied cepa and other cephalosporins depletion and indicated high influence of speciation in the observed degradation rates approaching disinfection radiation few data are available for cephalosporins specifically kim and tanaka 2009 and kim et al 2009 investigated the effects of uvc and uv h2o2 in the transformation of cef however these authors did not consider the speciation propriety of this drug in summary considering that speciation of a pollutant and matrix composition can influence uvc photolysis and hydrolysis rates the available data for cepa and cef is inconclusive for predicting its environmental behavior the present study aims to close this gap by investigating the influence of ph on hydrolysis kinetics of cef and cepa as well as to provide more information regarding the impact of cephalosporin speciation on photo transformation kinetics in synthetic and real water matrices 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals ceftiofur sodium cef purity 98 cas 104010 37 9 and cefapirin sodium cepa purity 99 cas 24356 60 3 were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology california usa and sigma aldrich seelze germany respectively generally each powdered cephalosporin was diluted in ultrapure water resulting in stock solutions of 2 mm all solutions were prepared and stored under refrigeration 4 c for at maximum 2 days the following chemicals were used

modeling purposes solutions were prepared with ultrapure water uw elga purelab flex resistivity 15 5 mω cm all reagents were of analytical grade 2 2 surface water sampling ruhr river surface water 10 30 cm depth was collected in kupferdreh rk n 51 23 32 e 7 4 31 district of essen germany in march 2017 the grabbed samples 6 l were filtered with 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester filters whatman germany and stored at 4 c and dark until use right after water sampling the following relevant parameters were assessed total carbon tc non purgeable organic carbon npoc inorganic carbon ic dissolved organic carbon doc as well as total nitrogen ph alkalinity and the ions cl so 4 2 no 3 and no 2 2 3 hydrolysis the ph dependent stability of cepa and cef in aqueous solutions was investigated testing each cephalosporin separately experiments were performed in triplicates in darkness at room temperature 22 1 c and without ionic strength adjustment ten buffer solutions ph 1 to 12 5 table s4 supplementary information were prepared according to oecd 2004 recommendations the buffer solutions of each investigated ph value and uw 4 ml each were inserted into inert brown glass vials 15 ml 2 ml of fresh antibiotic work solution 350 μm was added to these brown glass vials for starting the reaction the final test conditions were as follows 70 μm antibiotic in 0 04 m buffer 70 min hydrolysis time and sampling every 14 min for sampling 0 5 ml was removed and immediately mixed with 4 5 ml phosphate buffer ph 7 for stabilizing cephalosporins according to berendsen et al 2009 finally 50 μl of each quenched sample was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc to monitor the abatement of the compounds under study see further details below section 2 5 to verify reproducibility and deviations all reactions and measurements were carried out in triplicates complementary hydrolysis experiments were carried out with rk and uw since preliminary experiments demonstrated longer half life times of both antibiotics in these matrices than in buffered solutions an automated sampling and longer experimental duration was chosen for that 50 ml of matrix was spiked with antibiotics resulting in 70 μm starting concentration later the test solution was split in brown glass hplc vials 1 5 ml which were immediately analyzed for the antibiotic concentration by hplc dad section 2 5 concentration of cepa and cef were determined every 22 min for 6 h 2 4 photolysis the uvc photolytic transformation of environmentally relevant ionic species of cef and cepa was studied aiming at a better understanding of the degradation processes involved in the aquatic fate of these chemicals and using a scenario of water disinfection via uvc usage with no direct implication in environmental photochemical transformations two approaches were used first for kinetic studies experiments were carried out in uw at different ph values afterwards experiments were performed using the target cephalosporins spiked in surface water 2 4 1 kinetics studies photolysis was performed using a merry go round reactor h th schneider glasapparatebau germany which was previously described and applied for similar purposes wegelin et al 1994 canonica et al 2008 lutze et al 2015 as inner radiation source a monochromatic low pressure mercury lamp 15 w gph303t5l 4 hereaus germany with main emission at 254 nm was used 185 nm band suppressed additionally a fluid circulator ministat 125 huber germany filled with uw was used to keep the reactor internal temperature always constant at 25 0 2 c finally quartz tubes 15 8 mm average internal diameter were placed in the circular water bath for sample exposure before and after each experiment the system absolute fluence rate was chemically measured by uri actinometry von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 lutze et al 2015 accordingly the obtained average fluence rate e0 was 62 3 μe m 2 s 1 equivalent to 3 mj cm 2 s 1 the available pk a values for cepa are 2 74 carboxyl and 5 13 pyridine for cef the values are 2 68 carboxyl and 3 28 aminothiazole ribeiro and schmidt 2017 considering that speciation of pharmaceuticals can influence their photo transformation canonica et al 2008 avisar et al 2010 baeza and knappe 2011 the cationic zwitterionic and anionic species of cepa and cef fig 1 were investigated therefore several buffer solutions ph 2 to 9 were prepared using adjusted phosphate and sulfuric acid buffers afterwards test solutions were prepared in a 100 ml volumetric flask by adding 5 ml of antibiotic work solution 40 and 80 μm for cef and cepa respectively 5 ml buffer and making up with uw to ensure no interference in the light transmittance through the test tubes all chemicals were studied at low concentration i e cepa 4 μm cef 2 μm buffer 5 mm consequently the initial test solutions presented maximum absorbance below 0 01 cm 1 at wavelengths 200 nm next 50 ml of each test solution were inserted in quartz tubes previously conditioned to 25 0 2 c following 5 ml was sampled after 0 18 36 54 72 and 90 s of uvc exposure finally cephalosporin depletion was determined for every performed condition by hplc dad section 2 5 all experiments and measurements were performed at least in triplicates 2 4 2 photolysis in surface water to study the behavior of cepa and cef during uvc disinfection of water a real matrix was tested radiation experiments were performed as described above section 2 4 1 since the real water matrix rk presented significant light absorption i e 0 045 cm 1 it was necessary to introduce a correction factor for internal fluence rate calculation therefore the morowitz factor katsoyiannis et al 2011 was used to correct the applied fluence rate determined by uri actinometry for comparison the model contaminant atz was used for internal fluence determination according to canonica et al 2008 and lutze et al 2015 in fact both internal and corrected fluence rates showed good agreement fig s3 supplementary information 2 5 analytical methods bicarbonate concentration was determined as alkalinity by 0 01 m sulfuric acid titration using an automatic titrator tiamo metrohm the

results and discussion 3 1 hydrolysis in pure water generally hydrolysis can be categorized as acid catalyzed k a neutral or ph independent k n and base catalyzed k b reaction mabey and mill 1978 schwarzenbach et al 2003 the observed pseudo first order hydrolysis rate constant k obs can be defined as the sum of all reactions following eq 1 1 k o b s k a h k n k b o h in our experiments cepa presented similar hydrolysis rates under acidic and neutral environment fig 2 a from ph 1 3 to 7 1 the mean k obs values were similar table 1 resulting in half life time of days however base catalyzed hydrolysis appeared to be more important fig 2a shows a linear increase of log k obs with ph at ph values above 9 in fact cepa presented low stability at ph 12 half life 10 min while average k obs obtained at ph 7 1 was hundredfold smaller table 1 this result indicates that cepa is rather stable at typical ph values of natural water matrices ph 7 and that acid catalyzed reactions are not significant at ph 2 assuming k n equals the k obs at ph 7 1 schwarzenbach et al 2003 the ph independent rate constant for cepa was derived from eq 1 k n 0 03 10 4 s 1 22 1 c considering that only neutral and base catalyzed hydrolysis take place at ph 9 the k b value for cepa was obtained using the previously calculated k n and rearranging eq 1 therefore the k b calculated for cepa at 22 1 c was 0 14 m 1 s 1 with k n and k b at hand eq 1 could be used for calculating k a for cepa 0 08 10 4 m 1 s 1 finally using k n k a and k b the ph values where two hydrolysis reactions are equally important i mabey and mill 1978 mitchell et al 2014 could be calculated for this purpose eqs 2 4 were used 2 i a n log k a k n 3 i a b 0 5 log k a k b k w 4 i n b log k n k b k w a n b acid catalyzed ph independent and base catalyzed reaction respectively eqs 2 4 gave following results i an 0 5 i ab 4 9 and inb 9 4 therefore at typical ph of natural waters neutral and base catalyzed reactions are the most important for the hydrolysis of this antibiotic in principle other nucleophiles present in a real water matrix may also catalyze hydrolysis of cepa however this was not observed in case of rk water cef and cepa display a similar hydrolysis profile as indicated in fig 2b base catalyzed reactions are the most significant ones in the aqueous transformation of cef however cef showed a faster transformation rate in acid catalyzed hydrolysis than cepa from ph 1 5 to ph 4 2 the obtained half life times were in the range of hours in fact even under neutral conditions cef presented significant hydrolysis rate ph 7 2 k obs 0 06 10 4 s 1 t½ 1 4 days the hydrolytic kinetic parameters for cef can be obtained from table 1 the resulting values of i of cef indicate that at typical ph values of natural water matrices 6 8 base catalyzed reactions are somewhat less important than in case of cepa table 1 this indicates that the effect of other nucleophilic compounds of a natural water have a smaller effect on cef hydrolysis compared to cepa hydrolysis the base catalyzed hydrolysis of several cephalosporins has been reported but in few cases complete hydrolytic kinetic parameters or intersection points have been established these data are important for the understanding and prediction of cephalosporin behavior during analytical procedures in biological systems and in other environmentally relevant matrices analyzing both cephalosporins hydrolysis profiles no visible shoulder caused by dissociation was observed consequently hydrolysis kinetics were not influenced by the speciation of cef and cepa yamana and tsuji 1976 therefore eq 1 was used along with the obtained k n k b and k a values for cepa and cef table 1 to estimate and fit the hydrolysis degradation rate for both compounds at any ph value and 22 1 c the resulting modeled curves are plotted in fig 2 along with measured values the fitted curves readily agree with the experimental data interestingly the model indicates acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cef occurring at ph 3 which confirms the results obtained by berendsen et al 2009 for cepa which displayed a somewhat smaller scattering in the data the fitted curve agrees even better with the measured values to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that hydrolytic kinetics parameters are provided for cepa although the authors did not calculate t1 2 or hydrolysis rate constants berendsen et al 2009 reported similar alkaline catalyzed degradation for cef the degrees of degradation of 100 within 30 min at ph 12 and by 80 within 3 h at ph 11 observed by these authors follow the same tendency as presented in our study table 1 berendsen et al 2009 also investigated ph effects on the degradation of cepa and its major metabolite desacetyl cefapirin dac they reported that cepa and dac were instable at ph above 7 5 what agrees well with our findings however differences were noticed in the available data concerning the neutral and acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cef for example sunkara et al 1999 reported a rate constant of k obs 0 03 10 4 s 1 at ph 5 citric acid nah2po4 buffer and k obs 0 05 10 4 s 1 at ph 7 4 phosphate buffer for cef as shown in table 1 our results at ph 7 2 agree with the data of sunkara et al 1999 but reveal a faster reaction at acidic condition gilbertson et al 1990 also reported on cef hydrolysis and observed a decrease in reaction rates at acidic ph cef half life times of 100 8 and 4 2 days were obtained at 22 c and ph values of 5 7 and 9 respectively gilbertson et al 1990 koshy and cazers 1997 studied cef hydrolysis and products formation upon cephalosporin hydrolysis in a high ionic strength environment desfuroyl ceftiofur dfc was formed in analogy to hydrolysis of thioesters this transformation does not change the bioactive part of cef beta lactam structure hence the biological activity may be preserved after cef hydrolysis koshy and cazers 1997 which may also apply to cepa in analogy to hydrolysis of carbon esters hydroxo cepa and acetic acid may be formed from hydrolysis of the ester group in cepa yamana and tsuji 1976 previous studies investigated the hydrolysis of other cephalosporins in aqueous solution wang and notari 1994 demonstrated that both h and oh are significant for cefuroxime hydrolysis indeed the hydrolysis of cefuroxime s alkyl carbamate group as well as of its beta lactam ring were the major degradation pathways yamana and tsuji 1976 studied the ph dependent hydrolysis kinetics of such 3 acetoxymethylcephalosporins they indicated that in both neutral and alkaline ph the ester moiety is hydrolyzed resulting in high yields of desacetyl intermediates under acidic conditions the desacetyl product is also formed but quickly undergoes lactonization hydrolysis rates of several cephalosporins determined by yamana and tsuji 1976 were very similar to cef also revealing significant acid catalyzed hydrolysis at ph 3 fig 2b besides sharing similar side chain cefaloglycin was more susceptible to base and acid catalyzed hydrolysis than cepa in fact cefaloglycin showed significant stability only in the ph range 2 4 yamana and tsuji 1976 whereas cepa presented similar k obs values at ph 9 fig 2a however it is important to consider that under environmental conditions several other parameters beside ph may influence hydrolysis 3 2 matrix effects on cepa and cef hydrolysis the hydrolytic degradation of cepa and cef was studied using uw and rk as table 1 illustrates cepa presented similar degradation in both matrices for this drug the observed k obs values for uw and rk are in the same range of the ones obtained using buffered solutions and agree with the estimated curve fig 2a consequently matrix composition did not affect cepa hydrolysis at least under our experimental conditions dark 22 1 c 70 μm starting concentration however the results obtained for cef are controversial degradation in unbuffered uw and rk was much slower than the ones exhibited and predicted for similar ph values fig 2b for instance half life times of 30 and 14 7 days were observed in uw ph 6 after antibiotic spiking and rk ph 8 after antibiotic spiking respectively in contrast in phosphate buffer ph 7 2 cef presented t1 2 of 1 4 days li et al 2011 reported a k obs of 0 05 10 4 s 1 for cef hydrolysis in neutral solutions at 25 c this value is very similar to our results using ph 7 2 phosphate buffer i e k obs 0 06 10 4 s 1 but ten times higher than our results using uw water k obs 0 003 10 4 s 1 table 1 sunkara et al 1999 reported 0 007 10 4 s 1 as cef k obs in distilled water 25 c a value in the same range as our results with similar matrix furthermore using phosphate buffer at ph 7 4 and citric acid nah2po4 buffer at ph 5 sunkara et al 1999 obtained k obs 0 046 10 4 s 1 and k obs 0 025 10 4 s 1 respectively these values are very similar to our results with buffers table 1 and confirmed that cef hydrolysis can be influenced by other matrix constituents while cepa was not affected phosphate borate and acetate buffers did not catalyze cefuroxime cefalotin and cefoxitin hydrolysis wang and notari 1994 mitchell et al 2014 in the study of cepa and cef stability during typical sample preparation berendsen et al 2009 indicated the applicability of phosphate buffers ph 7 to quench further degradation likewise the standard guideline for studying the ph dependent hydrolysis oecd 2004 also includes phosphate in the list of suggested buffers the observed scattering of cef degradation kinetics may also result from fluctuations in the baseline of the chromatographic determination of cef which appeared during the analysis of the samples fig s2 supplementary information 3 3 photolysis as a function of speciation speciation of organic compounds can largely affect photo degradation canonica et al 2008 avisar et al 2010 baeza and knappe 2011 hence all relevant species of cepa and cef i e cationic zwitterionic and anionic species were investigated therefore ph was adjusted for achieving predominant presence of each species table 2 further details on speciation of cef and cepa see ribeiro and schmidt 2017 molar absorption coefficient quantum yield and fluence based degradation kinetics for all cef and cepa species are given in table 2 in case of the neutral species other species are also present and can slightly interfere the ph for investigating the neutral species was adjusted in order to minimize these interferences since minor interferences by other species are always possible the term apparent molar absorption coefficient εapp was chosen as suggested by canonica et al 2008 each ionic species was photolyzed using at least two ph values at which these species predominate the apparent pseudo first order rate constant k app for each ionic species was determined using the fluence dose h and ln c t c 0 according to eq 5 5 ln c t c 0 k a p p h as shown in fig 3 cepa cationic and zwitterionic species presented fast and similar transformation rates with t1 2 ranging from 25 to 29 s table 2 in contrast cepa anionic species showed somewhat faster reaction having half life times of 19 and 21 s a small variation 0 001 in the calculated average of k app was observed table 2 demonstrating that cepa s electronic density alteration hardly affects photo transformation moreover all investigated cef species presented very similar transformation rates fig 4 this antibiotic revealed a comparable photolysis rate as cepa with half life times ranging from 23 to 26 s table 2 the k app values of cepa ionic species were statistically compared using anova followed by tukey test and no significant difference was observed p 0 05 the same applies for cef ionic species the apparent quantum yield ф app for each analyzed species at 254 nm was calculated by rearranging eq 6 which describes direct photolytic degradation canonica et al 2008 for that the obtained apparent molar absorption coefficient εapp the average photon fluence rate of the employed photoreactor e0 62 3 μe m 2 s 1 and the time based apparent pseudo first order rate constant tk app in s 1 table s5 supplementary information were used 6 t k a p p 2 303 e 0 ε a p p ф a p p as demonstrated in table 2 the quantum yields for cepa species presented small variation with the mean at ф app 0 146 0 02 mol e 1 for cef the mean apparent quantum yield was 0 087 0 007 mol e 1 as for cepa all studied species of cef showed similar ф app values our results differ from those reported by wang and lin 2012 using a sunlight simulator 290 nm λ 700 nm the authors demonstrated significant ph dependence for cepa photo transformation our results may be explained by the different wavelength used in our experiments considering that sunlight simulators are typically rather weak radiation sources hydrolysis may have also contributed in the observed degradation kinetics derived by wang and lin 2012 this may also explain the observed ph dependency furthermore differences in photo transformation parameters may be also explained by variations of starting concentration matrix characteristics and experimental setup lin and reinhard 2005 using a low pressure lamp of 8 w emitting at 254 nm for treating a sample at ph 7 kim and tanaka 2009 and kim et al 2009 also reported on the direct photo transformation of cef first kim et al 2009 reported a εapp 254 nm of 1466 m2 mol 1 for cef the present study reveals a similar εapp 1850 m2 mol 1 normalizing tk app values by the fluence rate k app e0 tk app e0 allows to assess the efficiency of photo degradation the results of kim and tanaka fairly agree with our data albeit our data suggest a somewhat lower energy demand for photodegradation of cef i e our study k app e0 0 93 10 3 j 1m2 kim and tanaka 2009 k app e0 1 72 10 3 j 1m2 however with both degradation rates 30 of cef will be degraded upon 400 j m 2 which is the uv exposure recommended for water disinfection dvgw 1997 interferences by buffer which can catalyze hydrolysis can be ruled out since the rates observed in our photolytic study were thousandfold higher than the ones observed for hydrolysis k app and εapp can but must not correlate due to the fact that the quantum yield can be affected by speciation of the compound under study canonica et al 2008 in fact analyzing diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and other pharmaceuticals photo transformation baeza and knappe 2011 did not observe clear correlations between εapp and photolytic transformation rates even including quantum yields for comparing the ph dependence of photo kinetics parameters these authors could not observe the patterns suggested by canonica et al 2008 indeed the generated data referring to cepa and cef photolysis compiled in table 2 were also investigated according to the methodology employed by canonica et al 2008 and baeza and knappe 2011 for cef k app and εapp did not significantly change with the ph in contrast for cepa a clear correlation was observed with concomitant increase of εapp and k app fig s5 supplementary information our results with cephalosporins corroborate the results of baeza and knappe 2011 where the authors illustrate that despite structural similarities sulfonamide antibiotics showed different correlations of photo kinetic parameters 3 4 photolysis in surface water in natural waters the presence of photosensitizers and radical scavengers may lead to different photo transformation processes than in uw previous studies indicated significant enhancement of pharmaceutical degradation in surface waters due to indirect photolysis lin and reinhard 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2011 wang and lin 2012 in the present work the photolytic kinetics of cef and cepa spiked in rk were assessed as illustrated in fig 5 photolysis of cef and cepa is not strongly affected by constituents of the water matrix in case of cef hardly any effect of the water matrix can be observed while photolysis of cepa is slightly enhanced by the presence of the water matrix which indicates that photosensitizers where involved in degradation of cepa in rk yet the observed matrix effect on cepa photo oxidation compared to cef cannot be explained however different behaviors in photo oxidation of compounds with similar structures has already been reported baeza and knappe 2011 wang and lin 2012 using sunlight simulator wang and lin 2012 reported a different behavior slower photolysis rate of cepa among several cephalosporins in surface water than in pure water alkalinity and nitrite are indicated as major photosensitizers in surface water schwarzenbach et al 2003 as discussed by katsoyiannis et al 2011 and wang and lin 2012 dissolved organic matter may play a role as both photosensitizer and radical scavenger accordingly the investigated surface water was chemically characterized table s3 both the water matrix investigated by wang and lin 2012 and rk contained photosensitizers albeit in different concentrations however the different outcome of these studies can be explained by the different radiation sources used the uvc radiation from the lp hg arc may more effectively excite aqueous species than the sunlight simulator which emits only a small fraction of uvc radiation 4 conclusions kinetic rates for the hydrolysis and photo transformation of cef and cepa in artificial and natural waters were presented the conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows ph dependent hydrolytic kinetic parameters 22 1 c including intersection points i for cepa and cef have shown that these compounds are relatively stable under neutral and acid environment presenting half life times ranging from 1 4 to 3 days cepa and 1 9 h to 3 7 days cef whereas for both drugs base catalyzed reactions ph 9 led to fast degradation day t½ min photo degradation kinetics under uvc radiation λ 254 nm was not affected by speciation of cepa the same applied for cef ionic species during uv disinfection applying 400 j m 2 cef and cepa was degraded in rk by 32 and 40 respectively acknowledgements arr gratefully acknowledges the scholarship

19707,lately special attention has been given to veterinary cephalosporin antibiotics due to their broad activity spectrum and significant consumption indeed the determination of hydrolytic and photolytic kinetics provides a better comprehension of the undesired persistence of cephalosporins in aqueous matrices in this work the two widely used veterinary antibiotics ceftiofur cef and cefapirin cepa showed high instability under alkaline conditions degrading in few minutes at ph 11 in buffered solutions at neutral ph and natural temperature t 22 1 c both drugs presented moderate stability t½ 3 d cepa and 1 4 d cef our study also demonstrated that cepa and cef speciation did not significantly influence the direct photolysis rates using a simulated water disinfection set up λ 254 nm all ionic species of cef and cepa presented fast and similar pseudo first order degradation rates kapp 0 0095 0 0004 and 0 0092 0 001 cm2 mj 1 respectively furthermore using surface water in hydrolysis experiments cef demonstrated significant matrix dependent stability with a half life t½ 14 7 d tenfold higher than in buffered solutions in contrast cepa presented a very similar hydrolysis rate in river water t½ 4 2 d and a subtle faster photo degradation rate in this same matrix kapp 0 0128 0 001 cm2 mj 1 highlighting the importance of disinfection radiation for cephalosporin depletion in aqueous environments keywords photo transformation hydrolysis speciation ceftiofur cefapirin 1 introduction cephalosporin antibiotics as other pharmaceuticals have been reported to be present in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 in aqueous matrices cha et al 2006 lin et al 2008 besides the potential effects in non target organisms wang and lin 2012 alexandrino et al 2017 the observed increase of bacterial resistance in the last years has been linked to the presence of antibiotics in the environment boxall 2004 kümmerer 2009 especially the ones employed in veterinary medicine zhang et al 2017 in this context cephalosporin antibiotics are of environmental concern due to their high consumption sadeghi sefidmazgi et al 2011 significant activity against gram negative bacteria emea 1999 and unclear fate in complex matrixes gilbertson et al 1990 peterson et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 indeed investigations of abiotic transformation processes i e hydrolysis photolysis and partitioning sorption as well as biotic data i e aerobic and anaerobic degradation rates are incomplete or non existent for several pharmaceuticals however previous studies suggest that abiotic transformations as hydrolysis and photolysis may be more important than biodegradation for the environmental depletion of cephalosporins gilbertson et al 1990 jiang et al 2010 li et al 2011 wang and lin 2012 mitchell et al 2014 alexandrino et al 2017 besides the modeling study provided by fabbri et al 2015 suggested direct photolysis of cephalosporins in surface water as a potential trigger of toxic compounds as for other penicillin derivatives relative fast hydrolysis rates of cephalosporins are expected due to side chain degradation and beta lactam ring cleavage yamana and tsuji 1976 however hydrolytic half life times of days have been reported for this antibiotic group at ph 7 and 20 25 c gilbertson et al 1990 jiang et al 2010 mitchell et al 2014 consequently the presence of such compounds in aquatic systems cannot be neglected the semi synthetic antibiotics ceftiofur cef and cefapirin cepa have significant usage in veterinary clinic due to their broad activity spectrum against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria and high efficiency in the treatment of respiratory urinal dermatologic and infectious diseases gilbertson et al 1990 emea 1999 berendsen et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 cef has been widely used to treat respiratory and dermatologic diseases in dairy and beef cattle swine equines and chicks sunkara et al 1999 zhang et al 2017 in vivo studies demonstrated that intramuscularly applied cef is metabolized to the equally biologically active desfuroyl ceftiofur dfc desfuroyl ceftiofur cysteine disulphide and furoic acid emea 1999 li et al 2011 suggested dfc as the major hydrolysis product of cef presenting similar bioactivity and effectiveness than its precursor on the other hand ceftiofur aldehyde is the main cef biodegradation transformation product being formed by the beta lactam ring cleavage which induces reduced or neutralized antimicrobial activity li et al 2011 considered as one of the most important dairy cattle medicines cepa is mainly used for the treatment of mastitis one recurrent and economically relevant intramammary infection sadeghi sefidmazgi et al 2011 desacetyl cefapirin dac is the main cepa metabolite sharing similar structure stability and antimicrobial activity with its parental drug berendsen et al 2009 recently the occurrence of cepa and other cephalosporins in aquatic environments has been reported cha et al 2006 lin et al 2008 the average detected concentrations of cepa were 5 and 9 ng l 1 respectively obtained in hospital wastewater of taiwan lin et al 2008 and in an agriculturally influenced river in usa cha et al 2006 however little information is available about the environmental fate of those important antibiotics such as hydrolysis rates and photolysis in fact temperature ph and matrix composition are important parameters for hydrolysis of organic compounds mabey and mill 1978 schwarzenbach et al 2003 oecd 2004 likewise chemical speciation can play a significant role in the photo transformation of active products canonica et al 2008 baeza and knappe 2011 specifically in multifunctional antibiotics avisar et al 2010 hydrolysis kinetic data are hardly available for cepa where only body temperature was considered i e 37 c berendsen et al 2009 meanwhile other authors already studied ph and temperature effects on the degradation of cef gilbertson et al 1990 koshy and cazers 1997 sunkara et al 1999 however the reported data gives conflicting evidence the only consensus is the complexity of cef hydrolysis koshy and cazers 1997 stated that dfc the major cef hydrolysis product is later converted to dimers of desfuroylceftiofur thiolactone among other more complex structures recently ribeiro and schmidt 2017 reported on the ph dependent ionization of cepa and cef including their expected speciation yields in aqueous solution at ph values typical for water treatment 6 8 it was observed that both compounds are mainly present as anions i e cepa and cef or as zwitterions i e cepa and cef particularly wang and lin 2012 carried out the only available study approaching ph effects on cephalosporin photo transformation using simulated sunlight induced photolysis 290 nm 700 nm these authors studied cepa and other cephalosporins depletion and indicated high influence of speciation in the observed degradation rates approaching disinfection radiation few data are available for cephalosporins specifically kim and tanaka 2009 and kim et al 2009 investigated the effects of uvc and uv h2o2 in the transformation of cef however these authors did not consider the speciation propriety of this drug in summary considering that speciation of a pollutant and matrix composition can influence uvc photolysis and hydrolysis rates the available data for cepa and cef is inconclusive for predicting its environmental behavior the present study aims to close this gap by investigating the influence of ph on hydrolysis kinetics of cef and cepa as well as to provide more information regarding the impact of cephalosporin speciation on photo transformation kinetics in synthetic and real water matrices 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals ceftiofur sodium cef purity 98

modeling purposes solutions were prepared with ultrapure water uw elga purelab flex resistivity 15 5 mω cm all reagents were of analytical grade 2 2 surface water sampling ruhr river surface water 10

carbon doc as well as total nitrogen ph alkalinity and the ions cl so 4 2 no 3 and no 2 2 3 hydrolysis the ph dependent stability of cepa and cef in aqueous solutions was investigated testing each cephalosporin separately experiments were performed in triplicates in darkness at room temperature 22 1 c and without ionic strength adjustment ten buffer solutions ph 1 to 12 5 table s4 supplementary

antibiotic work solution 350 μm was added to these brown glass vials for starting the reaction the final test conditions were as follows 70 μm antibiotic in 0 04 m buffer 70 min hydrolysis time and sampling every 14 min for sampling 0 5 ml was removed and immediately mixed with 4 5 ml phosphate buffer ph 7 for stabilizing cephalosporins according to berendsen et al 2009 finally 50 μl of each quenched sample was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc to monitor the abatement of the compounds under study see further details below section 2 5 to verify reproducibility and deviations all reactions and measurements were carried out in triplicates complementary hydrolysis experiments were carried out with rk and uw since preliminary experiments demonstrated longer half life times of both antibiotics in these matrices than in buffered solutions an automated sampling and longer experimental duration was chosen for that 50 ml of matrix was spiked with antibiotics resulting in 70 μm starting concentration later the test solution was split in brown glass hplc vials 1 5 ml which were immediately analyzed for the antibiotic concentration by hplc dad section 2 5 concentration of cepa and cef were determined every 22 min for 6 h 2 4 photolysis the uvc photolytic transformation of environmentally relevant ionic species of cef and cepa was studied aiming at a better understanding of the degradation processes involved in the aquatic fate of these chemicals and using a scenario of water disinfection via uvc usage with no direct implication in environmental photochemical transformations two approaches were used first for kinetic studies experiments were carried out in uw at different ph values afterwards experiments were performed using the target cephalosporins spiked in surface water 2 4 1 kinetics studies photolysis was performed using a merry go round reactor h th schneider glasapparatebau germany which was previously described and applied for similar purposes wegelin et al 1994 canonica et al 2008 lutze et al 2015 as inner radiation source a monochromatic low pressure mercury lamp 15 w gph303t5l 4 hereaus germany with main emission at 254 nm was used 185 nm band suppressed additionally a fluid circulator ministat 125 huber germany filled with uw was used to keep the reactor internal temperature always constant at 25 0 2 c finally quartz tubes 15 8 mm average internal diameter were placed in the circular water bath for sample exposure before and after each experiment the system absolute fluence rate was chemically measured by uri actinometry von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 lutze et al 2015 accordingly the obtained average fluence rate e0 was 62 3 μe m 2 s 1 equivalent to 3 mj cm 2 s 1 the available pk a values for cepa are 2 74 carboxyl and 5 13 pyridine for cef the values are 2 68 carboxyl and 3 28 aminothiazole ribeiro and schmidt 2017 considering that speciation of pharmaceuticals can influence their photo transformation canonica et al 2008 avisar et al 2010 baeza and knappe 2011 the cationic zwitterionic and anionic species of cepa and cef fig 1 were investigated therefore several buffer solutions ph 2 to 9 were prepared using adjusted phosphate and sulfuric acid buffers afterwards test solutions were prepared in a 100 ml volumetric flask by adding 5 ml of antibiotic work solution 40 and 80 μm for cef and cepa respectively 5 ml buffer and making up with uw to ensure no interference in the light transmittance through the test tubes all chemicals were studied at low concentration i e cepa 4 μm cef 2 μm buffer 5 mm consequently the initial test solutions presented maximum absorbance below 0 01 cm 1 at wavelengths 200 nm next 50 ml of each test solution were inserted in quartz tubes previously conditioned to 25 0 2 c following 5 ml was sampled after 0 18 36 54 72 and 90 s of uvc exposure finally cephalosporin depletion was determined for every performed condition by hplc dad section 2 5 all experiments and measurements were performed at least in triplicates 2 4 2 photolysis in surface water to study the behavior of cepa and cef during uvc disinfection of water a real matrix was tested radiation experiments were performed as described above section 2 4 1 since the real water matrix rk presented significant light absorption i e 0 045 cm 1 it was necessary to introduce a correction factor for internal fluence rate calculation therefore the morowitz factor katsoyiannis et al 2011 was used to correct the applied fluence rate determined by uri actinometry for comparison the model contaminant atz was used for internal fluence determination according to canonica et al 2008 and lutze et al 2015 in fact both internal and corrected fluence rates showed good agreement fig s3 supplementary information 2 5 analytical methods bicarbonate concentration was determined as alkalinity by 0 01 m sulfuric acid titration using an automatic titrator tiamo metrohm the

results and discussion 3 1 hydrolysis in pure water generally hydrolysis can be categorized as acid catalyzed k a neutral or ph independent k n and base catalyzed k b reaction mabey and mill 1978 schwarzenbach et al 2003 the observed pseudo first order hydrolysis rate constant k obs can be defined as the sum of all reactions following eq 1 1 k o b s k a h k n k b o h in our experiments cepa presented similar hydrolysis rates under acidic and neutral environment fig 2 a from ph 1 3 to 7 1 the mean k obs values were similar table 1 resulting in half life time of days however base catalyzed hydrolysis appeared to be more important fig 2a shows a linear increase of log k obs with ph at ph values above 9 in fact cepa presented low stability at ph 12 half life 10 min while average k obs obtained at ph 7 1 was hundredfold smaller table 1 this result indicates that cepa is rather stable at typical ph values of natural water matrices ph 7 and that acid catalyzed reactions are not significant at ph 2 assuming k n equals the k obs at ph 7 1 schwarzenbach et al 2003 the ph independent rate constant for cepa was derived from eq 1 k n 0 03 10 4 s 1 22 1 c considering that only neutral and base catalyzed hydrolysis take place at ph 9 the k b value for cepa was obtained using the previously calculated k n and rearranging eq 1 therefore the k b calculated for cepa at 22 1 c was 0 14 m 1 s 1 with k n and k b at hand eq 1 could be used for calculating k a for cepa 0 08 10 4 m 1 s 1 finally using k n k a and k b the ph values where two hydrolysis reactions are equally important i mabey and mill 1978 mitchell et al 2014 could be calculated for this purpose eqs 2 4 were used 2 i a n log k a k n 3 i a b 0 5 log k a k b k w 4 i n b log k n k b k w a n b acid catalyzed ph independent and base catalyzed reaction respectively eqs 2 4 gave following results i an 0 5 i ab 4 9 and inb 9 4 therefore at typical ph of natural waters neutral and base catalyzed reactions are the most important for the hydrolysis of this antibiotic in principle other nucleophiles present in a real water matrix may also catalyze hydrolysis of cepa however this was not observed in case of rk water cef and cepa display a similar hydrolysis profile as indicated in fig 2b base catalyzed reactions are the most significant ones in the aqueous transformation of cef however cef showed a faster transformation rate in acid catalyzed hydrolysis than cepa from ph 1 5 to ph 4 2 the obtained half life times were in the range of hours in fact even under neutral conditions cef presented significant hydrolysis rate ph 7 2 k obs 0 06 10 4 s 1 t½ 1 4 days the hydrolytic kinetic parameters for cef can be obtained from table 1 the resulting values of i of cef indicate that at typical ph values of natural water matrices 6 8 base catalyzed reactions are somewhat less important than in case of cepa table 1 this indicates that the effect of other nucleophilic compounds of a natural water have a smaller effect on cef hydrolysis compared to cepa hydrolysis the base catalyzed hydrolysis of several cephalosporins has been reported but in few cases complete hydrolytic kinetic parameters or intersection points have been established these data are important for the understanding and prediction of cephalosporin behavior during analytical procedures in biological systems and in other environmentally relevant matrices analyzing both cephalosporins hydrolysis profiles no visible shoulder caused by dissociation was observed consequently hydrolysis kinetics were not influenced by the speciation of cef and cepa yamana and tsuji 1976 therefore eq 1 was used along with the obtained k n k b and k a values for cepa and cef table 1 to estimate and fit the hydrolysis degradation rate for both compounds at any ph value and 22 1 c the resulting modeled curves are plotted in fig 2 along with measured values the fitted curves readily agree with the experimental data interestingly the model indicates acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cef occurring at ph 3 which confirms the results obtained by berendsen et al 2009 for cepa which displayed a somewhat smaller scattering in the data the fitted curve agrees even better with the measured values to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that hydrolytic kinetics parameters are provided for cepa although the authors did not calculate t1 2 or hydrolysis rate constants berendsen et al 2009 reported similar alkaline catalyzed degradation for cef the degrees of degradation of 100 within 30 min at ph 12 and by 80 within 3 h at ph 11 observed by these authors follow the same tendency as presented in our study table 1 berendsen et al 2009 also investigated ph effects on the degradation of cepa and its major metabolite desacetyl cefapirin dac they reported that cepa and dac were instable at ph above 7 5 what agrees well with our findings however differences were noticed in the available data concerning the neutral and acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cef for example sunkara et al 1999 reported a rate constant of k obs 0 03 10 4 s 1 at ph 5 citric acid nah2po4 buffer and k obs 0 05 10 4 s 1 at ph 7 4 phosphate buffer for cef as shown in table 1 our results at ph 7 2 agree with the data of sunkara et al 1999 but reveal a faster reaction at acidic condition gilbertson et al 1990 also reported on cef hydrolysis and observed a decrease in reaction rates at acidic ph cef half life times of 100 8 and 4 2 days were obtained at 22 c and ph values of 5 7 and 9 respectively gilbertson et al 1990 koshy and cazers 1997 studied cef hydrolysis and products formation upon cephalosporin hydrolysis in a high ionic strength environment desfuroyl ceftiofur dfc was formed in analogy to hydrolysis of thioesters this transformation does not change the bioactive part of cef beta lactam structure hence the biological activity may be preserved after cef hydrolysis koshy and cazers 1997 which may also apply to cepa in analogy to hydrolysis of carbon esters hydroxo cepa and acetic acid may be formed from hydrolysis of the ester group in cepa yamana and tsuji 1976 previous studies investigated the hydrolysis of other cephalosporins in aqueous solution wang and notari 1994 demonstrated that both h and oh are significant for cefuroxime hydrolysis indeed the hydrolysis of cefuroxime s alkyl carbamate group as well as of its beta lactam ring were the major degradation pathways yamana and tsuji 1976 studied the ph dependent hydrolysis kinetics of such 3 acetoxymethylcephalosporins they indicated that in both neutral and alkaline ph the ester moiety is hydrolyzed resulting in high yields of desacetyl intermediates under acidic conditions the desacetyl product is also formed but quickly undergoes lactonization hydrolysis rates of several cephalosporins determined by yamana and tsuji 1976 were very similar to cef also revealing significant acid catalyzed hydrolysis at ph 3 fig 2b besides sharing similar side chain cefaloglycin was more susceptible to base and acid catalyzed hydrolysis than cepa in fact cefaloglycin showed significant stability only in the ph range 2 4 yamana and tsuji 1976 whereas cepa presented similar k obs values at ph 9 fig 2a however it is important to consider that under environmental conditions several other parameters beside ph may influence hydrolysis 3 2 matrix effects on cepa and cef hydrolysis the hydrolytic degradation of cepa and cef was studied using uw and rk as table 1 illustrates cepa presented similar degradation in both matrices for this drug the observed k obs values for uw and rk are in the same range of the ones obtained using buffered solutions and agree with the estimated curve fig 2a consequently matrix composition did not affect cepa hydrolysis at least under our experimental conditions dark 22 1 c 70 μm starting concentration however the results obtained for cef are controversial degradation in unbuffered uw and rk was much slower than the ones exhibited and predicted for similar ph values fig 2b for instance half life times of 30 and 14 7 days were observed in uw ph 6 after antibiotic spiking and rk ph 8 after antibiotic spiking respectively in contrast in phosphate buffer ph 7 2 cef presented t1 2 of 1 4 days li et al 2011 reported a k obs of 0 05 10 4 s 1 for cef hydrolysis in neutral solutions at 25 c this value is very similar to our results using ph 7 2 phosphate buffer i e k obs 0 06 10 4 s 1 but ten times higher than our results using uw water k obs 0 003 10 4 s 1 table 1 sunkara et al 1999 reported 0 007 10 4 s 1 as cef k obs in distilled water 25 c a value in the same range as our results with similar matrix furthermore using phosphate buffer at ph 7 4 and citric acid nah2po4 buffer at ph 5 sunkara et al 1999 obtained k obs 0 046 10 4 s 1 and k obs 0 025 10 4 s 1 respectively these values are very similar to our results with buffers table 1 and confirmed that cef hydrolysis can be influenced by other matrix constituents while cepa was not affected phosphate borate and acetate buffers did not catalyze cefuroxime cefalotin and cefoxitin hydrolysis wang and notari 1994 mitchell et al 2014 in the study of cepa and cef stability during typical sample preparation berendsen et al 2009 indicated the applicability of phosphate buffers ph 7 to quench further degradation likewise the standard guideline for studying the ph dependent hydrolysis oecd 2004 also includes phosphate in the list of suggested buffers the observed scattering of cef degradation kinetics may also result from fluctuations in the baseline of the chromatographic determination of cef which appeared during the analysis of the samples fig s2 supplementary information 3 3 photolysis as a function of speciation speciation of organic compounds can largely affect photo degradation canonica et al 2008 avisar et al 2010 baeza and knappe 2011 hence all relevant species of cepa and cef i e cationic zwitterionic and anionic species were investigated therefore ph was adjusted for achieving predominant presence of each species table 2 further details on speciation of cef and cepa see ribeiro and schmidt 2017 molar absorption coefficient quantum yield and fluence based degradation kinetics for all cef and cepa species are given in table 2 in case of the neutral species other species are also present and can slightly interfere the ph for investigating the neutral species was adjusted in order to minimize these interferences since minor interferences by other species are always possible the term apparent molar absorption coefficient εapp was chosen as suggested by canonica et al 2008 each ionic species was photolyzed using at least two ph values at which these species predominate the apparent pseudo first order rate constant k app for each ionic species was determined using the fluence dose h and ln c t c 0 according to eq 5 5 ln c t c 0 k a p p h as shown in fig 3 cepa cationic and zwitterionic species presented fast and similar transformation rates with t1 2 ranging from 25 to 29 s table 2 in contrast cepa anionic species showed somewhat faster reaction having half life times of 19 and 21 s a small variation 0 001 in the calculated average of k app was observed table 2 demonstrating that cepa s electronic density alteration hardly affects photo transformation moreover all investigated cef species presented very similar transformation rates fig 4 this antibiotic revealed a comparable photolysis rate as cepa with half life times ranging from 23 to 26 s table 2 the k app values of cepa ionic species were statistically compared using anova followed by tukey test and no significant difference was observed p 0 05 the same applies for cef ionic species the apparent quantum yield ф app for each analyzed species at 254 nm was calculated by rearranging eq 6 which describes direct photolytic degradation canonica et al 2008 for that the obtained apparent molar absorption coefficient εapp the average photon fluence rate of the employed photoreactor e0 62 3 μe m 2 s 1 and the time based apparent pseudo first order rate constant tk app in s 1 table s5 supplementary information were used 6 t k a p p 2 303 e 0 ε a p p ф a p p as demonstrated in table 2 the quantum yields for cepa species presented small variation with the mean at ф app 0 146 0 02 mol e 1 for cef the mean apparent quantum yield was 0 087 0 007 mol e 1 as for cepa all studied species of cef showed similar ф app values our results differ from those reported by wang and lin 2012 using a sunlight simulator 290 nm λ 700 nm the authors demonstrated significant ph dependence for cepa photo transformation our results may be explained by the different wavelength used in our experiments considering that sunlight simulators are typically rather weak radiation sources hydrolysis may have also contributed in the observed degradation kinetics derived by wang and lin 2012 this may also explain the observed ph dependency furthermore differences in photo transformation parameters may be also explained by variations of starting concentration matrix characteristics and experimental setup lin and reinhard 2005 using a low pressure lamp of 8 w emitting at 254 nm for treating a sample at ph 7 kim and tanaka 2009 and kim et al 2009 also reported on the direct photo transformation of cef first kim et al 2009 reported a εapp 254 nm of 1466 m2 mol 1 for cef the present study reveals a similar εapp 1850 m2 mol 1 normalizing tk app values by the fluence rate k app e0 tk app e0 allows to assess the efficiency of photo degradation the results of kim and tanaka fairly agree with our data albeit our data suggest a somewhat lower energy demand for photodegradation of cef i e our study k app e0 0 93 10 3 j 1m2 kim and tanaka 2009 k app e0 1 72 10 3 j 1m2 however with both degradation rates 30 of cef will be degraded upon 400 j m 2 which is the uv exposure recommended for water disinfection dvgw 1997 interferences by buffer which can catalyze hydrolysis can be ruled out since the rates observed in our photolytic study were thousandfold higher than the ones observed for hydrolysis k app and εapp can but must not correlate due to the fact that the quantum yield can be affected by speciation of the compound under study canonica et al 2008 in fact analyzing diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and other pharmaceuticals photo transformation baeza and knappe 2011 did not observe clear correlations between εapp and photolytic transformation rates even including quantum yields for comparing the ph dependence of photo kinetics parameters these authors could not observe the patterns suggested by canonica et al 2008 indeed the generated data referring to cepa and cef photolysis compiled in table 2 were also investigated according to the methodology employed by canonica et al 2008 and baeza and knappe 2011 for cef k app and εapp did not significantly change with the ph in contrast for cepa a clear correlation was observed with concomitant increase of εapp and k app fig s5 supplementary information our results with cephalosporins corroborate the results of baeza and knappe 2011 where the authors illustrate that despite structural similarities sulfonamide antibiotics showed different correlations of photo kinetic parameters 3 4 photolysis in surface water in natural waters the presence of photosensitizers and radical scavengers may lead to different photo transformation processes than in uw previous studies indicated significant enhancement of pharmaceutical degradation in surface waters due to indirect photolysis lin and reinhard 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2011 wang and lin 2012 in the present work the photolytic kinetics of cef and cepa spiked in rk were assessed as illustrated in fig 5 photolysis of cef and cepa is not strongly affected by constituents of the water matrix in case of cef hardly any effect of the water matrix can be observed while photolysis of cepa is slightly enhanced by the presence of the water matrix which indicates that photosensitizers where involved in degradation of cepa in rk yet the observed matrix effect on cepa photo oxidation compared to cef cannot be explained however different behaviors in photo oxidation of compounds with similar structures has already been reported baeza and knappe 2011 wang and lin 2012 using sunlight simulator wang and lin 2012 reported a different behavior slower photolysis rate of cepa among several cephalosporins in surface water than in pure water alkalinity and nitrite are indicated as major photosensitizers in surface water schwarzenbach et al 2003 as discussed by katsoyiannis et al 2011 and wang and lin 2012 dissolved organic matter may play a role as both photosensitizer and radical scavenger accordingly the investigated surface water was chemically characterized table s3 both the water matrix investigated by wang and lin 2012 and rk contained photosensitizers albeit in different concentrations however the different outcome of these studies can be explained by the different radiation sources used the uvc radiation from the lp hg arc may more effectively excite aqueous species than the sunlight simulator which emits only a small fraction of uvc radiation 4 conclusions kinetic rates for the hydrolysis and photo transformation of cef and cepa in artificial and natural waters were presented the conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows ph dependent hydrolytic kinetic parameters 22 1 c including intersection points i for cepa and cef have shown that these compounds are relatively stable under neutral and acid environment presenting half life times ranging from 1 4 to 3 days cepa and 1 9 h to 3 7 days cef whereas for both drugs base catalyzed reactions ph 9 led to fast degradation day t½ min photo degradation kinetics under uvc radiation λ 254 nm was not affected by speciation of cepa the same applied for cef ionic species during uv disinfection applying 400 j m 2 cef and cepa was degraded in rk by 32 and 40 respectively acknowledgements arr gratefully acknowledges the scholarship

19708,the use of reclaimed water brings new challenges for the water industry in terms of maintaining water quality while increasing sustainability increased attention has been devoted to opportunistic pathogens especially legionella pneumophila due to its growing importance as a portion of the waterborne disease burden in the united states infection occurs when a person inhales a mist containing legionella bacteria the top three uses for reclaimed water cooling towers spray irrigation and toilet flushing that generate aerosols were evaluated for legionella health risks in reclaimed water using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra risks are compared using data from nineteen united states reclaimed water utilities measured with culture based methods quantitative pcr qpcr and ethidium monoazide qpcr median toilet flushing annual infection risks exceeded 10 4 considering multiple toilet types while median clinical severity infection risks did not exceed this value sprinkler and cooling tower risks varied depending on meteorological conditions and operational characteristics such as drift eliminator performance however the greatest differences between risk scenarios were due to 1 the dose response model used infection or clinical severity infection 2 population at risk considered residential or occupational and 3 differences in laboratory analytical method theoretical setback distances necessary to achieve a median annual infection risk level of 10 4 are proposed for spray irrigation and cooling towers in both cooling tower and sprinkler cases legionella infection risks were non trivial at potentially large setback distances and indicate other simultaneous management practices could be needed to manage risks the sensitivity analysis indicated that the most influential factors for variability in risks were the concentration of legionella and aerosol partitioning and or efficiency across all models highlighting the importance of strategies to manage legionella occurrence in reclaimed water graphical abstract image 1 keywords reclaimed water quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra legionella pneumophila cooling towers toilet flushing spray irrigation 1 introduction growing global water scarcity has intensified the need to recover water resources from wastewater especially as population growth economic development and urbanization increase pressures on existing water supplies levine and asano 2004 reclaimed water can alleviate stress on municipal water systems and augment existing water portfolios however there is the potential for health risks from human contact with contaminants in reclaimed water through dermal contact inhalation or ingestion during various water use activities agricultural and industrial water reuse represent the sectors with the largest reclaimed water usage in the united states jiménez and asano 2008 reclaimed water for cooling system purposes further represents the largest industrial water reuse application metcalf and eddy 2007 cooling systems may consume 20 50 of a facility s water usage aoki et al 2005 common uses of reclaimed water such as spray irrigation or cooling towers can produce aerosols that are of concern because contaminants can travel beyond the immediate vicinity of application li et al 2011 additionally toilet flushing has been identified as a top use of recycled water in a survey of ten united states recycled water systems jjemba et al 2015 lechevallier et al 2017 toilet flushing can also generate aerosols that can potentially be associated with health risks fewtrell and kay 2007 gerba et al 1975 hamilton et al 2017 together spray irrigation 90 respondents cooling towers 50 respondents and toilet flushing 30 respondents comprise the top three uses of recycled water identified in the survey jjemba et al 2015 lechevallier et al 2017 to date no documented infectious disease outbreaks have been reported in association with reclaimed water and epidemiological studies have focused primarily on potential fecal pathogen associated health risks durand and schwebach 1989 sheikh et al 1990 ward et al 1989 without finding evidence of increased risk one recent study of irrigation workers exposed to reclaimed water showed higher colonization with staphylococcus and enterococcus bacteria compared to office workers although this difference was not significant goldstein et al 2014 however concerns exist regarding opportunistic pathogens such as legionella non tuberculous mycobacteria ntm pseudomonas aeruginosa stenotrophomas maltophila staphylococcus aureus and acanthamoeba spp especially as alternative non potable routes of exposure are more relevant for reclaimed water use the chemistry of reclaimed water is distinct from that of potable water with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter and nutrients known to occur in reclaimed water systems associated with enhanced microbial growth garner et al 2016 intermittent usage of reclaimed water may also result in higher water age opportunistic pathogens can grow at low organic carbon concentrations and are particularly prone to growth in water environments with high water age and biofilm growth where free living amoeba found in biofilms can enhance pathogen resistance to disinfectants growth persistence and virulence cooper and hanlon 2010 kirschner et al 1992 thomas et al 2010 although fully functioning water reuse treatment may be sufficiently robust to be protective for fecal pathogen risks chaudhry et al 2017 it is not yet known whether the same is true for opportunistic pathogens legionella is one of the most significant opportunistic waterborne pathogens as it is responsible for a substantial portion of the united states waterborne disease burden beer et al 2015 infection with legionella can cause the pneumonia like illness legionnaires disease or a milder form of infection known as pontiac fever fields et al 2002 it is known to occur in engineered water systems including cooling towers ahmadrajabi et al 2016 wastewater treatment facilities allestam et al 2006 fernandez cassi et al 2016 pascual et al 2003 sánchez monedero et al 2008 walser et al 2017 ambient water environments fliermans et al 1979 and soils amemura maekawa et al 2012 wallis and robinson 2005 legionella spp grow in biofilms in piping and can slough off and become aerosolized through water fixtures at which point human exposure can occur aerosol production of legionella is a particular concern as outbreaks have been associated with exposure to aerosols generated by cooling towers castilla et al 2008 george et al 2016 nguyen et al 2006 walser et al 2014 weiss et al 2017 wastewater treatment facilities gregersen et al 1999 kusnetsov et al 2010 olsen et al 2010 decorative fountains haupt et al 2012 and other common water uses hines et al 2014 for this reason it is warranted to investigate the potential for elevated risks from exposure to legionella in reclaimed water few studies have quantified legionella in reclaimed water jjemba et al 2010 palmer et al 1995 and a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has not yet been performed for legionella for exposures to reclaimed water the qmra framework integrates information regarding pathogen occurrence infectivity and exposure for determining the health implications of microbial hazards using a process of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization haas et al 2014 to inform appropriate usages of reclaimed water and identify factors which have the greatest implication for best management practices a qmra is presented for scenarios of toilet flushing spray irrigation and cooling tower generated aerosols additionally due to the availability and practice of using different laboratory detection methods to enumerate legionella spp risks were also assessed using a comparison of three common detection methods culture based methods ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction ema qpcr and qpcr culture based methods quantify viable culturable cells colony forming units cfu per l ema qpcr quantifies gene copies from cells with an intact cell membrane and is intended to represent the concentration of viable cells as measured in gene copies per l delgado viscogliosi et al 2005 mansi et al 2014 qin et al 2012 typically a qmra will seek to use data that are most representative of viable infectious microorganisms however these data are not always available for a particular situation and it is not uncommon for qmras to rely upon qpcr data when viability and infectivity information is not available each detection method has its drawbacks whiley and taylor 2014 and there is currently no consensus regarding the implications of using datasets generated with varying methods on resulting health risks therefore an additional objective of this work was to quantify the impacts of laboratory detection method on qmra estimates using concentrations generated using all three methods culture ema qpcr qpcr from a large national study of legionella occurrence 2 materials and methods 2 1 exposure models three exposure scenarios of toilet flushing spray irrigation and cooling tower generated aerosols were considered using a previously derived framework for legionella risks hamilton and haas 2016 legionella was considered to be present in reclaimed water at concentrations measured in a comprehensive national legionella occurrence study by johnson et al 2017 with aerosols generated at rates specific to each process modeled not all aerosols released from a given activity will reach a receptor while possessing droplet diameters within the respirable range aerosol particles of median diameters between 1 and 10 μm were considered respirable for all three exposure scenarios as legionella is typically 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide and particles greater than 10 μm are not likely to reach the lower respiratory tract baron and willeke 1986 metcalf and eddy 2007 where available information was used regarding how the bacteria partitions from bulk water to aerosol and pathogen decay was considered during transport through air to a receptor most large aerosol droplets are trapped in the nasopharyngeal region and smaller particles are able to travel to the alveoli where legionella infection is initiated and behaves according to an exponential dose response model human exposure patterns for each scenario were taken into account to annualize risks where necessary data from published graphs necessary for aerosol calculations were extracted using alcasa digitize it v 4 2 0 2 1 1 toilet flushing three qmra methods were compared to assess infection risks from toilet flushing with multiple common toilet types johnson et al 2013 o toole et al 2009 the use of either a partitioning coefficient pc armstrong and haas 2007b 2008 azuma et al 2013 medema

dose lim et al 2015 are accepted qmra practices for modeling aerosol inhalation exposures therefore both the pc method 1 and aerosol dose method 2 and 3 methods are assessed and compared using two available datasets for toilet aerosol size distributions johnson et al 2013 o toole et al 2009 method 2 and 3 method 1 for toilet flushing is modified from the qmra exposure model of schoen and ashbolt 2011 originally developed for showering and relying on the use of a pc as per equation 1 aerosols generated with the pc were only considered for sizes between 1 and 4 μm due to the upper bound pc used the pc was derived from a study by darlow and bale 1959 and analyzed by hines et al 2014 indicating that 87 of produced aerosols were less than 4 μm in diameter with no size information about other aerosol sizes produced the study used for the lower bound estimate by barker and jones 2005 did not indicate the size of aerosols produced and the same aerosol size fraction 87 between 1 and 4

al 2012 the goal of this work was to develop a generalized model for long range transport with reclaimed water containing legionella under a range of meteorological conditions that does not rely upon intensive site specific information the concentration of legionella downwind from an aerosol emitting source is dependent upon the concentration of legionella in the originating reclaimed water transport and dispersion deposition wet and dry evaporation and bacterial viability as a function of environmental conditions these factors are incorporated into a gaussian plume atmospheric transport

potential to slough off pipe surfaces was suspended in the bulk water at the time of sampling therefore legionella in bulk water represent 100 of legionella available for aerosolization 10 the fate of bacteria in individual aerosols is not tracked however it is acknowledged here that larger aerosols in the starting distribution are likely to contain more bacteria and therefore result in higher concentration aerosols downstream than expected in some aerosols of smaller diameter blatny et al 2011 11 enrichment of the aerosolized water with bacteria compared to the bulk water is not considered 12 reclaimed water is not blended with any other water source prior to use the plume model accounts for dispersion but not the fraction of aerosols within the respirable size range which is of crucial concern for legionella inhalation 1 10 μm to obtain this fraction the approach of hardy et al 2006 was used considering the mass weighted fraction of aerosols likely to become fully evaporated as those that are 100 μm in diameter and the fine mist fraction as those droplets with diameters 100 200 μm in diameter represented in the model as q i s aerosols larger than 400 μm settled at distances 50 m and were therefore assumed to settle at close range for both sprinklers and cooling towers and were not included in the model it was assumed that all droplets with an initial diameter of 200 μm would reach a diameter of 10 μm or less by the time they reached the downwind receptor 2 2 legionella concentrations for all models concentrations of legionella in reclaimed water c leg were computed from a national study johnson et al 2017 according to equation 8 8 c l e g 1 r c r w f l p where c leg corrected concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water or drinking water r recovery efficiency c rw concentration of legionella spp measured in reclaimed water or drinking water c dw and f lp fraction of legionella spp in the analytical method identified as legionella pneumophila because some samples did not have any detectable legionella i e were below the limit of detection interval censored distributions were fit to concentration data using the package fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 in r v 3 1 1 www rproject org whereby non detect observations were censored between zero and the detection limit 2 3 dose response and risk characterization the daily probability of each endpoint was calculated using the exponential dose response model for l pneumophila equation 9 armstrong and haas 2007a haas et al 1999 two dose response models were used for infection corresponding to subclinical infection or potentially a pontiac fever endpoint or clinical severity infection corresponding to an infection requiring a clinical visit table 2 9 p i n f 1 e r d where p inf is the probability of infection or clinical illness per event r is the probability of the bacteria bypassing the host defenses and initiating a given response and d is the dose of legionella at the target organ alveoli annual risk was calculated as per equation 10 10 p i n f a n n u a l 1 1 n f 1 p i n f where f is the daily frequency of the activity flushing a toilet spray irrigation application or being present outside near a cooling tower and n is the yearly frequency a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify variables contributing to uncertainty using 10 000 monte carlo iterations all computations were performed in r and using the mc2d package pouillot and delignette muller 2010 the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to identify the most important predictive factors of annual infection or clinical severity infection risk where 0 is no influence and 1 or 1 when the output is wholly dependent on that input the model inputs were ranked based on their correlation coefficient with the output variable annual risk 3 results 3 1 legionella concentrations in reclaimed water concentrations of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water were modeled using lognormal distributions based on data for legionella spp provided in johnson et al 2017 for nineteen united states reclaimed water systems table 7 some data were generated during a snapshot screening using a culture based assay after which six of the nineteen were sampled quarterly following the initial reconnaissance survey using three methods culture ema qpcr and qpcr a summary of the six utilities chosen for follow up sampling is provided in supplemental table s1 a total of 153 culture based samples 115 ema qpcr samples and 115 qpcr samples were considered production at the six plants chosen for follow up ranged from 14 000 to 75 000 000 gpd and the plants used two disinfectant types free chlorine and chloramine forty six percent of samples had disinfectant residuals below 1 mg l and 79 of samples had residuals below 0 2 mg l legionella spp was quantified in the effluent storage reservoir and three locations in the distribution system coded 1 2 and 3 using three analytical methods culture ema qpcr and qpcr all locations effluent storage reservoir and distribution system locations 1 2 and 3 were pooled for generating the distributions ninety six percent of legionella spp detected using the culture based assay and 52 of legionella spp gene copies were determined to be l pneumophila this ratio was used to correct legionella spp concentrations obtained from each method the recovery efficiency of the membrane filtration method reported and used in the current study was 70 18 6 mean sd 3 2 toilet flushing 3 2 1 literature review to define toilet flushing parameters method 1 an upper bound pc derived by hines et al 2014 1 3 10 6 cfu m 3 cfu l 1 and lower bound pc calculated from a controlled toilet flushing experiment using gram negative bacteria serratia marcesens nctc 10211 were used barker and jones 2005 barker and jones 2005 seeded toilets with 1010 bacteria on the toilet sidewalls and flushed 5 min after applying the inoculum the bulk toilet water contained 108 cfu ml serratia prior to flushing bacterial air samples were collected 20 cm above and 30 cm in front of the toilet after flushing and a maximum concentration of 1370 527 cfu m3 in air was detected 1 min after the flush resulting in a pc of 1 37 10 8 cfu m 3 cfu l 1 the aerosol size information was not given and the authors suggest that based on the type of air sampling used size ranges were likely to be above 20 μm indicating the assumption of darlow and bale 1959 may have been conservative in equation 1 the calculated pc is

more appropriate surrogate than ms 2 coliphage tested in the study due to its size and similarities with legionella moore et al 2015 a lower generation rate of bacteria containing aerosol is expected for toilet flushing due to the less active generation process than for showering or aerated hot spring spas it is assumed the decay in aerosol for toilet flushing is negligible over a 1 5 min exposure event directly after flushing for toilet flushing exposure frequency a mean of 5 05 flushes per day was used from a study of 22 municipalities water utilities water purveyors water districts and water providers mayer and deoreo 1999 table 2 the deposition efficiency fraction for aerosols of diameter i μm was derived from heyder et al 1986 for a breathing rate of 15 l air min an 8 s breathing cycle and 1 l of tidal volume table 3 ranges were specified using the nasal and oral deposition rates as the upper and lower bound respectively the fraction f i of legionella that partitions into various aerosol sizes after transitioning from bulk water to aerosol during a toilet flush was assumed based on an aerosol partitioning dataset from allegra et al 2016 allegra et al 2016 used a nebulizer to generate aerosols containing l pneumophila and measured the percentage of total bacteria measured using qpcr in aerosols of various sizes table 3 values extracted from original reference fig 4 the distribution of the volume of water inhaled according to method 1 was lognormally distributed with parameters 20 9 1 07 corresponding to a mean of 1 49 10 9 l reaching the alveoli method 2 a toilet experiment by o toole et al 2009 used a caroma uniset cistern model p n 213012 and pan model p n 601200w operated at full capacity for either 9 l 4 5 l for full half flush aerosols ranging from 0 06 to 20 μm were measured however aerosols were only observed in the 2 3 μm size bin and none of the other 3 10 μm bins for a single toilet flush no aerosols were observable for a half flush the deposition efficiency fraction for aerosols of diameter 3 μm was used from heyder et al 1986 the distribution of the volume of water inhaled according to method 2 was lognormally distributed with parameters 26 3 1 95 corresponding to a mean of 2 53 10 11 l reaching the alveoli method 3 a toilet experiment by johnson et al 2013 used four types of toilets including a pre fepa gravity flow toilet 13 3 lpf a dual flush high efficiency toilet het 3 8 or 4 9 lpf a dual flush pressure assisted gravity flow toilet pat 4 2 or 4 9 lpf and a flushometer fom toilet 5 3 lpf data were available for 1 10 μm size mass median aerodynamic diameters mmad and were digitally extracted and averaged across toilet types from johnson et al 2013 fig 6 in the johnson paper and converted to a fraction of the total particles generated of each size mmad using 10y 100 table 4 the fraction was applied to the total generation of particles flush and sampling volume m3 averaged over the flush conditions table 3 each size mmad was corrected for its corresponding alveolar deposition efficiency the distribution of the volume of water inhaled according to method 3 was lognormally distributed with parameters 24 4 0 688 corresponding to a mean of 3 21 10 11 l reaching the alveoli 3 2 2 toilet flushing risk results three exposure model methodologies were used to compute the annual risk of infection and severe clinical infection from exposure to reclaimed water during toilet flushing annual risks for method 1 were highest followed by method 3 and method 2 annual risks for infection infection endpoint dose response model inf and clinical severity infection csi are shown in fig 1 median annual risks of infection and csi using culture based legionella concentration data ranged from 2 95 10 6 method 2 to 3 82 10 4 method 1 and 3 20 10 9 method 2 to 4 11 10 7 method 1 respectively fig 1 using ema qpcr legionella concentration data median annual risks for infection and clinical severity infection ranged from 2 07 10 5 method 2 to 2 75 10 3 method 1 and 2 56 10 8 method 2 to 3 00 10 6 method 1 respectively for qpcr legionella concentration data median annual risks for infection and clinical severity infection ranged from 8 52 10 5 method 2 to 1 06 10 2 method 1 and 1 02 10 7 method 2 to 1 17 10 5 method 1 respectively the 95th percentiles for annual infection risks ranged from 4 08 10 4 method 2 to 2 72 10 2 method 1 for culture 5 69 10 3 method 2 to 2 59 10 1 method 1 for ema qpcr and 2 23 10 2 method 2 to 7 41 10 1 method 1 for qpcr the 95th percentiles for annual clinical severity infection risks ranged from 4 60 10 7 method 2 to 2 58 10 5 method 1 for culture 6 40 10 6 method 2 to 3 19 10 4 method 1 for ema qpcr and 2 70 10 5 method 2 to 1 38 10 3 method 1 for qpcr if compared to the usepa annual infection benchmark of 10 4 infections per person per year for drinking water median annual infection risks infection dose response endpoint exceeded this value for method 1 culture based and method 3 qpcr using a clinical severity infection dose response endpoint no calculated models exceeded this value the 95th percentile annual infection risks exceeded 10 4 for all methods the 95th percentile clinical severity risks exceeded 10 4 for method 1 ema qpcr and qpcr for all methods the concentration of legionella in reclaimed water was the most important predictive factor of the final estimate of annual risk of either infection or clinical severity infection fig 2 spearman rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0 71 to 0 94 the large ranges of annual risks observed are therefore likely due to variability in this factor for method 1 the partitioning coefficient was the next most important factor and for method 2 the concentration of aerosols c aer 2 5 was the next most important factor for all models exposure time t dose response variable r and exposure frequency f were also important factors 3 3 long range dispersion models 3 3 1 literature review for spray irrigation parameters reclaimed water may be applied through a variety of mechanisms producing varying degrees of aerosols ranging from minimal drip irrigation to substantial spray irrigation it is assumed here that spray irrigation with reclaimed water would take place via a stationary sprinkler system and could therefore be considered a point source sprinkler heights are all 1 m for commonly used sprinkler systems for reclaimed water table 5 jjemba et al 2015 however the plume model was considered to commence from the maximum height of the spray stream the maximum stream height value of 6 m reported across the commonly used sprinklers in table 5 was used the distance required to reach the apex of the sprinkler stream 25 m was added to estimates for sprinkler setback distances reported in the text the sprinkler efficiency is the portion of initially sprayed water that leaves the immediate vicinity of the spray irrigation system as aerosols including aqueous aerosols and evaporated droplets usepa 1982 the efficiency for low pressure smooth plate sprinklers ranged from 0 5 to 1 4 percent kohl 1974 inhalable aerosol size fractions q i were reported by hardy et al 2006 for various sprinklers the largest fractions for rainbird sprinkler nozzles were chosen table 6 the fine mist fraction was evenly divided into ten bins with mmad i 1 10 to estimate the portion of downstream aerosols 10 μm decay rates specific to evaporation or aqueous transport were applied separately for these portions of the total downstream aerosol load a uniform distribution of residential exposures to spray irrigation activities was determined from estimates derived from australian guidelines for water reuse ranging from 81 to 99 inhalation exposures per year chhipi shrestha et al 2017 nrmmc 2008 occupational exposures were assumed to be similar to those estimated in a study of biosolids application accounting for daily year round exposures to biosolids for a total of 255 exposures per year brooks et al 2005a 2012 this accounts for a 5 day work week with one week absent from exposure residential exposures were assumed to occur for 1 h during each exposure event brooks et al 2005a 2012 while occupational exposures were assumed to occur during a standard 8 h work shift 255 days per year as anything over an 8 h shift can be considered an extended or unusual shift osha 2017 3 3 2 literature review for cooling tower parameters the principal categories for cooling water systems are once through non contact cooling recirculation non contact cooling and direct contact cooling metcalf and eddy 2007 the majority of cooling water systems that use reclaimed water are recirculating non contact systems metcalf and eddy 2007 in recirculating non contact systems warmed water from a cooling operation or heat exchanger is cooled by transferring its heat to air through evaporation in a cooling tower warm water from process cooling is sprayed on the top of the internal packing used to break up the water through spray into droplets to enhance air water contact cool dry outside air is pulled up through the cooling tower by a large rotating fan to cool the warm water through evaporation water is removed by blowdown or purge and small amounts of water capable of carrying microorganisms are also lost by drift typical water loss from drift is assumed to be 0 001 0 005 of the total recirculating water ashrae 2004 however it is noted that this loss rate could be higher for older designs or certain choices of drift eliminator up to 0 1 lucas et al 2012 both typical 0 003 0 005 and high drift 0 01 0 1 conditions were simulated to examine their impact on annual health risks for cooling towers the mass weighted proportions of aerosols 100 and 100 200 μm were calculated by simulating a lognormal distribution specified by peterson and lighthart 1977 with a geometric mean of 230 1 59 μm arithmetic mean sd of 256 125 μm the design and operating conditions of recirculating cooling water towers vary widely selby et al 1996 the flow rate of total recirculating water is a parameter designed using performance curves specific to a given set of equipment and process being served to achieve a desired range of thermal capability of the cooling tower given set of operating conditions entering water temperature leaving water temperature and entering air wet bulb temperature ashrae 2004 the entering air wet bulb temperature required system temperature level cooling tower size and number of cells will balance the heat rejected at a specific approach difference between leaving water temperature and entering air wet bulb temperature ashrae 2004 the cooling tower size is a function of these factors as well as the quantity of water to be cooled the air velocity through the cell and the tower height zhang et al 2012 therefore it is challenging to designate a set of typical operating conditions for use within a qmra it is assumed for simplicity in this model that larger heat loads necessitate larger towers which in turn require larger quantities of recirculated water several studies report flow rates per cell for large up to 100 m stack height cooling towers of approximately 103 104 l s adams et al 1978 1980 chen and hanna 1978 cooling towers of heights 10 m and 100 m were simulated with flow rates of 102 103 l s and 103 104 l s respectively table 6 it was assumed conservatively that operation occurred continuously and therefore could result in potential exposures 365 days per year for residential exposures bhopal and barr 1990 residential exposures were assumed to occur for 1 h during each exposure event brooks et al 2005a 2012 while occupational exposures were assumed to occur during a standard 8 h work shift 255 days per year osha 2017 3 3 3 decay rates several studies have examined legionella decay in aerosol as a function of relative humidity and seeding matrix as well as bacteria strain type and source berendt 1980 1981 dennis and lee 1988 hambleton et al 1983 legionella survival generally increases as the ambient relative humidity increases and it survives particularly well at intermediate 65 relative humidity however this relationship is not linear and zones of instability are present legionella generally survived better in suspensions containing algal extracts compared to tryptose saline hambleton et al 1983 held l pneumophila 74 81 at various relative humidity for 15 min before aerosolizing them in a 3 jet collision nebulizer the organisms survived best at 65 rh and worst at 55 survival was also high at 90 and 80 relative humidity therefore 65 80 and 90 relative humidities were chosen for modeling scenarios values were extracted from published graphs and decay constants were obtained by plotting log concentration versus time for two sets of experiments using water spray in hambleton et al table 6 two other studies examined legionella survival in aerosolized culture broth berendt 1980 dennis and lee 1988 and were used as lower bounds on the decay estimates at each humidity only one study examined the decay of dried legionella for use with the evaporated mass fraction katz and hammel 1987 legionella pneumophila philadelphia 1 strain was dried for 90 min a four log drop in viability was observed during the first 30 s followed by a more gradual decline biphasic decay values were derived by converting percent recovery to a concentration and plotting log concentration versus time the higher decay rate was applied for up to the first 30 s after the average total evaporation time while the lower decay rate was applied from t 30 s to downstream time t where applicable no study was available that simultaneously examined microbial decay impacts of rh and solar exposure on legionella a study by paez rubio and peccia 2005 allowed for parsing out of decay attributable to solar exposure versus other factors in aerosol at two rh ranges for e coli another gram negative bacteria the solar induced inactivation rate was used for both moderate rh of 50 60 with mean se inactivation of 1 00 10 3 3 42 10 3 s 1 n 5 and high rh of 85 95 with mean se inactivation of 2 17 10 3 8 70 10 4 s 1 n 5 these decay rates were applied in addition to the non solar decay rates at each rh where the moderate rh was applied with the 65 rh non solar decay and the high rh was applied with the 80 and 90 rh non solar decay data were not available for the impact of solar inactivation on legionella in droplets that evaporated therefore these decay fractions were applied to both the aqueous and evaporated fractions solar decay was assumed at every time t because exposure times were assumed to happen when people were present during daylight hours 3 4 cooling tower risk results annual health risks from exposure to aerosols from cooling towers were modeled for 4 pasquil stability classes a through d corresponding to wind speeds ranging from 1 to 7 m s 3 humidity values with corresponding solar decay values 65 80 and 90 2 stack heights 10 m and 100 m 2 dose response endpoints infection clinical severity infection 3 methods culture ema qpcr and qpcr and 2 exposure durations frequencies residential occupational at various downwind distances from 50 to 10 000 m a comparison of annual infection risks for residential populations with various combinations of wind speed and relative humidity parameters for culturable legionella is shown in supplemental fig s1 changing meteorological conditions did not have as important of an impact on risk as the other modeled factors generally as wind speed increases aerosols are carried farther and annual risks peak farther away from the cooling tower although legionella is more stable at 65 and 90 relative humidity than at 80 this does not have as great an impact on annual risk of infection as changing the wind speed legionella is carried farthest at the highest wind speed 7 m s and a relative humidity of 65 using this most conservative set of meteorological parameters a comparison of annual risks for infection and clinical severity infection at two stack heights and all three analytical methods are shown for residential and occupational populations in figs 3 6 peak risks occur downwind from the source as some time must pass for the plume to reach human breathing height annual risks from qpcr are highest followed by ema qpcr and culture based assays annual clinical severity infection risks are up to 2 5 orders of magnitude lower than annual infection risks at a given downwind distance occupational risks were up to one log higher than residential risks in addition both types of annual infection risks peak further downstream for stack heights of 100 m compared to 10 m if the usepa 10 4 annual infection risk target for drinking water is used for comparison to 95th percentiles from the cooling tower annual infection risk infection dose response endpoint distribution the setback distance for both residential and occupational populations with a 10 m or 100 m tall cooling tower would be 5 000 m with no other risk mitigation actions figs 3 6 for a median comparison point distances for a 10 m cooling tower would range from 500 m culturable to 3 500 m qpcr using a clinical severity infection dose response endpoint and stack height of 10 m setback distances for residential populations would cover a large range depending on the concentration detection method and percentile for comparison used using a 95th percentile for comparison the setback distance would be less than 50 m for culturable 500 m for ema qpcr or 1000 m for qpcr fig 3 for occupational populations these corresponding distances would be 50 m 1000 m and 2500 m respectively fig 5 if median annual clinical severity risks for a stack height of 10 m are compared to the 10 4 benchmark no residential or occupational models exceed this value the results of the sensitivity analysis for cooling towers are shown in fig 7 regardless of the detection method used the concentration of legionella in reclaimed water was the most important predictive factor of the final estimate of annual infection or clinical severity infection risk spearman rank correlation coefficient ranging from 0 81 to 0 89 the cooling tower circulating water flow rate dose response parameter and cooling tower drift efficiency were the next most influential factors owing to variation in the efficiency of various drift eliminators a comparison of typical operating conditions of 0 001 0 005 and less effective drift eliminator conditions which might be typical of an older pre 1970 s cooling tower of 0 01 0 1 are presented in supplemental fig s2 a higher efficiency drift eliminator can decrease risks by 1 1 5 logs highlighting this factor as an important potential management strategy 3 5 spray irrigation risk results a comparison of annual infection and clinical severity infection risks for the most conservative set of meteorological conditions is shown in figs 8 and 9 for sprinklers a stack height of 6 m was used corresponding to the highest point of the sprinkler spray arc for this reason figs 8 9 should be interpreted as distance downwind from the horizontal distance at which the maximum height of the arc occurs this distance has a maximum length of 24 4 m table 5 and is included in setback distance estimates below generally sprinkler risks were lower than cooling tower risks for annual infection residential population risks setback distances would range from 1 025 m culture based assay to 10 000 m qpcr based assay from the sprinkler under conservative meteorological conditions conditions that promote legionella dispersion of 7 m s windspeed and 65 rh and using a 95th percentile for comparison if no other risk mitigation strategies are applied these distances would be between 75 m culturable and 625 m qpcr based using median values for comparison 95th percentile annual clinical severity residential population risks were 10 4 for culture based and ema qpcr methods but not for qpcr corresponding to 225 m setback distance occupational annual infection risks indicate a setback distance 5 025 m culture based or 10 000 m ema qpcr or qpcr based and occupational clinical severity risks correspond to distances ranging from 75 m culture based to 1 225 m qpcr based using a 95th percentile comparison and 75 m using a median comparison the sprinkler sensitivity analysis shown in fig 7 also highlights the concentration of legionella in reclaimed water as the primary factor that influences annual infection estimates the sprinkler flow rate and aerosol efficiency were the next most influential parameters and the dose response parameter was also an important factor 4 discussion a qmra is presented here for legionella infection risks during toilet flushing spray irrigation and cooling tower mist inhalation with reclaimed water three toilet flushing exposure models were compared using different analytical methods and dose response endpoints a modified gaussian plume dispersion model was used to compare risks for different analytical methods meteorological conditions exposure types dose response endpoints and downwind distances for sprinkler and cooling tower risks two operation conditions for informing cooling tower risk management were explored these options were varying the stack height and aerosolization efficiency for cooling towers moderate differences in annual infection and clinical severity risks were observed across the three methods culturable ema qpcr qpcr used to detect legionella for each scenario this resulted in 1 2 orders of magnitude differences in median annual infection or clinical severity infection risks across models however risk estimates for ema qpcr and qpcr had higher values than risk estimates using the culture based data this difference matters when choosing between percentiles to compare to the target or benchmark value in order to derive a setback distance for example large differences up to 3 orders of magnitude across scenarios were observed when using an infection versus a clinical severity infection dose response model with the infection model resulting in higher risks lesser differences were observed in the cooling tower and sprinkler models at any downwind distance due to residential versus occupational exposure 1 2 order difference or raising the stack height up to 2 orders of magnitude difference with peak risks occurring further downwind changes in meteorological parameters varied between models based on downwind distances with high 7 m s wind speed and 65 relative humidity resulting in the highest risk estimates these findings indicate that differences between risk scenarios versus the sensitivity analyses that identify important factors within a single scenario are most largely influenced by the selection of a dose response model infection or clinical severity infection followed by the exposure model used toilet flushing only exposure duration cooling tower and sprinkler only residential or occupational and method culture based ema qpcr or qpcr used to quantify legionella in the water sources annual infection or clinical severity infection risks greater than a tentative 10 4 annual infection benchmark value for drinking water were observed for certain cases in all three exposure scenarios depending on the conditions for toilet flushing method 2 was the least conservative producing lower risk estimates overall and method 1 was the most conservative resulting in higher risk estimates overall this is likely due to the use of a pc in method 1 which measured the ratio of bacterial concentrations in air and water this indicates there is some discrepancy when comparing results computed using a pc versus computing bacterial concentrations in each size range based on an aerosol size distribution both approaches require assumptions to be made when assessing how legionella is partitioned in aerosol more experimental measurements are needed to validate these approaches to determine the relative strengths of each approach the risks associated with toilet flushing may be somewhat mitigated by recommending reclaimed water users put the lid down prior to flushing however some studies noted that closing the toilet lid did not have a substantial effect on mitigating the spread of aerosols barker and jones 2005 bound and atkinson 1966 the cooling tower and sprinkler models indicate that legionella containing aerosols can be carried long distances in sufficient quantities to present health risks above 10 4 annual probability of infection or clinical severity infection these findings are consistent with previous studies that have predicted long range transport of legionella and observed distances between outbreak cases and implicated cooling towers up to 12 km away borgen et al 2008 nygård et al 2008 rouil et al 2004 walser et al 2014 however these large spreads were likely attributed to hot weather and high humidity or rare events such as thermal inversions chan and iseman 2013 fisman et al 2005 in many cases outbreaks were also associated with inadequate maintenance of cooling tower systems such as lack of regular inspection faulty dosing pumps suboptimal disinfection high pressure cleaning intermittent operation modes and restarting of cooling towers walser et al 2014 depending on the model conditions selected the setback distances associated with a 10 4 annual risk could be quite large the setback distance was highly sensitive to the legionella detection method used as a result additional risk mitigation strategies are likely to be warranted to decrease the setback distance needed interventions such as windbreaks using trees or walls around irrigation areas could also reduce risks information is not currently available regarding the degree to which microorganisms are removed due to these interventions risks from cooling towers can be reduced by utilizing towers built with a lower stack height and efficient drift eliminators lucas et al 2012 the simulations performed here demonstrate that a less effective drift system can increase risks 1 1 5 logs although higher stack heights have slightly lower annual risks than lower stack heights throughout the zone of influence higher stack heights result in farther transport of aerosols and therefore could result in higher setback distances in some cases a lower stack height reduces the distance aerosols can travel an effective stack height for cooling towers would be higher than the actual stack height used for simulation here due to the effects of plume rise which occurs because the plume is hotter than the surrounding air and rises buoyantly as it exits the stack with a vertical velocity thomson et al 2013a in the current simulations plume rise was not considered in order to calculate plume rise it is necessary to obtain specific information regarding the stack height exit velocity stack diameter and temperature of exiting water vapor obtaining such specific information about the cooling tower was beyond the scope of the current simulations additional guidance documents suggest that stagnant water nutrient growth including the presence of biofilms poor overall microbiological water quality cooling tower deficiencies inadequate maintenance poor design or a location of the system that results in large exposures and or exposures to immune compromised populations are risk factors for legionella outbreaks ashrae 2015 cdc 2016 department of health and human services 2015 sharvelle et al 2017 measures such as treatment before initial startup following commissioning or any extended shutdown period periodic inspection and monitoring restriction of access to the cooling tower use of drift eliminators bleed off to prevent solids accumulation protection from sunlight training cooling tower employees in health and safety practices use of hazard analysis and critical control points haccp methodology and or documenting all strategies for planning monitoring controlling and responding to issues that arise conducting independent audits and installing automatic biocide dosing devices can mitigate some of these risks ashrae 2015 cdc 2016 department of health and human services 2015 sharvelle et al 2017 generally sprinkler risks were lower than cooling tower risks most likely due to the smaller fraction of fine aerosols generated lower dispersion height and lower water flow rate for the low pressure low profile sprinklers modeled annual clinical severity infection risks were 10 4 for most scenarios with setback distances 75 m if considering annual infection risks setback distances could increase substantially beyond 75 m the sprinkler simulation was initiated at the apex of the spray arc as such the velocity propelling droplets in the x direction was not considered which may cause larger droplets to be propelled further distances this factor could result in actual dispersion distances being greater than those used in the qmra and therefore larger required setback distances in addition to using low profile and low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems like the ones specified in this report nozzles with larger orifices will reduce the formation of fine mist subsurface or drip irrigation would minimize drift formation but can incur higher initial investment costs thomson et al 2013b although increasing the droplet size distribution for sprinklers mitigates legionella risk reliance on larger droplets may increase erosion risk for fragile soils due to the greater kinetic energies associated with larger droplets montero et al 2003 cooling towers generally must operate when process cooling is needed but sprinkler application can be scheduled during periods of low wind velocity or directed away from areas such as hospitals where sensitive populations are located in addition operations can be scheduled during nighttime hours or off hours when employees are away from the irrigation zone although not addressed in the models conditions of high humidity and lower temperature will reduce evaporative loss of droplets and prevent some of the size decrease that results in drift droplets reaching a respirable range before they settle solar decay of bacteria in aerosol is also greater at higher humidity paez rubio and peccia 2005 although decay for evaporated legionella is greater than for legionella in aqueous aerosol this factor had minimal influence in the model furthermore it is not known how viability or infectivity changes during long range aerosol transport while all three laboratory methods culture ema qpcr qpcr are currently in use for legionella monitoring there is no consensus on which method is most appropriate generally qpcr will detect legionella more frequently than culture based methods whiley and taylor 2014 culture based methods are considered the gold standard and will detect viable legionella but will underestimate viable but non culturable vbnc legionella while qpcr data will enumerate non viable cells collins et al 2015 furthermore qpcr results are not always correlated with culture based methods whiley and taylor 2014 while ema qpcr produces estimates of legionella cells with intact membranes that can be a good indication of cell viability some authors argue the use of ema qpcr may not be appropriate for testing for regulatory purposes for biofilms or when high levels of background bacteria are present taylor et al 2014 ema based methods will need to be improved in terms of reliability and robustness in order to increase their routine use however there are algorithms available to aid in their interpretation and comparison with qpcr based data ditommaso et al 2015 the most important factor identified in the sensitivity analysis for nearly all models was the concentration of legionella in the reclaimed water this analysis did not account for dilution of reclaimed water with other types of water typically reclaimed water can have up to 20 v v dilution dungan 2014 dilution with water of higher microbiological quality could provide significant water savings while still reducing the need for additional risk management options additionally changes in reclaimed water quality within a cooling tower or premise plumbing were not considered legionella could grow in these systems and result in potentially higher risks although the net effect during premise plumbing under specific conditions is a research gap another important parameter identified in the sensitivity analysis is the aerosolization efficiency or fraction that ultimately is in the respirable range by the time it reaches a downwind receptor determining the aerosol size distribution and downwind proportion of legionella containing aerosols in the respirable range remains a substantial challenge for qmra models it is challenging to model the evolution of aerosol size distributions over time due to co occurring and interrelated dynamic rate physical phenomena of settling evaporation condensation coalescence and secondary aerosol formation due to bubble burst and film collapse hinds 1999 lighthart et al 1991 the fraction of aerosols in the respirable range is therefore not likely to remain constant over time and the current model may underestimate the impact of varying meteorological parameters as a constant fraction of respirable droplets over downwind distances is assumed this approach has been applied in other legionella qmra models that considered aerosol size distributions armstrong and haas 2007b nygård et al 2008 however a model that considers these factors is therefore recommended for further development to more accurately determine legionella risks from systems with the potential for large scale dispersion finally risks were not computed using disability adjusted life years daly which are useful for comparing health burdens from various infection scenarios however although daly measures are available for the netherlands van lier et al 2016 standard daly values for legionnaires disease in us based populations are not currently available and are recommended for further development to aid in interpretation of risk values 5 conclusions legionella median annual infection risks and annual clinical severity infection risks for toilet flushing can exceed a 10 4 annual risk of infection benchmark for some aerosol exposure estimation methods and the 95th percentile risk exceeded the benchmark for all aerosol exposure estimation methods legionella annual infection risks and annual clinical severity infection risks are non trivial at potentially large distances away from cooling towers and sprinklers operating under typical conditions ranked according to their influence on annual risk estimates the dose response model chosen infection or clinical severity infection the population at risk residential or occupational the detection method culture based ema qpcr or qpcr operating conditions drift eliminator performance or stack height for cooling towers only and meteorological conditions cooling towers and sprinklers were the most important factors identified in the scenario analyses the concentration of legionella present in reclaimed water was the most influential parameter within all individual risk simulations highlighting the importance of efforts to control occurrence for managing risks management practices such as closing toilet lids using more efficient drift eliminators for cooling towers or using wind breaks for cooling towers and sprinklers could contribute to public health risk mitigation

19708,the use of reclaimed water brings new challenges for the water industry in terms of maintaining water quality while increasing sustainability increased attention has been devoted to opportunistic pathogens especially legionella pneumophila due to its growing importance as a portion of the waterborne disease burden in the united states infection occurs when a person inhales a mist containing legionella bacteria the top three uses for reclaimed water cooling towers spray irrigation and toilet flushing that generate aerosols were evaluated for legionella health risks in reclaimed water using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra risks are compared using data from nineteen united states reclaimed water utilities measured with culture based methods quantitative pcr qpcr and ethidium monoazide qpcr median toilet flushing annual infection risks exceeded 10 4 considering multiple toilet types while median clinical severity infection risks did not exceed this value sprinkler and cooling tower risks varied depending on meteorological conditions and operational characteristics such as drift eliminator performance however the greatest differences between risk scenarios were due to 1 the dose response model used infection or clinical severity infection 2 population at risk considered residential or occupational and 3 differences in laboratory analytical method theoretical setback distances necessary to achieve a median annual infection risk level of 10 4 are proposed for spray irrigation and cooling towers in both cooling tower and sprinkler cases legionella infection risks were non trivial at potentially large setback distances and indicate other simultaneous management practices could be needed to manage risks the sensitivity analysis indicated that the most influential factors for variability in risks were the concentration of legionella and aerosol partitioning and or efficiency across all models highlighting the importance of strategies to manage legionella occurrence in reclaimed water graphical abstract image 1 keywords reclaimed water quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra legionella pneumophila cooling towers toilet flushing spray irrigation 1 introduction growing global water scarcity has intensified the need to recover water resources from wastewater especially as population growth economic development and urbanization increase pressures on existing water supplies levine and asano 2004 reclaimed water can alleviate stress on municipal water systems and augment existing water portfolios however there is the potential for health risks from human contact with contaminants in reclaimed water through dermal contact inhalation or ingestion during various water use activities agricultural and industrial water reuse represent the sectors with the largest reclaimed water usage in the united states jiménez and asano 2008 reclaimed water for cooling system purposes further represents the largest industrial water reuse application metcalf and eddy 2007 cooling systems may consume 20 50 of a facility s water usage aoki et al 2005 common uses of reclaimed water such as spray irrigation or cooling towers can produce aerosols that are of concern because contaminants can travel beyond the immediate vicinity of application li et al 2011 additionally toilet flushing has been identified as a top use of recycled water in a survey of ten united states recycled water systems jjemba et al 2015 lechevallier et al 2017 toilet flushing can also generate aerosols that can potentially be associated with health risks fewtrell and kay 2007 gerba et al 1975 hamilton et al 2017 together spray irrigation 90 respondents cooling towers 50 respondents and toilet flushing 30 respondents comprise the top three uses of recycled water identified in the survey jjemba et al 2015 lechevallier et al 2017 to date no documented infectious disease outbreaks have been reported in association with reclaimed water and epidemiological studies have focused primarily on potential fecal pathogen associated health risks durand and schwebach 1989 sheikh et al 1990 ward et al 1989 without finding evidence of increased risk one recent study of irrigation workers exposed to reclaimed water showed higher colonization with staphylococcus and enterococcus bacteria compared to office workers although this difference was not significant goldstein et al 2014 however concerns exist regarding opportunistic pathogens such as legionella non tuberculous mycobacteria ntm pseudomonas aeruginosa stenotrophomas maltophila staphylococcus aureus and acanthamoeba spp especially as alternative non potable routes of exposure are more relevant for reclaimed water use the chemistry of reclaimed water is distinct from that of potable water with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter and nutrients known to occur in reclaimed water systems associated with enhanced microbial growth garner et al 2016 intermittent usage of reclaimed water may also result in higher water age opportunistic pathogens can grow at low organic carbon concentrations and are particularly prone to growth in water environments with high water age and biofilm growth where free living amoeba found in biofilms can enhance pathogen resistance to disinfectants growth persistence and virulence cooper and hanlon 2010 kirschner et al 1992 thomas et al 2010 although fully functioning water reuse treatment may be sufficiently robust to be protective for fecal pathogen risks chaudhry et al 2017 it is not yet known whether the same is true for opportunistic pathogens legionella is one of the most significant opportunistic waterborne pathogens as it is responsible for a substantial portion of the united states waterborne disease burden beer et al 2015 infection with legionella can cause the pneumonia like illness legionnaires disease or a milder form of infection known as pontiac fever fields et al 2002 it is known to occur in engineered water systems including cooling towers ahmadrajabi et al 2016 wastewater treatment facilities allestam et al 2006 fernandez cassi et al 2016 pascual et al 2003 sánchez monedero et al 2008 walser et al 2017 ambient water environments fliermans et al 1979 and soils amemura maekawa et al 2012 wallis and robinson 2005 legionella spp grow in biofilms in piping and can slough off and become aerosolized through water fixtures at which point human exposure can occur aerosol production of legionella is a particular concern as outbreaks have been associated with exposure to aerosols generated by cooling towers castilla et al 2008 george et al 2016 nguyen et al 2006 walser et al 2014 weiss et al 2017 wastewater treatment facilities gregersen et al 1999 kusnetsov et al 2010 olsen et al 2010 decorative fountains haupt et al 2012 and other common water uses hines et al 2014 for this reason it is warranted to investigate the potential for elevated risks from exposure to legionella in reclaimed water few studies have quantified legionella in reclaimed water jjemba et al 2010 palmer et al 1995 and a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has not yet been performed for legionella for exposures to reclaimed water the qmra framework integrates information regarding pathogen occurrence infectivity and exposure for determining the health implications of microbial hazards using a process of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization haas et al 2014 to inform appropriate usages of reclaimed water and identify factors which have the greatest implication for best management practices a qmra is presented for scenarios of toilet flushing spray irrigation and cooling tower generated aerosols additionally due to the availability and practice of using different laboratory detection methods to enumerate legionella spp risks were also assessed using a comparison of three common detection methods culture based methods ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction ema qpcr and qpcr culture based methods quantify viable culturable cells colony forming units cfu per l ema qpcr quantifies gene copies from cells with an intact cell membrane and is intended to represent the concentration of viable cells as measured in gene copies per l delgado viscogliosi et al 2005 mansi et al 2014 qin et al 2012 typically a qmra will seek to use data that are most representative of viable infectious microorganisms however these data are not always available for a particular situation and it is not uncommon for qmras to rely upon qpcr data when viability and infectivity information is not available each detection method has its drawbacks whiley and taylor 2014 and there is currently no consensus regarding the implications of using datasets generated with varying methods on resulting health risks therefore an additional objective of this work was to quantify the impacts of laboratory detection method on qmra estimates using concentrations generated using all three methods culture ema qpcr qpcr from a large national study of legionella occurrence 2 materials and methods 2 1 exposure models three exposure scenarios of toilet flushing spray irrigation and cooling tower generated aerosols were considered using a previously derived framework for legionella risks hamilton and haas 2016 legionella was considered to be present in reclaimed water at concentrations measured in a comprehensive national legionella occurrence study by johnson et al 2017 with aerosols generated at rates specific to each process modeled not all aerosols released from a given activity will reach a receptor while possessing droplet diameters within the respirable range aerosol particles of median diameters between 1 and 10 μm were considered respirable for all three exposure scenarios as legionella is typically 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide and particles greater than 10 μm are not likely to reach the lower respiratory tract baron and willeke 1986 metcalf and eddy 2007 where available information was used regarding how the bacteria partitions from bulk water to aerosol and pathogen decay was considered during transport through air to a receptor most large aerosol droplets are trapped in the nasopharyngeal region and smaller particles are able to travel to the alveoli where legionella infection is initiated and behaves according to an exponential dose response model human exposure patterns for each scenario were taken into account to annualize risks where necessary data from published graphs necessary for aerosol calculations were extracted using alcasa digitize it v 4 2 0 2 1 1 toilet flushing three qmra methods were compared to assess infection risks from toilet flushing with multiple common toilet types johnson et al 2013 o toole et al 2009 the use of either a partitioning coefficient pc armstrong and haas 2007b 2008 azuma et al 2013 medema

dose lim et al 2015 are accepted qmra practices for modeling aerosol inhalation exposures therefore both the pc method 1 and aerosol dose method 2 and 3 methods are assessed and compared using two available datasets for toilet aerosol size distributions johnson et al 2013 o toole et al 2009 method 2 and 3 method 1 for toilet flushing is modified from the qmra exposure model of schoen and ashbolt 2011 originally developed for showering and relying on the use of a pc as per equation 1 aerosols generated with the pc were only considered for sizes between 1 and 4 μm due to the upper bound pc used the pc was derived from a study by darlow and bale 1959 and analyzed by hines et al 2014 indicating that 87 of produced aerosols were less than 4 μm in diameter with no size information about other aerosol sizes produced the study used for the lower bound estimate by barker and jones 2005 did not indicate the size of aerosols produced and the same aerosol size fraction 87 between 1 and 4

atmospheric models for particle dispersion are simple box gaussian plume gp lagrangian and eulerian holmes and morawska 2006 dungan 2010 and van leuken et al 2015 reviewed fate and transport models for bioaerosols which relied heavily upon modified gp models qmra models for wastewater biosolids use and spread of dusts containing pathogens between farms used gp models with various modifications brooks et al 2005b 2012 dowd et al 2000 galada et al 2012 jahne et al 2014 2015 ssematimba et al 2012 tanner et al 2008 teng et al 2013 viau et al 2011 with several studies generating site specific meteorological data intensive estimates using us environmental protection agency aermod software dungan 2014 jahne et al 2014 2015 or computational fluid dynamics cfd blatny et al 2008 2011 fossum et al 2012 the goal of this work was to develop a generalized model for long range transport with reclaimed water containing legionella under a range of meteorological conditions that does not rely upon intensive site specific information the concentration of legionella downwind from an aerosol emitting source is dependent upon the concentration of legionella in the originating reclaimed water transport and dispersion deposition wet and dry evaporation and bacterial viability as a function of environmental conditions these factors are incorporated into a gaussian plume atmospheric transport model to calculate the dose of legionella at a receptor downwind from a cooling tower or irrigation spray source using equation 4 a combination of previously proposed models that account for organism

air is negligible 2 reclaimed water aerosols are generated during daytime only only daytime solar insolation values and corresponding atmospheric stability values only are considered 3 no overlapping cooling tower irrigation sources or other sources of legionella in the system 4 exposures occur at a constant distance directly downwind from the sprinkler or cooling tower 5 protection of legionella due to the presence of organic debris algae or free living amoeba is not considered 6 the impacts of aerosol dynamics including bubble burst break up or agglomeration of aerosols film collapse and shear forces on legionella are not considered 7 effects of a moist aerosol plume thermodynamics are not considered 8 no topographic effects 9 no additional effects of biofilms and any biofilm with potential to slough off pipe surfaces was suspended in the bulk water at the time of sampling therefore legionella in bulk water represent 100 of legionella available for aerosolization 10 the fate of bacteria in individual aerosols is not tracked however it is acknowledged here that larger aerosols in the starting distribution are likely to contain more bacteria and therefore result in higher concentration aerosols downstream than expected in some aerosols of smaller diameter blatny et al 2011 11 enrichment of the aerosolized water with bacteria compared to the bulk water is not considered 12 reclaimed water is not blended with any other water source prior to use the plume model accounts for dispersion but not the fraction of aerosols within the respirable size range which is of crucial concern for legionella inhalation 1 10 μm to obtain this fraction the approach of hardy et al 2006 was used considering the mass weighted fraction of aerosols likely to become fully evaporated as those that are 100 μm in diameter and the fine mist fraction as those droplets with diameters 100 200 μm in diameter represented in the model as q i s aerosols larger than 400 μm settled at distances 50 m and were therefore assumed to settle at close range for both sprinklers and cooling towers and were not included in the model it was assumed that all droplets with an initial diameter of 200 μm would reach a diameter of 10 μm or less by the time they reached the downwind receptor 2 2 legionella concentrations for all models concentrations of legionella in reclaimed water c leg were computed from a national study johnson et al 2017 according to equation 8 8 c l e g 1 r c r w f l p where c leg corrected concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water or drinking water r recovery

delignette muller and dutang 2015 in r v 3 1 1 www rproject org whereby non detect observations were censored between zero and the detection limit 2 3 dose response and risk characterization the daily probability of each endpoint was calculated using the exponential dose response model for l pneumophila equation 9 armstrong and haas 2007a haas et al 1999 two dose response models were used for infection corresponding to subclinical infection or potentially a pontiac fever endpoint or clinical severity infection corresponding to an infection requiring a clinical visit table 2 9 p i n f 1 e r

legionella at the target organ alveoli annual risk was calculated as per equation 10 10 p i n f a n n u a l 1 1 n f 1 p i n f where f is the daily frequency of the activity flushing a toilet spray irrigation application or being present outside near a cooling tower and n is the yearly frequency a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify variables contributing to uncertainty using 10 000 monte carlo iterations all computations were performed in r and using the mc2d package pouillot and delignette muller 2010 the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to identify the most important predictive factors of annual infection or clinical severity infection risk where 0 is no influence and 1 or 1 when the output is wholly dependent on that input the model inputs were ranked based on their correlation coefficient with the output variable annual risk 3 results 3 1 legionella concentrations in reclaimed water concentrations of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water were modeled using lognormal distributions based on data for legionella spp provided in johnson et al 2017 for nineteen united states reclaimed water systems table 7 some data were generated during a snapshot screening using a culture based assay after which six of the nineteen were sampled quarterly following the initial reconnaissance survey using three methods culture ema qpcr and qpcr a summary of the six utilities chosen for follow up sampling is provided in supplemental table s1 a total of 153 culture based samples 115 ema qpcr samples and 115 qpcr samples were considered production at the six plants chosen for follow up ranged from 14 000 to 75 000 000 gpd and the plants used two disinfectant types free chlorine and chloramine forty six percent of samples had disinfectant residuals below 1 mg l and 79 of samples had residuals below 0 2 mg l legionella spp was quantified in the effluent storage reservoir and three locations in the distribution system coded 1 2 and 3 using three analytical methods culture ema qpcr and qpcr all locations effluent storage reservoir and distribution system locations 1 2 and 3 were pooled for generating the distributions ninety six percent of legionella spp detected using the culture based assay and 52 of legionella spp gene copies were determined to be l pneumophila this ratio was used to correct legionella spp concentrations obtained from each method the recovery efficiency of the membrane filtration method reported and used in the current study was 70 18 6 mean sd 3 2 toilet flushing 3 2 1 literature

using gram negative bacteria serratia marcesens nctc 10211 were used barker and jones 2005 barker and jones 2005 seeded toilets with 1010 bacteria on the toilet sidewalls and flushed 5 min after applying the inoculum the bulk toilet water contained 108 cfu ml serratia prior to flushing bacterial air samples were collected 20 cm above and 30 cm in front of the toilet after flushing and a maximum concentration of 1370 527 cfu m3 in air was detected 1 min after the flush resulting in a pc of 1 37 10 8 cfu m 3 cfu l 1 the aerosol size information was not given and the authors suggest that based on the type of air sampling used size ranges were likely to be above 20 μm indicating the assumption of darlow and bale 1959 may have been conservative in equation 1 the calculated pc is

more appropriate surrogate than ms 2 coliphage tested in the study due to its size and similarities with legionella moore et al 2015 a lower generation rate of bacteria containing aerosol is expected for toilet flushing due to the less active generation process than for showering or aerated hot spring spas it is assumed the decay in aerosol for toilet flushing is negligible over a 1 5 min exposure event directly after flushing for toilet flushing exposure frequency a mean of 5 05 flushes per day was used from a study of 22 municipalities water utilities water purveyors water districts and water providers mayer and deoreo 1999 table 2 the deposition efficiency fraction for aerosols of diameter i μm was derived from heyder et al 1986 for a breathing rate of 15 l air min an 8 s breathing cycle and 1 l of tidal volume table 3 ranges were specified using the nasal and oral deposition rates as the upper and lower bound respectively the fraction f i of legionella that partitions into various aerosol sizes after transitioning from bulk water to aerosol during a toilet flush was assumed based on an aerosol partitioning dataset from allegra et al 2016 allegra et al 2016 used a nebulizer to generate aerosols containing l pneumophila and measured the percentage of total bacteria measured using qpcr in aerosols of various sizes table 3 values extracted from original reference fig 4 the

to 20 μm were measured however aerosols were only observed in the 2 3 μm size bin and none of the other 3 10 μm bins for a single toilet flush no aerosols were observable for a half flush the deposition efficiency fraction for aerosols of diameter 3 μm was used from heyder et al 1986 the distribution of the volume of water inhaled according to method 2 was lognormally distributed with parameters 26 3 1 95 corresponding to a mean of 2 53 10 11 l reaching the alveoli method 3 a toilet experiment by johnson et al 2013 used four types of toilets including a pre fepa gravity flow toilet

particles generated of each size mmad using 10y 100 table 4 the fraction was applied to the total generation of particles flush and sampling volume m3 averaged over the flush conditions table 3 each size mmad was corrected for its corresponding alveolar deposition efficiency the distribution of the volume of water inhaled according to method 3 was lognormally distributed with parameters 24 4 0

82 10 4 method 1 and 3 20 10 9 method 2 to 4 11 10 7 method 1 respectively fig 1 using ema qpcr legionella concentration data median annual risks for infection and clinical severity infection ranged from 2 07 10 5 method 2 to 2 75 10 3 method 1 and 2 56 10 8 method 2 to 3 00 10 6 method 1 respectively for qpcr legionella concentration data median annual risks for infection and clinical severity infection ranged from 8 52 10 5 method 2 to 1 06 10 2 method 1 and 1 02 10 7 method 2 to 1 17 10 5 method 1 respectively the 95th percentiles for annual infection risks ranged from 4 08 10 4 method 2 to 2 72 10 2 method 1 for culture 5 69 10 3 method 2 to 2 59 10 1 method 1 for ema qpcr and 2 23 10 2 method 2 to 7 41 10 1 method 1 for qpcr the 95th percentiles for annual clinical severity infection risks ranged from 4 60 10 7 method 2 to 2 58 10 5 method 1 for culture 6 40 10 6 method 2 to 3 19 10 4 method 1 for ema qpcr and 2 70 10 5 method 2 to 1 38 10 3 method 1 for qpcr if compared to the usepa annual infection benchmark of 10 4 infections per person per year for drinking water median annual infection risks infection dose response endpoint exceeded this value for method 1 culture based and method 3 qpcr using a clinical severity infection dose response endpoint no calculated models exceeded this value the 95th percentile annual infection risks exceeded 10 4 for all methods the 95th percentile clinical severity risks exceeded 10 4 for method 1 ema qpcr and qpcr for all methods the concentration of legionella in reclaimed water was the most important predictive factor of the final estimate of annual risk of either infection or clinical severity infection fig 2 spearman rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0 71 to 0 94 the large ranges of annual risks observed are therefore likely due to variability in this factor for method 1 the partitioning coefficient was the next most important factor and for method 2 the concentration of aerosols c aer 2 5 was the next most important factor for all models exposure time t dose response variable r and exposure frequency f were also important factors 3 3 long range dispersion models 3 3 1 literature review for spray irrigation parameters reclaimed water may be applied through a variety of mechanisms producing varying degrees of aerosols ranging from minimal drip irrigation to substantial spray irrigation it is assumed here that spray irrigation with reclaimed water would take place via a stationary sprinkler system and could therefore be considered a point source sprinkler heights are all 1 m for commonly used sprinkler systems for reclaimed water table 5 jjemba et al 2015 however the plume model was considered to commence from the maximum height of the spray stream the maximum stream height value of 6 m reported across the commonly used sprinklers in table 5 was used the distance required to reach the apex of the sprinkler stream 25 m was added to estimates for sprinkler setback distances reported in the text the sprinkler efficiency is the portion of initially sprayed water that leaves the immediate vicinity of the spray irrigation system as aerosols including aqueous aerosols and evaporated droplets usepa 1982 the efficiency for low pressure smooth plate sprinklers ranged from 0 5 to 1 4 percent kohl 1974 inhalable aerosol size fractions q i were reported by hardy et al 2006 for various sprinklers the largest fractions for rainbird sprinkler nozzles were chosen table 6 the fine mist fraction was evenly divided into ten bins with mmad i 1 10 to estimate the portion of downstream aerosols 10 μm decay rates specific to evaporation or aqueous transport were applied separately for these portions of the total downstream aerosol load a uniform distribution of residential exposures to spray irrigation activities was determined from estimates derived from australian guidelines for water reuse ranging from 81 to 99 inhalation exposures per year chhipi shrestha et al 2017 nrmmc 2008 occupational exposures were assumed to be similar to those estimated in a study of biosolids application accounting for daily year round exposures to biosolids for a total of 255 exposures per year brooks et al 2005a 2012 this accounts for a 5 day work week with one week absent from exposure residential exposures were assumed to occur for 1 h during each exposure event brooks et al 2005a 2012 while occupational exposures were assumed to occur during a standard 8 h work shift 255 days per year as anything over an 8 h shift can be considered an extended or unusual shift osha 2017 3 3 2 literature review for cooling tower parameters the principal categories for cooling water systems are once through non contact cooling recirculation non contact cooling and direct contact cooling metcalf and eddy 2007 the majority of cooling water systems that use reclaimed water are recirculating non contact systems metcalf and eddy 2007 in recirculating non contact systems warmed water from a cooling operation or heat exchanger is cooled by transferring its heat to air through evaporation in a cooling tower warm water from process cooling is sprayed on the top of the internal packing used to break up the water through spray into droplets to enhance air water contact cool dry outside air is pulled up through the cooling tower by a large rotating fan to cool the warm water through evaporation water is removed by blowdown or purge and small amounts of water capable of carrying microorganisms are also lost by drift typical water loss from drift is assumed to be 0 001 0 005 of the total recirculating water ashrae 2004 however it is noted that this loss rate could be higher for older designs or certain choices of drift eliminator up to 0 1 lucas et al 2012 both typical 0 003 0 005 and high drift 0 01 0 1 conditions were simulated to examine their impact on annual health risks for cooling towers the mass weighted proportions of aerosols 100 and 100 200 μm were calculated by simulating a lognormal distribution specified by peterson and lighthart 1977 with a geometric mean of 230 1 59 μm arithmetic mean sd of 256 125 μm the design and operating conditions of recirculating cooling water towers vary widely selby et al 1996 the flow rate of total recirculating water is a parameter designed using performance curves specific to a given set of equipment and process being served to achieve a desired range of thermal capability of the cooling tower given set of operating conditions entering water temperature leaving water temperature and entering air wet bulb temperature ashrae 2004 the entering air wet bulb temperature required system temperature level cooling tower size and number of cells will balance the heat rejected at a specific approach difference between leaving water temperature and entering air wet bulb temperature ashrae 2004 the cooling tower size is a function of these factors as well as the quantity of water to be cooled the air velocity through the cell and the tower height zhang et al 2012 therefore it is challenging to designate a set of typical operating conditions for use within a qmra it is assumed for simplicity in this model that larger heat loads necessitate larger towers which in turn require larger quantities of recirculated water several studies report flow rates per cell for large up to 100 m stack height cooling towers of approximately 103 104 l s adams et al 1978 1980 chen and hanna 1978 cooling towers of heights 10 m and 100 m were simulated with flow rates of 102 103 l s and 103 104 l s respectively table 6 it was assumed conservatively that operation occurred continuously and therefore could result in potential exposures 365 days per year for residential exposures bhopal and barr 1990 residential exposures were assumed to occur for 1 h during each exposure event brooks et al 2005a 2012 while occupational exposures were assumed to occur during a standard 8 h work shift 255 days per year osha 2017 3 3 3 decay rates several studies have examined legionella decay in aerosol as a function of relative humidity and seeding matrix as well as bacteria strain type and source berendt 1980 1981 dennis and lee 1988 hambleton et al 1983 legionella survival generally increases as the ambient relative humidity increases and it survives particularly well at intermediate 65 relative humidity however this relationship is not linear and zones of instability are present legionella generally survived better in suspensions containing algal extracts compared to tryptose saline hambleton et al 1983 held l pneumophila 74 81 at various relative humidity for 15 min before aerosolizing them in a 3 jet collision nebulizer the organisms survived best at 65 rh and worst at 55 survival was also high at 90 and 80 relative humidity therefore 65 80 and 90 relative humidities were chosen for modeling scenarios values were extracted from published graphs and decay constants were obtained by plotting log concentration versus time for two sets of experiments using water spray in hambleton et al table 6 two other studies examined legionella survival in aerosolized culture broth berendt 1980 dennis and lee 1988 and were used as lower bounds on the decay estimates at each humidity only one study examined the decay of dried legionella for use with the evaporated mass fraction katz and hammel 1987 legionella pneumophila philadelphia 1 strain was dried for 90 min a four log drop in viability was observed during the first 30 s followed by a more gradual decline biphasic decay values were derived by converting percent recovery to a concentration and plotting log concentration versus time the higher decay rate was applied for up to the first 30 s after the average total evaporation time while the lower decay rate was applied from t 30 s to downstream time t where applicable no study was available that simultaneously examined microbial decay impacts of rh and solar exposure on legionella a study by paez rubio and peccia 2005 allowed for parsing out of decay attributable to solar exposure versus other factors in aerosol at two rh ranges for e coli another gram negative bacteria the solar induced inactivation rate was used for both moderate rh of 50 60 with mean se inactivation of 1 00 10 3 3 42 10 3 s 1 n 5 and high rh of 85 95 with mean se inactivation of 2 17 10 3 8 70 10 4 s 1 n 5 these decay rates were applied in addition to the non solar decay rates at each rh where the moderate rh was applied with the 65 rh non solar decay and the high rh was applied with the 80 and 90 rh non solar decay data were not available for the impact of solar inactivation on legionella in droplets that evaporated therefore these decay fractions were applied to both the aqueous and evaporated fractions solar decay was assumed at every time t because exposure times were assumed to happen when people were present during daylight hours 3 4 cooling tower risk results annual health risks from exposure to aerosols from cooling towers were modeled for 4 pasquil stability classes a through d corresponding to wind speeds ranging from 1 to 7 m s 3 humidity values with corresponding solar decay values 65 80 and 90 2 stack heights 10 m and 100 m 2 dose response endpoints infection clinical severity infection 3 methods culture ema qpcr and qpcr and 2 exposure durations frequencies residential occupational at various downwind distances from 50 to 10 000 m a comparison of annual infection risks for residential populations with various combinations of wind speed and relative humidity parameters for culturable legionella is shown in supplemental fig s1 changing meteorological conditions did not have as important of an impact on risk as the other modeled factors generally as wind speed increases aerosols are carried farther and annual risks peak farther away from the cooling tower although legionella is more stable at 65 and 90 relative humidity than at 80 this does not have as great an impact on annual risk of infection as changing the wind speed legionella is carried farthest at the highest wind speed 7 m s and a relative humidity of 65 using this most conservative set of meteorological parameters a comparison of annual risks for infection and clinical severity infection at two stack heights and all three analytical methods are shown for residential and occupational populations in figs 3 6 peak risks occur downwind from the source as some time must pass for the plume to reach human breathing height annual risks from qpcr are highest followed by ema qpcr and culture based assays annual clinical severity infection risks are up to 2 5 orders of magnitude lower than annual infection risks at a given downwind distance occupational risks were up to one log higher than residential risks in addition both types of annual infection risks peak further downstream for stack heights of 100 m compared to 10 m if the usepa 10 4 annual infection risk target for drinking water is used for comparison to 95th percentiles from the cooling tower annual infection risk infection dose response endpoint distribution the setback distance for both residential and occupational populations with a 10 m or 100 m tall cooling tower would be 5 000 m with no other risk mitigation actions figs 3 6 for a median comparison point distances for a 10 m cooling tower would range from 500 m culturable to 3 500 m qpcr using a clinical severity infection dose response endpoint and stack height of 10 m setback distances for residential populations would cover a large range depending on the concentration detection method and percentile for comparison used using a 95th percentile for comparison the setback distance would be less than 50 m for culturable 500 m for ema qpcr or 1000 m for qpcr fig 3 for occupational populations these corresponding distances would be 50 m 1000 m and 2500 m respectively fig 5 if median annual clinical severity risks for a stack height of 10 m are compared to the 10 4 benchmark no residential or occupational models exceed this value the results of the sensitivity analysis for cooling towers are shown in fig 7 regardless of the detection method used the concentration of legionella in reclaimed water was the most important predictive factor of the final estimate of annual infection or clinical severity infection risk spearman rank correlation coefficient ranging from 0 81 to 0 89 the cooling tower circulating water flow rate dose response parameter and cooling tower drift efficiency were the next most influential factors owing to variation in the efficiency of various drift eliminators a comparison of typical operating conditions of 0 001 0 005 and less effective drift eliminator conditions which might be typical of an older pre 1970 s cooling tower of 0 01 0 1 are presented in supplemental fig s2 a higher efficiency drift eliminator can decrease risks by 1 1 5 logs highlighting this factor as an important potential management strategy 3 5 spray irrigation risk results a comparison of annual infection and clinical severity infection risks for the most conservative set of meteorological conditions is shown in figs 8 and 9 for sprinklers a stack height of 6 m was used corresponding to the highest point of the sprinkler spray arc for this reason figs 8 9 should be interpreted as distance downwind from the horizontal distance at which the maximum height of the arc occurs this distance has a maximum length of 24 4 m table 5 and is included in setback distance estimates below generally sprinkler risks were lower than cooling tower risks for annual infection residential population risks setback distances would range from 1 025 m culture based assay to 10 000 m qpcr based assay from the sprinkler under conservative meteorological conditions conditions that promote legionella dispersion of 7 m s windspeed and 65 rh and using a 95th percentile for comparison if no other risk mitigation strategies are applied these distances would be between 75 m culturable and 625 m qpcr based using median values for comparison 95th percentile annual clinical severity residential population risks were 10 4 for culture based and ema qpcr methods but not for qpcr corresponding to 225 m setback distance occupational annual infection risks indicate a setback distance 5 025 m culture based or 10 000 m ema qpcr or qpcr based and occupational clinical severity risks correspond to distances ranging from 75 m culture based to 1 225 m qpcr based using a 95th percentile comparison and 75 m using a median comparison the sprinkler sensitivity analysis shown in fig 7 also highlights the concentration of legionella in reclaimed water as the primary factor that influences annual infection estimates the sprinkler flow rate and aerosol efficiency were the next most influential parameters and the dose response parameter was also an important factor 4 discussion a qmra is presented here for legionella infection risks during toilet flushing spray irrigation and cooling tower mist inhalation with reclaimed water three toilet flushing exposure models were compared using different analytical methods and dose response endpoints a modified gaussian plume dispersion model was used to compare risks for different analytical methods meteorological conditions exposure types dose response endpoints and downwind distances for sprinkler and cooling tower risks two operation conditions for informing cooling tower risk management were explored these options were varying the stack height and aerosolization efficiency for cooling towers moderate differences in annual infection and clinical severity risks were observed across the three methods culturable ema qpcr qpcr used to detect legionella for each scenario this resulted in 1 2 orders of magnitude differences in median annual infection or clinical severity infection risks across models however risk estimates for ema qpcr and qpcr had higher values than risk estimates using the culture based data this difference matters when choosing between percentiles to compare to the target or benchmark value in order to derive a setback distance for example large differences up to 3 orders of magnitude across scenarios were observed when using an infection versus a clinical severity infection dose response model with the infection model resulting in higher risks lesser differences were observed in the cooling tower and sprinkler models at any downwind distance due to residential versus occupational exposure 1 2 order difference or raising the stack height up to 2 orders of magnitude difference with peak risks occurring further downwind changes in meteorological parameters varied between models based on downwind distances with high 7 m s wind speed and 65 relative humidity resulting in the highest risk estimates these findings indicate that differences between risk scenarios versus the sensitivity analyses that identify important factors within a single scenario are most largely influenced by the selection of a dose response model infection or clinical severity infection followed by the exposure model used toilet flushing only exposure duration cooling tower and sprinkler only residential or occupational and method culture based ema qpcr or qpcr used to quantify legionella in the water sources annual infection or clinical severity infection risks greater than a tentative 10 4 annual infection benchmark value for drinking water were observed for certain cases in all three exposure scenarios depending on the conditions for toilet flushing method 2 was the least conservative producing lower risk estimates overall and method 1 was the most conservative resulting in higher risk estimates overall this is likely due to the use of a pc in method 1 which measured the ratio of bacterial concentrations in air and water this indicates there is some discrepancy when comparing results computed using a pc versus computing bacterial concentrations in each size range based on an aerosol size distribution both approaches require assumptions to be made when assessing how legionella is partitioned in aerosol more experimental measurements are needed to validate these approaches to determine the relative strengths of each approach the risks associated with toilet flushing may be somewhat mitigated by recommending reclaimed water users put the lid down prior to flushing however some studies noted that closing the toilet lid did not have a substantial effect on mitigating the spread of aerosols barker and jones 2005 bound and atkinson 1966 the cooling tower and sprinkler models indicate that legionella containing aerosols can be carried long distances in sufficient quantities to present health risks above 10 4 annual probability of infection or clinical severity infection these findings are consistent with previous studies that have predicted long range transport of legionella and observed distances between outbreak cases and implicated cooling towers up to 12 km away borgen et al 2008 nygård et al 2008 rouil et al 2004 walser et al 2014 however these large spreads were likely attributed to hot weather and high humidity or rare events such as thermal inversions chan and iseman 2013 fisman et al 2005 in many cases outbreaks were also associated with inadequate maintenance of cooling tower systems such as lack of regular inspection faulty dosing pumps suboptimal disinfection high pressure cleaning intermittent operation modes and restarting of cooling towers walser et al 2014 depending on the model conditions selected the setback distances associated with a 10 4 annual risk could be quite large the setback distance was highly sensitive to the legionella detection method used as a result additional risk mitigation strategies are likely to be warranted to decrease the setback distance needed interventions such as windbreaks using trees or walls around irrigation areas could also reduce risks information is not currently available regarding the degree to which microorganisms are removed due to these interventions risks from cooling towers can be reduced by utilizing towers built with a lower stack height and efficient drift eliminators lucas et al 2012 the simulations performed here demonstrate that a less effective drift system can increase risks 1 1 5 logs although higher stack heights have slightly lower annual risks than lower stack heights throughout the zone of influence higher stack heights result in farther transport of aerosols and therefore could result in higher setback distances in some cases a lower stack height reduces the distance aerosols can travel an effective stack height for cooling towers would be higher than the actual stack height used for simulation here due to the effects of plume rise which occurs because the plume is hotter than the surrounding air and rises buoyantly as it exits the stack with a vertical velocity thomson et al 2013a in the current simulations plume rise was not considered in order to calculate plume rise it is necessary to obtain specific information regarding the stack height exit velocity stack diameter and temperature of exiting water vapor obtaining such specific information about the cooling tower was beyond the scope of the current simulations additional guidance documents suggest that stagnant water nutrient growth including the presence of biofilms poor overall microbiological water quality cooling tower deficiencies inadequate maintenance poor design or a location of the system that results in large exposures and or exposures to immune compromised populations are risk factors for legionella outbreaks ashrae 2015 cdc 2016 department of health and human services 2015 sharvelle et al 2017 measures such as treatment before initial startup following commissioning or any extended shutdown period periodic inspection and monitoring restriction of access to the cooling tower use of drift eliminators bleed off to prevent solids accumulation protection from sunlight training cooling tower employees in health and safety practices use of hazard analysis and critical control points haccp methodology and or documenting all strategies for planning monitoring controlling and responding to issues that arise conducting independent audits and installing automatic biocide dosing devices can mitigate some of these risks ashrae 2015 cdc 2016 department of health and human services 2015 sharvelle et al 2017 generally sprinkler risks were lower than cooling tower risks most likely due to the smaller fraction of fine aerosols generated lower dispersion height and lower water flow rate for the low pressure low profile sprinklers modeled annual clinical severity infection risks were 10 4 for most scenarios with setback distances 75 m if considering annual infection risks setback distances could increase substantially beyond 75 m the sprinkler simulation was initiated at the apex of the spray arc as such the velocity propelling droplets in the x direction was not considered which may cause larger droplets to be propelled further distances this factor could result in actual dispersion distances being greater than those used in the qmra and therefore larger required setback distances in addition to using low profile and low pressure sprinkler irrigation systems like the ones specified in this report nozzles with larger orifices will reduce the formation of fine mist subsurface or drip irrigation would minimize drift formation but can incur higher initial investment costs thomson et al 2013b although increasing the droplet size distribution for sprinklers mitigates legionella risk reliance on larger droplets may increase erosion risk for fragile soils due to the greater kinetic energies associated with larger droplets montero et al 2003 cooling towers generally must operate when process cooling is needed but sprinkler application can be scheduled during periods of low wind velocity or directed away from areas such as hospitals where sensitive populations are located in addition operations can be scheduled during nighttime hours or off hours when employees are away from the irrigation zone although not addressed in the models conditions of high humidity and lower temperature will reduce evaporative loss of droplets and prevent some of the size decrease that results in drift droplets reaching a respirable range before they settle solar decay of bacteria in aerosol is also greater at higher humidity paez rubio and peccia 2005 although decay for evaporated legionella is greater than for legionella in aqueous aerosol this factor had minimal influence in the model furthermore it is not known how viability or infectivity changes during long range aerosol transport while all three laboratory methods culture ema qpcr qpcr are currently in use for legionella monitoring there is no consensus on which method is most appropriate generally qpcr will detect legionella more frequently than culture based methods whiley and taylor 2014 culture based methods are considered the gold standard and will detect viable legionella but will underestimate viable but non culturable vbnc legionella while qpcr data will enumerate non viable cells collins et al 2015 furthermore qpcr results are not always correlated with culture based methods whiley and taylor 2014 while ema qpcr produces estimates of legionella cells with intact membranes that can be a good indication of cell viability some authors argue the use of ema qpcr may not be appropriate for testing for regulatory purposes for biofilms or when high levels of background bacteria are present taylor et al 2014 ema based methods will need to be improved in terms of reliability and robustness in order to increase their routine use however there are algorithms available to aid in their interpretation and comparison with qpcr based data ditommaso et al 2015 the most important factor identified in the sensitivity analysis for nearly all models was the concentration of legionella in the reclaimed water this analysis did not account for dilution of reclaimed water with other types of water typically reclaimed water can have up to 20 v v dilution dungan 2014 dilution with water of higher microbiological quality could provide significant water savings while still reducing the need for additional risk management options additionally changes in reclaimed water quality within a cooling tower or premise plumbing were not considered legionella could grow in these systems and result in potentially higher risks although the net effect during premise plumbing under specific conditions is a research gap another important parameter identified in the sensitivity analysis is the aerosolization efficiency or fraction that ultimately is in the respirable range by the time it reaches a downwind receptor determining the aerosol size distribution and downwind proportion of legionella containing aerosols in the respirable range remains a substantial challenge for qmra models it is challenging to model the evolution of aerosol size distributions over time due to co occurring and interrelated dynamic rate physical phenomena of settling evaporation condensation coalescence and secondary aerosol formation due to bubble burst and film collapse hinds 1999 lighthart et al 1991 the fraction of aerosols in the respirable range is therefore not likely to remain constant over time and the current model may underestimate the impact of varying meteorological parameters as a constant fraction of respirable droplets over downwind distances is assumed this approach has been applied in other legionella qmra models that considered aerosol size distributions armstrong and haas 2007b nygård et al 2008 however a model that considers these factors is therefore recommended for further development to more accurately determine legionella risks from systems with the potential for large scale dispersion finally risks were not computed using disability adjusted life years daly which are useful for comparing health burdens from various infection scenarios however although daly measures are available for the netherlands van lier et al 2016 standard daly values for legionnaires disease in us based populations are not currently available and are recommended for further development to aid in interpretation of risk values 5 conclusions legionella median annual infection risks and annual clinical severity infection risks for toilet flushing can exceed a 10 4 annual risk of infection benchmark for some aerosol exposure estimation methods and the 95th percentile risk exceeded the benchmark for all aerosol exposure estimation methods legionella annual infection risks and annual clinical severity infection risks are non trivial at potentially large distances away from cooling towers and sprinklers operating under typical conditions ranked according to their influence on annual risk estimates the dose response model chosen infection or clinical severity infection the population at risk residential or occupational the detection method culture based ema qpcr or qpcr operating conditions drift eliminator performance or stack height for cooling towers only and meteorological conditions cooling towers and sprinklers were the most important factors identified in the scenario analyses the concentration of legionella present in reclaimed water was the most influential parameter within all individual risk simulations highlighting the importance of efforts to control occurrence for managing risks management practices such as closing toilet lids using more efficient drift eliminators for cooling towers or using wind breaks for cooling towers and sprinklers could contribute to public health risk mitigation

19709,this study investigates the functional correspondence between porescale hydrodynamics mass transfer pore structure and biofilm morphology during progressive biofilm colonization of a porous medium hydrodynamics and the structure of both the porous medium and the biofilm are experimentally measured with 3d particle tracking velocimetry and micro x ray computed tomography respectively the analysis focuses on data obtained in a clean porous medium after 36 h of biofilm growth registration of the particle tracking and x ray data sets allows to delineate the interplay between porous medium geometry hydrodynamic and mass transfer processes on the morphology of the developing biofilm a local analysis revealed wide distributions of wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses the spatial distribution of the biofilm patches uncovered that the wall shear stresses controlled the biofilm development neither external nor internal mass transfer limitations were noticeable in the considered system consistent with the excess supply of nutrient and electron acceptors the wall shear stress remained constant in the vicinity of the biofilm but increased substantially elsewhere graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm three dimensional porous medium three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry x ray micro computed tomography wall shear stress concentration boundary layer thickness biofilm morphology 1 introduction biofilms are communities of bacteria attaching and developing on surfaces embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps and persistently developing in environmental medical and industrial settings in porous media such as soils many prokaryotic microorganisms develop a sessile lifestyle that allows them to better cope with their environment griebler and lueders 2009 as biofilms are ubiquitous in porous media systems their relevance stretches over a wide range of applications spanning from the bioremediation of contaminated aquifers meckenstock et al 2015 fixed bed trickling filters gujer and boller 1986 morgenroth et al 1996 gülay et al 2014 or membrane filtration systems baker and dudley 1998 for all these different applications biofilm formation can have a positive or detrimental impact therefore understanding biofilm development in respect to the local geometry of the pore network the porescale hydrodynamics and mass transfer processes is a prerequisite for optimal biofilm control the investigation of these processes requires access to wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer distributions eberl et al 2000 picioreanu et al 2000 based on locally resolved flow and structural information the development of biofilms in porous media is a process involving a wide range of scales from micro over meso to macroscale battin et al 2007 for instance microscale hydrodynamics were shown to control the initial attachment of individual bacteria or particulate matter to surfaces rusconi et al 2014 radu et al 2014 the macroscale is the scale relevant for the integrated understanding of larger engineering or natural systems e g reactors aquifers the mesoscale links the micro and the macroscale as it is the scale at which flow and mass transfer interact with and define the biofilm structures eberl et al 2000 the focus of this study is the mesoscale in porous media or porescale the processes that drive growth of biofilms are complicated by the complexity of the pore space in which they grow in natural porous media and by the feedback mechanisms between pore clogging from biofilm growth and solute transport to deliver nutrients and carry away wastes subtle changes to the pore structure have been reported to affect pore velocities and characteristic length scales i e pore radii by orders of magnitude seymour et al 2004 holzner et al 2015 porous media can be considered as networks of connected three dimensional roughness elements or corners representative of e g soils or filters but also of many other pore scale environments in which biofilms develop biofilm development in porous structures result from highly diverse and complex phenomena for instance the growth of biofilms was identified to induce the formation of preferential flow paths while the interplay between biofilm growth detachment decay and lysis was numerically shown to cause the intermittent shifting of these flow paths bottero et al 2013 locally the intricate geometry of the pore network and the evolving flow field during biofilm growth influence competition between bacterial communities as slow growing or non eps producing bacteria can outcompete fast growing or eps producing ones coyte et al 2017 nadell et al 2017 various studies of biofilm formation at the porescale mainly considered porous media with two dimensional pore networks either experimentally drescher et al 2013 qian et al 2017 or numerically kapellos et al 2007 the use of new imaging methods such as optical coherence tomography oct allows linking biofilm formation to local hydrodynamic conditions and overall system performances xi et al 2006 wagner et al 2010a derlon et al 2012 oct allows imaging the biofilm physical structure at the meso scale but oct can also be combined with fluid flow modeling to study flow dynamics gao et al 2014 weiss et al 2015 however the penetration depth of the oct s signal is limited to around 2 mm in biofilms which restrains the application of oct for monitoring biofilm formation in 3d porous media another relevant method is magnetic resonance imaging mri mri has been used to investigate transport processes in progressively bioclogged 3d porous media at the pore seymour et al 2004 and at the darcy scale codd et al 2011 wagner et al 2010b used mri to study the link between the biofilm formation in a tubular reactor and its influence on the 3d velocity distribution results from mri imaging revealed that biofilm patches could resist maximum local shear stresses up to seven times higher than the mean ones however several aspects limit a wide application of mri to study of biofilm formation in porous media access to device cost of the apparatus and use of dedicated flow cells adapted to the mri etc despite recent progresses the availability of experimental methods to provide information about both the porescale flow and biofilm development in fully 3d porous media remains limited experimental data on porescale biofilm properties and hydrodynamics are also required to validate numerical models developed to predict biofilm formation in porous media a parameter of interest is the biofilm shear strength the resistance of biofilms to shear exerted by the surrounding fluid the biofilm shear strength is experimentally challenging to measure and vary with the growth conditions and bacterial type yet many models often use a default value of the biofilms shear strength that may not be representative of their biofilms thus highlighting the need for direct measurements of biofilm shear strength in 3d porous media this is reinforced by the wide distributions of biofilm shear strengths mentioned in recent studies e g stewart 2014 which can be attributed to the natural heterogeneous distribution of material properties of biofilms stewart and franklin 2008 but also to the distribution of wall shear stresses exerted by fluid flow on biofilms as a consequence of velocity gradients in the biofilm vicinity stewart 2014 additionally the wall shear stresses exerted on the biofilm are very often roughly approximated based on the initial hydrodynamic conditions derlon et al 2008 blauert et al 2015 thus not accounting for the effect of the biofilm formation on the flow which increases the uncertainty of the assumed biofilm shear strength the goal of this paper is thus to experimentally investigate the influence of porescale hydrodynamics and mass transfer processes specifically wall shear stress and concentration boundary layer distribution functions on biofilm development in a transparent 3d porous media a biofilm was grown in a 3d porous medium for 36 h under a constant volumetric flow rate with nutrients and electron acceptors supplied in excess the hydrodynamics were measured at the porescale with three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry 3d ptv in a clean porous medium and after biofilm growth the structure of the porous medium along with the morphology and spatial distribution of the biofilm were obtained with x ray micro computed tomography x ray μct the novel combination of hydrodynamic and structural data permit direct measurements of the feedback mechanisms between biofilm patch development and the fluid dynamics at the porescale to answer the following research questions how does the growth of the biofilm depend on the local wall shear stress and local mass transfer processes what is the influence of the growing biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics pore scale velocities wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses 2 material and methods 2 1 porous medium the porous medium used in this work consists of nafion pellets ion power munich germany a material with physico chemical properties similar to that of sand grains downie et al 2012 the diameter d n of the pellets is roughly monodisperse and distributed around 2 5 0 5 mm nafion is an iono polymer whose optical refractive index can easily be matched rim with aqueous solutions yielding models of transparent soil downie et al 2012 here a decent rim was obtained with a glucose concentration of 11 w v see supplementary information 1 for a detailed analysis concerning the refractive index matching optimization the nafion pellets underwent three times the following treatment allowing optimal transparency approximately 20 g of pellets were heated up at 65 c for 1 h while stirred at 200 rpm under reflux afterwards the pellets were cooled for 30 min at room temperature and stored overnight at 4 c 2 2 biofilm cultivation the 11 w v glucose solution used as a growth medium in this study was prepared with tap water in order to enhance the growth of the heterotrophic biofilm cultivated in this experiment nitrogen and phosphorus were added to a molar ratio c n p of 1000 1 1 this low ratio is due to the high glucose concentration that was not only serving as a carbon source but also provided the refractive index matching with the nafion grains nitrate nano3 was here serving both as nitrogen source and electron acceptor phosphorus was added as k2hpo4 and nah2po4 2h2oaccounting for 1 3 and 2 3 respectively of the total phosphorus molecular ratio yielding inflow concentrations of 8 14 mg no3 n l and 18 9 mg po4 3 p l the mixed species bacterial inoculum used in this study was isolated from the chriesbach river dübendorf switzerland desmond et al 2018 the frozen bacterial inoculum contained in 2 ml eppendorf tubes was added to 100 ml of the growth medium it was then incubated for 20 24 h at 30 c and stirred at 200 rpm until reaching midlogarithmic phase od600 0 52 0 096 the incubation procedure was repeated three consecutive times for the bacteria to adapt to the synthetic carbon source of the growth medium for the last incubation cycle the nafion grains were added to the growth medium to allow initial bacterial attachment upon the incubation a custom built pmma flow cell 38 38 16 mm3 was wet packed with the inoculated nafion grains bottles containing 10 l of growth medium were connected to the flow cell with silicon tubing vwr dietikon switzerland previously washed with 70 v v ethanol and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water the growth medium was replaced every 12 h and spiked with 100 ml of the inoculum a peristaltic pump ismatec glattbrugg switzerland was used to set a volumetric flow rate of 10 ml min as illustrated in fig 1 a a syringe was used as a bubble trap as well as to dampen the pulsatile flow created by the peristaltic pump nitrate and oxygen concentration were sampled in the effluent every 12 h and revealed a high bacterial activity but no actual nutrient limitations 4 41 0 67 mg no3 n l and 4 84 0 55 mg o2 l respectively 2 3 three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry the three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry 3d ptv method applied in this work allows for detection and tracking of flow particle tracers which move faithfully with the porewater tracking the position of tracer particles provides data on velocity and acceleration along flow trajectories this method was developed to study turbulent flows hoyer et al 2005 and was lately adapted to study flows in porous media holzner et al 2015 in order to perform 3d ptv measurements the flow cell was connected to a 120 ml syringe mounted on a syringe pump lambda vit fit lambda baar switzerland the volumetric flow rate was set to 10 ml min yielding a darcy velocity q of 0 27 mm s the estimated reynolds number was re q d n ν 0 5 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the glucose aqueous solution ν 1 33 e 6 m2 s at 20 c the tracer particles were composed of fluorescent red polyethylene microspheres cospheric santa barbara ca usa with a density of 1 g cm3 and with a diameter d p of ca 70 μm 90 between 63 and 75 μm were added to the growth medium to create a suspension as these particles are neutrally buoyant inertial effects are not of concern and the particles follow the flow reliably holzner et al 2015 for each 3d ptv measurement the tracer particle concentration added is of 0 02 g l corresponding to a volume fraction of 0 002 which is low enough to ensure that particle particle interactions were not of concern the fluorescent tracer particles were illuminated with a 100 w pulsed nd ylf laser λ 527 nm darwin duo quantronix hamden usa fig 1 b shows the setup used for the 3d ptv experiments the flow cell was imaged from both the front and back sides with a photron fastcam sa5 with a resolution of 1024 1024 at 50 frames per second fps using an image splitter providing 4 stereoscopic views between 30 and 200 particles were tracked per frame yielding ca 106 data points for every measurement 4549 and 4193 trajectories for the time points t 0 and t 36 h respectively and 3d particle locations with an accuracy of ca 50 μm holzner et al 2015 assuming stationarity of the porescale flow and neglecting structural changes induced by biofilm growth during 3d ptv experiments ca 30 min an estimated average inter particle distance of ca 50 μm was obtained additional information about processing of the 3d ptv data and extraction of the wall shear stresses is available in the supplementary information 2 2 4 x ray micro tomography biofilms form porous structures up to 90 porosity wagner et al 2010a with high water content and densities very close to that of water thus the application of x ray micro tomography to biofilm imaging requires the addition of contrast agents here we follow the approach presented by davit et al 2011 and use a suspension of 0 05 g ml barium sulfate baso4 particles micropaque guerbet zürich switzerland as a contrast agent that emphasizes the porespace free of biofilm davit et al 2011 noted the occurrence of biofilm detachment occurring during the baso4 injection carrel et al 2017 suggested to use iron sulfate feso4 as a contrast agent by continuously adding it to the biofilm during culturing and thus avoiding detachment however this approach could not be applied here without negatively affecting the rim therefore baso4 was used as a contrast agent in order to minimize biofilm contrast agent interactions the injection of the baso4 was done over 12 h at a volumetric flow rate 500 times smaller than the growth flow rate x ray μct scans of the biofilm samples were performed at the swiss federal laboratories for materials science and technology empa dübendorf switzerland on a custom built scanner equipped with a tungsten microfocus source with cone beam configuration and a 40 40 cm2 flat panel detector four frames of 1441 projections were acquired over 3 h at a voltage of 80 kv and focused electron beam current of 125 μa reconstruction was performed as presented in carrel et al 2017 the resolution of the obtained tomograms was of 27 μm a first scan was imaged prior to the injection of the contrast agent in order to obtain the structure of the initial porous media a second scan was imaged after the injection of the contrast agent in order to obtain the biofilm coated porous media the reconstructed tomograms exhibited beam hardening artifacts which were attributed to the polychromatic nature of x rays the high absorption coefficient of barium and the non homogeneous distribution of the contrast agent within it these artifacts were mostly localized near the outermost sides of the anisotropic flow cell therefore a central region of sufficient visualization quality was cropped and used for structural analysis where the artifacts were weaker with dimensions of 20 20 16 mm i e 25 of the total flow cell volume contrast enhancement of the different materials in the tomographic image was effectuated using fiji schindelin et al 2012 a non local mean filter was then run in avizo thermo fisher scientific hillsboro oregon usa to improve the signal to noise ratio segmentation was done using avizo and consisted of watershed segmentation refined with morphological operations closing of the solid grains and the biofilm as well as opening of the air bubbles the air bubbles that entered the flow cell during the injection of the contrast agent were assigned to the liquid phase objects smaller than 10 voxels were discarded before the final data evaluation the procedure presented in pérez reche et al 2012 was used to measure pore radii along the skeleton of the void space additional information concerning the image segmentation is available in the supplementary information 3 bounding boxes fitted to the segmented biofilm patches allowed to extract geometric features of the patches such as their aspect ratio which was obtained by dividing the largest axis of the bounding box by its smallest axis 2 5 registration the x ray segmented data set and the 3d ptv trajectories were registered e g transformed into one coordinate system in order to allow a local investigation of the biofilm flow coupling the registration was performed using a custom registration algorithm in a first step the lagrangian 3d ptv flow information was mapped on a eulerian grid of 81 μm size corresponding to three times the resolution of the x ray data the resolution of the x ray tomograms 27 μm pixels was decreased accordingly for the ease of calculation binning based on voxel averages consecutively a linear transformation was obtained by a discrete pseudo digital volume correlation maximizing the following criterion r i j l m n o v x m i n j o l v p m n o m n o v p m n o where i j and l are the components of the displacement vector d i j l v x is the segmented liquid phase of the volumetric x ray data set and v p is the amount of 3d ptv lagrangian data mapped on the eulerian grid the final r ijl obtained for the different data sets were of 88 67 for the clean porous media and of 76 78 for the bioclogged packing the uncertainty related to the registration can be inferred to partial volume effects due to the decreased resolution of the tomograms and to the accuracy of the 3d ptv fig 2 a d allows assessing the quality of the registration 2 6 calculation of local wall shear stress and concentration boundary layer thickness the registered data provided the basis for a local analysis of hydrodynamic and mass transfer processes a first variable of interest is the wall shear stress τ w defined as τ w μ υ n where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and υ n the velocity gradient defined by the velocity magnitude ν and the vector n normal to the triangulated faces of the solid phase nafion grains or to the biofilm surface n 0 in order to evaluate this velocity gradient the lagrangian data was first binned on an eulerian grid of 100 μm mesh size as the interparticle distance of the 3d ptv data was of ca 50 μm on average the eulerian velocity field obtained after binning was not perfectly filled i e there were empty voxels which were not sampled by any fluid particle the velocity gradients were then interpolated linearly from the eulerian velocity field on the normal of the solid surface nafion grains or biofilm that is for all surface patches where velocity information was available thus providing access to the wall shear stress distribution velocity profiles within pores typically exhibit parabolic profiles de anna et al 2017 the accuracy for the wall shear stress was estimated at 8 by comparing both a linear and a quadratic interpolation of the velocity profile to obtain two different approaches for determining wall shear stress the comparison between the two interpolation methods indicates that the spatial resolution of the velocity map was sufficient to retrieve wall shear stress with satisfying accuracy note that τw was approximated assuming a no slip boundary condition at the biofilm surface and thus non permeable biofilms however several authors showed that biofilms are permeable and have networks of submicroscopic channels davit et al 2013 stoodley et al 1994 since the permeability of biofilms is generally fairly low deng et al 2013 we infer that its influence on the approximation of the wall shear stresses is negligible a second variable of interest that allows assessment of the interplay of mass transfer conditions on biofilm development is the concentration boundary layer thickness δ c the mass transfer coefficient k s d s δ c indicates the rate at which substrate or electron acceptors diffuse over the concentration boundary layer thickness δ c from the bulk of the pore network towards the surface of the grain therefore nutrient limitations are less prone to occur for small concentration boundary layer thicknesses in order to estimate δ c we firstly consider that it is linked to the hydraulic boundary layer thickness δ v as δ c δ v s c 1 3 where the schmidt number s c υ d expresses the ratio of momentum diffusivity υ to mass diffusivity d the thicknesses δ c and δ v are commonly defined as lengths stretching normally from the substratum to the 99th percentile of fully developed concentration or velocity profiles respectively here due to the intricate substratum geometries and velocity profiles the hydraulic boundary layer thickness δ v is approximated by considering the length scale associated with molecular diffusion of momentum as induced by shear as δ v ν υ n this means that the concentration boundary layer thickness δ c is proportional to τ 1 2 w strictly at locations with negligible biofilm the boundary layer thickness should be very small because no appreciable substratum gradient is present this implies that using this approach we likely overestimate δ c in such locations in the comparative analysis below we are interested in the dominant factors that control biofilm growth hence our approach provides an estimate of the local δ c that will develop after biofilm has grown in a given location 3 results 3 1 registered data fig 2 presents the results of the registered 3d ptv and x ray data for the central region of the flow cell for the initial clean porous medium t 0 h in a and after 36 h of biofilm development in b fig 2 c and d are local close ups of a and b the tracer particle trajectories in fig 2 are color coded with the velocity magnitude illustrating the intermittency of velocities along trajectories typical of porous media flows de anna et al 2013 the increasingly darker coding of the velocities along trajectories reflects the average velocity increase additionally biofilm growth induced substantial changes on the flow field compare fig 2 a and b which is restricted to fewer channels in fig 2 b biofilm patches are distributed in between nafion grains note that in fig 2 b the flow information is not distributed homogeneously this could either be caused by flow tracers not sampling stagnation zones or because the view of the particles was obstructed by biofilm patches the close ups in fig 2 c and d show local changes of the flow field upon biofilm growth the biofilm patches illustrated in fig 2 d exhibit a high aspect ratio and an orientation approximately aligned with the initial flow direction upon biofilm growth the channel on the left of the central grain presented in fig 2 d appears to be clogged indicating that growth of a biofilm patch in a pore results in local obstruction of the flow which consequently is compensated by significant hydrodynamic changes fig 2 e and f present triangulated meshes of the biofilm patches presented in the close ups and bounding boxes fitted to each individual patch to extract biofilm size and aspect ratio 3 2 influence of biofilm growth on porescale statistics in order to quantify the influence of biofilm growth on the porescale hydrodynamics we conduct a statistical analysis on relevant variables such as the distributions of average porescale velocities pore radii wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses in the clean and bioclogged porous medium fig 3 presents the probability density functions pdfs which can be considered normalized continuous histograms for the listed variables in the presence and absence of biofilm fig 3 a presents the pdf of the velocity magnitude for the clean and bioclogged porous medium upon biofilm growth there is a slight increase of the average velocity and a substantial increase of the variance as seen in the greater frequency in low and high velocities heavy pdf tailing these increased tailings are typical of flow fields for pore networks of increasing heterogeneity morales et al 2017 siena et al 2014 this indicates that the growing biofilm affects the pore structure and leads to the formation of preferential flow paths increased velocity tails and slow velocity zones increased low velocity tail of the pdf the impact of the biofilm on the pore structure is further confirmed by fig 3 b showing the pore radii distribution for the clean and bioclogged packings with biofilm growth the average pore radius decreases from 0 41 mm to 0 33 mm note that these distributions have an exponential tail typical of pore radii distribution in porous media holzner et al 2015 the wall shear stress distributions obtained are presented in fig 3 c and span a range of over two orders of magnitude with biofilm growth the pore space is reduced and average velocity increased due to mass conservation while the wall shear stresses increase substantially fig 3 d shows the distribution of the concentration boundary layer thicknesses δ c for the clean and bioclogged porous media as a consequence of the wall shear stress increase observed previously the concentration boundary layer thickness decreases accordingly 3 3 local statistical analysis in this section we consider the distributions of variables describing the geometry of the pore network and the local hydrodynamics presented in fig 3 of interest is the investigation of how these variables locally influence the biofilm or are themselves changed by the developing biofilm we consider all the points of pore network s skeleton see fig 2c and investigate whether biofilm patches develop in their vicinity within a distance of one pore radius this allows us to understand how locally flow and mass transfer influence biofilm development for the initial time point at 0 h of biofilm growth this distinction is performed with hindsight for nafion faces on which biofilm will develop bf 0 or those on which it will not n 0 for the bioclogged data at 36 h of biofilm growth the distinction is made by classifying surfaces with observable biofilm development bf 36 or nafion grain surfaces that remained uncolonized n 36 fig 4 a and b show the pdfs of the porescale velocity magnitude in the vicinity of the developing biofilm bf and on uncolonized channels n before and after biofilm growth the pdfs do not show appreciable differences indicating that the porescale velocities do not directly influence the biofilm development fig 4 c and d show a similar comparison for the pore radii before and after biofilm growth here a noticeable difference emerges as the pore radii where the biofilm initially develops are on average smaller than in channels where no biofilm grows additionally the pore radii in the biofilm vicinity after 36 h of growth show a substantial shift in distribution see fig 4 d toward smaller overall pores particularly in the vicinity of the biofilm this suggests an increase of the biofilm specific surface area which is a key parameter for the estimation of mass transfer characteristics within biofilms horn and lackner 2014 the distributions of the wall shear stress values obtained for the surface of the clean nafion grains solid lines and for the surface of the nascent biofilm dashed lines are shown in fig 5 at a time prior to biofilm growth a and after biofilm growth b although the distribution of wall shear stresses is wide with and without biofilm presence a strong difference between the two types of surfaces is noticeable from these data it is possible to note that the maximal wall shear stress for the surfaces that will not be colonized by the biofilm are about twice as large as those where nascent biofilm is found at 36 h substantial differences are also observed for the concentration boundary layer thicknesses depicted in fig 5 c and d no biofilms were observed to colonize or develop in the high wall shear stress regions despite the small concentration boundary layers present there corroborating that wall shear stress controls biofilm development in the present experiment we conjecture from these data that too small pores do have sufficient flux of nutrients to sustain biofilm growth mainly diffusion is the mechanism for nutrient mass transfer which can be limiting too large pores experience high shear which we interpret to be hydrodynamically unfavourable for biofilms to become established presumably the high wall shear detaches nascent colonies and thus prevents significant eps from developing 3 4 morphology of the biofilm patches fig 6 a shows the pdf of the biofilm patch size which follows a power law distribution where the probability approximately decreases with the inverse of the size fig 6 b shows the correlation of biofilm patch sizes with average pore radii of the clean porous medium in which the patches grew over the course of the experiment the biofilm patch size increases with the pore radii which is expected since the biofilm patches are confined by the radii the largest biofilm patches are found for average radii of 0 47 mm slightly larger than the average radius of the porous medium r p 0 41 mm where the angular brackets denote an average performed over all measured radii the largest radii appear to be associated with rather small biofilm patches the wide distribution of the biofilm patch sizes indicates that there is no simple direct relation between the patch size and the pore radii fig 6 c shows the pdf of the biofilm patches aspect ratio which is widely distributed and displays a rather high average indicating that elongated shapes are not atypical fig 6 d shows the correlation of biofilm patch size to aspect ratio indicating that the maximal size of the biofilm patches decreases with increasing aspect ratio the pdf of the biofilm thickness defined as the distance between the biofilm faces to the closest grain faces is presented in fig 6 e the wide range of biofilm thicknesses observed reflects the patchiness of the biofilm morphologies visible in fig 3 e and f finally fig 6 f depicts the correlation of biofilm thickness with initial wall shear stress showing that the maximal biofilm thickness tends to decrease with increasing wall shear stresses 3 5 relation between porescale velocities and radii fig 7 shows joint pdfs of the normalized velocity and of the normalized pore radius for the clean porous medium a and the bioclogged medium b holzner et al 2015 conjectured the dependence of the maximum porescale velocity υ m on the pore radius r p according to the power law υ m υ 0 r p r 0 α 2 α 2 where ν 0 and r 0 represent characteristic velocities and pore radii the exponent α is a parameter reflecting the pore network geometry and stretches from 2 for a completely serial pore arrangement few pathways through which water can flow to 2 for a completely parallel one many equally probably pathways for water to flow the limits to this power law scaling are indicated in fig 7 as a dashed dotted and a dashed line the white circles show the conditional average of ν ν on r p r p and the continuous line shows a power law fitted to the conditional average the fitted exponent is noted as imbedded text in the figures the width of the joint pdfs of v v and r p r p increases with biofilm growth but are found within the scaling corresponding to completely parallel or serial pore arrangements the exponents measured decrease from 0 257 to 0 063 reflecting how the pore arrangement changes from parallel towards more serial with biofilm growth 4 discussion 4 1 how does the growth of the biofilm depend on the local wall shear stress and local mass transfer processes the overarching goal of this study is to provide experimental evidence allowing to delineate the influence of porous medium geometry flow and mass transfer processes on the formation of biofilms in a 3d porous medium the results obtained indicate that in 3d porous media representative of some natural and engineering systems biofilms are exposed to wide distributions of wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses biofilm especially tends to develop in low wall shear stress regions fig 5 a and b after 36 h of growth results from x ray μct and 3d ptv revealed that biofilm formation occurred in the regions of low shear stresses while no or very low biofilm formation was observed in the regions of high shear stresses conversely mass transfer did not seem to play any role consistent with presence of nutrient and electron acceptors in excess had mass transfer been a key variable we would expect less biofilm to develop in the regions where the concentration boundary layer is thick see fig 5 c and d it is important to note that this differs but does not conflict with studies on bacteria adhesion to clean surfaces which are found to preferentially accumulate in high shear regions rusconi et al 2014 those studies focus on the initial adhesion of biofilm forming cells while the current work concentrates on biofilm development of uniformly attached cells on all grains surfaces which we observe is shaped by the local hydrodynamics the average of the wall shear stress distributions presented in fig 5 a and b in the vicinity of the biofilm and at the surface of the bare grains shows a ca 1 8 fold increase over the course of the experiment see table 1 the increase of the maximal wall shear stress measured is substantially higher 2 5 for the bare grains than at the biofilm surface 1 4 differences in the increase of the maximal values measured for the biofilm compared to the bare grains suggests that there is a threshold shear stress in the system that the biofilm cannot withstand this would imply a biofilm shear or cohesive strength of ca 0 02 n m2 which is on the lower end of biofilm shear strengths observed experimentally elsewhere stewart 2014 the largest biofilm patch sizes were found in pores of radii close to the average radii but the wide distribution observed for the patch sizes did not indicate that the local geometry of the pore network was substantially influencing biofilm development the maximal thickness of the biofilm patches decreased with increasing wall shear stress showing that for the given porous medium and under the present growth conditions the wall shear stress played a predominant role on controlling biofilm development 4 2 what is the influence of the growing biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics the prevalence of low wall shear stresses in the vicinity of the biofilms could be attributed to the impact of the growing biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics coyte et al 2017 showed that the local development of a tiny biofilm patch induced an additional pressure drop at a given location of the pore network which resulted in substantial non local changes in the overall flow field in the present study the flow rate was kept constant over the course of the experiment invoking mass conservation and assuming that the biofilm is homogeneously distributed over a typical cylindrical pore thullner and baveye 2008 would mean that the average velocity would increase in an inverse quadratic relation relative to the pore radius υ q π r 2 see dashed dotted lines on fig 7 however as the data presented in this study show the biofilm is not homogeneously distributed at the grain surface furthermore even if the flow rate were kept constant such that the pressure gradient increased at the flow cell scale locally it is possible to have zones with only small pressure gradient variations for similar pressure gradients according to poiseuille s law the velocity is proportional to the square of the radius υ r 2 see dashed lines on fig 7 so that low velocity regions or stagnant zones can form with biofilm growth these considerations suggest that predicting the local impact of the growth of biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics is far from trivial as for example porescale velocities could increase or decrease with the pore radius variation the complex interactions between biofilm development and porescale hydrodynamics is illustrated by the radius velocity relation presented in fig 7 the experimental data presented in this study shows that there is a formation of high velocity regions as also indicated by the high velocity tails of the velocity magnitude pdfs fig 3 a 4 3 significance to our knowledge our work is one of the first experimental studies of the biofilm shear strength in three dimensional porous media it is important to note that the small wall shear stress values obtained here are of the same order of magnitude than values obtained elsewhere for low reynolds number flows nadell et al 2017 song et al 2014 if we consider variability in shear strengths from different types of biofilms the direct measurements of wall shear strength presented here are on the lower end of values reported in other studies 0 1 to more than 10 000 n m2 as reported in möhle et al 2007 derlon et al 2008 or stewart 2014 the ability of measuring in situ the biofilm shear strength in 3d porous media opens several research opportunities namely to use this approach for the validation of numerical models numerical models often rely on default values of biofilm shear strengths obtained from the literature bottero et al 2013 pintelon et al 2012 our results however underline the risk associated with using generic values for the biofilm shear strength because these values might relate to non relevant growth conditions and thus overestimate this system parameter the experimental method introduced in our study allows to access realistic biofilm shear strengths in 3d porous media with an accuracy of about 8 we suggest that this approach can hence be used to validate assumptions made for numerical models of biofilm formation in 3d porous media providing distributions of wall shear stress values local to the biofilm given that both optical camera setups and laboratory x ray scanners become more and more a standard equipment of many laboratories our approach offers a viable method to resolve the geometry of the porous media in conjunction with the biofilm morphology as well as distribution of the local wall shear stresses a limitation of our method is that the x rays might inactivate cells of the biofilm which would impact subsequent measurements of biofilm morphology in this study we have analyzed only one bioclogged state t 36 h and we have not quantified this possible influence which therefore remains a subject of future work possible alternative methods which would not suffer from this limitation are based on magnetic resonance microscopy adapting the approach introduced by wagner et al 2010b to 3d porous media or by combining 3d geometries obtained from x ray micro tomography with numerical studies of coupled flow and biofilm growth peszynska et al 2016 each of these approaches ptv x ray combination magnetic resonance and x ray numerical simulation combination has its own strengths and weaknesses with respect to spatial resolution accuracy and assumptions made concerning biofilm flow coupling the magnetic resonance approach offers even finer 50 μm spatial resolution than the present approach and does not require index matching or referencing between flow and biofilm data because all phases are extracted from the same data set however it is not trivial to distinguish between flow in pore spaces and fluid inside biofilms because biofilms tend to be permeable and the magnetic resonance signal also captures flow inside the biofilm e g seymour et al 2004 numerical simulations based on x ray geometries offer very high resolution and accuracy however assumptions must be made for example concerning the permeability of the biofilm or biofilm growth e g graf von der schulenburg et al 2009 bottero et al 2013 there is therefore no best approach but rather the optimal method should be chosen depending on the specific setup and research goal in mind 5 conclusions this study presents experimental measurements on porescale hydrodynamics porespace structure and biofilm morphology in a progressively bioclogged porous medium with the aim of delineating the influence of the porespace geometry wall shear stresses and mass transfer processes on biofilm growth the local wall shear stress measurements revealed that the attachment and development of biofilm patches was controlled by the local wall shear stress biofilm formation occurred in the regions of low shear stresses while no significant amount of biofilm grew in the regions of high shear stresses biofilms were found at local wall shear stresses up to 0 02 n which defines a maximal shear strength of the biofilm in the porous medium mass transfer processes played a secondary role for growth consistent with presence of nutrient and electron acceptors in excess in our experiments the development of biofilm substantially influenced the porescale hydrodynamics as shown by the significant increase of the pore velocities and wall shear stresses both in terms of average value and variance given that the flow rate was kept constant the increase of average pore velocity is a consequence of the porosity reduction upon biofilm growth however growth was not homogeneous in space and resulted in the clogging of certain pores so that the pore scale flow arrangement changed from a predominantly parallel configuration towards a more serial one this is a manifestation of the formation of preferential flow pathways in the bioclogged porous medium we propose that based on this method measured biofilm shear strength could be used to validate models used in numerical simulations of biofilm growth in porous media furthermore the growth conditions used in the current study could be tailored to provide experimental data for practical applications that seek to optimize biofilm thickness or specific surface area and that upscale mass transfer processes to practically relevant scales of sand or trickling filters finally with the fast pace of development of 3d printing technology in terms of printable materials geometries and scales accessible the 3d printing of nafion carrico et al 2015 might soon allow similar investigations in other geometries non granular porous media membrane feed spacer channels and at scales

19709,this study investigates the functional correspondence between porescale hydrodynamics mass transfer pore structure and biofilm morphology during progressive biofilm colonization of a porous medium hydrodynamics and the structure of both the porous medium and the biofilm are experimentally measured with 3d particle tracking velocimetry and micro x ray computed tomography respectively the analysis focuses on data obtained in a clean porous medium after 36 h of biofilm growth registration of the particle tracking and x ray data sets allows to delineate the interplay between porous medium geometry hydrodynamic and mass transfer processes on the morphology of the developing biofilm a local analysis revealed wide distributions of wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses the spatial distribution of the biofilm patches uncovered that the wall shear stresses controlled the biofilm development neither external nor internal mass transfer limitations were noticeable in the considered system consistent with the excess supply of nutrient and electron acceptors the wall shear stress remained constant in the vicinity of the biofilm but increased

concentration boundary layer thickness biofilm morphology 1 introduction biofilms are communities of bacteria attaching and developing on surfaces embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps and persistently developing in environmental medical and industrial settings in porous media such as soils many prokaryotic microorganisms develop a sessile lifestyle that allows them to better cope with their environment griebler and lueders 2009 as biofilms are ubiquitous in porous media systems their relevance stretches over a wide range of applications spanning from the bioremediation of contaminated aquifers meckenstock et al 2015 fixed bed trickling filters gujer and boller 1986 morgenroth et al 1996 gülay et al 2014 or membrane filtration systems baker and dudley 1998 for all these different applications biofilm formation can have a positive or detrimental impact therefore understanding biofilm development in respect to the local geometry of the pore network the porescale hydrodynamics and mass transfer processes is a prerequisite for optimal biofilm control the investigation of these processes requires access to wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer distributions eberl et al 2000 picioreanu et al 2000 based on locally resolved flow and structural information the development of biofilms in porous media is a process involving a wide range of scales from micro over meso to macroscale battin et al 2007 for instance microscale hydrodynamics were shown to control the initial attachment of individual bacteria or particulate matter to surfaces rusconi et al 2014 radu et al 2014 the macroscale is the scale relevant for the integrated understanding of larger engineering or natural systems e g reactors aquifers the mesoscale links the micro and the macroscale as it is the scale at which flow and mass transfer interact with and define the biofilm structures eberl et al 2000 the focus of this study is the mesoscale in porous media or porescale the processes that drive growth of biofilms are complicated by the complexity of the pore space in which they grow in natural porous media and by the feedback mechanisms between pore clogging from biofilm growth and solute transport to deliver nutrients and carry away wastes subtle changes to the pore structure have been reported to affect pore velocities and characteristic length scales i e pore radii by orders of magnitude seymour et al 2004 holzner et al 2015 porous media can be considered as networks of connected three dimensional roughness elements or corners representative of e g soils or filters but also of many other pore scale environments in which biofilms develop biofilm development in porous structures result from highly diverse and complex phenomena for instance the growth of biofilms was identified to induce the formation of preferential flow paths while the interplay between biofilm growth detachment decay and lysis was numerically shown to cause the intermittent shifting of these flow paths bottero et al 2013 locally the intricate geometry of the pore network and the evolving flow field during biofilm growth influence competition between bacterial communities as slow growing or non eps producing bacteria can outcompete fast growing or eps producing ones coyte et al 2017 nadell et al 2017 various studies of biofilm formation at the porescale mainly considered porous media with two dimensional pore networks either experimentally drescher et al 2013 qian et al 2017 or numerically kapellos et al 2007 the use of new imaging methods such as optical coherence tomography oct allows linking biofilm formation to local hydrodynamic conditions and overall system performances xi et al 2006 wagner et al 2010a derlon et al 2012 oct allows imaging the biofilm physical structure at the meso scale but oct can also be combined with fluid flow modeling to study flow dynamics gao et al 2014 weiss et al 2015 however the penetration depth of the oct s signal is limited to around 2 mm in biofilms which restrains the application of oct for monitoring biofilm formation in 3d porous media another relevant method is magnetic resonance imaging mri mri has been used to investigate transport processes in progressively bioclogged 3d porous media at the pore seymour et al 2004 and at the darcy scale codd et al 2011 wagner et al 2010b used mri to study the link between the biofilm formation in a tubular reactor and its influence on the 3d velocity distribution results from mri imaging revealed that biofilm patches could resist maximum local shear stresses up to seven times higher than the mean ones however several aspects limit a wide application of mri to study of biofilm formation in porous media access to device cost of the apparatus and use of dedicated flow cells adapted to the mri etc despite recent progresses the availability of experimental methods to provide information about both the porescale flow and biofilm development in fully 3d porous media remains limited experimental data on porescale biofilm properties and hydrodynamics are also required to validate numerical models developed to predict biofilm formation in porous media a parameter of interest is the biofilm shear strength the resistance of biofilms to shear exerted by the surrounding fluid the biofilm shear strength is experimentally challenging to measure and vary with the growth conditions and bacterial type yet many models often use a default value of the biofilms shear strength that may not be representative of their biofilms thus highlighting the need for direct measurements of biofilm shear strength in 3d porous media this is reinforced by the wide distributions of biofilm shear strengths mentioned in recent studies e g stewart 2014 which can be attributed to the natural heterogeneous distribution of material properties of biofilms stewart and franklin 2008 but also to the distribution of wall shear stresses exerted by fluid flow on biofilms as a consequence of velocity gradients in the biofilm vicinity stewart 2014 additionally the wall shear stresses exerted on the biofilm are very often roughly approximated based on the initial hydrodynamic conditions derlon et al 2008 blauert et al 2015 thus not accounting for the effect of the biofilm formation on the flow which increases the uncertainty of the assumed biofilm shear strength the goal of this paper is thus to experimentally investigate the influence of porescale hydrodynamics and mass transfer processes specifically wall shear stress and concentration boundary layer distribution functions on biofilm development in a transparent 3d porous media a biofilm was grown in a 3d porous medium for 36 h under a constant volumetric flow rate with nutrients and electron acceptors supplied in excess the hydrodynamics were measured at the porescale with three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry 3d ptv in a clean porous medium and after biofilm growth the structure of the porous medium along with the morphology and spatial distribution of the biofilm were obtained with x ray micro computed tomography x ray μct the novel combination of hydrodynamic and structural data permit direct measurements of the feedback mechanisms between biofilm patch development and the fluid dynamics at the porescale to answer the following research questions how does the growth of the biofilm depend on the local wall shear stress and local mass transfer processes what is the influence of the growing biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics pore scale velocities wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses 2 material and methods 2 1 porous medium the porous medium used in this work consists of nafion pellets ion power munich germany a material with physico chemical properties similar to that of sand grains downie et al 2012 the diameter d n of the pellets is roughly monodisperse and distributed around 2 5 0 5 mm nafion is an iono polymer whose optical refractive index can easily be matched rim with aqueous solutions yielding models of transparent soil downie et al 2012 here a decent rim was obtained with a glucose concentration of 11 w v see supplementary information 1 for a detailed analysis concerning the refractive index matching optimization the nafion pellets underwent three times the following treatment allowing optimal transparency approximately 20 g of pellets were heated up at 65 c for 1 h while stirred at 200 rpm under reflux afterwards the pellets were cooled for 30 min at room temperature and stored overnight at 4 c 2 2 biofilm cultivation the 11 w v glucose solution used as a growth medium in this study was prepared with tap water in order to enhance the growth of the heterotrophic biofilm cultivated in this experiment nitrogen and phosphorus were added to a molar ratio c n p of 1000 1 1 this low ratio is due to the high glucose concentration that was not only serving as a carbon source but also provided the refractive index matching with the nafion grains nitrate nano3 was here serving both as nitrogen source and electron acceptor phosphorus was added as k2hpo4 and nah2po4 2h2oaccounting for 1 3 and 2 3 respectively of the total phosphorus molecular ratio yielding inflow concentrations of 8 14 mg no3 n l and 18 9 mg po4 3 p l the mixed species bacterial inoculum used in this study was isolated from the chriesbach river dübendorf switzerland desmond et al 2018 the frozen bacterial inoculum contained in 2 ml eppendorf tubes was added to 100 ml of the growth medium it was then incubated for 20 24 h at 30 c and stirred at 200 rpm until reaching midlogarithmic phase od600 0 52 0 096 the incubation procedure was repeated three consecutive times for the bacteria to adapt to the synthetic carbon source of the growth medium for the last incubation cycle the nafion grains were added to the growth medium to allow initial bacterial attachment upon the incubation a custom built pmma flow cell 38 38 16 mm3 was wet packed with the inoculated nafion grains bottles containing 10 l of growth medium were connected to the flow cell with silicon tubing vwr dietikon switzerland previously washed with 70 v v ethanol and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water the growth medium was replaced every 12 h and spiked with 100 ml of the inoculum a peristaltic pump ismatec glattbrugg switzerland was used to set a volumetric flow rate of 10 ml min as illustrated in fig 1 a a syringe was used as a bubble trap as well as to dampen the pulsatile flow created by the peristaltic pump nitrate and oxygen concentration were sampled in the effluent every 12 h and revealed a high bacterial activity but no actual nutrient limitations 4 41 0 67 mg no3 n l and 4 84 0 55 mg o2 l respectively 2 3 three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry the three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry 3d ptv method applied in this work allows for detection and tracking of flow particle tracers which move faithfully with the porewater tracking the position of tracer particles provides data on velocity and acceleration along flow trajectories this method was developed to study turbulent flows hoyer et al 2005 and was lately adapted to study flows in porous media holzner et al 2015 in order to perform 3d ptv measurements the flow cell was connected to a 120 ml syringe mounted on a syringe pump lambda vit fit lambda baar switzerland the volumetric flow rate was set to 10 ml min yielding a darcy velocity q of 0 27 mm s the estimated reynolds number was re q d n ν 0 5 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the glucose aqueous solution ν 1 33 e 6 m2 s at 20 c the tracer particles were composed of fluorescent red polyethylene microspheres cospheric santa barbara ca usa with a density of 1 g cm3 and with a diameter d p of ca 70 μm 90 between 63 and 75 μm were added to the growth medium to create a suspension as these particles are neutrally buoyant inertial effects are not of concern and the particles follow the flow reliably holzner et al 2015 for each 3d ptv measurement the tracer particle concentration added is of 0 02 g l corresponding to a volume fraction of 0 002 which is low enough to ensure that particle particle interactions were not of concern the fluorescent tracer particles were illuminated with a 100 w pulsed nd ylf laser λ 527 nm darwin duo quantronix hamden usa fig 1 b shows the setup used for the 3d ptv experiments the flow cell was imaged from both the front and back sides with a photron fastcam sa5 with a resolution of 1024 1024 at 50 frames per second fps using an image splitter providing 4 stereoscopic views between 30 and 200 particles were tracked per frame yielding ca 106 data points for every measurement 4549 and 4193 trajectories for the time points t 0 and t 36 h respectively and 3d particle locations with an accuracy of ca 50 μm holzner et al 2015 assuming stationarity of the porescale flow and neglecting structural changes induced by biofilm growth during 3d ptv experiments ca 30 min an estimated average inter particle distance of ca 50 μm was obtained additional information about processing of the 3d ptv data and extraction of the wall shear stresses is available in the supplementary information 2 2 4 x ray micro tomography biofilms form porous structures up to 90 porosity wagner et al 2010a with high water content and densities very close to that of water thus the application of x ray micro tomography to biofilm imaging requires the addition of contrast agents here we follow the approach presented by davit et al 2011 and use a suspension of 0 05 g ml barium sulfate baso4 particles micropaque guerbet zürich switzerland as a contrast agent that emphasizes the porespace free of biofilm davit et al 2011 noted the occurrence of biofilm detachment occurring during the baso4 injection carrel et al 2017 suggested to use iron sulfate feso4 as a contrast agent by continuously adding it to the biofilm during culturing and thus avoiding detachment however this approach could not be applied here without negatively affecting the rim therefore baso4 was used as a contrast agent in order to minimize biofilm contrast agent interactions the injection of the baso4 was done over 12 h at a volumetric flow rate 500 times smaller than the growth flow rate x ray μct scans of the biofilm samples were performed at the swiss federal laboratories for materials science and technology empa dübendorf switzerland on a custom built scanner equipped with a tungsten microfocus source with cone beam configuration and a 40 40 cm2 flat panel detector four frames of 1441 projections were acquired over 3 h at a voltage of 80 kv and focused electron beam current of 125 μa reconstruction was performed as presented in carrel et al 2017 the resolution of the obtained tomograms was of 27 μm a first scan was imaged prior to the injection of the contrast agent in order to obtain the structure of the initial porous media a second scan was imaged after the injection of the contrast agent in order to obtain the biofilm coated porous media the reconstructed tomograms exhibited beam hardening artifacts which were attributed to the polychromatic nature of x rays the high absorption coefficient of barium and the non homogeneous distribution of the contrast agent within it these artifacts were mostly localized near the outermost sides of the anisotropic flow cell therefore a central region of sufficient visualization quality was cropped and used for structural analysis where the artifacts were weaker with dimensions of 20 20 16 mm i e 25 of the total flow cell volume contrast enhancement of the different materials in the tomographic image was effectuated using fiji schindelin et al 2012 a non local mean filter was then run in avizo thermo fisher scientific hillsboro oregon usa to improve the signal to noise ratio segmentation was done using avizo and consisted of watershed segmentation refined with morphological operations closing of the solid grains and the biofilm as well as opening of the air bubbles the air bubbles that entered the flow cell during the injection of the contrast agent were assigned to the liquid phase objects smaller than 10 voxels were discarded before the final data evaluation the procedure presented in pérez reche et al 2012 was used to measure pore radii along the skeleton of the void space additional information concerning the image segmentation is available in the supplementary information 3 bounding boxes fitted to the segmented biofilm patches allowed to extract geometric features of the patches such as their aspect ratio which was obtained by dividing the largest axis of the bounding box by its smallest axis 2 5 registration the x ray segmented data set and the 3d ptv trajectories were registered e g transformed into one coordinate system in order to allow a local investigation of the biofilm flow coupling the registration was performed using a custom registration algorithm in a first step the lagrangian 3d ptv flow information was mapped on a eulerian grid of 81 μm size corresponding to three times the resolution of the x ray data the resolution of the x ray tomograms 27 μm pixels was decreased accordingly for the ease of calculation binning based on voxel averages consecutively a linear transformation was obtained by a discrete pseudo digital volume correlation maximizing the following criterion r i j l m n o v x m i n j o l v p m n o m n o v p m n o where i j and l are the components of the displacement vector d i j l v x is the segmented liquid phase of the volumetric x ray data set and v p is the amount of 3d ptv lagrangian data mapped on the eulerian grid the final r ijl obtained for the different data sets were of 88 67 for the clean porous media and of 76 78 for the bioclogged packing the uncertainty related to the registration can be inferred to partial volume effects due to the decreased resolution of the tomograms and to the accuracy of the 3d ptv fig 2 a d allows assessing the quality of the registration 2 6 calculation of local wall shear stress and concentration boundary layer thickness the registered data provided the basis for a local analysis of hydrodynamic and mass transfer processes a first variable of interest is the wall shear stress τ w defined as τ w μ υ n where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and υ n the velocity gradient defined by the velocity magnitude ν and the vector n normal to the triangulated faces of the solid phase nafion grains or to the biofilm surface n 0 in order to evaluate this velocity gradient the lagrangian data was first binned on an eulerian grid of 100 μm mesh size as the interparticle distance of the 3d ptv data was of ca 50 μm on average the eulerian velocity field obtained after binning was not perfectly filled i e there were empty voxels which were not sampled by any fluid particle the velocity gradients were then interpolated linearly from the eulerian velocity field on the normal of the solid surface nafion grains or biofilm that is for all surface patches where velocity information was available thus providing access to the wall shear stress distribution velocity profiles within pores typically exhibit parabolic profiles de anna et al 2017 the accuracy for the wall shear stress was estimated at 8 by comparing both a linear and a quadratic interpolation of the velocity profile to obtain two different approaches for determining wall shear stress the comparison between the two interpolation methods indicates that the spatial resolution of the velocity map was sufficient to retrieve wall shear stress with satisfying accuracy note that τw was approximated assuming a no slip boundary condition at the biofilm surface and thus non permeable biofilms however several authors showed that biofilms are permeable and have networks of submicroscopic channels davit et al 2013 stoodley et al 1994 since the permeability of biofilms is generally fairly low deng et al 2013 we infer that its influence on the approximation of the wall shear stresses is negligible a second variable of interest that allows assessment of the interplay of mass transfer conditions on biofilm development is the concentration boundary layer thickness δ c the mass transfer coefficient k s d s δ c indicates the rate at which substrate or electron acceptors diffuse over the concentration boundary layer thickness δ c from the bulk of the pore network towards the surface of the grain therefore nutrient limitations are less prone to occur for small concentration boundary layer thicknesses in order to estimate δ c we firstly consider that it is linked to the hydraulic boundary layer thickness δ v as δ c δ v s c 1 3 where the schmidt number s c υ d expresses the ratio of momentum diffusivity υ to mass diffusivity d the thicknesses δ c and δ v are commonly defined as lengths stretching normally from the substratum to the 99th percentile of fully developed concentration or velocity profiles respectively here due to the intricate substratum geometries and velocity profiles the hydraulic boundary layer thickness δ v is approximated by considering the length scale associated with molecular diffusion of momentum as induced by shear as δ v ν υ n this means that the concentration boundary layer thickness δ c is proportional to τ 1 2 w strictly at locations with negligible biofilm the boundary layer thickness should be very small because no appreciable substratum gradient is present this implies that using this approach we likely overestimate δ c in such locations in the comparative analysis below we are interested in the dominant factors that control biofilm growth hence our approach provides an estimate of the local δ c that will develop after biofilm has grown in a given location 3 results 3 1 registered data fig 2 presents the results of the registered 3d ptv and x ray data for the central region of the flow cell for the initial clean porous medium t 0 h in a and after 36 h of biofilm development in b fig 2 c and d are local close ups of a and b the tracer particle trajectories in fig 2 are color coded with the velocity magnitude illustrating the intermittency of velocities along trajectories typical of porous media flows de anna et al 2013 the increasingly darker coding of the velocities along trajectories reflects the average velocity increase additionally biofilm growth induced substantial changes on the flow field compare fig 2 a and b which is restricted to fewer channels in fig 2 b biofilm patches are distributed in between nafion grains note that in fig 2 b the flow information is not distributed homogeneously this could either be caused by flow tracers not sampling stagnation zones or because the view of the particles was obstructed by biofilm patches the close ups in fig 2 c and d show local changes of the flow field upon biofilm growth the biofilm patches illustrated in fig 2 d exhibit a high aspect ratio and an orientation approximately aligned with the initial flow direction upon biofilm growth the channel on the left of the central grain presented in fig 2 d appears to be clogged indicating that growth of a biofilm patch in a pore results in local obstruction of the flow which consequently is compensated by significant hydrodynamic changes fig 2 e and f present triangulated meshes of the biofilm patches presented in the close ups and bounding boxes fitted to each individual patch to extract biofilm size and aspect ratio 3 2 influence of biofilm growth on porescale statistics in order to quantify the influence of biofilm growth on the porescale hydrodynamics we conduct a statistical analysis on relevant variables such as the distributions of average porescale velocities pore radii wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses in the clean and bioclogged porous medium fig 3 presents the probability density functions pdfs which can be considered normalized continuous histograms for the listed variables in the presence and absence of biofilm fig 3 a presents the pdf of the velocity magnitude for the clean and bioclogged porous medium upon biofilm growth there is a slight increase of the average velocity and a substantial increase of the variance as seen in the greater frequency in low and high velocities heavy pdf tailing these increased tailings are typical of flow fields for pore networks of increasing heterogeneity morales et al 2017 siena et al 2014 this indicates that the growing biofilm affects the pore structure and leads to the formation of preferential flow paths increased velocity tails and slow velocity zones increased low velocity tail of the pdf the impact of the biofilm on the pore structure is further confirmed by fig 3 b showing the pore radii distribution for the clean and bioclogged packings with biofilm growth the average pore radius decreases from 0 41 mm to 0 33 mm note that these distributions have an exponential tail typical of pore radii distribution in porous media holzner et al 2015 the wall shear stress distributions obtained are presented in fig 3 c and span a range of over two orders of magnitude with biofilm growth the pore space is reduced and average velocity increased due to mass conservation while the wall shear stresses increase substantially fig 3 d shows the distribution of the concentration boundary layer thicknesses δ c for the clean and bioclogged porous media as a consequence of the wall shear stress increase observed previously the concentration boundary layer thickness decreases accordingly 3 3 local statistical analysis in this section we consider the distributions of variables describing the geometry of the pore network and the local hydrodynamics presented in fig 3 of interest is the investigation of how these variables locally influence the biofilm or are themselves changed by the developing biofilm we consider all the points of pore network s skeleton see fig 2c and investigate whether biofilm patches develop in their vicinity within a distance of one pore radius this allows us to understand how locally flow and mass transfer influence biofilm development for the initial time point at 0 h of biofilm growth this distinction is performed with hindsight for nafion faces on which biofilm will develop bf 0 or those on which it will not n 0 for the bioclogged data at 36 h of biofilm growth the distinction is made by classifying surfaces with observable biofilm development bf 36 or nafion grain surfaces that remained uncolonized n 36 fig 4 a and b show the pdfs of the porescale velocity magnitude in the vicinity of the developing biofilm bf and on uncolonized channels n before and after biofilm growth the pdfs do not show appreciable differences indicating that the porescale velocities do not directly influence the biofilm development fig 4 c and d show a similar comparison for the pore radii before and after biofilm growth here a noticeable difference emerges as the pore radii where the biofilm initially develops are on average smaller than in channels where no biofilm grows additionally the pore radii in the biofilm vicinity after 36 h of growth show a substantial shift in distribution see fig 4 d toward smaller overall pores particularly in the vicinity of the biofilm this suggests an increase of the biofilm specific surface area which is a key parameter for the estimation of mass transfer characteristics within biofilms horn and lackner 2014 the distributions of the wall shear stress values obtained for the surface of the clean nafion grains solid lines and for the surface of the nascent biofilm dashed lines are shown in fig 5 at a time prior to biofilm growth a and after biofilm growth b although the distribution of wall shear stresses is wide with and without biofilm presence a strong difference between the two types of surfaces is noticeable from these data it is possible to note that the maximal wall shear stress for the surfaces that will not be colonized by the biofilm are about twice as large as those where nascent biofilm is found at 36 h substantial differences are also observed for the concentration boundary layer thicknesses depicted in fig 5 c and d no biofilms were observed to colonize or develop in the high wall shear stress regions despite the small concentration boundary layers present there corroborating that wall shear stress controls biofilm development in the present experiment we conjecture from these data that too small pores do have sufficient flux of nutrients to sustain biofilm growth mainly diffusion is the mechanism for nutrient mass transfer which can be limiting too large pores experience high shear which we interpret to be hydrodynamically unfavourable for biofilms to become established presumably the high wall shear detaches nascent colonies and thus prevents significant eps from developing 3 4 morphology of the biofilm patches fig 6 a shows the pdf of the biofilm patch size which follows a power law distribution where the probability approximately decreases with the inverse of the size fig 6 b shows the correlation of biofilm patch sizes with average pore radii of the clean porous medium in which the patches grew over the course of the experiment the biofilm patch size increases with the pore radii which is expected since the biofilm patches are confined by the radii the largest biofilm patches are found for average radii of 0 47 mm slightly larger than the average radius of the porous medium r p 0 41 mm where the angular brackets denote an average performed over all measured radii the largest radii appear to be associated with rather small biofilm patches the wide distribution of the biofilm patch sizes indicates that there is no simple direct relation between the patch size and the pore radii fig 6 c shows the pdf of the biofilm patches aspect ratio which is widely distributed and displays a rather high average indicating that elongated shapes are not atypical fig 6 d shows the correlation of biofilm patch size to aspect ratio indicating that the maximal size of the biofilm patches decreases with increasing aspect ratio the pdf of the biofilm thickness defined as the distance between the biofilm faces to the closest grain faces is presented in fig 6 e the wide range of biofilm thicknesses observed reflects the patchiness of the biofilm morphologies visible in fig 3 e and f finally fig 6 f depicts the correlation of biofilm thickness with initial wall shear stress showing that the maximal biofilm thickness tends to decrease with increasing wall shear stresses 3 5 relation between porescale velocities and radii fig 7 shows joint pdfs of the normalized velocity and of the normalized pore radius for the clean porous medium a and the bioclogged medium b holzner et al 2015 conjectured the dependence of the maximum porescale velocity υ m on the pore radius r p according to the power law υ m υ 0 r p r 0 α 2 α 2 where ν 0 and r 0 represent characteristic velocities and pore radii the exponent α is a parameter reflecting the pore network geometry and stretches from 2 for a completely serial pore arrangement few pathways through which water can flow to 2 for a completely parallel one many equally probably pathways for water to flow the limits to this power law scaling are indicated in fig 7 as a dashed dotted and a dashed line the white circles show the conditional average of ν ν on r p r p and the continuous line shows a power law fitted to the conditional average the fitted exponent is noted as imbedded text in the figures the width of the joint pdfs of v v and r p r p increases with biofilm growth but are found within the scaling corresponding to completely parallel or serial pore arrangements the exponents measured decrease from 0 257 to 0 063 reflecting how the pore arrangement changes from parallel towards more serial with biofilm growth 4 discussion 4 1 how does the growth of the biofilm depend on the local wall shear stress and local mass transfer processes the overarching goal of this study is to provide experimental evidence allowing to delineate the influence of porous medium geometry flow and mass transfer processes on the formation of biofilms in a 3d porous medium the results obtained indicate that in 3d porous media representative of some natural and engineering systems biofilms are exposed to wide distributions of wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses biofilm especially tends to develop in low wall shear stress regions fig 5 a and b after 36 h of growth results from x ray μct and 3d ptv revealed that biofilm formation occurred in the regions of low shear stresses while no or very low biofilm formation was observed in the regions of high shear stresses conversely mass transfer did not seem to play any role consistent with presence of nutrient and electron acceptors in excess had mass transfer been a key variable we would expect less biofilm to develop in the regions where the concentration boundary layer is thick see fig 5 c and d it is important to note that this differs but does not conflict with studies on bacteria adhesion to clean surfaces which are found to preferentially accumulate in high shear regions rusconi et al 2014 those studies focus on the initial adhesion of biofilm forming cells while the current work concentrates on biofilm development of uniformly attached cells on all grains surfaces which we observe is shaped by the local hydrodynamics the average of the wall shear stress distributions presented in fig 5 a and b in the vicinity of the biofilm and at the surface of the bare grains shows a ca 1 8 fold increase over the course of the experiment see table 1 the increase of the maximal wall shear stress measured is substantially higher 2 5 for the bare grains than at the biofilm surface 1 4 differences in the increase of the maximal values measured for the biofilm compared to the bare grains suggests that there is a threshold shear stress in the system that the biofilm cannot withstand this would imply a biofilm shear or cohesive strength of ca 0 02 n m2 which is on the lower end of biofilm shear strengths observed experimentally elsewhere stewart 2014 the largest biofilm patch sizes were found in pores of radii close to the average radii but the wide distribution observed for the patch sizes did not indicate that the local geometry of the pore network was substantially influencing biofilm development the maximal thickness of the biofilm patches decreased with increasing wall shear stress showing that for the given porous medium and under the present growth conditions the wall shear stress played a predominant role on controlling biofilm development 4 2 what is the influence of the growing biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics the prevalence of low wall shear stresses in the vicinity of the biofilms could be attributed to the impact of the growing biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics coyte et al 2017 showed that the local development of a tiny biofilm patch induced an additional pressure drop at a given location of the pore network which resulted in substantial non local changes in the overall flow field in the present study the flow rate was kept constant over the course of the experiment invoking mass conservation and assuming that the biofilm is homogeneously distributed over a typical cylindrical pore thullner and baveye 2008 would mean that the average velocity would increase in an inverse quadratic relation relative to the pore radius υ q π r 2 see dashed dotted lines on fig 7 however as the data presented in this study show the biofilm is not homogeneously distributed at the grain surface furthermore even if the flow rate were kept constant such that the pressure gradient increased at the flow cell scale locally it is possible to have zones with only small pressure gradient variations for similar pressure gradients according to poiseuille s law the velocity is proportional to the square of the radius υ r 2 see dashed lines on fig 7 so that low velocity regions or stagnant zones can form with biofilm growth these considerations suggest that predicting the local impact of the growth of biofilm on the porescale hydrodynamics is far from trivial as for example porescale velocities could increase or decrease with the pore radius variation the complex interactions between biofilm development and porescale hydrodynamics is illustrated by the radius velocity relation presented in fig 7 the experimental data presented in this study shows that there is a formation of high velocity regions as also indicated by the high velocity tails of the velocity magnitude pdfs fig 3 a 4 3 significance to our knowledge our work is one of the first experimental studies of the biofilm shear strength in three dimensional porous media it is important to note that the small wall shear stress values obtained here are of the same order of magnitude than values obtained elsewhere for low reynolds number flows nadell et al 2017 song et al 2014 if we consider variability in shear strengths from different types of biofilms the direct measurements of wall shear strength presented here are on the lower end of values reported in other studies 0 1 to more than 10 000 n m2 as reported in möhle et al 2007 derlon et al 2008 or stewart 2014 the ability of measuring in situ the biofilm shear strength in 3d porous media opens several research opportunities namely to use this approach for the validation of numerical models numerical models often rely on default values of biofilm shear strengths obtained from the literature bottero et al 2013 pintelon et al 2012 our results however underline the risk associated with using generic values for the biofilm shear strength because these values might relate to non relevant growth conditions and thus overestimate this system parameter the experimental method introduced in our study allows to access realistic biofilm shear strengths in 3d porous media with an accuracy of about 8 we suggest that this approach can hence be used to validate assumptions made for numerical models of biofilm formation in 3d porous media providing distributions of wall shear stress values local to the biofilm given that both optical camera setups and laboratory x ray scanners become more and more a standard equipment of many laboratories our approach offers a viable method to resolve the geometry of the porous media in conjunction with the biofilm morphology as well as distribution of the local wall shear stresses a limitation of our method is that the x rays might inactivate cells of the biofilm which would impact subsequent measurements of biofilm morphology in this study we have analyzed only one bioclogged state t 36 h and we have not quantified this possible influence which therefore remains a subject of future work possible alternative methods which would not suffer from this limitation are based on magnetic resonance microscopy adapting the approach introduced by wagner et al 2010b to 3d porous media or by combining 3d geometries obtained from x ray micro tomography with numerical studies of coupled flow and biofilm growth peszynska et al 2016 each of these approaches ptv x ray combination magnetic resonance and x ray numerical simulation combination has its own strengths and weaknesses with respect to spatial resolution accuracy and assumptions made concerning biofilm flow coupling the magnetic resonance approach offers even finer 50 μm spatial resolution than the present approach and does not require index matching or referencing between flow and biofilm data because all phases are extracted from the same data set however it is not trivial to distinguish between flow in pore spaces and fluid inside biofilms because biofilms tend to be permeable and the magnetic resonance signal also captures flow inside the biofilm e g seymour et al 2004 numerical simulations based on x ray geometries offer very high resolution and accuracy however assumptions must be made for example concerning the permeability of the biofilm or biofilm growth e g graf von der schulenburg et al 2009 bottero et al 2013 there is therefore no best approach but rather the optimal method should be chosen depending on the specific setup and research goal in mind 5 conclusions this study presents experimental measurements on porescale hydrodynamics porespace structure and biofilm morphology in a progressively bioclogged porous medium with the aim of delineating the influence of the porespace geometry wall shear stresses and mass transfer processes on biofilm growth the local wall shear stress measurements revealed that the attachment and development of biofilm patches was controlled by the local wall shear stress biofilm formation occurred in the regions of low shear stresses while no significant amount of biofilm grew in the regions of high shear stresses biofilms were found at local wall shear stresses up to 0 02 n which defines a maximal shear strength of the biofilm in the porous medium mass transfer processes played a secondary role for growth consistent with presence of nutrient and electron acceptors in excess in our experiments the development of biofilm substantially influenced the porescale hydrodynamics as shown by the significant increase of the pore velocities and wall shear stresses both in terms of average value and variance given that the flow rate was kept constant the increase of average pore velocity is a consequence of the porosity reduction upon biofilm growth however growth was not homogeneous in space and resulted in the clogging of certain pores so that the pore scale flow arrangement changed from a predominantly parallel configuration towards a more serial one this is a manifestation of the formation of preferential flow pathways in the bioclogged porous medium we propose that based on this method measured biofilm shear strength could be used to validate models used in numerical simulations of biofilm growth in porous media furthermore the growth conditions used in the current study could be tailored to provide experimental data for practical applications that seek to optimize biofilm thickness or specific surface area and that upscale mass transfer processes to practically relevant scales of sand or trickling filters finally with the fast pace of development of 3d printing technology in terms of printable materials geometries and scales accessible the 3d printing of nafion carrico et al 2015 might soon allow similar investigations in other geometries non granular porous media membrane feed spacer channels and at scales
