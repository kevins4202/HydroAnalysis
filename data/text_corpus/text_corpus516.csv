2580,in light of shifting precipitation patterns induced by climate change communities are seeking to build resiliency in urban drainage systems through interventions such as green stormwater infrastructure gsi bioretention cells are one of the most commonly implemented forms of gsi for their ability to reduce peak discharge retain runoff and filter pollutants however they may be at risk of reduced function in the future due to deviations from historic precipitation frequency and intensity patterns which are essential to their design further changes in future function are likely to vary regionally as the magnitude of future climate changes will differ across the globe to explore the range of impacts to future bioretention function an ensemble of 10 regional climate models at 17 locations across the contiguous united states were evaluated to provide the widest range of potential future outcomes using a probabilistic approach to capture the uncertain nature of climate change bioretention cells were modeled using usepa s storm water management model swmm to compare existing and future performance under a range of climate change projections median annual rainfall and 99th percentile rainfall event depths and intensities were projected to increase across all 17 locations while antecedent dry period i e the time between consecutive rain events was projected to increase for 11 locations correspondingly bioretention cell hydrologic performance decreased across all 17 locations under future scenarios relative to performance under current climate conditions annual volumes of infiltration decreased between 4 0 and 24 0 across all 17 locations while overflow increased between 0 4 and 19 6 for 15 locations results suggest that bioretention cells in the southern united states are at significant risk of reduced function in the future while those in the midwest and northeast are at moderate risk bioretention cells in the northwest west performed the best under future climate scenarios that is they showed similar function in the future to that of the present findings demonstrate that most if not all bioretention cells across the contiguous united states will require some degree of modification to maintain existing function under future conditions keywords green infrastructure urban hydrology climate change stormwater swmm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased likelihood of extreme weather events e g frequent floods drought conditions record breaking temperatures associated with anthropogenic activities has been well documented masson delmotte et al 2018 for example bishop et al 2019 found a 40 increase in fall precipitation for the period 1895 2018 in the southeastern united states with nearly all of the added precipitation occurring with an increased intensity similarly using datasets from 182 stations across the contiguous united states karl and knight 1998 noted a 10 increase in precipitation over the twentieth century primarily due to heavy and extreme precipitation events with 53 of the added precipitation attributable to the upper 10 of the precipitation distribution according to prudhomme et al 2014 if anthropogenic activities and emissions continue to increase at the current rate then southern europe the middle east the southeast united states chile and south west australia are at significant risk of experiencing droughts and water security issues by the year 2100 at the same time the rapid urbanization across the planet has led to a greater percentage of urban areas becoming covered by impervious surfaces that prevent soil infiltration shuster et al 2005 these shifts result in increased runoff and flooding du et al 2012 increased nonpoint source pollution o driscoll et al 2010 and a suite of degraded conditions in receiving waters referred to as the urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 the combination of climate change and rapid urbanization poses serious risks for public health and safety zhang et al 2018 showed that the extreme flooding caused by hurricane harvey in august 2017 was intensified due to both anthropogenic induced climate change and the effects of increased urbanization in houston texas usa similarly yang et al 2021 found that the extreme rainfall and flooding in western europe during july 2021 was exacerbated due to urbanization and urban induced rainfall anomalies such extreme precipitation events have provoked efforts to mitigate the worsening effects of climate change stormwater management systems which are typically broken into two categories gray and green represent critical infrastructure components which are directly threatened by climate change green stormwater infrastructure gsi is increasingly utilized in urban areas to assist and supplant existing gray stormwater infrastructure and enhance the resilience of urban drainage networks to climate change eckart et al 2017 huang et al 2018 one of the most commonly implemented and studied types of gsi is the bioretention cell which consists of layers of gravel soil sand organic matter and plants tdec 2014 bioretention cells provide effective removal of total suspended solids tss and pollutants e g tn tp davis et al 2001 while reducing runoff volume and peak discharge dietz 2007 winston et al 2016 davis 2008 despite research showing the benefits of bioretention under existing climate regimes the use of these systems for climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability is underpinned by their ability to function under future climate scenarios which is effectively the climate resiliency of bioretention hettiarachchi et al 2022b historically hydrologic engineering designs including bioretention have relied on the stationarity of rainfall patterns however recent research has shown that this can no longer be assumed with a shift towards increasingly frequent and more intense storm events milly et al 2008 pryor et al 2009 cook et al 2020 rosenberg et al 2010 wasko and sharma 2015 and hettiarachchi et al 2018 also found that warming temperatures associated with future climate regimes could increase the variability of storm temporal patterns further stressing stormwater infrastructure thus a number of studies have begun to use projections from regional climate models rcms and general circulation models gcms to understand potential shifts in hydrologic processes and the resulting effects on critical infrastructure arnbjerg nielsen 2012 cook et al 2019 sarkar et al 2018 recent studies have implemented a similar approach to investigate the future function of bioretention cells under climate change hathaway et al 2014 evaluated future performance of four bioretention cells in rocky mountain and nashville north carolina usa using one rcm and two representative concentration pathways rcps comparing historic 2001 2004 with projected 2055 2058 performance results showed that the frequency and volume of overflow could increase significantly for projected scenarios requiring an additional storage of between 9 and 31 cm to limit increases in annual overflow under future conditions zhang et al 2019 evaluated a range of design configurations for a bioretention cell in melbourne australia using eight gcms and one rcp comparing historic 1995 2004 with projected 2040 2049 performance results suggested that larger bioretention cells should be prioritized due to the variability of future gcm scenarios similarly tirpak et al 2021 evaluated a range of design configurations for a bioretention cell in knoxville tennessee usa using 10 rcms two rcps and three underlying soil types with infiltration rates ranging from 0 13 cm hr to 2 5 cm hr comparing historic 2010 2014 with projected 2040 2044 performance results showed that even the most significant retrofit configurations led to overflow increases in 67 4 to 71 1 of simulations with underlying soil type having minimal effect on overflow indicating the significant impact of shifting precipitation patterns wang et al 2019a performed a similar study by evaluating a range of bioretention cell surface areas in guangzhou china using 11 gcms four rcps and six design storms results showed that future bioretention cells could maintain existing function for small short duration storms by increasing surface area but function will diminish as storm size and duration increase regardless of increases in surface area highlighting regional differences in future climate winston 2016 evaluated future performance of bioretention cells located 25 km apart in northeast ohio usa using one gcm and two rcps comparing historic 2001 2004 with projected 2055 2059 performance results showed that bioretention cells mitigated 5 9 less runoff in one location while mitigating 4 6 more runoff in the other location as such while some research has been performed investigating the performance of a single bioretention cell under future precipitation patterns almost no research has been performed comparing multiple locations across the united states or the globe for that matter there is a need to explore the geographic variability in the effects of climate change on existing gsi to better understand the regional adaptations that may be required to prepare for these impacts to address this knowledge gap this study explores changes in bioretention performance under future climate change scenarios in 17 locations across the united states selected based off their unique hydrologic region ten regional climate models rcms were selected from the north american coordinated regional downscaling experiment na cordex to provide a wide range of potential future precipitation outcomes at each location mearns et al 2017 the objective of this effort was to identify shifts in bioretention performance from historical to future conditions and to better understand the geographic variability of impacts to future performance results from this work can be used to identify locations where bioretention cells may be most adversely affected by climate change and thus may require modifications to ensure their desired performance persists in the future 2 data collection and methodology 2 1 data collection observed climate data were acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information ncei data archive to allow for bias correction of climate model outputs and characterization of historical bioretention function noaa 2016 simulated historic and future climate data were acquired from the north american coordinated regional downscaling experiment na cordex data archive mearns et al 2017 climate data were acquired for 17 locations across the us table 1 which were selected based on their unique hydrologic region defined by the bukovsky climate map bukovsky et al 2019 the bukovsky climate map groups regions by hydrologic similarity accounting for average temperature and rainfall as well as seasonal occurrences such as the north american monsoon bukovsky 2011 using the same cities as cook et al 2019 each climate region in the contiguous us was represented by at least one city in the analysis observed daily temperature maximum and minimum and hourly precipitation data from january 1 1999 to december 31 2013 were gathered from the noaa ncei archive for all 17 locations noaa 2016 the 15 year period was selected to fully capture the year to year variability of recent precipitation and temperature patterns subject to data availability the 17 noaa ncei stations shown in table 1 were selected based off the availability of continuous climate data for the time range specified and their proximity to the selected cities covering the majority of north america the na cordex data archive provides simulated climate data from a range of rcms produced using boundary conditions from gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 mearns et al 2017 as recommended by bukovsky and mearns 2020 all ten na cordex climate models with available hourly precipitation projections were used for this study to provide the most comprehensive range of potential future outcomes table 2 due to the limited availability of hourly precipitation projections in the archive only one rcp4 5 scenario representing moderate population growth moderate climate policy and eventual decline and stabilization of anthropogenic emissions was evaluated while nine rcp8 5 scenarios representing high population growth no climate policy and rapid increase in anthropogenic emissions were evaluated van vuuren et al 2011 both historic simulated climate data from january 1 1999 to december 31 2013 and future simulated climate data from january 1 2035 to december 31 2049 were acquired to allow for bias correction and swmm modeling 2 2 bias correction systematic bias was corrected in climate model outputs following data acquisition due to bias introduced during model formulation and the downscaling process bias correction procedures must be applied to more accurately align modeled climate data with observed climate data rosenberg et al 2010 stephens et al 2010 compared five different weather prediction climate and global cloud resolving models and found that all models overproduced precipitation frequency by a factor of two while underproducing precipitation intensity compared with observed precipitation data bias correction is therefore required prior to swmm modeling to ensure that rcm inputs provide statistically accurate distributions the kernel density distribution mapping kddm bias correction procedure was selected due to its accuracy ease of implementation mcginnis and mearns 2016 tirpak et al 2021 and overall performance compared with other bias correction procedures mcginnis et al 2015 kddm applies a set of bias correction steps to scale the distribution of climate projections to match that of observed climate data due to the frequent over prediction of low intensity precipitation stephens et al 2010 the excess drizzle was first removed from projected rainfall by setting hourly precipitation volumes below a minimum threshold to zero in order to match the wet dry ratio of timesteps in the observed precipitation data mcginnis and mearns 2016 following this dedrizzling step nonparametric estimates of the underlying probability density functions pdfs similar to smooth non discrete histograms were produced for the observed and simulated precipitation datasets the resulting pdfs were integrated using the trapezoidal rule to approximate cumulative distribution functions cdfs a transfer function was then created by fitting a spline between the corresponding quantiles for the inverse cdf of the observed precipitation data and the forward cdf of the simulated precipitation data mcginnis et al 2015 lastly the transfer function was applied to both the historic and future simulated precipitation data yielding bias corrected projections of future rainfall kddm bias correction of the simulated temperature data followed the same steps as the precipitation bias correction with the exception of the dedrizzling step and was performed on a monthly basis to account for seasonal variability mcginnis et al 2015 bias correction via kddm was applied to all projections of precipitation and temperature records for each of the 17 cities of interest in a single instance extreme values were removed from observed climate data to improve bias correction the september 2013 floods in boulder co resulted in 231 mm of rainfall recorded on september 12 noaa 2016 nearly doubling the previous daily record of 122 mm hamill 2014 according to the noaa national weather service precipitation frequency data server noaa 2017 the 24 hr 1000 year precipitation depth for boulder co is 207 mm 24 mm less than the rainfall on september 12 2013 further illustrating the rarity of the precipitation event cook 2018 reported that extreme values in observed data used to bias correct simulated data may lead to inaccurate annual maximum values obtained through kddm bias correction as such observed hourly precipitation data from september 9 2013 through september 16 2013 for boulder co were replaced with the median precipitation depth for that time period using the previous 14 year record removal of these extreme values resulted in bias corrected simulated precipitation data that more accurately reflected the distribution of the observed precipitation data kddm bias correction of the simulated hourly precipitation and daily temperature data was performed using the r package climod mcginnis 2018 r core team 2020 similar to analysis in tirpak et al 2021 the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to confirm the statistical similarities between the distributions of observed and bias corrected climate data for all 10 models across all 17 locations based on these results the bias corrected future climate data was determined to be suitable for subsequent swmm modeling following bias correction an implausibly high precipitation depth was noted in the bias corrected future dataset in el paso using model 6 9615 mm in 4 h the precipitation amount was removed and set to 0 mm for the 4 hour time period subsequently producing future precipitation statistics in line with the other nine models 2 3 swmm modeling the usepa storm water management model swmm version 5 1 was used in this study for its ability to provide dynamic rainfall runoff relationships for long term simulations gironás et al 2009 and capacity to directly model bioretention cells using the lid control editor rossman 2015 the swmm model was designed to simulate a hypothetical 0 4 hectare 4 000 m2 subcatchment a bioretention cell a rain gage and an outlet detailed design characteristics for the subcatchment are shown in table 3 the subcatchment was designed with 100 impervious cover to represent a common impervious surface in a city such as a parking lot a manning s n value of 0 01 was selected for the impervious surface to account for the hydraulic efficiency of the subcatchment arcement and schneider 1989 all runoff from the subcatchment was routed directly to the bioretention cell while bioretention cell design guidelines vary by region the same bioretention cell characteristics were used for all locations and models to ensure the only independent variable was climate observed and bias corrected future allowing for relative changes in bioretention cell performance to be assessed bioretention cell design characteristics were based off the baseline design scenario used by tirpak et al 2021 which incorporated design recommendations from the tennessee department of conservation tdec 2014 the minnesota stormwater steering committee mssc 2006 the knox county tennessee stormwater management manual county 2008 and the swmm user s manual version 5 1 rossman 2015 this design was considered to be comparable to design standards in most locations aiona et al 2020 ldeq 2010 massdep 2008 ncdeq 2020 pwsa 2022 sara 2019 bioretention cell design characteristics used in the swmm model are shown in table 4 the surface area 534 2 m2 and surface layer depth 15 2 cm were sized to enable the bioretention cell to store the water quality storm event for the southeastern united states deletic 1998 pitt 1999 which is typically the surface runoff generated from a 25 4 mm storm event the soil layer was composed of a mixture of coarse sand topsoil and organic matter to filter pollutants while promoting flow through high hydraulic conductivity 5 1 cm hr the storage layer underlying the media was composed of astm 57 stone nominal size of 4 75 to 25 mm with a high void ratio 0 4 to allow for water storage or seepage 1 3 cm hr into the native soil astm 2003 lastly the bottom of the underdrain pipe was placed at the top of the storage layer to allow the storage layer to completely fill prior to draining rossman 2015 the rainfall runoff process model accounted for surface runoff from the subcatchment into the bioretention cell the green ampt infiltration model was used to represent soil infiltration using fundamental soil properties i e initial soil moisture deficit saturated hydraulic conductivity and suction head at the wetting front green and ampt 1911 dynamic wave routing was used to solve the one dimensional saint venant equations and incorporate both the continuity and momentum equations rossman 2015 data file inputs included observed hourly precipitation data 1999 2013 and bias corrected future hourly precipitation data 2035 2049 the climatology editor was used to input external climate files containing observed daily temperature data 1999 2013 and bias corrected future daily temperature data 2035 2049 the temperature files were used as the source of evaporation rates in the evaporation tab of the climatology editor which estimates daily evaporation rates from daily temperature values using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 rossman 2015 following model setup the model was run using the observed climate data 17 scenarios from january 1 1999 to december 31 2013 and the bias corrected future climate data 170 scenarios which included 10 projections for each of the 17 cities used herein from january 1 2035 to december 31 2049 three bioretention cell outputs were compiled and assessed in this study i e infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow these three bioretention cell performance indices accounted for the majority of total inflow into the bioretention cell and provided quantitative measures for the efficacy of the bioretention cell the sum of all three performance indices i e infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow over the entire simulation period i e 15 years is hereafter referred to as cumulative volume observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 median average annual infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow volumes for all 17 locations were calculated for fig 5 the values were calculated by dividing the median cumulative volume by the duration of the simulation period i e 15 years to yield an annual average the sum of all three annualized performance indices i e infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow is hereafter referred to as annual volume due to many locations having extremely low underdrain outflow or overflow under the observed precipitation dataset relative comparisons between observed and future datasets have been made in fig 5 using changes in the percent of total annual volume attributed to each hydrologic pathway as opposed to using percent change relative percent change between the observed and future datasets was calculated using eq 1 1 relative c h a n g e f u t u r e o b s e r v e d 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation statistics due to the significant number of locations 17 and models 10 climate inputs were first analyzed to understand how precipitation varied based on both location and a given climate model comparison of observed and future datasets using both categories location and model provides context as to how assessments of climate change effects may yield variable results based on these factors bioretention cell performance was then assessed using three bioretention cell performance indices infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow due to the range of locations selected it s important to first note the geographic and hydrologic variability of the united states the 17 locations can be separated into the following five regions the northeast boston and pittsburgh the midwest chicago fargo and st louis the southeast charlotte memphis and new orleans the southwest amarillo el paso phoenix and san antonio and the northwest west boise boulder portland missoula and san jose the northeast and midwest are defined by humid continental climates with mild to hot summers and year round precipitation the southeast is defined by a humid subtropical climate the southwest varies from cold semi arid to hot desert climates and the northwest west varies from cold semi arid to humid continental to mediterranean climates köppen 1900 for example in the eastern united states pittsburgh is between 550 and 950 km from boston 776 km charlotte 584 km chicago 674 km and st louis 898 km and in the western united states el paso is also between 550 and 950 km from amarillo 577 km boulder 923 km phoenix 555 km and san antonio 808 km however while the observed mean annual rainfall for these five eastern us locations ranges between 912 mm in chicago and 1072 mm in boston the observed mean annual rainfall for these five western us locations ranges between 163 mm in phoenix and 790 mm in san antonio rainfall event depths also vary significantly by region from 35 mm in boise to 268 mm in new orleans for observed 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths fig 1 displays the percent change between the observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 datasets for mean annual rainfall mean annual rain events mean annual rainy days and mean drying period for the 17 locations rainy days were counted as any day in which rainfall depth was greater than 0 0 mm between 00 00 and 23 59 a minimum inter event time mit of 6 hours was used to separate rain events in the datasets chin et al 2016 palynchuk and guo 2008 any period without rainfall for 6 h or more was accounted for in the mean drying period i e the time between consecutive rain events the boxplots for each location consist of the percent change between the observed and future datasets for all 10 models i e 10 values per boxplot out of the 170 total future model location combinations annual rainfall increased in 135 combinations 79 4 annual rain events decreased in 110 combinations 64 7 annual rainy days decreased in 103 combinations 60 6 and mean drying period increased in 107 combinations 62 9 median annual rainfall shown as the solid black line inside each boxplot in fig 1 increased for all 17 locations while the median number of annual rain events and rainy days decreased for nine locations with an additional three locations observing decreases in one of these two precipitation characteristics across all locations mean annual rainfall depth increased by 9 9 71 mm while mean annual rain events and rainy days decreased 6 2 6 5 days and 3 9 3 7 days respectively the greatest percent change in mean annual rainfall with an increase of 18 7 corresponding to an additional 278 mm of rainfall occurred in new orleans while the lowest percent change occurred in portland with an increase of 4 3 38 mm these trends are consistent with the understanding that while the total amount of rainfall may be higher in many locations in the future extreme rainfall will also increase in a significant number of locations due to climate change coupled with an anticipated reduction in the number of rainfall events climate change is expected to bring larger drying periods between storms zhang et al 2019 further increasing the vulnerability of water scarce environments hettiarachchi et al 2022a median drying period increased for 11 locations but portland was the only location where all 10 models projected increased annual dry days i e a decrease in the average number of rainy days per year the northwest west was the only region in which all locations i e boise boulder portland missoula and san jose showed increases in median drying period and excluding missoula account for four of the five largest percent increases in median drying period as documented by manka et al 2016 the significant increase in median drying period in the northwest west could reduce the efficacy of biological processes present in bioretention cells resulting in nutrient export and the subsequent degradation of nearby waterways combining all locations mean drying period increased by 10 5 0 5 days with the greatest percent change in mean drying period occurring in new orleans mean increase of 37 8 or 1 2 days while no change occurred in st louis jhong and tung 2018 also observed increases in the duration of future dry periods in taiwan and suggested that occurrences of floods and droughts could occur more frequently due to the combination of increased precipitation event volumes and drying periods fig 2 displays the percent change between observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 precipitation depths for 50th 90th 99th and 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths for the 17 locations out of the 170 total future model location combinations 50th percentile events increased in 62 combinations 36 5 90th percentile events increased in 118 combinations 69 4 99th percentile events increased in 165 combinations 97 1 and 99 9th percentile events increased in 147 combinations 86 5 while median 50th percentile events only increased in seven locations the higher percentile events were consistently predicted to increase in size with median 90th percentile events increasing in 12 locations median 99th percentile events increasing in all 17 locations and median 99 9th percentile events increasing in 16 locations rainfall intensities were projected to increase for an even greater number of locations and percentiles with median 50th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in 11 locations median 90th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in 15 locations median 99th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in all 17 locations and median 99 9th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in 15 locations the trend in upper percentile precipitation events and rainfall intensities 90th coupled with minimal changes to moderate precipitation events i e 50th percentile supports findings in existing literature and again points to anticipated increases in severe rainfall in the future karl and knight 1998 olsson et al 2009 since bioretention cells are most effective during small lower intensity precipitation events the increase in the frequency of large higher intensity precipitation events is particularly concerning for future bioretention cell performance wang et al 2018 the significant outliers in the 50th boulder and 99 9th percentiles el paso indicate that as expected climate change will not affect regional or even local precipitation equally for example the four locations i e boulder missoula portland and san jose with the greatest increases in median 50th percentile precipitation events occurred in the northwest west while no location in the southwest or southeast showed an increase in median 50th percentile precipitation events additionally while those four locations i e boulder missoula portland and san jose showed all 10 models projecting either increases or no change in 50th percentile precipitation events six locations i e amarillo charlotte el paso memphis san antonio and st louis showed all 10 models projecting either decreases or no change in 50th percentile precipitation events demonstrating the variability of future climate winston 2016 found similar variability in future precipitation when comparing locations only 25 km apart in northeast ohio usa similarly gao et al 2012 showed substantial variability in climate change effects on extreme weather across the eastern united states 3 2 bioretention cell performance statistics fig 3 displays the percent change between observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow from the modeled bioretention cell for all 17 locations due to a lack of overflow under the observed rainfall data i e flow equal to zero boxplots for boise missoula phoenix portland and san jose are excluded from fig 3 as percent change could not be calculated boise was the only location where both underdrain outflow and overflow did not occur under the observed rainfall data and also produced the lowest observed 99th and 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths out of all 17 locations illustrating the relationship between bioretention performance and regional climate while underdrain outflow and or overflow box plots in fig 3 could not be produced for these five locations i e boise missoula phoenix portland and san jose underdrain outflow and overflow increased in all five locations under future scenarios indicating even the best performing bioretention cells may experience diminished performance under future climate change scenarios these locations also produced five of the six lowest observed 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths and are the western most out of all 17 locations further illustrating the relationship between bioretention cell performance and regional climate additionally overflow only occurred on two days out of 15 years under the observed rainfall data for el paso as such percent change between observed and future overflow in el paso appears more extreme in part due to the low number of overflow days for the observed dataset excluding the two locations with increased median infiltration loss boise 25 9 and fargo 1 7 percent change in median infiltration loss ranged from 0 2 portland to 18 3 new orleans in the remaining 15 locations conversely excluding the one location with an observed underdrain outflow value of zero boise percent change in median underdrain outflow increased between 9 7 san antonio and 393 2 phoenix in the remaining 16 locations finally five locations had an observed overflow value of zero i e percent change could not be calculated while extreme outlier values were observed in two locations namely boulder median decrease of 8 6 and el paso median increase of 1510 4 in the remaining 10 locations the percent change in median overflow increased between 74 5 chicago and 509 7 boston additionally all locations in the northeast i e boston and pittsburgh and southeast i e charlotte memphis and new orleans showed all 10 models projecting increases in overflow with a minimum increase in overflow of 140 across the five locations new orleans pittsburgh and st louis also showed all 10 models projecting decreases in median infiltration loss indicating a high likelihood of diminished performance regardless of the future climate change scenario the projected significant increase in overflow in 11 locations is most concerning from a public health and safety perspective due to the increased risk of flooding in urban areas hou et al 2020 olsson et al 2009 and degradation of waterways caused by overflow predominantly bypassing treatment and quickly proceeding to nearby conveyances hathaway et al 2014 walsh et al 2005 out of the 170 total future model location combinations overflow increased in 151 combinations 88 8 underdrain outflow increased in 163 combinations 95 9 and infiltration loss decreased in 121 combinations 71 2 the increase in overflow and underdrain outflow combined with decreased infiltration loss indicate bioretention cells designed following current methods may be unable to accommodate the projected shift in precipitation patterns specifically surface infiltration rates may not be sufficient to avoid significant increases in overflow while only a single underlying soil type 1 3 cm hr was evaluated in this study results from tirpak et al 2021 indicate that underlying soil type has little effect on overflow thus the primary benefits of bioretention cells i e reducing peak runoff groundwater recharge and filtering pollutants may be lessened under future climate change scenarios decreased infiltration loss under increased rainfall volumes has been documented in previous literature tirpak et al 2021 but the root cause has not been investigated this is important as different design modifications may be needed depending on the primary contributors to decreased infiltration this phenomenon is most likely due to the bioretention cell surface layer filling too quickly overwhelming surface infiltration rates and subsequent infiltration loss and contributing to immediate overflow if the surface layer is filling too quickly to enable surface infiltration then the surface layer depth could be increased to hold a greater runoff volume providing additional time for surface infiltration to occur tirpak et al 2021 real time control rtc technologies could provide an additional option to decrease overflow and increase infiltration during moderate storm events through weather research and forecast wrf models and real time sensors and controls klenzendorf et al 2015 enabling bioretention cells to transition from passive stormwater management to active vijayaraghavan et al 2021 compared to passive bioretention cells persaud et al 2019 and shen et al 2020 found that rtc technologies could provide both hydrologic and water quality improvements if retention time and storage are optimized for storm events however further research on the efficacy of rtc technologies for bioretention performance optimization is still required and it s unlikely that rtc technologies could significantly reduce overflow during extreme storm events fig 4 displays the percent change between observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 mean yearly overflow days 50th percentile daily overflow volume 90th percentile daily overflow volume and 99th percentile daily overflow volume overflow days were counted as any day in which overflow volume was greater than 0 0 m3 between 00 00 and 23 59 due to observed values of zero for overflow boise missoula phoenix portland and san jose are not shown in fig 4 i e percent change could not be calculated percent change in median yearly overflow days increased between 16 4 new orleans and 347 5 el paso for all 12 locations shown of the 12 locations shown in fig 4 median number of annual rainy days also decreased in six locations i e boston boulder chicago el paso new orleans and pittsburgh and excluding boulder and st louis median 90th percentile rainfall intensities also increased for the 10 remaining locations again indicating increases in rainfall magnitude and intensity when events do occur a particularly compelling example of this trend is found in new orleans where a relatively low increase in median yearly overflow days was observed yet a significant increase in median annual precipitation 18 7 and 99th percentile rainfall intensities 21 3 and decrease in median annual rainy days 19 5 were observed the largest percent changes in all three precipitation statistics suggesting more intense events will make up a greater percentage of the storms that do occur given that bioretention cells are most effective during small lower intensity precipitation events the efficacy of bioretention cells as a stormwater management practice in new orleans may be questioned as large higher intensity precipitation events become the norm excluding boulder and chicago median 50th 90th and 99th percentile daily overflow increased for the 10 remaining locations shown in fig 4 excluding the northwest west the consistent increase across all overflow percentiles indicates that government agencies city planners and stormwater engineers across the country should expect higher volumes to bypass treatment when overflow occurs from bioretention cells locations in the southeast i e charlotte memphis and new orleans face the greatest likelihood of higher overflow volumes all three locations experienced 100 increases for all three 50th 90th and 99th median daily overflow percentiles with all 10 climate models projecting increases in overflow compared with observed performance given the uniformity in predicted changes to a range of overflow volumes adaptations to limit the environmental and public safety impacts of untreated bypass may be especially critical in these locations 3 3 regional trends in future bioretention cell performance observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 median average annual infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow volumes for all 17 locations are presented in fig 5 results indicate that bioretention cells in the southern united states i e southeast and southwest are most at risk of performance impacts under future climate change scenarios the seven southern most locations i e amarillo charlotte el paso memphis new orleans phoenix and san antonio produced the highest relative percent increases in overflow ranging from 7 0 to 19 6 with the exception of memphis these locations also produced six of the highest relative percent decreases in infiltration loss ranging from 15 3 to 24 0 new orleans and san antonio also recorded the two highest relative increases in annual overflow volume 2115 1 cu m yr and 710 0 cu m yr respectively significant increases in overflow in the southern united states are consistent with extreme precipitation projections by prein et al 2017 and bioretention literature cook et al 2019 hathaway et al 2014 the significant increases in overflow are a direct result of the frequent and intense rainfall in the southern united states highlighting the potential limitations of current bioretention design strategies although gsi is likely to provide some resiliency to extreme precipitation these results indicate there are limits in this resilience that can be exceeded similarly bioretention cells located in the midwest and northeast are still at risk of diminished performance under future climate change scenarios following the seven southern locations the five locations in the midwest and northeast i e boston chicago fargo pittsburgh and st louis produced the next highest relative percent increases in overflow ranging from 3 3 to 5 2 the five midwest and northeast locations also recorded the 5th through 9th highest relative median increases in annual overflow volumes ranging from 176 2 cu m yr to 241 1 cu m yr results are consistent with cook et al 2019 who found that overflow from bioretention cells in the midwest and northeast occurred at equal or greater magnitudes compared with other regions in the united states bioretention cells in the northwest west have the best likelihood of being able to maintain existing function under future climate change scenarios also consistent with previous findings cook et al 2019 the five northwest west locations i e boise boulder missoula portland and san jose produced the lowest relative percent changes in overflow ranging from a decrease of 0 3 to an increase of 1 2 these locations also recorded the lowest relative changes in annual overflow volume ranging from a median decrease of 4 2 cu m yr to an increase of 21 5 cu m yr the minimal effect on existing bioretention cell function indicates that stormwater infrastructure in the northwest west may require the least adaptation measures to maintain existing function under future climate conditions 3 4 implications to bioretention design and adaptation measures while overflow and infiltration are expected to increase and decrease respectively under future climate conditions for many bioretention cells across the united states modifications can be implemented to mitigate the effects of climate change to their performance tirpak et al 2021 compared an ensemble of retrofit and design configurations for bioretention cells in east tennessee and found varying degrees of success for three scenarios 1 increasing the soil layer depth 2 increasing the storage layer depth 3 and increasing the bioretention cell surface area increasing the depth of the soil layer in the bioretention cell was shown to be a conservative yet effective method of increasing runoff volume retention tirpak et al 2021 as such increasing the depth of the soil layer for bioretention cells in regions where overflow is expected to modestly increase such as the northwest west and parts of the midwest is a viable option requiring low investment particularly for newly constructed cells increased soil layer depth can also increase pollutant removal and water storage hatt et al 2009 which may mitigate plant stress in these systems in the drier climates projected for the northwest west increasing the depth of the storage layer has been found to be an effective method of reducing overflow hathaway et al 2014 found an increased storage layer depth from 9 0 to 31 0 cm would maintain existing function of bioretention cells in east north carolina into the late 2050 s similarly winston 2016 found that increasing storage layer depth from 5 0 to 17 0 cm would maintain existing function in northeast ohio into the late 2050 s increasing the storage layer depth has the potential to temporarily store a greater volume of runoff than increasing the soil layer depth but requires either deepening the bioretention cell or removing media from the soil layer reducing the efficacy of pollutant removal further substantial increases in surface storage depth may lead to public safety concerns due to the hazard posed by deeper ponding zones relative to nearby surfaces however increasing the storage layer depth has been shown to be more effective at reducing overflow than increasing the soil layer depth and should be considered if overflow reduction is a priority tirpak et al 2021 densely populated highly urbanized locations with a need to mitigate projected increases in future overflow such as chicago pittsburgh or boston may greatly benefit from increased storage layer depths in bioretention cells the final viable option investigated by tirpak et al 2021 increased the surface area of bioretention cells relative to the subcatchment which has been shown to be an effective method of reducing overflow and increasing infiltration due to increased soil and storage layer volumes wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 increasing bioretention cell surface area requires the greatest investment of the three options and may not be viable in highly urbanized locations due to limited space or cost however locations in the southern united states such as el paso san antonio memphis charlotte and new orleans may require significant investment in all stormwater infrastructure both grey and green to mitigate projected increases in overflow volumes a location such as new orleans in particular may need to incorporate bioretention cell modifications wherever possible to reduce the significant increases in overflow volumes projected under future climate conditions given the geographic and hydrologic variability of the us locations selected for this study the bioretention cell modifications suggested could be applied to a range of cities globally locations projected to experience fewer rainfall events and longer dry periods such as melbourne australia zhang et al 2019 could increase soil layer depths of bioretention cells to mitigate plant stress and improve pollutant removal high density locations with humid continental climates similar to boston and pittsburgh such as vienna austria strauss et al 2013 may benefit from increasing the storage layer depth in bioretention cells depending on the severity of future climate conditions subtropical locations similar to new orleans and charlotte such as guangzhou china wang et al 2019a will likely require considerable bioretention cell modifications wherever possible 4 conclusions bioretention performance under future climate change projections was evaluated for 17 cities across the contiguous united states using swmm version 5 1 median annual rainfall increased across all 17 locations in future scenarios a majority of locations also experienced a decreased median number of rainy days and rain events while median drying period increased precipitation events were projected to become more severe for upper percentile events 90th while 50th percentile events were projected to change minimally for all locations except for boulder future precipitation events were projected therefore to become less frequent but more severe however findings clearly indicate that while precipitation event severity is expected to increase on average across the united states the shift in precipitation patterns will vary significantly by location as a result of shifting precipitation patterns future bioretention cell performance was impacted by changing climates across all locations results demonstrated that bioretention cells in the southern united states have the greatest likelihood of diminished future function followed by cells in the midwest and northeast due to the magnitude of change projected for the northwest west bioretention cells in those regions may only require minor investments in retrofits or design modifications to maintain future performance increased annual overflow which poses significant environmental and health risks to urban communities projected for the midwest northeast and southern united states may elevate the importance of design modifications e g increasing surface storage layer volumes to offset these risks projected decreases in infiltration from bioretention cells especially notable in the southern united states presents additional challenge for city planners and stormwater engineers if bioretention cells are no longer able to promote infiltration into native soils and filter pollutants from runoff then their benefit as a stormwater control measure will be substantially reduced further these outcomes suggest that while bioretention following current design strategies may continue to provide some runoff mitigation shifting precipitation patterns including more intense rain events reveal limitations in their ability to maintain desired performance under future climate conditions future studies should consider a wider range of climate models emissions scenarios and bioretention cell configurations to provide an even more robust assessment of future impacts to performance additionally while a range of climate models and locations were evaluated in this study a single bioretention cell configuration was used for all simulations studies which consider multiple bioretention cell configurations would provide insight on the significance of design modifications beyond current standards for a range of locations to maintain existing function under future climate scenarios credit authorship contribution statement matthew weathers methodology formal analysis data curation

2580,in light of shifting precipitation patterns induced by climate change communities are seeking to build resiliency in urban drainage systems through interventions such as green stormwater infrastructure gsi bioretention cells are one of the most commonly implemented forms of gsi for their ability to reduce peak discharge retain runoff and filter pollutants however they may be at risk of reduced function in the future due to deviations from historic precipitation frequency and intensity patterns which are essential to their design further changes in future function are likely to vary regionally as the magnitude of future climate changes will differ across the globe to explore the range of impacts to future bioretention function an ensemble of 10 regional climate models at 17 locations across the contiguous united states were evaluated to provide the widest range of potential future outcomes using a probabilistic approach to capture the uncertain nature of climate change bioretention cells were modeled using usepa s storm water management model swmm to compare existing and future performance under a range of climate change projections median annual rainfall and 99th percentile rainfall event depths and intensities were projected to increase across all 17 locations while antecedent dry period i e the time between consecutive rain events was projected to increase for 11 locations correspondingly bioretention cell hydrologic performance decreased across all 17 locations under future scenarios relative to performance under current climate conditions annual volumes of infiltration decreased between 4 0 and 24 0 across all 17 locations while overflow increased between 0 4 and 19 6 for 15 locations results suggest that bioretention cells in the southern united states are at significant risk of reduced function in the future while those in the midwest and northeast are at moderate risk bioretention cells in the northwest west performed the best under future climate scenarios that is they showed similar function in the future to that of the present findings demonstrate that most if not all bioretention cells across the contiguous united states will require some degree of modification to maintain existing function under future conditions keywords green infrastructure urban hydrology climate change stormwater swmm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased likelihood of extreme weather events e g frequent floods drought conditions record breaking temperatures associated with anthropogenic activities has been well documented masson delmotte et al 2018 for example bishop et al 2019 found a 40 increase in fall precipitation for the period 1895 2018 in the southeastern united states with nearly all of the added precipitation occurring with an increased intensity similarly using datasets from 182 stations across the contiguous united states karl and knight 1998 noted a 10 increase in precipitation over the twentieth century primarily due to heavy and extreme precipitation events with 53 of the added precipitation attributable to the upper 10 of the precipitation distribution according to prudhomme et al 2014 if anthropogenic activities and emissions continue to increase at the current rate then southern europe the middle east the southeast united states chile and south west australia are at significant risk of experiencing droughts and water security issues by the year 2100 at the same time the rapid urbanization across the planet has led to a greater percentage of urban areas becoming covered by impervious surfaces that prevent soil infiltration shuster et al 2005 these shifts result in increased runoff and flooding du et al 2012 increased nonpoint source pollution o driscoll et al 2010 and a suite of degraded conditions in receiving waters referred to as the urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 the combination of climate change and rapid urbanization poses serious risks for public health and safety zhang et al 2018 showed that the extreme flooding caused by hurricane harvey in august 2017 was intensified due to both anthropogenic induced climate change and the effects of increased urbanization in houston texas usa similarly yang et al 2021 found that the extreme rainfall and flooding in western europe during july 2021 was exacerbated due to urbanization and urban induced rainfall anomalies such extreme precipitation events have provoked efforts to mitigate the worsening effects of climate change stormwater management systems which are typically broken into two categories gray and green represent critical infrastructure components which are directly threatened by climate change green stormwater infrastructure gsi is increasingly utilized in urban areas to assist and supplant existing gray stormwater infrastructure and enhance the resilience of urban drainage networks to climate change eckart et al 2017 huang et al 2018 one of the most commonly implemented and studied types of gsi is the bioretention cell which consists of layers of gravel soil sand organic matter and plants tdec 2014 bioretention cells provide effective removal of total suspended solids tss and pollutants e g tn tp davis et al 2001 while reducing runoff volume and peak discharge dietz 2007 winston et al 2016 davis 2008 despite research showing the benefits of bioretention under existing climate regimes the use of these systems for climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability is underpinned by their ability to function under future climate scenarios which is effectively the climate resiliency of bioretention hettiarachchi et al 2022b historically hydrologic engineering designs including bioretention have relied on the stationarity of rainfall patterns however recent research has shown that this can no longer be assumed with a shift towards increasingly frequent and more intense storm events milly et al 2008 pryor et al 2009 cook et al 2020 rosenberg et al 2010 wasko and sharma 2015 and hettiarachchi et al 2018 also found that warming temperatures associated with future climate regimes could increase the variability of storm temporal patterns further stressing stormwater infrastructure thus a number of studies have begun to use projections from regional climate models rcms and general circulation models gcms to understand potential shifts in hydrologic processes and the resulting effects on critical infrastructure arnbjerg nielsen 2012 cook et al 2019 sarkar et al 2018 recent studies have implemented a similar approach to investigate the future function of bioretention cells under climate change hathaway et al 2014 evaluated future performance of four bioretention cells in rocky mountain and nashville north carolina usa using one rcm and two representative concentration pathways rcps comparing historic 2001 2004 with projected 2055 2058 performance results showed that the frequency and volume of overflow could increase significantly for projected scenarios requiring an additional storage of between 9 and 31 cm to limit increases in annual overflow under future conditions zhang et al 2019 evaluated a range of design configurations for a bioretention cell in melbourne australia using eight gcms and one rcp comparing historic 1995 2004 with projected 2040 2049 performance results suggested that larger bioretention cells should be prioritized due to the variability of future gcm scenarios similarly tirpak et al 2021 evaluated a range of design configurations for a bioretention cell in knoxville tennessee usa using 10 rcms two rcps and three underlying soil types with infiltration rates ranging from 0 13 cm hr to 2 5 cm hr comparing historic 2010 2014 with projected 2040 2044 performance results showed that even the most significant retrofit configurations led to overflow increases in 67 4 to 71 1 of simulations with underlying soil type having minimal effect on overflow indicating the significant impact of shifting precipitation patterns wang et al 2019a performed a similar study by evaluating a range of bioretention cell surface areas in guangzhou china using 11 gcms four rcps and six design storms results showed that future bioretention cells could maintain existing function for small short duration storms by increasing surface area but function will diminish as storm size and duration increase regardless of increases in surface area highlighting regional differences in future climate winston 2016 evaluated future performance of bioretention cells located 25 km apart in northeast ohio usa using one gcm and two rcps comparing historic 2001 2004 with projected 2055 2059 performance results showed that bioretention cells mitigated 5 9 less runoff in one location while mitigating 4 6 more runoff in the other location as such while some research has been performed investigating the performance of a single bioretention cell under future precipitation patterns almost no research has been performed comparing multiple locations across the united states or the globe for that matter there is a need to explore the geographic variability in the effects of climate change on existing gsi to better understand the regional adaptations that may be required to prepare for these impacts to address this knowledge gap this study explores changes in bioretention performance under future climate change scenarios in 17 locations across the united states selected based off their unique hydrologic region ten regional climate models rcms were selected from the north american coordinated regional downscaling experiment na cordex to provide a wide range of potential future precipitation outcomes at each location mearns et al 2017 the objective of this effort was to identify shifts in bioretention performance from historical to future conditions and to better understand the geographic variability of impacts to future performance results from this work can be used to identify locations where bioretention cells may be most adversely affected by climate change and thus may require modifications to ensure their desired performance persists in the future 2 data collection and methodology 2 1 data collection observed climate data were acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information ncei data archive to allow for bias correction of climate model outputs and characterization of historical bioretention function noaa 2016 simulated historic and future climate data were acquired from the north american coordinated regional downscaling experiment na cordex data archive mearns et al 2017 climate data were acquired for 17 locations across the us table 1 which were selected based on their unique hydrologic region defined by the bukovsky climate map bukovsky et al 2019 the bukovsky climate map groups regions by hydrologic similarity accounting for average temperature and rainfall as well as seasonal occurrences such as the north american monsoon bukovsky 2011 using the same cities as cook et al 2019 each climate region in the contiguous us was represented by at least one city in the analysis observed daily temperature maximum and minimum and hourly precipitation data from january 1 1999 to december 31 2013 were gathered from the noaa ncei archive for all 17 locations noaa 2016 the 15 year period was selected to fully capture the year to year variability of recent precipitation and temperature patterns subject to data availability the 17 noaa ncei stations shown in table 1 were selected based off the availability of continuous climate data for the time range specified and their proximity to the selected cities covering the majority of north america the na cordex data archive provides simulated climate data from a range of rcms produced using boundary conditions from gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 mearns et al 2017 as recommended by bukovsky and mearns 2020 all ten na cordex climate models with available hourly precipitation projections were used for this study to provide the most comprehensive range of potential future outcomes table 2 due to the limited availability of hourly precipitation projections in the archive only one rcp4 5 scenario representing moderate population growth moderate climate policy and eventual decline and stabilization of anthropogenic emissions was evaluated while nine rcp8 5 scenarios representing high population growth no climate policy and rapid increase in anthropogenic emissions were evaluated van vuuren et al 2011 both historic simulated climate data from january 1 1999 to december 31 2013 and future simulated climate data from january 1 2035 to december 31 2049 were acquired to allow for bias correction and swmm modeling 2 2 bias correction systematic bias was corrected in climate model outputs following data acquisition due to bias introduced during model formulation and the downscaling process bias correction procedures must be applied to more accurately align modeled climate data with observed climate data rosenberg et al 2010 stephens et al 2010 compared five different weather prediction climate and global cloud resolving models and found that all models overproduced precipitation frequency by a factor of two while underproducing precipitation intensity compared with observed precipitation data bias correction is therefore required prior to swmm modeling to ensure that rcm inputs provide statistically accurate distributions the kernel density distribution mapping kddm bias correction procedure was selected due to its accuracy ease of implementation mcginnis and mearns 2016 tirpak et al 2021 and overall performance compared with other bias correction procedures mcginnis et al 2015 kddm applies a set of bias correction steps to scale the distribution of climate projections to match that of observed climate data due to the frequent over prediction of low intensity precipitation stephens et al 2010 the excess drizzle was first removed from projected rainfall by setting hourly precipitation volumes below a minimum threshold to zero in order to match the wet dry ratio of timesteps in the observed precipitation data mcginnis and mearns 2016 following this dedrizzling step nonparametric estimates of the underlying probability density functions pdfs similar to smooth non discrete histograms were produced for the observed and simulated precipitation datasets the resulting pdfs were integrated using the trapezoidal rule to approximate cumulative distribution functions cdfs a transfer function was then created by fitting a spline between the corresponding quantiles for the inverse cdf of the observed precipitation data and the forward cdf of the simulated precipitation data mcginnis et al 2015 lastly the transfer function was applied to both the historic and future simulated precipitation data yielding bias corrected projections of future rainfall kddm bias correction of the simulated temperature data followed the same steps as the precipitation bias correction with the exception of the dedrizzling step and was performed on a monthly basis to account for seasonal variability mcginnis et al 2015 bias correction via kddm was applied to all projections of precipitation and temperature records for each of the 17 cities of interest in a single instance extreme values were removed from observed climate data to improve bias correction the september 2013 floods in boulder co resulted in 231 mm of rainfall recorded on september 12 noaa 2016 nearly doubling the previous daily record of 122 mm hamill 2014 according to the noaa national weather service precipitation frequency data server noaa 2017 the 24 hr 1000 year precipitation depth for boulder co is 207 mm 24 mm less than the rainfall on september 12 2013 further illustrating the rarity of the precipitation event cook 2018 reported that extreme values in observed data used to bias correct simulated data may lead to inaccurate annual maximum values obtained through kddm bias correction as such observed hourly precipitation data from september 9 2013 through september 16 2013 for boulder co were replaced with the median precipitation depth for that time period using the previous 14 year record removal of these extreme values resulted in bias corrected simulated precipitation data that more accurately reflected the distribution of the observed precipitation data kddm bias correction of the simulated hourly precipitation and daily temperature data was performed using the r package climod mcginnis 2018 r core team 2020 similar to analysis in tirpak et al 2021 the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to confirm the statistical similarities between the distributions of observed and bias corrected climate data for all 10 models across all 17 locations based on these results the bias corrected future climate data was determined to be suitable for subsequent swmm modeling following bias correction an implausibly high precipitation depth was noted in the bias corrected future dataset in el paso using model 6 9615 mm in 4 h the precipitation amount was removed and set to 0 mm for the 4 hour time period subsequently producing future precipitation statistics in line with the other nine models 2 3 swmm modeling the usepa storm water management model swmm version 5 1 was used in this study for its ability to provide dynamic rainfall runoff relationships for long term simulations gironás et al 2009 and capacity to directly model bioretention cells using the lid control editor rossman 2015 the swmm model was designed to simulate a hypothetical 0 4 hectare 4 000 m2 subcatchment a bioretention cell a rain gage and an outlet detailed design characteristics for the subcatchment are shown in table 3 the subcatchment was designed with 100 impervious cover to represent a common impervious surface in a city such as a parking lot a manning s n value of 0 01 was selected for the impervious surface to account for the hydraulic efficiency of the subcatchment arcement and schneider 1989 all runoff from the subcatchment was routed directly to the bioretention cell while bioretention cell design guidelines vary by region the same bioretention cell characteristics were used for all locations and models to ensure the only independent variable was climate observed and bias corrected future allowing for relative changes in bioretention cell performance to be assessed bioretention cell design characteristics were based off the baseline design scenario used by tirpak et al 2021 which incorporated design recommendations from the tennessee department of conservation tdec 2014 the minnesota stormwater steering committee mssc 2006 the knox county tennessee stormwater management manual county 2008 and the swmm user s manual version 5 1 rossman 2015 this design was considered to be comparable to design standards in most locations aiona et al 2020 ldeq 2010 massdep 2008 ncdeq 2020 pwsa 2022 sara 2019 bioretention cell design characteristics used in the swmm model are shown in table 4 the surface area 534 2 m2 and surface layer depth 15 2 cm were sized to enable the bioretention cell to store the water quality storm event for the southeastern united states deletic 1998 pitt 1999 which is typically the surface runoff generated from a 25 4 mm storm event the soil layer was composed of a mixture of coarse sand topsoil and organic matter to filter pollutants while promoting flow through high hydraulic conductivity 5 1 cm hr the storage layer underlying the media was composed of astm 57 stone nominal size of 4 75 to 25 mm with a high void ratio 0 4 to allow for water storage or seepage 1 3 cm hr into the native soil astm 2003 lastly the bottom of the underdrain pipe was placed at the top of the storage layer to allow the storage layer to completely fill prior to draining rossman 2015 the rainfall runoff process model accounted for surface runoff from the subcatchment into the bioretention cell the green ampt infiltration model was used to represent soil infiltration using fundamental soil properties i e initial soil moisture deficit saturated hydraulic conductivity and suction head at the wetting front green and ampt 1911 dynamic wave routing was used to solve the one dimensional saint venant equations and incorporate both the continuity and momentum equations rossman 2015 data file inputs included observed hourly precipitation data 1999 2013 and bias corrected future hourly precipitation data 2035 2049 the climatology editor was used to input external climate files containing observed daily temperature data 1999 2013 and bias corrected future daily temperature data 2035 2049 the temperature files were used as the source of evaporation rates in the evaporation tab of the climatology editor which estimates daily evaporation rates from daily temperature values using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 rossman 2015 following model setup the model was run using the observed climate data 17 scenarios from january 1 1999 to december 31 2013 and the bias corrected future climate data 170 scenarios which included 10 projections for each of the 17 cities used herein from january 1 2035 to december 31 2049 three bioretention cell outputs were compiled and assessed in this study i e infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow these three bioretention cell performance indices accounted for the majority of total inflow into the bioretention cell and provided quantitative measures for the efficacy of the bioretention cell the sum of all three performance indices i e infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow over the entire simulation period i e 15 years is hereafter referred to as cumulative volume observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 median average annual infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow volumes for all 17 locations were calculated for fig 5 the values were calculated by dividing the median cumulative volume by the duration of the simulation period i e 15 years to yield an annual average the sum of all three annualized performance indices i e infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow is hereafter referred to as annual volume due to many locations having extremely low underdrain outflow or overflow under the observed precipitation dataset relative comparisons between observed and future datasets have been made in fig 5 using changes in the percent of total annual volume attributed to each hydrologic pathway as opposed to using percent change relative percent change between the observed and future datasets was calculated using eq 1 1 relative c h a n g e f u t u r e o b s e r v e d 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation statistics due to the significant number of locations 17 and models 10 climate inputs were first analyzed to understand how precipitation varied based on both location and a given climate model comparison of observed and future datasets using both categories location and model provides context as to how assessments of climate change effects may yield variable results based on these factors bioretention cell performance was then assessed using three bioretention cell performance indices infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow due to the range of locations selected it s important to first note the geographic and hydrologic variability of the united states the 17 locations can be separated into the following five regions the northeast boston and pittsburgh the midwest chicago fargo and st louis the southeast charlotte memphis and new orleans the southwest amarillo el paso phoenix and san antonio and the northwest west boise boulder portland missoula and san jose the northeast and midwest are defined by humid continental climates with mild to hot summers and year round precipitation the southeast is defined by a humid subtropical climate the southwest varies from cold semi arid to hot desert climates and the northwest west varies from cold semi arid to humid continental to mediterranean climates köppen 1900 for example in the eastern united states pittsburgh is between 550 and 950 km from boston 776 km charlotte 584 km chicago 674 km and st louis 898 km and in the western united states el paso is also between 550 and 950 km from amarillo 577 km boulder 923 km phoenix 555 km and san antonio 808 km however while the observed mean annual rainfall for these five eastern us locations ranges between 912 mm in chicago and 1072 mm in boston the observed mean annual rainfall for these five western us locations ranges between 163 mm in phoenix and 790 mm in san antonio rainfall event depths also vary significantly by region from 35 mm in boise to 268 mm in new orleans for observed 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths fig 1 displays the percent change between the observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 datasets for mean annual rainfall mean annual rain events mean annual rainy days and mean drying period for the 17 locations rainy days were counted as any day in which rainfall depth was greater than 0 0 mm between 00 00 and 23 59 a minimum inter event time mit of 6 hours was used to separate rain events in the datasets chin et al 2016 palynchuk and guo 2008 any period without rainfall for 6 h or more was accounted for in the mean drying period i e the time between consecutive rain events the boxplots for each location consist of the percent change between the observed and future datasets for all 10 models i e 10 values per boxplot out of the 170 total future model location combinations annual rainfall increased in 135 combinations 79 4 annual rain events decreased in 110 combinations 64 7 annual rainy days decreased in 103 combinations 60 6 and mean drying period increased in 107 combinations 62 9 median annual rainfall shown as the solid black line inside each boxplot in fig 1 increased for all 17 locations while the median number of annual rain events and rainy days decreased for nine locations with an additional three locations observing decreases in one of these two precipitation characteristics across all locations mean annual rainfall depth increased by 9 9 71 mm while mean annual rain events and rainy days decreased 6 2 6 5 days and 3 9 3 7 days respectively the greatest percent change in mean annual rainfall with an increase of 18 7 corresponding to an additional 278 mm of rainfall occurred in new orleans while the lowest percent change occurred in portland with an increase of 4 3 38 mm these trends are consistent with the understanding that while the total amount of rainfall may be higher in many locations in the future extreme rainfall will also increase in a significant number of locations due to climate change coupled with an anticipated reduction in the number of rainfall events climate change is expected to bring larger drying periods between storms zhang et al 2019 further increasing the vulnerability of water scarce environments hettiarachchi et al 2022a median drying period increased for 11 locations but portland was the only location where all 10 models projected increased annual dry days i e a decrease in the average number of rainy days per year the northwest west was the only region in which all locations i e boise boulder portland missoula and san jose showed increases in median drying period and excluding missoula account for four of the five largest percent increases in median drying period as documented by manka et al 2016 the significant increase in median drying period in the northwest west could reduce the efficacy of biological processes present in bioretention cells resulting in nutrient export and the subsequent degradation of nearby waterways combining all locations mean drying period increased by 10 5 0 5 days with the greatest percent change in mean drying period occurring in new orleans mean increase of 37 8 or 1 2 days while no change occurred in st louis jhong and tung 2018 also observed increases in the duration of future dry periods in taiwan and suggested that occurrences of floods and droughts could occur more frequently due to the combination of increased precipitation event volumes and drying periods fig 2 displays the percent change between observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 precipitation depths for 50th 90th 99th and 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths for the 17 locations out of the 170 total future model location combinations 50th percentile events increased in 62 combinations 36 5 90th percentile events increased in 118 combinations 69 4 99th percentile events increased in 165 combinations 97 1 and 99 9th percentile events increased in 147 combinations 86 5 while median 50th percentile events only increased in seven locations the higher percentile events were consistently predicted to increase in size with median 90th percentile events increasing in 12 locations median 99th percentile events increasing in all 17 locations and median 99 9th percentile events increasing in 16 locations rainfall intensities were projected to increase for an even greater number of locations and percentiles with median 50th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in 11 locations median 90th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in 15 locations median 99th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in all 17 locations and median 99 9th percentile rainfall intensities predicted to increase in 15 locations the trend in upper percentile precipitation events and rainfall intensities 90th coupled with minimal changes to moderate precipitation events i e 50th percentile supports findings in existing literature and again points to anticipated increases in severe rainfall in the future karl and knight 1998 olsson et al 2009 since bioretention cells are most effective during small lower intensity precipitation events the increase in the frequency of large higher intensity precipitation events is particularly concerning for future bioretention cell performance wang et al 2018 the significant outliers in the 50th boulder and 99 9th percentiles el paso indicate that as expected climate change will not affect regional or even local precipitation equally for example the four locations i e boulder missoula portland and san jose with the greatest increases in median 50th percentile precipitation events occurred in the northwest west while no location in the southwest or southeast showed an increase in median 50th percentile precipitation events additionally while those four locations i e boulder missoula portland and san jose showed all 10 models projecting either increases or no change in 50th percentile precipitation events six locations i e amarillo charlotte el paso memphis san antonio and st louis showed all 10 models projecting either decreases or no change in 50th percentile precipitation events demonstrating the variability of future climate winston 2016 found similar variability in future precipitation when comparing locations only 25 km apart in northeast ohio usa similarly gao et al 2012 showed substantial variability in climate change effects on extreme weather across the eastern united states 3 2 bioretention cell performance statistics fig 3 displays the percent change between observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow from the modeled bioretention cell for all 17 locations due to a lack of overflow under the observed rainfall data i e flow equal to zero boxplots for boise missoula phoenix portland and san jose are excluded from fig 3 as percent change could not be calculated boise was the only location where both underdrain outflow and overflow did not occur under the observed rainfall data and also produced the lowest observed 99th and 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths out of all 17 locations illustrating the relationship between bioretention performance and regional climate while underdrain outflow and or overflow box plots in fig 3 could not be produced for these five locations i e boise missoula phoenix portland and san jose underdrain outflow and overflow increased in all five locations under future scenarios indicating even the best performing bioretention cells may experience diminished performance under future climate change scenarios these locations also produced five of the six lowest observed 99 9th percentile rainfall event depths and are the western most out of all 17 locations further illustrating the relationship between bioretention cell performance and regional climate additionally overflow only occurred on two days out of 15 years under the observed rainfall data for el paso as such percent change between observed and future overflow in el paso appears more extreme in part due to the low number of overflow days for the observed dataset excluding the two locations with increased median infiltration loss boise 25 9 and fargo 1 7 percent change in median infiltration loss ranged from 0 2 portland to 18 3 new orleans in the remaining 15 locations conversely excluding the one location with an observed underdrain outflow value of zero boise percent change in median underdrain outflow increased between 9 7 san antonio and 393 2 phoenix in the remaining 16 locations finally five locations had an observed overflow value of zero i e percent change could not be calculated while extreme outlier values were observed in two locations namely boulder median decrease of 8 6 and el paso median increase of 1510 4 in the remaining 10 locations the percent change in median overflow increased between 74 5 chicago and 509 7 boston additionally all locations in the northeast i e boston and pittsburgh and southeast i e charlotte memphis and new orleans showed all 10 models projecting increases in overflow with a minimum increase in overflow of 140 across the five locations new orleans pittsburgh and st louis also showed all 10 models projecting decreases in median infiltration loss indicating a high likelihood of diminished performance regardless of the future climate change scenario the projected significant increase in overflow in 11 locations is most concerning from a public health and safety perspective due to the increased risk of flooding in urban areas hou et al 2020 olsson et al 2009 and degradation of waterways caused by overflow predominantly bypassing treatment and quickly proceeding to nearby conveyances hathaway et al 2014 walsh et al 2005 out of the 170 total future model location combinations overflow increased in 151 combinations 88 8 underdrain outflow increased in 163 combinations 95 9 and infiltration loss decreased in 121 combinations 71 2 the increase in overflow and underdrain outflow combined with decreased infiltration loss indicate bioretention cells designed following current methods may be unable to accommodate the projected shift in precipitation patterns specifically surface infiltration rates may not be sufficient to avoid significant increases in overflow while only a single underlying soil type 1 3 cm hr was evaluated in this study results from tirpak et al 2021 indicate that underlying soil type has little effect on overflow thus the primary benefits of bioretention cells i e reducing peak runoff groundwater recharge and filtering pollutants may be lessened under future climate change scenarios decreased infiltration loss under increased rainfall volumes has been documented in previous literature tirpak et al 2021 but the root cause has not been investigated this is important as different design modifications may be needed depending on the primary contributors to decreased infiltration this phenomenon is most likely due to the bioretention cell surface layer filling too quickly overwhelming surface infiltration rates and subsequent infiltration loss and contributing to immediate overflow if the surface layer is filling too quickly to enable surface infiltration then the surface layer depth could be increased to hold a greater runoff volume providing additional time for surface infiltration to occur tirpak et al 2021 real time control rtc technologies could provide an additional option to decrease overflow and increase infiltration during moderate storm events through weather research and forecast wrf models and real time sensors and controls klenzendorf et al 2015 enabling bioretention cells to transition from passive stormwater management to active vijayaraghavan et al 2021 compared to passive bioretention cells persaud et al 2019 and shen et al 2020 found that rtc technologies could provide both hydrologic and water quality improvements if retention time and storage are optimized for storm events however further research on the efficacy of rtc technologies for bioretention performance optimization is still required and it s unlikely that rtc technologies could significantly reduce overflow during extreme storm events fig 4 displays the percent change between observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 mean yearly overflow days 50th percentile daily overflow volume 90th percentile daily overflow volume and 99th percentile daily overflow volume overflow days were counted as any day in which overflow volume was greater than 0 0 m3 between 00 00 and 23 59 due to observed values of zero for overflow boise missoula phoenix portland and san jose are not shown in fig 4 i e percent change could not be calculated percent change in median yearly overflow days increased between 16 4 new orleans and 347 5 el paso for all 12 locations shown of the 12 locations shown in fig 4 median number of annual rainy days also decreased in six locations i e boston boulder chicago el paso new orleans and pittsburgh and excluding boulder and st louis median 90th percentile rainfall intensities also increased for the 10 remaining locations again indicating increases in rainfall magnitude and intensity when events do occur a particularly compelling example of this trend is found in new orleans where a relatively low increase in median yearly overflow days was observed yet a significant increase in median annual precipitation 18 7 and 99th percentile rainfall intensities 21 3 and decrease in median annual rainy days 19 5 were observed the largest percent changes in all three precipitation statistics suggesting more intense events will make up a greater percentage of the storms that do occur given that bioretention cells are most effective during small lower intensity precipitation events the efficacy of bioretention cells as a stormwater management practice in new orleans may be questioned as large higher intensity precipitation events become the norm excluding boulder and chicago median 50th 90th and 99th percentile daily overflow increased for the 10 remaining locations shown in fig 4 excluding the northwest west the consistent increase across all overflow percentiles indicates that government agencies city planners and stormwater engineers across the country should expect higher volumes to bypass treatment when overflow occurs from bioretention cells locations in the southeast i e charlotte memphis and new orleans face the greatest likelihood of higher overflow volumes all three locations experienced 100 increases for all three 50th 90th and 99th median daily overflow percentiles with all 10 climate models projecting increases in overflow compared with observed performance given the uniformity in predicted changes to a range of overflow volumes adaptations to limit the environmental and public safety impacts of untreated bypass may be especially critical in these locations 3 3 regional trends in future bioretention cell performance observed 1999 2013 and future 2035 2049 median average annual infiltration loss underdrain outflow and overflow volumes for all 17 locations are presented in fig 5 results indicate that bioretention cells in the southern united states i e southeast and southwest are most at risk of performance impacts under future climate change scenarios the seven southern most locations i e amarillo charlotte el paso memphis new orleans phoenix and san antonio produced the highest relative percent increases in overflow ranging from 7 0 to 19 6 with the exception of memphis these locations also produced six of the highest relative percent decreases in infiltration loss ranging from 15 3 to 24 0 new orleans and san antonio also recorded the two highest relative increases in annual overflow volume 2115 1 cu m yr and 710 0 cu m yr respectively significant increases in overflow in the southern united states are consistent with extreme precipitation projections by prein et al 2017 and bioretention literature cook et al 2019 hathaway et al 2014 the significant increases in overflow are a direct result of the frequent and intense rainfall in the southern united states highlighting the potential limitations of current bioretention design strategies although gsi is likely to provide some resiliency to extreme precipitation these results indicate there are limits in this resilience that can be exceeded similarly bioretention cells located in the midwest and northeast are still at risk of diminished performance under future climate change scenarios following the seven southern locations the five locations in the midwest and northeast i e boston chicago fargo pittsburgh and st louis produced the next highest relative percent increases in overflow ranging from 3 3 to 5 2 the five midwest and northeast locations also recorded the 5th through 9th highest relative median increases in annual overflow volumes ranging from 176 2 cu m yr to 241 1 cu m yr results are consistent with cook et al 2019 who found that overflow from bioretention cells in the midwest and northeast occurred at equal or greater magnitudes compared with other regions in the united states bioretention cells in the northwest west have the best likelihood of being able to maintain existing function under future climate change scenarios also consistent with previous findings cook et al 2019 the five northwest west locations i e boise boulder missoula portland and san jose produced the lowest relative percent changes in overflow ranging from a decrease of 0 3 to an increase of 1 2 these locations also recorded the lowest relative changes in annual overflow volume ranging from a median decrease of 4 2 cu m yr to an increase of 21 5 cu m yr the minimal effect on existing bioretention cell function indicates that stormwater infrastructure in the northwest west may require the least adaptation measures to maintain existing function under future climate conditions 3 4 implications to bioretention design and adaptation measures while overflow and infiltration are expected to increase and decrease respectively under future climate conditions for many bioretention cells across the united states modifications can be implemented to mitigate the effects of climate change to their performance tirpak et al 2021 compared an ensemble of retrofit and design configurations for bioretention cells in east tennessee and found varying degrees of success for three scenarios 1 increasing the soil layer depth 2 increasing the storage layer depth 3 and increasing the bioretention cell surface area increasing the depth of the soil layer in the bioretention cell was shown to be a conservative yet effective method of increasing runoff volume retention tirpak et al 2021 as such increasing the depth of the soil layer for bioretention cells in regions where overflow is expected to modestly increase such as the northwest west and parts of the midwest is a viable option requiring low investment particularly for newly constructed cells increased soil layer depth can also increase pollutant removal and water storage hatt et al 2009 which may mitigate plant stress in these systems in the drier climates projected for the northwest west increasing the depth of the storage layer has been found to be an effective method of reducing overflow hathaway et al 2014 found an increased storage layer depth from 9 0 to 31 0 cm would maintain existing function of bioretention cells in east north carolina into the late 2050 s similarly winston 2016 found that increasing storage layer depth from 5 0 to 17 0 cm would maintain existing function in northeast ohio into the late 2050 s increasing the storage layer depth has the potential to temporarily store a greater volume of runoff than increasing the soil layer depth but requires either deepening the bioretention cell or removing media from the soil layer reducing the efficacy of pollutant removal further substantial increases in surface storage depth may lead to public safety concerns due to the hazard posed by deeper ponding zones relative to nearby surfaces however increasing the storage layer depth has been shown to be more effective at reducing overflow than increasing the soil layer depth and should be considered if overflow reduction is a priority tirpak et al 2021 densely populated highly urbanized locations with a need to mitigate projected increases in future overflow such as chicago pittsburgh or boston may greatly benefit from increased storage layer depths in bioretention cells the final viable option investigated by tirpak et al 2021 increased the surface area of bioretention cells relative to the subcatchment which has been shown to be an effective method of reducing overflow and increasing infiltration due to increased soil and storage layer volumes wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 increasing bioretention cell surface area requires the greatest investment of the three options and may not be viable in highly urbanized locations due to limited space or cost however locations in the southern united states such as el paso san antonio memphis charlotte and new orleans may require significant investment in all stormwater infrastructure both grey and green to mitigate projected increases in overflow volumes a location such as new orleans in particular may need to incorporate bioretention cell modifications wherever possible to reduce the significant increases in overflow volumes projected under future climate conditions given the geographic and hydrologic variability of the us locations selected for this study the bioretention cell modifications suggested could be applied to a range of cities globally locations projected to experience fewer rainfall events and longer dry periods such as melbourne australia zhang et al 2019 could increase soil layer depths of bioretention cells to mitigate plant stress and improve pollutant removal high density locations with humid continental climates similar to boston and pittsburgh such as vienna austria strauss et al 2013 may benefit from increasing the storage layer depth in bioretention cells depending on the severity of future climate conditions subtropical locations similar to new orleans and charlotte such as guangzhou china wang et al 2019a will likely require considerable bioretention cell modifications wherever possible 4 conclusions bioretention performance under future climate change projections was evaluated for 17 cities across the contiguous united states using swmm version 5 1 median annual rainfall increased across all 17 locations in future scenarios a majority of locations also experienced a decreased median number of rainy days and rain events while median drying period increased precipitation events were projected to become more severe for upper percentile events 90th while 50th percentile events were projected to change minimally for all locations except for boulder future precipitation events were projected therefore to become less frequent but more severe however findings clearly indicate that while precipitation event severity is expected to increase on average across the united states the shift in precipitation patterns will vary significantly by location as a result of shifting precipitation patterns future bioretention cell performance was impacted by changing climates across all locations results demonstrated that bioretention cells in the southern united states have the greatest likelihood of diminished future function followed by cells in the midwest and northeast due to the magnitude of change projected for the northwest west bioretention cells in those regions may only require minor investments in retrofits or design modifications to maintain future performance increased annual overflow which poses significant environmental and health risks to urban communities projected for the midwest northeast and southern united states may elevate the importance of design modifications e g increasing surface storage layer volumes to offset these risks projected decreases in infiltration from bioretention cells especially notable in the southern united states presents additional challenge for city planners and stormwater engineers if bioretention cells are no longer able to promote infiltration into native soils and filter pollutants from runoff then their benefit as a stormwater control measure will be substantially reduced further these outcomes suggest that while bioretention following current design strategies may continue to provide some runoff mitigation shifting precipitation patterns including more intense rain events reveal limitations in their ability to maintain desired performance under future climate conditions future studies should consider a wider range of climate models emissions scenarios and bioretention cell configurations to provide an even more robust assessment of future impacts to performance additionally while a range of climate models and locations were evaluated in this study a single bioretention cell configuration was used for all simulations studies which consider multiple bioretention cell configurations would provide insight on the significance of design modifications beyond current standards for a range of locations to maintain existing function under future climate scenarios credit authorship contribution statement matthew weathers methodology formal analysis data curation

2581,excessive anthropogenic nitrate loads around coasts and rivers threaten human and ecosystem health in this study we established new numerical models to investigate how dynamic interactions between hydraulics nutrients and biofilms hnb drive the removal process of nitrate from upwelling groundwater within heterogeneous sediments the results showed nitrate can be removed as much as 60 times more efficiently in heterogeneous sediments under interactions between hnb than in the typical heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous conceptualizations with assuming constant microbial biomass driven by the interactions between hnb aquatic sediments are more microbially active to mediate biogeochemical cycling specifically progressively increasing biomass with biofilm growth promotes oxygen consumption resulting in enhanced denitrification in heterogeneous sediments meanwhile not only can the hotspots of denitrification develop in low permeability silt structures with rich organic matter om but they can also form in high permeability and low om sand structures as well in contrast by assuming constant microbial biomass the hotspots can only form in silt structures for heterogeneous sediments and cannot exist for equivalent homogeneous sediments these findings are significantly different from the classical understanding of heterogeneous aquatic sediments in which coarse structures inhibit efficient nitrate removal and mainly function as delivery channels of nutrients whereas only fine structures host hotspots of denitrification significant underestimation of groundwater borne nitrate removal can be induced by assuming constant microbial biomass overall this study is useful for understanding nitrate fate within aquatic sediments and benefits for coastal and riverine restorations and watershed nitrogen management keywords surface water and groundwater interaction nitrate removal heterogeneous sediments upwelling groundwater biofilm growth numerical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater discharges to most continental surface water bodies cardenas and wilson 2006 winter et al 1998 and coastal ocean along continental shelves moore 1996 moore et al 2008 fig 1 concurrently significant amounts of nitrate migrate from groundwater to surface water threatening humans and ecosystem health grant et al 2018 gruber and galloway 2008 denitrification is a primary sink for permanently reducing nitrate no3 to gases i e n2 n2o and thus it regulates nitrate removal from aquatic systems martínez espinosa et al 2021 rivett et al 2008 the bed interfaces e g ocean floor riverbed lake bed have been widely recognized as hotspots of denitrification boano et al 2014 cardenas et al 2008 triska et al 1989 as upwelling groundwater discharges to surface water denitrification occurs within bed interfaces which are generally the last porous media phase where nitrate can be removed permanently before transitioning into water columns above sediments hester et al 2019 thus the process of nitrate removal from upwelling groundwater within aquatic bed sediments is a subject of interest for research heterogeneous bed sediments often consist of high k where k denotes hydraulic conductivity coarse structures e g cobble gravel sand that are often organic scarce mcgarr et al 2021 and low k fine structures e g silt clay that are typically organic rich e g barnes et al 2019 knights et al 2017 krause et al 2013 the heterogeneity of sediment permeability and organic matter om that fuels microbial mediated aerobic respiration and denitrification significantly impact water flow paths and solute residence time cardenas et al 2004 sawyer and cardenas 2009 pryshlak et al 2015 and further influence the nitrate removal in aquatic sediments hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 specifically as water flows through heterogeneous sediments residence times tend to be relatively short in high k coarse structures western et al 2001 and are relatively long in low k fine structures gomez velez et al 2014 pryshlak et al 2015 in coarse structures the combinations of scarce om and short residence times do not facilitate the consumption of dissolved oxygen do via aerobic respiration and thus may promote the formation of oxic conditions wallace et al 2020 conversely in fine structures there is a relatively longer residence time and rich om where anoxic conditions can be created claret et al 1997 knights et al 2017 krause et al 2013 according to the theory of thermodynamics denitrification would be inhibited by oxygen whereas a high nitrate removal rate occurs within a low oxygen environment where organic carbon is ample duff and triska 1990 rivett et al 2008 thus based on these principles the following classical perspectives were proposed e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 in heterogeneous aquatic sediments coarse structures typically lead to low nitrate removal efficiency due to scarce om and short residence time and mainly function as the channels for delivery of nutrients whereas fine structures host hotspots of denitrification and promote nitrate removal due to rich om and long residence time the magnitude and efficiency of nitrate removal in heterogeneous aquatic sediments depend on the balance between the efficient delivery of nitrate through coarse structures and the nitrate removal occurring within fine structures wallace et al 2021 several studies have investigated the processing of nitrate in heterogeneous aquatic sediments for example sawyer 2015 examined the removal of nitrate as upwelling groundwater flows across heterogeneous sediments bardini et al 2013 pescimoro et al 2019 and wallace et al 2020 2021 analyzed nitrogen cycling within heterogeneous riparian aquifer under tidal influence and within hyporheic zones along streambeds similarly hester et al 2014 and hester et al 2019 investigated the mixing dependent denitrification in dune induced hyporheic zones from these studies e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 two common assumptions were adopted to investigate nitrate removal in heterogeneous aquatic sediments including 1 microbial biomass in aquatic sediments has no volume and is constant over time and uniformly distributed within coarse fine structures 2 sediment permeability is constant over time in fact these two assumptions often deviate from field conditions in aquatic sediments e g aubeneau et al 2016 battin and sengschmitt 1999 blaschke et al 2003 jin et al 2017 newcomer et al 2016 treese et al 2009 ulrich et al 2015 xian et al 2020 specifically when nutrients are available biofilm forms by assembling cells and extracellular polymeric substances and biomass as well as sediment permeability change over space and time due to the growth of biofilm e g battin and sengschmitt 1999 blaschke et al 2003 newcomer et al 2016 treese et al 2009 furthermore complex interactions between biofilm growth loss water flow and reactive transport of nutrients occur within bed interfaces caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 ping et al 2020 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 biofilms can occupy pore spaces and reduce the porosity of sediments and cause bioclogging effect that decrease permeability of porous media thullner et al 2002 thullner et al 2004 causing water flow and nutrients transport to change in turn biofilm growth depends on the nutrients supply and biofilm loss can be induced by endogenous decay and flow induced biofilm shearing ke et al 2021 rittmann 1982 speitel and digiano 1987 biofilm growth rate further varies as a response to changes in nutrient distributions concentrations caruso et al 2017 newcomer et al 2018 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 and flow induced shearing forces ke et al 2021 rittmann 1982 speitel and digiano 1987 thus physical e g sediment permeability chemical e g om and microbial heterogeneities spatiotemporally coexist and interconnect in realistic bed interfaces systems however while investigating nitrogen removal in heterogeneous beds consisting of sand and silt previous studies e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 often neglected the interactions between hydraulics nutrients and biofilms hnb and consequently the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in biomass and sediment permeability were ignored recently some studies have presented coupled models of biofilm growth reactive transport of nutrients and water flow to incorporate these interactions to analyze nutrients cycling in hyporheic zones e g caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 newcomer et al 2018 ping et al 2018 2020 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 or wetlands samsó et al 2016 however these studies focused on the nutrients cycling in homogeneous aquatic sediments thus the removal process of nitrate from upwelling groundwater under dynamic interactions between hnb in heterogeneous aquatic sediments has not been well elucidated the purpose of this study is to investigate how the interactions between hnb drive nitrate removal from upwelling groundwater through heterogeneous aquatic sediments a series of coupled numerical models were developed which couple water flow reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth in different heterogeneous sediments with varying sand silt fractions these numerical model simulations are used to analyze the spatial relationships between hotspots of denitrification high k and low om coarse structures and low k and high om fine structures we also compared the models for heterogeneous sediments as well as equivalent homogeneous sediments while ignoring the interactions between hnb to understand how nitrate removal varies in the absence of the interactions and or sediment heterogeneity 2 fluid flow biogeochemical and biofilm model 2 1 model description in this section we establish new two dimensional 2 d coupled numerical models of water flow reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth to describe nitrate dynamics in the process of upwelling groundwater discharge to surface water through heterogeneous sediments our model is based on previous reactive transport models e g sawyer 2015 which neglected the interactions between hnb and instead assigned uniform and constant microbial biomass concentration and sediment permeability for sand silt structures of heterogeneous aquatic sediments despite several studies bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 using other models to examine nitrate removal in heterogeneous aquatic sediments as discussed in section 1 only sawyer 2015 s model investigated the removal of nitrate from upwelling groundwater across heterogeneous sediments which include both nonuniform physical e g hydraulic conductivity and chemical e g organic carbon content properties in addition we also adopted the considerations from the previous models e g caruso et al 2017 newcomer et al 2018 ping et al 2018 2020 xian et al 2019 that have incorporated the interactions in homogeneous sediments and neglected biofilm shearing overall our model couples flow reactive transport of nutrients biofilm growth endogenous decay and shearing and bioclogging processes occurring within heterogeneous beds the heterogeneous bed sediments consist of binary spatial distributions of sand and silt these were stochastically simulated using a markov chain method and indicator simulations with quenching within t progs carle 1999 in all 21 heterogeneous cases were created with silt fractions ranging from 0 to 100 by an interval of 5 fig 2 the mean length of 2 cm was adopted for the less abundant facies in the horizontal and vertical direction these heterogeneous cases are identical to those generated by sawyer 2015 and are representatives of universal centimeter or core scale features of aquatic sediments such as rip up clasts combinations of terrestrial om e g fine grained om leaves and sticks sawyer 2015 2 2 governing equation the porous flow reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm

2 3 initial and boundary conditions and model simulation scenarios eqs 1 16 are solved by the finite element software comsol multiphysics a constant hydraulic head difference of 1 cm is maintained between the bottom inlet and the top outlet to keep an upwelling groundwater flow to surface water fig 1b the inlet is assigned by constant concentrations of cno 3 0 20 mg l cdo 0 2 mg l and cdoc 0 0 mg l that represents nitrate rich anoxic upwelling groundwater with negligible doc gu et al 2007 krause et al 2013 therefore the energy source for microbial respiration is solely from the poc within the sediments the do concentration of the upwelling groundwater at the bottom boundary is significantly dependent on the upstream microbial consumption along the flow paths for example as riparian zones mainly consist of coarse sediments like gravel cobble and coarse sand the do consumption is relatively low because of the organic scarce coarse sediments and the short residence times and thus it is possible to form the oxygenated groundwater in this situation e g song et al 2018 krause et al 2013 conversely anoxic groundwater can form in the riparian zones that are composed of organic rich fine sediments like silt and clay due to the high potential of aerobic respiration and long residence times in general it is more common to find anoxic rather than oxygenated groundwater in realistic field settings with the considerations of the more common anoxic groundwater here the anoxic upwelling groundwater is set as the bottom boundary meanwhile the outlet is given as an outflow boundary this outflow boundary results in that the do concentration of surface water as well as the diffusion of the do from surface water to groundwater are not explicitly simulated in the models in fact the do diffusion from surface water to groundwater can only influence the nitrate processing within the extent of several millimeters approaching the water sediment interface and therefore it is negligible for the removal of nitrate across the entire 2 d domain more discussions on the impact of the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater are provided in section 3 3 lateral boundaries are set as no flow and no flux boundary conditions the initial hydraulic head across the 2 d domain was assigned as the steady state distribution under the given hydraulic head difference between the inlet and outlet also the initial distributions of nutrients are given as the steady distribution under the assigned concentration boundaries sources sinks and the hydraulic conditions with no microbial consumption such initial distributions of nutrients represent the steady state concentration profiles before the functional microbial inoculation in the aquatic sediments for the sandy and silty facies the original i e without bioclogging hydraulic conductivities are 1 10 4 m s and 5 10 6 m s respectively domenico and schwartz 1990 freeze and cherry 1979 and the original particulate organic carbon poc content are 0 2 and 2 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 respectively the initial biomass concentrations of 1 10 4 kg m3 and 1 10 3 kg m3 are respectively adopted for sandy and silty facies sawyer 2015 representing an initial attachment stage of microbial biofilm growth the higher initial biomass concentration in silty than sandy facies is given because the silty facies have the higher specific surface area for microbial attachment and also have the higher organic carbon content to guarantee microbes survive in the initial attachment stage sawyer 2015 the biogeochemical and biofilms parameters of numerical models are calibrated from the 2 d sandbox experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 and are summarized in table 1 the model calibration is provided in section 3 1 the 2 d model domain was discretized by 35 000 80 000 triangle elements the transient numerical simulations were run for a period of 300 d during which an entire biofilm growth period including initial bacterial attachment biofilm growing stage and decay stage occur in previous studies the heterogeneous sediments were often represented by equivalent homogeneous or heterogeneous models assuming constant microbial biomass thus in this study two sets of heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous models that assume constant microbial biomass i e no biofilm growth are also established for each heterogeneous case these heterogeneous cases are stochastically generated above to investigate the controls of the interactions between hnb on nitrate removal for the heterogeneous model assuming constant microbial biomass the initial biomass concentration distributions are assigned with the initial values in the heterogeneous model with the interactions as for the equivalent homogeneous model assuming constant microbial biomass the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is calculated based on darcy s law using the initial groundwater flux in the heterogeneous model the initial poc content and the biomass concentration were derived from the arithmetically weighted averages according to the sand silt fraction in the heterogeneous model at the initial time sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 the other parameters are the same as those in the heterogeneous model with the interactions see table 1 for the summary of the model simulation scenarios 2 4 quantifying

reliability of the 2 d numerical model simulations we simulate with the 2 d sandbox experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 and compare the simulated results and their experimental data we chose the experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 for comparisons because the similar experimental conditions of the upwelling porous flow and the nutrient supplies of doc do and no3 for microbial growth with those in our numerical models in the experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 the sandbox dimension 0 44 m 0 30 m 0 01 m was continuously supplied from the bottom with nutrients solutions 0 11 mm acetate 0 3 mm o2 1 ppm nano3 for biofilm growth the sandbox was filled with quartz sand having a grain size of 0 4 0 8 mm the sand box was divided into 3 layers in the vertical direction from the inlet 1 sterilized layer 0 14 m thick 2 inoculated layer 0 12 m thick 3 sterilized layer 0 18 m thick the temporal changes in hydraulic conductivity and porosity were observed by measuring variations in the hydraulic gradient across the whole sandbox the experiments were repeated three times for 20 25 days and the substrate in experiment 3 was removed after 20 days more details about the sandbox experiment can be found in seifert and engesgaard 2012 the parameters of reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth are calibrated by fitting the simulated results with the experimental data as shown in fig 3 some variations occur in the experimental results of experiment 1 2 3 the possible reasons include 1 the nutrients was nonuniformly supplied from the bottom to the sand box seifert and engesgaard 2012 2 the sand may be heterogeneously packed in the sand box overall the simulated results generally agree well with the average output of the experiment 1 2 3 the calibrated parameters of the numerical model are summarized in table 1 3 2 controls of interactions between hnb on removal of nitrate from upwelling groundwater in heterogeneous sediments fig 4 a presents the case where the interactions between hnb are considered and the cases where no interaction is included i e assuming constant microbial biomass it can be observed that the efficiency of nitrate removal generally rises as the silt content increases for siltier sediments the organic matter content is higher and the residence time is longer due to the lower permeability high organic matter content and long residence time facilitate do consumption promoting denitrification since the efficiency of nitrate removal increases but the groundwater discharge flux decreases with silt content fig 4a and 4c the nitrate removal rate increases with silt content and reaches a peak at mild or moderate silt content fig 4b these results are consistent with recent studies e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 of nitrate reduction in heterogeneous streambed sediments assuming constant microbial biomass in contrast to the cases assuming constant microbial biomass the time average groundwater discharge rate to surface water was only slightly reduced by the biofilm induced bioclogging effect due to biofilm growth fig 4c this is because biofilm growth is doc limited and flow shearing inhibited for relatively sandy sediments meanwhile it is no3 do limited for relatively silty sediments despite this as portrayed in fig 4a and 4b significant discrepancies were observed in the removal efficiency and removal rate of nitrate in the relatively sandy sediments as for silty sediments only a slight discrepancy was observed the greatest discrepancy occurs in the silt fractions of 0 15 specifically 60 times higher nitrate removal efficiency can be observed for the case with the interactions between hnb in contrast to the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous cases assuming constant microbial biomass meanwhile 58 times greater nitrate removal rate was induced by the interactions based on the reactive transport model of nitrate assuming constant microbial biomass sawyer 2015 examined the nitrate removal in heterogeneous sediments consisting of sand and silt structures as upwelling groundwater discharges to surface water sawyer 2015 showed that nitrate removal efficiency is 1 for silt fraction 25 and increases to roughly 100 for silt fraction 60 and the nitrate removal rate is greatest at moderate silt fractions in comparison the nitrate removal efficiency and removal rate are less than those in our cases which assume constant microbial concentration this is because sawyer 2015 imposed oxygenated upwelling groundwater do 8 mg l to the bottom boundary thus inhibiting denitrification meanwhile the anoxic groundwater do 2 mg l at the bottom boundary facilitating denitrification was used in the present study despite these differences the varying trends of nitrate removal efficiency and nitrate removal rate with silt fraction are generally consistent fig 4a and 4b moreover differing from the consistently low nitrate removal rate of sandy sediments i e silt fraction 25 in sawyer 2015 the present study found that relatively high nitrate removal rate can occur in sandy sediments despite relatively low poc content due to the biofilm growth fig 4a and 4b some laboratory studies have shown that relatively high denitrification rate can occur within organic scarce sandy sediments e g cook et al 2006 gihring et al 2010 for example by collecting apalachicola bay and gulf of mexico intact sediments of sands with carbon contents of 0 11 0 15 in usa gihring et al 2010 have shown that the efflux rate of n2 the products of denitrification can reach up to 0 87 mmol n m 2 d 1 cook et al 2006 also have detected the efflux rate of n2 ranging from 0 07 mmol n m 2h 1 to 0 13 mmol n m 2h 1 within the sandy sediments samples collected from helsingør denmark thus for organic scarce sandy sediments the previous models e g sawyer 2015 which assume constant biomass concentration may significantly underestimate the nitrate removal of heterogeneous aquatic sediment under upwelling groundwater flow conditions for the relatively sandy sediments the progressively increasing biomass with biofilm growth largely enhances the microbial bioactivity of aquatic sediments increases the do consumption rate and denitrification rate and thus promoting the removal of no3 from groundwater fig 5 driven by the stimulation of nutrients biofilm growth mainly occurs in both the silt structures and the immediate downstream strips in the sand structures resulting in the development of local low permeability bioactive microsites at the bioactive microsites in the sand structures doc can be supplied from the poc dissolution from the upstream silt structures and mixes with the no3 that was mainly transferred via sand structures this mixing of nutrients stimulates the biofilm growth and promote the development of the hotspots of denitrification in the mixing zones consequently the hotspots of denitrification cannot only form within the silt structures but also develop within sand structures in contrast as shown in fig 5 by assuming constant microbial biomass the hotspots of nitrate removal can only develop in silt structures for the heterogeneous sediments also they do not exist for the equivalent homogeneous sediments due to the assumption that microbial biomass is unchanged and microbial biomass concentration is much less in sand than silt structures sawyer 2015 also showed the hotspots of denitrification also only form within the low k and high om silt structures in fact several field studies can provide direct evidences for the new findings of the coexistence of hotspots of denitrification within high k low om coarse structures and low k high om fine structures for example hill et al 2000 investigated the denitrification in the riparian zone along two transects of the boyne river in southern ontario canada the groundwater transports 20 60 mg l 1 no3 to the boyne river through heterogeneous sediments consisting of the coarse structures of sand gravel and the fine structures of peat organic loams and muds hill et al 2000 observed doc no3 do n2o distributions for the two transects their observed results e g fig 7 in hill et al 2000 showed the hotspots of denitrification can occur in both the sand structures and peat structures or peat sand interfaces moreover by collecting pore water and sediments samples over shore perpendicular cross sections of a sandy beach where fresh groundwater discharges to the sea in cape shores lewes delaware usa kim et al 2017 2019 have examined the spatial distributions of aerobic respiration rate denitrification rate and poc in the sandy beach aquifers the observed data e g fig 3 in kim et al 2017 and fig 5 in kim et al 2019 indicated that the high denitrification rate did not always co occur with the organic rich zones but can also occur within in the organic scarce zones of sand structures based on previous assumptions about constant and uniform microbial biomass presents in coarse fine structures of heterogeneous aquatic sediments e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 the sand structures were often regarded as the channels that deliver nutrients thus inhibiting efficient nitrate removal due to short residence time scarce om whereas the hotspots of nitrate removal can only form in fine structures due to long residence time and high om e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 thus conceptually the nitrate removal occurring in sand structures was often regarded much less than in silt structures pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 however our study shows that the microbial biomass varies over space and time due to the spatiotemporal variations of flow field and nutrient distributions in heterogeneous sediments as a response not only can the hotspots of denitrification form in low k and high om silt structures but they can develop in high k and low om sand structures as well fig 5 fig 4d highlights the biofilm enhanced nitrate removal in sand structures making the nitrate removal rate occurring within sand structures to be higher than silt fraction 30 those occurring within silt structures in comparisons despite the heterogeneity of sediment permeability and om content have been incorporated the ratio of nitrate removal occurring in sand structures to that in silt structures can be significantly underestimated due to the neglect of the interactions between hnb 3 3 implications of interactions between hnb on nitrate removal in bed interfaces as surface water and or groundwater flow across bed sediments the removal of nitrate is fundamentally determined by the solute residences time and the microbial consumption rate based on this theory the rapid removal of nitrate requires anoxic environment high doc concentration high microbial activity and relatively long residence time pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2021 by establishing new coupled models of water flow reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth the present study shows that the microbial bioactivity within aquatic sediments increases with microbial growth enhanced microbial activity can increase the consumption of do and create the larger anoxic zones facilitating denitrification and thus leading to more efficient nitrate removal thus previous reactive transport models e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 that often assumed constant microbial biomass concentration may underpredict the nitrate removal efficiency in aquatic sediments such as hyporheic zones riparian zones or wetlands in heterogeneous aquatic sediments the water flow across fine structures typically is low do no3 but high doc due to their low permeability and high om content claret et al 1997 knights et al 2017 krause et al 2013 in contrast the coarse structures can transport high no3 do but low doc because of their high permeability and low om content wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 as a result the important mixing of waters with distinct chemical components occurs within heterogeneous sediments this mixing process has important implications on nitrate removal because the waters of high supplies of doc and no3 can encounter in the mixing zones and thus the hotspots of denitrification can be created in heterogeneous aquatic sediments as discussed in section 3 2 the mixing can occur at the interfaces of fine coarse structures and at some localized strips in coarse structures that is located at the immediate downstream of fine structures fig 5 for the localized strips in coarse structures the doc supplied from upstream fine sediments mixes with the no3 that is mainly transferred via coarse structures the enhanced effects of the mixing at the interfaces of silt sand facies on nitrate removal have been revealed by sawyer 2015 whereas the effects of mixing at the localized strips in coarse structures have not been recognized in previous studies the present study indicates that except for the interfaces of silt sand facies the mixing processes within the coarse structures are also important for the enhanced removal of nitrate actually in sawyer 2015 the assumption of constant and much less microbial biomass in coarse than fine structures was adopted while kinetics of the microbial growth was accounted for and considered in this present work accordingly the assumption of low microbial biomass led to the low efficiency of nitrate removal within coarse structures despite the mixing process occur and thus the coarse structures were merely regarded as the channels for delivering the nutrients in previous studies e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2021 but as a matter of fact the microbial biomass at the mixing zones within coarse structures cannot always remain at a low concentration but would increase with the stimulations of high supplies of doc and no3 caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 ping et al 2020 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 with microbial growth the hotspots of nitrate removal can also form within coarse structures thus due to the assumptions of constant microbial biomass the classic heterogeneous or homogeneous advection dispersion reaction models for the nitrate transport in heterogeneous aquatic sediments e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 may significantly underestimate nitrate removal occurring within coarse structures and lead to the misinterpretations of the functions of coarse structures on the degradation of contaminants damköhler number of oxygen dao 2 represents the product of residence time and do consumption rate gu et al 2007 marzadri et al 2012 ocampo et al 2006 zarnetske et al 2012 and is commonly used to predict nitrate removal in aquatic sediments e g briggs et al 2015 flewelling et al 2012 hampton et al 2020 shuai et al 2017 for calculating dao 2 the flow field in the equivalent homogeneous sediments is typically used to evaluate residence time similarly the microbial biomass concentration of the functional group for facilitating aerobic respiration was often lumped as a constant and uniform parameter with vo for calculating do consumption rate however in real world systems sediment heterogeneity exists over different scales e g pore to facies to geologic formation wallace et al 2020 and can create local less mobile zones and hotspots of denitrification over various scales e g briggs et al 2015 2018 chowdhury et al 2020 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 xian et al 2022 biofilm growth can lead to spatiotemporally variable flow fields and microbial biomass distribution caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 newcomer et al 2018 ping et al 2018 2020 samsó et al 2016 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 and promote hotspots of denitrification forming in both organic scarce coarse and organic rich fine structures therefore dao 2 is scale and time dependent the dao 2 typically evaluated from the equivalent homogeneous conceptualization assuming constant and uniform microbial biomass may fail to capture the spatiotemporally variable localized hotspots of denitrification at a smaller scale and therefore may result in significant estimated errors however it is a challenge to incorporate the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of sediment permeability om and microbial biomass over a small scale into large scale models due to the limitations of measured data and computation resources sawyer 2015 in this study nitrification was not included in our models because the anoxic upwelling groundwater is assigned at the bottom boundary and do would be further consumed along the flow paths the nitrification rate is very low in the anoxic environment due to the oxygen demanding nitrifying bacteria furthermore the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater are not explicitly simulated while the outflow boundary is assigned to the outlet in fact the influence of the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater is negligible in the present study this is attributed to the followings in all simulations with various sand silt fraction ranging from 0 to 100 the average darcy velocity qav across the 2 d column is largest for silt fraction 0 and is smallest for silt fraction 100 in the cases with silt fraction 0 during the simulated period qav ranges from 0 159 m d to 0 168 m d for the case with biofilm growth and qav is constant for the cases with constant biofilm and equals to 0 168 m d in the cases with silt fraction 100 during the simulated period qav ranges from 0 0081 m d to 0 0085 m d for the case with biofilm growth and qav is constant for the cases with constant biofilm and equals to 0 0085 m d thus here we can determine the importance of do diffusion by calculating peclet number pe that is defined as qavl τdm s where l is the characteristic length dm s is the mass molecular diffusion coefficient of do in water dm s 1 10 9 m2 s and τ represents the tortuosity for the smallest value of qav i e 0 0081 m d l is roughly 2 5 mm to reach pe 1 this means that the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater can significantly influence the processing if nitrate only within the extent of 2 5 mm near the outlet this extent of this influence of diffusion would be smaller for the larger qav such influence can only affect the processing of nitrate slightly across the entire 2 d domain consequently the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater in the present study is not included in the model simulations 4 conclusions physical e g sediment permeability chemical e g om and microbial heterogeneities spatiotemporally coexist and interconnect in aquatic bed sediments under the dynamic interactions between hnb in this study we established a suite of numerical models to investigate how the interactions between hnb drive nitrate removal from upwelling groundwater through heterogeneous sediments the results showed that the aquatic sediments are more microbially active to mediate biogeochemical cycling where there are rigorous interactions between hnb compared to conditions where the functional microbial biomass is assumed constant over time specifically increasing microbial biomass with biofilm growth promotes oxygen consumption and increase denitrification rate and thus largely enhances the removal of nitrate from upwelling groundwater through heterogeneous sediments meanwhile the hotspots of nitrate removal can develop both in low om sand structures and high om silt structures in contrast by assuming constant microbial biomass the hotspots can only form in high om silt structures for heterogeneous sediments and cannot exist for the equivalent homogeneous sediments the biofilm enhanced nitrate removal in coarse structures make the nitrate removal rate occurring in coarse structures to be higher than those in fine structures for relatively sandy sediments these findings are significantly different from the classical understanding of heterogeneous sediments where coarse structures that have low nitrate removal efficiency and mainly function as the delivery channels of nutrients whereas only fine structures host the hotspots for denitrification significant underestimations of nitrate removal can be induced by ignoring biofilm growth overall this study is useful for understanding nitrate fate within aquatic sediments and benefits for coastal

2581,excessive anthropogenic nitrate loads around coasts and rivers threaten human and ecosystem health in this study we established new numerical models to investigate how dynamic interactions between hydraulics nutrients and biofilms hnb drive the removal process of nitrate from upwelling groundwater within heterogeneous sediments the results showed nitrate can be removed as much as 60 times more efficiently in heterogeneous sediments under interactions between hnb than in the typical heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous conceptualizations with assuming constant microbial biomass driven by the interactions between hnb aquatic sediments are more microbially active to mediate biogeochemical cycling specifically progressively increasing biomass with biofilm growth promotes oxygen consumption resulting in enhanced denitrification in heterogeneous sediments meanwhile not only can the hotspots of denitrification develop in low permeability silt structures with rich organic matter om but they can also form in high permeability and low om sand structures as well in contrast by assuming constant microbial biomass the hotspots can only form in silt structures for heterogeneous sediments and cannot exist for equivalent homogeneous sediments these findings are significantly different from the classical understanding of heterogeneous aquatic sediments in which coarse structures inhibit efficient nitrate removal and mainly function as delivery channels of nutrients whereas only fine structures host hotspots of denitrification significant underestimation of groundwater borne nitrate removal can be induced by assuming constant microbial biomass overall this study is useful for understanding nitrate fate within aquatic sediments and

et al 1998 and coastal ocean along continental shelves moore 1996 moore et al 2008 fig 1 concurrently significant amounts of nitrate migrate from groundwater to surface water threatening humans and ecosystem health grant et al 2018 gruber and galloway 2008 denitrification is a primary sink for permanently reducing nitrate no3 to gases i e n2 n2o and thus it regulates nitrate removal from aquatic

2008 triska et al 1989 as upwelling groundwater discharges to surface water denitrification occurs within bed interfaces which are generally the last porous media phase where nitrate can be removed permanently before transitioning into water columns above sediments hester et al 2019 thus the process of nitrate removal from upwelling groundwater within aquatic bed sediments is a subject of interest for research heterogeneous bed sediments often consist of high k where k denotes hydraulic conductivity coarse structures e g cobble gravel sand that are often organic scarce mcgarr et al 2021 and low k fine structures e g silt clay that are typically organic rich e g barnes et al 2019 knights et al 2017 krause et al 2013 the heterogeneity of sediment permeability and organic matter om that fuels microbial mediated aerobic respiration and denitrification significantly impact water flow paths and solute residence time cardenas et al 2004 sawyer and cardenas 2009 pryshlak et al 2015 and further influence the nitrate removal in aquatic sediments hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 specifically as water flows through heterogeneous sediments residence times tend to be relatively short in high k coarse structures western et al 2001 and are relatively long in low k fine structures gomez velez et al 2014 pryshlak et al 2015 in coarse structures the combinations of scarce om and short residence times do not facilitate the consumption of dissolved oxygen do via aerobic respiration and thus may promote the formation of oxic conditions wallace et al 2020 conversely in fine structures there is a relatively longer residence time and rich om where anoxic conditions can be created claret et al 1997 knights et al 2017 krause et al 2013 according to the theory of thermodynamics denitrification would be inhibited by oxygen whereas a high nitrate removal rate occurs within a low oxygen environment where organic carbon is ample duff and triska 1990 rivett et al 2008 thus based on these principles the following classical perspectives were proposed e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 in heterogeneous aquatic sediments coarse structures typically lead to low nitrate removal efficiency due to scarce om and short residence time and mainly function as the channels for delivery of nutrients whereas fine structures host hotspots of denitrification and promote nitrate removal due to rich om and long residence time the magnitude and efficiency of nitrate removal in heterogeneous aquatic sediments depend on the balance between the efficient delivery of nitrate through coarse structures and the nitrate removal occurring within fine structures wallace et al 2021 several studies have investigated the processing of nitrate in heterogeneous aquatic sediments for example sawyer 2015 examined the removal of nitrate as upwelling groundwater flows across heterogeneous sediments bardini et al 2013 pescimoro et al 2019 and wallace et al 2020 2021 analyzed nitrogen cycling within heterogeneous riparian aquifer under tidal influence and within hyporheic zones along streambeds similarly hester et al 2014 and hester et al 2019 investigated the mixing dependent denitrification in dune induced hyporheic zones from these studies e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 two common assumptions were adopted to investigate nitrate removal in heterogeneous aquatic sediments including 1 microbial biomass in aquatic sediments has no volume and is constant over time and uniformly distributed within coarse fine structures 2 sediment permeability is constant over time in fact these two assumptions often deviate from field conditions in aquatic sediments e g aubeneau et al 2016 battin and sengschmitt 1999 blaschke et al 2003 jin et al 2017 newcomer et al 2016 treese et al 2009 ulrich et al 2015 xian et al 2020 specifically when nutrients are available biofilm forms by assembling cells and extracellular polymeric substances and biomass as well as sediment permeability change over space and time due to the growth of biofilm e g battin and sengschmitt 1999 blaschke et al 2003 newcomer et al 2016 treese et al 2009 furthermore complex interactions between biofilm growth loss water flow and reactive transport of nutrients occur within bed interfaces caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 ping et al 2020 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 biofilms can occupy pore spaces and reduce the porosity of sediments and cause bioclogging effect that decrease permeability of porous media thullner et al 2002 thullner et al 2004 causing water flow and nutrients transport to change in turn biofilm growth depends on the nutrients supply and biofilm loss can be induced by endogenous decay and flow induced biofilm shearing ke et al 2021 rittmann 1982 speitel and digiano 1987 biofilm growth rate further varies as a response to changes in nutrient distributions concentrations caruso et al 2017 newcomer et al 2018 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 and flow induced shearing forces ke et al 2021 rittmann 1982 speitel and digiano 1987 thus physical e g sediment permeability chemical e g om and microbial heterogeneities spatiotemporally coexist and interconnect in

2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 often neglected the interactions between hydraulics nutrients and biofilms hnb and consequently the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in biomass and sediment permeability were ignored recently some studies have presented coupled models of biofilm growth reactive transport of nutrients and water flow to incorporate these interactions to analyze nutrients cycling in hyporheic zones e g caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 newcomer et al 2018 ping et al 2018 2020 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 or wetlands samsó et al 2016 however these studies focused on the nutrients cycling in homogeneous aquatic sediments thus the removal process of nitrate from upwelling groundwater under dynamic interactions between hnb in heterogeneous aquatic sediments has not been well elucidated the purpose of this study is to investigate how the interactions between hnb drive nitrate removal from upwelling groundwater through heterogeneous aquatic sediments a series of coupled numerical models were developed which couple water flow reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth in different heterogeneous sediments with varying sand silt fractions these numerical model simulations are used to analyze the spatial relationships between hotspots of denitrification high k and low om coarse structures and low k and high om fine structures we also compared the models for heterogeneous sediments as well as equivalent homogeneous sediments while ignoring the interactions between hnb to understand how nitrate removal varies in the absence of the interactions and or sediment heterogeneity 2 fluid flow biogeochemical and biofilm model 2 1 model description in this section we establish new two dimensional 2 d coupled numerical models of water flow reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth to describe nitrate dynamics in the process of upwelling groundwater discharge to surface water through heterogeneous sediments our model is based on previous reactive transport models e g sawyer 2015 which neglected the interactions between hnb and instead assigned uniform and constant microbial biomass

also adopted the considerations from the previous models e g caruso et al 2017 newcomer et al 2018 ping et al 2018 2020 xian et al 2019 that have incorporated the interactions in homogeneous sediments and neglected biofilm shearing overall our model couples flow reactive transport of nutrients biofilm growth endogenous decay and shearing and bioclogging processes occurring within heterogeneous beds the heterogeneous bed sediments consist of binary spatial distributions of sand and silt these were stochastically simulated using a markov chain method and indicator simulations with quenching within t progs carle 1999 in all 21 heterogeneous cases were created with silt fractions ranging from 0 to 100 by an interval of 5 fig 2 the mean length of 2 cm was adopted for the less abundant facies in the horizontal and vertical direction these heterogeneous cases are identical to those generated by sawyer 2015 and are representatives of universal centimeter or core scale features of aquatic

2 3 initial and boundary conditions and model simulation scenarios eqs 1 16 are solved by the finite element software comsol multiphysics a constant hydraulic head difference of 1 cm is maintained between the bottom inlet and the top outlet to keep an upwelling groundwater flow to surface water fig 1b the inlet is assigned by constant concentrations of cno 3 0 20 mg l cdo 0 2 mg l and cdoc 0 0 mg l that represents nitrate rich anoxic upwelling groundwater with negligible doc gu et al 2007 krause et al 2013 therefore the energy source for microbial respiration is solely from the poc within the sediments the do concentration of the upwelling groundwater at the bottom boundary is significantly dependent on the upstream microbial consumption along the flow paths for example as riparian zones mainly consist of coarse sediments like gravel cobble and coarse sand the do consumption is relatively low because of the organic scarce coarse sediments and the short residence times and thus it is possible to form the oxygenated groundwater in this situation e g song et al 2018 krause et al 2013 conversely anoxic groundwater can form in the riparian zones that are composed of organic rich fine sediments like silt and clay due to the high potential of aerobic respiration and long residence times in general it is more common to find anoxic rather than oxygenated groundwater in realistic field settings with the considerations of the more common anoxic groundwater here the anoxic upwelling groundwater is set as the bottom boundary meanwhile the outlet is given as an outflow boundary this outflow boundary results in that the do concentration of surface water as well as the diffusion of the do from surface water to groundwater are not explicitly simulated in the models in fact the do diffusion from surface water to groundwater can only influence the nitrate processing within the extent of several millimeters approaching the water sediment interface and therefore it is negligible for the removal of nitrate across the entire 2 d domain more discussions on the impact of the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater are provided in section 3 3 lateral boundaries are set as no flow and no flux boundary conditions the initial hydraulic head across the 2 d domain was assigned as the steady state distribution under the given hydraulic head difference between the inlet and outlet also the initial distributions of nutrients are given as the steady distribution under the assigned concentration boundaries sources sinks and the hydraulic conditions with no microbial consumption such initial distributions of nutrients represent the steady state concentration profiles before the functional microbial inoculation in the aquatic sediments for the sandy and silty facies the original i e without bioclogging hydraulic conductivities are 1 10 4 m s and 5 10 6 m s respectively domenico and schwartz 1990 freeze and cherry 1979 and the original particulate organic carbon poc content are 0 2 and 2 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 respectively the initial biomass concentrations of 1 10 4 kg m3 and 1 10 3 kg m3 are respectively adopted for sandy and silty facies sawyer 2015 representing an initial attachment stage of microbial biofilm growth the higher initial biomass concentration in silty than sandy facies is given because the silty facies have the higher specific surface area for microbial attachment and also have the higher organic carbon content to guarantee microbes survive in the initial attachment stage sawyer 2015 the biogeochemical and biofilms parameters of numerical models are calibrated from the 2 d sandbox experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 and are summarized in table 1 the model calibration is provided in section 3 1 the 2 d model domain was discretized by 35 000 80 000 triangle elements the transient numerical simulations were run for a period of 300 d during which an entire biofilm growth period including initial bacterial attachment biofilm growing stage and decay stage occur in previous studies the heterogeneous sediments were often represented by equivalent homogeneous or heterogeneous models assuming constant microbial biomass thus in this study two sets of heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous models that assume constant microbial biomass i e no biofilm growth are also established for each heterogeneous case these heterogeneous cases are stochastically generated above to investigate the controls of the interactions between hnb on nitrate removal for the heterogeneous model assuming constant microbial biomass the initial biomass concentration distributions are assigned with the initial values in the heterogeneous model with the interactions as for the equivalent homogeneous model assuming constant microbial biomass the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is calculated based on darcy s law using the initial groundwater flux in the heterogeneous model the initial poc content and the biomass concentration were derived from the arithmetically weighted averages according to the sand silt fraction in the heterogeneous model at the initial time sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 the other parameters are the same as those in the heterogeneous model with the interactions see table 1 for the summary of the model simulation scenarios 2 4 quantifying nitrate removal rate nitrate removal efficiency and groundwater discharge rate to quantifying the time averaged nitrate removal rate mar in the heterogeneous sediments during biofilm growth the

reliability of the 2 d numerical model simulations we simulate with the 2 d sandbox experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 and compare the simulated results and their experimental data we chose the experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 for comparisons because the similar experimental conditions of the upwelling porous flow and the nutrient supplies of doc do and no3 for microbial growth with those in our numerical models in the experiment of seifert and engesgaard 2012 the sandbox dimension 0 44 m 0 30 m 0 01 m was continuously supplied from the bottom with nutrients solutions 0 11 mm acetate 0 3 mm o2 1 ppm nano3 for biofilm growth the sandbox was filled with quartz sand having a grain size of 0 4 0 8 mm the sand box was divided into 3 layers in the vertical direction from the inlet 1 sterilized layer 0 14 m thick 2 inoculated layer 0 12 m thick 3 sterilized layer 0 18 m thick the temporal changes in hydraulic conductivity and porosity were observed by measuring variations in the hydraulic gradient across the whole sandbox the experiments were repeated three times for 20 25 days and the substrate in experiment 3 was removed after 20 days more details about the sandbox experiment can be found in seifert and engesgaard 2012 the parameters of reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth are calibrated by fitting the simulated results with the experimental data as shown in fig 3 some variations occur in the experimental results of experiment 1 2 3 the possible reasons include 1 the nutrients was nonuniformly supplied from the bottom to the sand box seifert and engesgaard 2012 2 the sand may be heterogeneously packed in the sand box overall the simulated results generally agree well with the average output of the experiment 1 2 3 the calibrated parameters of the numerical model are summarized in table 1 3 2 controls of interactions between hnb on removal of nitrate from upwelling groundwater in heterogeneous sediments fig 4 a presents the case where the interactions between hnb are considered and the cases where no interaction is included i e assuming constant microbial biomass it can be observed that the efficiency of nitrate removal generally rises as the silt content increases for siltier sediments the organic matter content is higher and the residence time is longer due to the lower permeability high organic matter content and long residence time facilitate do consumption promoting denitrification since the efficiency of nitrate removal increases but the groundwater discharge flux decreases with silt content fig 4a and 4c the nitrate removal rate increases with silt content and reaches a peak at mild or moderate silt content fig 4b these results are consistent with recent studies e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 of nitrate reduction in heterogeneous streambed sediments assuming constant microbial biomass in contrast to the cases assuming constant microbial biomass the time average groundwater discharge rate to surface water was only slightly reduced by the biofilm induced bioclogging effect due to biofilm growth fig 4c this is because biofilm growth is doc limited and flow shearing inhibited for relatively sandy sediments meanwhile it is no3 do limited for relatively silty sediments despite this as portrayed in fig 4a and 4b significant discrepancies were observed in the removal efficiency and removal rate of nitrate in the relatively sandy sediments as for silty sediments only a slight discrepancy was observed the greatest discrepancy occurs in the silt fractions of 0 15 specifically 60 times higher nitrate removal efficiency can be observed for the case with the interactions between hnb in contrast to the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous cases assuming constant microbial biomass meanwhile 58 times greater nitrate removal rate was induced by the interactions based on the reactive transport model of nitrate assuming constant microbial biomass sawyer 2015 examined the nitrate removal in heterogeneous sediments consisting of sand and silt structures as upwelling groundwater discharges to surface water sawyer 2015 showed that nitrate removal efficiency is 1 for silt fraction 25 and increases to roughly 100 for silt fraction 60 and the nitrate removal rate is greatest at moderate silt fractions in comparison the nitrate removal efficiency and removal rate are less than those in our cases which assume constant microbial concentration this is because sawyer 2015 imposed oxygenated upwelling groundwater do 8 mg l to the bottom boundary thus inhibiting denitrification meanwhile the anoxic groundwater do 2 mg l at the bottom boundary facilitating denitrification was used in the present study despite these differences the varying trends of nitrate removal efficiency and nitrate removal rate with silt fraction are generally consistent fig 4a and 4b moreover differing from the consistently low nitrate removal rate of sandy sediments i e silt fraction 25 in sawyer 2015 the present study found that relatively high nitrate removal rate can occur in sandy sediments despite relatively low poc content due to the biofilm growth fig 4a and 4b some laboratory studies have shown that relatively high denitrification rate can occur within organic scarce sandy sediments e g cook et al 2006 gihring et al 2010 for example by collecting apalachicola bay and gulf of mexico intact sediments of sands with carbon contents of 0 11 0 15 in usa gihring et al 2010 have shown that the efflux rate of n2 the products of denitrification can reach up to 0 87 mmol n m 2 d 1 cook et al 2006 also have detected the efflux rate of n2 ranging from 0 07 mmol n m 2h 1 to 0 13 mmol n m 2h 1 within the sandy sediments samples collected from helsingør denmark thus for organic scarce sandy sediments the previous models e g sawyer 2015 which assume constant biomass concentration may significantly underestimate the nitrate removal of heterogeneous aquatic sediment under upwelling groundwater flow conditions for the relatively sandy sediments the progressively increasing biomass with biofilm growth largely enhances the microbial bioactivity of aquatic sediments increases the do consumption rate and denitrification rate and thus promoting the removal of no3 from groundwater fig 5 driven by the stimulation of nutrients biofilm growth mainly occurs in both the silt structures and the immediate downstream strips in the sand structures resulting in the development of local low permeability bioactive microsites at the bioactive microsites in the sand structures doc can be supplied from the poc dissolution from the upstream silt structures and mixes with the no3 that was mainly transferred via sand structures this mixing of nutrients stimulates the biofilm growth and promote the development of the hotspots of denitrification in the mixing zones consequently the hotspots of denitrification cannot only form within the silt structures but also develop within sand structures in contrast as shown in fig 5 by assuming constant microbial biomass the hotspots of nitrate removal can only develop in silt structures for the heterogeneous sediments also they do not exist for the equivalent homogeneous sediments due to the assumption that microbial biomass is unchanged and microbial biomass concentration is much less in sand than silt structures sawyer 2015 also showed the hotspots of denitrification also only form within the low k and high om silt structures in fact several field studies can provide direct evidences for the new findings of the coexistence of hotspots of denitrification within high k low om coarse structures and low k high om fine structures for example hill et al 2000 investigated the denitrification in the riparian zone along two transects of the boyne river in southern ontario canada the groundwater transports 20 60 mg l 1 no3 to the boyne river through heterogeneous sediments consisting of the coarse structures of sand gravel and the fine structures of peat organic loams and muds hill et al 2000 observed doc no3 do n2o distributions for the two transects their observed results e g fig 7 in hill et al 2000 showed the hotspots of denitrification can occur in both the sand structures and peat structures or peat sand interfaces moreover by collecting pore water and sediments samples over shore perpendicular cross sections of a sandy beach where fresh groundwater discharges to the sea in cape shores lewes delaware usa kim et al 2017 2019 have examined the spatial distributions of aerobic respiration rate denitrification rate and poc in the sandy beach aquifers the observed data e g fig 3 in kim et al 2017 and fig 5 in kim et al 2019 indicated that the high denitrification rate did not always co occur with the organic rich zones but can also occur within in the organic scarce zones of sand structures based on previous assumptions about constant and uniform microbial biomass presents in coarse fine structures of heterogeneous aquatic sediments e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 the sand structures were often regarded as the channels that deliver nutrients thus inhibiting efficient nitrate removal due to short residence time scarce om whereas the hotspots of nitrate removal can only form in fine structures due to long residence time and high om e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 thus conceptually the nitrate removal occurring in sand structures was often regarded much less than in silt structures pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 however our study shows that the microbial biomass varies over space and time due to the spatiotemporal variations of flow field and nutrient distributions in heterogeneous sediments as a response not only can the hotspots of denitrification form in low k and high om silt structures but they can develop in high k and low om sand structures as well fig 5 fig 4d highlights the biofilm enhanced nitrate removal in sand structures making the nitrate removal rate occurring within sand structures to be higher than silt fraction 30 those occurring within silt structures in comparisons despite the heterogeneity of sediment permeability and om content have been incorporated the ratio of nitrate removal occurring in sand structures to that in silt structures can be significantly underestimated due to the neglect of the interactions between hnb 3 3 implications of interactions between hnb on nitrate removal in bed interfaces as surface water and or groundwater flow across bed sediments the removal of nitrate is fundamentally determined by the solute residences time and the microbial consumption rate based on this theory the rapid removal of nitrate requires anoxic environment high doc concentration high microbial activity and relatively long residence time pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2021 by establishing new coupled models of water flow reactive transport of nutrients and biofilm growth the present study shows that the microbial bioactivity within aquatic sediments increases with microbial growth enhanced microbial activity can increase the consumption of do and create the larger anoxic zones facilitating denitrification and thus leading to more efficient nitrate removal thus previous reactive transport models e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 that often assumed constant microbial biomass concentration may underpredict the nitrate removal efficiency in aquatic sediments such as hyporheic zones riparian zones or wetlands in heterogeneous aquatic sediments the water flow across fine structures typically is low do no3 but high doc due to their low permeability and high om content claret et al 1997 knights et al 2017 krause et al 2013 in contrast the coarse structures can transport high no3 do but low doc because of their high permeability and low om content wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 as a result the important mixing of waters with distinct chemical components occurs within heterogeneous sediments this mixing process has important implications on nitrate removal because the waters of high supplies of doc and no3 can encounter in the mixing zones and thus the hotspots of denitrification can be created in heterogeneous aquatic sediments as discussed in section 3 2 the mixing can occur at the interfaces of fine coarse structures and at some localized strips in coarse structures that is located at the immediate downstream of fine structures fig 5 for the localized strips in coarse structures the doc supplied from upstream fine sediments mixes with the no3 that is mainly transferred via coarse structures the enhanced effects of the mixing at the interfaces of silt sand facies on nitrate removal have been revealed by sawyer 2015 whereas the effects of mixing at the localized strips in coarse structures have not been recognized in previous studies the present study indicates that except for the interfaces of silt sand facies the mixing processes within the coarse structures are also important for the enhanced removal of nitrate actually in sawyer 2015 the assumption of constant and much less microbial biomass in coarse than fine structures was adopted while kinetics of the microbial growth was accounted for and considered in this present work accordingly the assumption of low microbial biomass led to the low efficiency of nitrate removal within coarse structures despite the mixing process occur and thus the coarse structures were merely regarded as the channels for delivering the nutrients in previous studies e g pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2021 but as a matter of fact the microbial biomass at the mixing zones within coarse structures cannot always remain at a low concentration but would increase with the stimulations of high supplies of doc and no3 caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 ping et al 2020 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 with microbial growth the hotspots of nitrate removal can also form within coarse structures thus due to the assumptions of constant microbial biomass the classic heterogeneous or homogeneous advection dispersion reaction models for the nitrate transport in heterogeneous aquatic sediments e g bardini et al 2013 hester et al 2014 hester et al 2019 pescimoro et al 2019 sawyer 2015 wallace et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 may significantly underestimate nitrate removal occurring within coarse structures and lead to the misinterpretations of the functions of coarse structures on the degradation of contaminants damköhler number of oxygen dao 2 represents the product of residence time and do consumption rate gu et al 2007 marzadri et al 2012 ocampo et al 2006 zarnetske et al 2012 and is commonly used to predict nitrate removal in aquatic sediments e g briggs et al 2015 flewelling et al 2012 hampton et al 2020

distribution caruso et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2020 newcomer et al 2018 ping et al 2018 2020 samsó et al 2016 xian et al 2019 xian et al 2022 and promote hotspots of denitrification forming in both organic scarce coarse and organic rich fine structures therefore dao 2 is scale and time dependent the dao 2 typically evaluated from the equivalent homogeneous conceptualization assuming constant and uniform microbial biomass may fail to capture the spatiotemporally variable localized hotspots of denitrification at a smaller scale and therefore may result in significant estimated errors however it is a challenge to incorporate the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of sediment permeability om and microbial biomass over a small scale into large scale models due to the limitations of measured data and computation resources sawyer 2015 in this study nitrification was not included in our models because the anoxic upwelling groundwater is assigned at the bottom boundary and do would be further consumed along the flow paths the nitrification rate is very low in the anoxic environment due to the oxygen demanding nitrifying bacteria furthermore the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater are not explicitly simulated while the outflow boundary is assigned to the outlet in fact the influence of the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater is negligible in the present study this is attributed to the followings in all simulations with various sand silt fraction ranging from 0 to 100 the average darcy velocity qav across the 2 d column is largest for silt fraction 0 and is smallest for silt fraction 100 in the cases with silt fraction 0 during the simulated period qav ranges from 0 159 m d to 0 168 m d for the case with biofilm growth and qav is constant for the cases with constant biofilm and equals to 0 168 m d in the cases with silt fraction 100 during the simulated period qav ranges from 0 0081 m d to 0 0085 m d for the case with biofilm growth and qav is constant for the cases with constant biofilm and equals to 0 0085 m d thus here we can determine the importance of do diffusion by calculating peclet number pe that is defined as qavl τdm s where l is the characteristic length dm s is the mass molecular diffusion coefficient of do in water dm s 1 10 9 m2 s and τ represents the tortuosity for the smallest value of qav i e 0 0081 m d l is roughly 2 5 mm to reach pe 1 this means that the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater can significantly influence the processing if nitrate only within the extent of 2 5 mm near the outlet this extent of this influence of diffusion would be smaller for the larger qav such influence can only affect the processing of nitrate slightly across the entire 2 d domain consequently the diffusion of do from surface water to groundwater in the present study is not included in the model simulations 4 conclusions physical e g sediment permeability chemical e g om and microbial heterogeneities spatiotemporally coexist and interconnect in aquatic bed sediments under the dynamic interactions between hnb in this study we established a suite of numerical models to investigate how the interactions between hnb drive nitrate removal from upwelling groundwater through heterogeneous sediments the results showed that the aquatic sediments are more microbially active to mediate biogeochemical cycling where there are rigorous interactions between hnb compared to conditions where the functional microbial biomass is assumed constant over time specifically increasing microbial biomass with biofilm growth promotes oxygen consumption and increase denitrification rate and thus largely enhances the removal of nitrate from upwelling groundwater through heterogeneous sediments meanwhile the hotspots of nitrate removal can develop both in low om sand structures and high om silt structures in contrast by assuming constant microbial biomass the hotspots can only form in high om silt structures for heterogeneous sediments and cannot exist for the equivalent homogeneous sediments the biofilm enhanced nitrate removal in coarse structures make the nitrate removal rate occurring in coarse structures to be higher than those in fine structures for relatively sandy sediments these findings are significantly different from the classical understanding of heterogeneous sediments where coarse structures that have low nitrate removal efficiency and mainly function as the delivery channels of nutrients whereas only fine structures host the hotspots for denitrification significant underestimations of nitrate removal can be induced by ignoring biofilm growth overall this study is useful for understanding nitrate fate within aquatic sediments and benefits for coastal and riverine restorations and watershed nitrogen management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

2582,understanding the geneses of geothermal systems is critical for their efficient and sustainable exploitation chlorine is one of the most conservative elements in geothermal waters and capable of providing valuable information related to the formation and evolution of geothermal systems thereby being a promising indicator for identifying geothermal system geneses in this study representative hydrothermal systems located in various tectonic regions in china including daggyai semi and gudui in plate margin as well as xinzhou and xiong an in inland basins were selected for investigating the chloride sources of the geothermal waters and possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation occurring in the relevant geochemical processes the chloride of geothermal waters in tibet originated predominantly from magmatic fluids input whereas water rock interaction was the primary chloride source for the xinzhou geothermal waters as for the chloride in xiong an it was primary derived from the dissolution of halite in carbonate rocks in addition the major processes resulting in the chlorine isotope fractionation were supposed to be magma degassing in the tibetan geothermal systems and ion filtration in the xiong an geothermal system based on the discovered chloride sources and possible processes inducing non negligible chlorine isotope fractionation the geneses of various geothermal systems investigated in this study were proposed this study suggests that stable chlorine isotopes coupled with other geochemical parameters have the potential for discriminating geothermal systems with different geneses keywords chlorine geochemistry stable isotopes fractionation geothermal waters china data availability i have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction geothermal water is a valuable geological resource with diversified applications high temperature geothermal water has been frequently used for power generation while low to medium temperature geothermal water was predominantly used for house heating bathing aquaculture and medical treatment investigating the geothermal system geneses is a critical step in policy making capable of improving geothermal water management and utilization the hydrochemistry of geothermal waters from various geothermal systems is usually quite different and thus can be employed for the identification of geothermal system geneses the geochemical compositions of geothermal waters formed merely via deep circulation of infiltrating waters are primarily controlled by their interactions with reservoir rocks tian et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 for magmatic hydrothermal systems on one hand presence of a relatively shallow magma chamber beneath such geothermal systems greatly increases reservoir temperatures and promotes dissolution of reservoir rocks on the other hand input of magmatic fluids released from underlying magmas is a non negligible or even more important factor affecting geothermal water geochemistry giggenbach 1995 guo and wang 2012 as for geothermal systems formed in the deep subsurface of large scale sedimentary basins they also tend to exhibit distinctly different hydrogeochemistry due to influence of pale sedimentary environments or recharge of connate waters das et al 2022 as a result hydrogeochemical studies of geothermal waters have been commonly applied to tracing the origins of geothermal fluids and to identifying the geological geneses of geothermal systems nonetheless the majority of hydrochemical constituents are chemically reactive and easily affected by shallow subsurface processes increasing the difficulties in discriminating the geneses of different geothermal systems in contrast to other hydrochemical constituents chlorine is unique because 1 chlorine concentrations in geothermal waters vary greatly ranging from 10 mg l to 50 g l li et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 2 chlorine is conservative in natural waters including geothermal waters and barely precipitates during formation of altered minerals arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 and 3 more importantly chlorine is highly hydrophilic and can be easily captured and preserved by the overlying geothermal reservoirs during magma degassing and therefore is helpful in identifying the magmatic heat source of geothermal systems li et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 however chloride concentration alone cannot be used to distinguish the chloride sources of geothermal waters in view that elevated chloride concentrations may be caused by various processes e g host rock leaching seawater mixing or magma degassing stable chlorine isotope compositions on the other hand could indicate different chlorine sources fig 1 for instance geothermal waters with a dominant source of cl from seawater usually have a homogeneous δ37cl value around 0 bonifacie et al 2005 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2014 the δ37cl values of geothermal waters in which cl originated from sedimentary rock leaching range from 2 51 to 0 01 generally negative zhang et al 2007 while those of geothermal waters with magmatic rock leaching as the primary cl source range from 0 3 to 1 3 generally positive cullen et al 2015 cullen et al 2021 stefánsson and barnes 2016 a few measurements on low temperature sediment pore waters from the juan de fuca ridge s eastern flank which are thought to be representative of connate waters show negative δ37cl values varying from 2 80 to 0 12 bonifacie et al 2007 geothermal waters affected by magmatic fluid input have a relatively wide δ37cl range varying from 1 0 to 2 1 bernal et al 2014 cullen et al 2015 li et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 stefánsson and barnes 2016 the geothermal fluids containing cl derived from the mantle seawater and halite dissolution have δ37cl values varying from 3 6 to 0 81 pinti et al 2020 to summarize the chlorine isotopic geochemistry of geothermal waters with different geneses varies greatly making it a suitable indicator for identifying geothermal system geneses in china magmatic geothermal systems are primarily distributed in the yunnan sichuan tibet geothermal province and the taiwan geothermal province such as rehai in yunnan bai et al 1994 shangguan et al 2000 yangbajain and yangyi in tibet guo et al 2007 guo et al 2009 yokoyama et al 1999 zhao et al 2002 and tatun in taiwan dobson et al 2018 liu et al 2011 they are all situated in the plate margins where geological conditions are favorable for formation of magmatic geothermal systems however there are undoubtedly many unproven magmatic and non magmatic geothermal systems in the above geothermal belts in contrast the geothermal systems located in chinese inland basins far from the plate margins are mostly low to medium temperature and do not have a magmatic heat source nevertheless there are also a few cases of high temperature geothermal systems under such geological conditions such as the gonghe basin in qinghai province and the datong basin in shanxi province pan et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 and the geneses of these geothermal systems remain unknown in summary the geologic geneses of a large number of geothermal systems in both plate margins and inland basins are far from being fully understood and more relevant research is required in this study we present the hydrochemical and chlorine isotope compositions of geothermal waters in three geothermal systems daggyai semi and gudui located in the plate margin tibetan plateau and two geothermal systems xinzhou and xiong an located in the inland basins the xinding basin and the bohai bay basin these data were used to assess the chloride sources of the investigated geothermal waters and the possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation involved in the related geochemical processes as well as to further investigate the use of chlorine geochemistry as a tool for identifying the geothermal systems geneses 2 geologic setting it is commonly accepted that the tibetan plateau was generated by the india asia plate collision since the early cenozoic chung et al 2005 tapponnier et al 2001 due to the subsequent subduction of the indian plate a series of east west trending sutures such as the indus tsangpo suture its bangong nu suture bns and jiangshajiang suture js have formed within the tibetan plateau fig 2 a hydrothermal activities can be found throughout the plateau but they are most concentrated in the southern tibetan plateau between the its and bns where intensive surface geothermal manifestations such as geysers boiling springs hot springs steaming ground and hydrothermal alteration are ubiquitously observed tong et al 1981 the hydrothermal activities on the nothern tibetan plateau are relatively weak with low to medium temperature springs predominating but the large scale distribution of sinter suggests that hydrothermal activities were much stronger in the past liao and zhao 1999 these hydrothermal activities on the tibetan plateau are the product of the collision between the indian plate and the eurasian plate and the geothermal fluids contain a wealth of deep information about the compositions of the upper and middle crusts and even the mantle the basement rocks of the southern tibetan plateau are mainly composed of the precambrian metamorphic rocks which are only found in amdo and to the west of the nam lake hu et al 2005 the cover sequences consist of paleozoic to mesozoic sedimentary rocks and mesozoic to cenozoic magmatic rocks zhu et al 2013 previous geophysical and geochemical investigations have revealed the presence of magma chambers in the depths of numerous geothermal systems in southern tibet brown et al 1996 guo et al 2019 hoke et al 2000 klemperer et al 2013 yokoyama et al 1999 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2002 the majority of which were derived from the mantle wedge guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 nonetheless the upward transport of the mantle wedge would inevitably mix with a large amount of crustal materials or induce local remelting of crustal rocks because of the thickened continental crust 70 80 km yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 in this study three hydrothermal systems in tibet daggyai semi and gudui were chosen as representatives of plate margin geothermal systems all of which are located near the indus tsangpo suture although no geophysical survey has been conducted in daggyai and semi the strong surface hydrothermal activity there suggests that magma chambers may exist beneath these geothermal systems detailed geological settings of daggyai semi and gudui are presented in the supplementary data the xinzhou geothermal area is geographically located south of the xinding basin in shanxi province north china the xinding basin is a cenozoic rift basin whose tectonic framework was primarily formed during the late yanshanian epoch zhang et al 2008 it is bounded on the east by the wutai mountain on the south by the jizhou mountain on the west by the yunzhong mountain and on the north by the heng mountain fig 2 b the basement rocks of the xinding basin including the surrounding mountains are primarily archean metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the heng mountain the wutai mountain and the south of the yunzhong mountain the overlying strata consist of cambrian ordovician limestone carboniferous triassic sandy shale tertiary sandstone and basalt and quaternary sediments han 2007 quaternary sediments with thickness ranging from 80 m to 200 m are outcropped throughout the basin the recharge sources of geothermal waters are the meteoric waters infiltrating into the surrounding mountains where limestone and metamorphic rocks mainly outcrop fracture structures were developed along the basin margin and also within the basin dividing the basin into fanzhi graben daixian graben yuanping graben qicun graben and xingding graben from north to south these fracture structures which act as channels for the convective circulation of geothermal fluids play an important role in the formation of the geothermal system han et al 2010 the main reservoir is hosted by weathered metamorphic rocks granitic gneiss belonging to the archean wutai group the xiong an geothermal area is located in the north of the jizhong graben of the bohai bay basin north china it is situated at the junction of the rongcheng and niutuozhen uplifts with the xushui graben to the west the baxian graben to the east and the baoding graben the gaoyang low uplift and the raoyang graben to the south fig 2c the major structures in xiong an are niunan fault niudong fault daxing fault and rongcheng fault which serve as the conduits for the upward transport of deep geothermal fluids the following units were found in increasing depth quaternary sediments neogene continental clastic rocks lower paleozoic to upper middle proterozoic marine carbonate rocks and archean metamorphic rocks zhu et al 2021 the quaternary sediments outcropping in the whole area serve as the cap rocks by providing good thermal insulation the xiong an geothermal system includes two major reservoirs the shallow reservoir is made up of neogene sandstone and the deep reservoir is made up of proterozoic limestone and dolostone all of the geothermal water samples in this study are from the deep reservoir the xiong an geothermal area is far from the plate margin geothermal belts and no continental rift is developed nearby so the likelihood of a shallow magmatic heat source beneath xiong an is negligible the geological and geothermal settings of daggyai semi gudui xinzhou and xiong an are summarized in table1 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sampling and measurements fifty one geothermal water samples were collected in this study including twenty hot spring samples from tibet thirteen from daggyai four from semi and three from gudui in august 2018 ten geothermal well samples from xinzhou in november 2019 and twenty one geothermal well samples from xiong an in december 2018 in addition eight rock core samples one granitic gneiss sample from xinzhou and seven dolomite samples from xiong an from five geothermal wells were also collected fig 2 shows the sampling locations of all the samples unstable parameters e g t ph and ec were tested in situ using a portable water quality analyzer for cations analysis concentrated hno3 was added to lower the ph below 1 while no chemicals were added for anions δd δ18o and δ37cl analysis 3 2 lab analysis and data processing 3 2 1 measurements of hydrochemical components as well as oxygen hydrogen and chlorine isotopes the concentrations of na k ca mg si b sr li and as in geothermal waters were determined by icp oes and icp ms within 2 weeks after sampling with uncertainties of 5 the so4 2 f cl and br were measured by ic with uncertainties of 2 the co2 equilibration method was employed for the determination of 18o 16o ratio of the geothermal waters while the zn reduction method was used to generate h2 for the d h ratio measurement coleman et al 1982 co2 and h2 isotope ratios were determined with a finnigan mat 251 mass spectrometer the δ18o and δd values were reported in reference to the value of the v smow the uncertainties are 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δd notably in high temperature geothermal systems a boiling process usually occurs near the surface because this process is able to cause significant changes in the deuterium and oxygen 18 compositions of subsurface fluids their δd and δ18o values need to be corrected the correction method was described in detail by guo et al 2014 and truesdell et al 1977 in this study the δd and δ18o values of seven hot springs in tibet dg05 dg08 dg11 dg13 sm01 sm02 and sm04 with sampling temperatures close to 85 c corresponding to the boiling point of the elevation at about 4500 m were corrected the chlorine isotope compositions of seventeen geothermal water samples were determined by p tims at the qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences this method has been widely applied to a variety of geological samples including seafloor rocks magenheim et al 1995 salt minerals liu et al 1997 luo et al 2014 seawaters shirodkar et al 2006 and pore fluids wei et al 2008 the geothermal waters were sequentially passed through an h ion and a cs ion exchange resin column to generate cscl solution for the mass spectrometric measurement the cscl solution containing about 10 μg chlorine was loaded onto a tantalum filament that had previously been covered with 2 5 μl of graphite slurry and degassed by being heated at a current of 2 5 a for 1 h the filament was then heated for 1 5 min at a current of 1a before being loaded onto the mass spectrometer the laboratory standard was the isl 354 nacl and the absolute 37cl 35cl ratio was 0 319549 0 000044 wei et al 2012 the external reproducibility of the analysis is 0 13 and the δ37cl value gives the deviation of the 37cl 35cl ratio of the sample relative to that of the standard mean ocean chlorine smoc the δ37cl values of the geothermal water samples were expressed as follows δ 37 cl sample 37 cl 35 cl sample 37 cl 35 cl smoc 1 1000 the in situ parameters and chemical and isotopic compositions of geothermal waters are presented in table 2 and table s1 3 2 2 measurements of cl br b and li contents of rocks eight rock core samples were analyzed for cl br b and li contents the nh4hf2 digestion method was used to extract cl and br from rock samples he et al 2019 at high temperatures nh4hf2 is capable of rapidly destroying the silicate mineral structure and its thermal decomposition also releases ammonia which reacts with halogens to form stable ammonium species preventing volatile halogen losses during digestion process a total of 100 mg of rock sample and 400 mg of nh4hf2 was weighed into a teflon vial savillex eden prairie mn and heated at 220 c for 2 h after cooling the digestion cake was diluted to 25 g with a 5 v v nh4oh solution and the supernatant solution was directly measured using an inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometer icpsfms the detection limits for cl and br are 5 μg g and 0 015 μg g respectively a series of reference geological materials were also analyzed to confirm the method s reliability and the measured cl and br values are consistent with the values previously reported in the literatures kendrick et al 2018 michel and villemant 2003 sekimoto and ebihara 2017 as for the determination of b and li concentrations in the rock samples each sample was completely digested with a mixed acid hno3 hclo4 hf and was measured by icp ms the measured cl br b and li contents of rocks are shown in table 3 4 results 4 1 chemistry of geothermal waters according to the sampling location and ph values all the waters were divided into four groups acid geothermal waters in tibet neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in tibet neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in xinzhou and neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in xiong an these four types of geothermal waters have distinct hydrogeochemical properties three acid hot spring samples from tibet two from daggyai and one from semi have a ph range of 3 0 to 4 5 and are of ca na so4 type fig 3 they have low electrical conductivity ec values and chloride concentrations fig 4 a these acid waters are formed by geothermal steams heating shallow cold groundwaters guo et al 2014 and thus contain much less chloride compared to deeply circulated neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in contrast to two acid daggyai hot springs the acid water sample from semi sm03 with higher ec value and chloride concentration could be mixed with neutral cl rich waters as for the neutral to alkaline samples in tibet the ph and ec values range from 6 0 to 8 6 and 1502 to 4184 μs cm respectively and the hydrochemical types are na hco3 cl and nacl fig 3 they represent the major discharge of reservoir fluids and consequently have higher ec values and chloride concentrations fig 4a the geothermal water samples from inland basins xinzhou and xiong an are all neutral or weakly alkaline the xinzhou water samples have ph and ec values ranging from 7 6 to 9 2 and 965 to 3270 μs cm respectively their major ions are na ca2 so4 2 and cl and the hydrochemical types are na ca so4 cl and na cl so4 fig 3 in general their chloride concentrations are lower than those of the non acid tibetan waters fig 4a the xiong an geothermal waters have ph and ec values varying from 6 8 to 8 5 and 4442 to 5457 μs cm respectively and belong to na cl and na cl hco3 types fig 3 their chloride concentrations are significantly higher compared to those from tibet and xinzhou fig 4 4 2 o h and cl stable isotopes the δd and δ18o values vary from 155 69 to 139 09 and from 16 30 to 11 93 for the acid tibetan waters from 163 08 to 137 99 and from 21 43 to 11 93 for the neutral to alkaline tibetan waters from 87 32 to 66 63 and from 12 04 to 8 55 for the xinzhou waters and from 74 48 to 70 35 and from 9 07 to 8 05 for the xiong an waters most water samples exhibit different degrees of oxygen isotope shifts fig 5 which is mainly due to the water rock interaction between geothermal waters and their host rocks notably the oxygen isotope shifts of the tibetan geothermal waters are significantly larger with some samples exceeding 3 possibly due to input of magmatic fluids in contrast the acid spring samples from tibet though featuring large oxygen isotope shifts as well have elevated δ18o values because primarily of the strong evaporation occurring in the spring vents small flow rates and large areas of the vents the δ37cl values of the water samples in tibet xinzhou and xiong an range from 0 02 to 0 46 0 03 to 0 3 and 0 02 to 0 73 respectively most of the samples have positive δ37cl values with the exception of xa11 0 02 and xa12 0 03 in xiong an the difference in δ37cl values among the geothermal waters from these three regions is not significant fig 4b in general there is no a statistically apparent relationship between δ37cl values and cl concentrations but several samples with high cl concentrations have unusually high δ37cl values for examples of the tibetan samples one with the highest chloride concentration sm04 has a quite high δ37cl value of 0 46 and the sample xa08 from xiong an with a chloride content of 1136 5 mg l has a δ37cl value up to 0 73 4 3 geochemistry of rocks the cl and br concentrations of the archean granitic gneiss sample collected in xinzhou 281 ppm and 1 48 ppm respectively are higher than those of the proterozoic dolomite samples collected in xiong an 84 8 168 0 ppm and 0 07 0 68 ppm respectively in contrast the li and b concentrations of the archean granitic gneiss in xinzhou are 0 51 ppm and 1 02 ppm respectively generally lower than those of the proterozoic dolomite rocks in xiong an ranging from 0 26 ppm to 18 73 ppm and 1 93 ppm to 121 01 ppm respectively the cl br molar ratio of the xinzhou granite gneiss sample 427 3 is lower than that of the xiong an dolostone 420 4 3504 7 whereas the cl b and cl li molar ratios 83 8 and 107 1 respectively are significantly higher than that of the xiong an dolostone 0 3 20 2 and 1 5 82 9 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 sources of chloride in geothermal waters 5 1 1 water rock interactions it is acknowledged that interaction between geothermal water and surrounding rock is one of the most predominant origins of dissolved chemical constituents in geothermal waters for either magmatic or non magmatic geothermal systems as a typical soluble and conservative element chlorine can be easily leached out from the reservoir rocks upon their reactions with geothermal waters fig 6 shows the correlations between b or li and cl all of which are regarded to be conservative in waters the cl b and cl li molar ratios of the xinzhou waters 81 3 186 2 and 93 4 496 3 respectively are close to those of the xinzhou granitic gneiss 83 8 and 107 1 respectively indicating that the cl in the xinzhou geothermal waters should originate from the water rock interactions in contrast the cl b and cl li molar ratios of the waters in tibet and xiong an are significantly higher than those of the corresponding reservoir rocks revealing that the chloride should have other sources besides the water rock interactions to further evaluate the contribution of water rock interactions to the chloride in the investigated geothermal waters an isotope mass balance model proposed by yamaoka et al 2015 was used to simulate the interactions between infiltrating meteoric water and different reservoir rocks in this model the cl contents and δ37cl values of the waters and rocks before and after the water rock interactions can be correlated by the following mass balance equation cl rock i rcl water i cl rock f rcl water f cl rock i 37 35 cl rock i rcl water i 37 35 cl water i cl rock i rcl water i cl rock f 37 35 cl rock f rcl rock f 37 35 cl rock f cl rock f rcl water f where cl rock i and cl water i are the cl concentrations of rock and water before interaction respectively r is the water rock mass ratio cl rock f and cl water f are the cl concentrations of rock and water after interaction respectively 37 35 cl rock i and 37 35 cl water i are the 37cl 35cl ratios of rock and water before interaction respectively and 37 35 cl rock f and 37 35 cl water f are the 37cl 35cl ratios of rock and water after interaction respectively the distribution coefficient of chlorine d cl is αdefined by d cl c l rock f c l water f and the isotopic fractionation factor of chlorine by α 37 35 cl rock f 37 35 cl water f based on the above two equations the cl concentration and δ37cl value of geothermal water after water rock interaction can be expressed as cl water f cl rock i r cl water i d cl r δ 37 c l water f c l rock i 1000 δ 37 c l rock i r c l water i 1000 δ 37 c l water i c l rock i r c l water i d cl r α d cl r in this study the initial meteoric waters in the three study regions were assumed to have a cl content of 3 ppm and a δ37cl value of 0 cullen et al 2015 given that the reservoirs in daggyai semi and gudui in tibet are primarily hosted by magmatic rocks table 1 the average cl concentration 359 4 ppm and δ37cl value 0 19 of the magmatic rocks reported by cullen et al 2015 cullen et al 2021 rizzo et al 2013 shinonaga et al 1994 and michel and villemant 2003 were used for the tibetan reservoir rock endmember as for the xinzhou reservoir rock endmember the cl concentration of the granitic gneiss sample 281 ppm analyzed in this study and the average δ37cl value of altered magmatic rocks from seven dsdp odp iodp drill sites 0 28 barnes and cisneros 2012 were used for the xiong an reservoir rock endmember the average cl concentration of the carbonate rock samples collected and analyzed in this study 123 3 ppm and the average δ37cl value of the carbonate rocks reported by arcuri and brimhall 2003 and selverstone and sharp 2015 0 48 were used due to a lack of systematic chlorine isotope fractionation experiments at high temperatures the available chlorine isotope fractionation factors between rocks and geothermal fluids are scarce at 700 c and 0 2 gpa cisneros 2013 determined the cl isotope fractionation factor between amphibole and a cl containing solution and the result showed a slightly positive fractionation 103lnαamphibole fluid 0 1 0 2 schauble et al 2003 determined the equilibrium cl isotope fractionations between silicates and coexisting brine and suggested that silicates had 2 3 higher δ37cl values at room temperature according to the reservoir temperatures in the study areas about 100 c in xinzhou and xiong an and 200 c in tibet the chlorine isotope fractionation coefficient α was set to be 1 001 for the water rock interactions in xinzhou and xiong an and 1 0005 for those in tibet the distribution coefficient of chlorine d cl has not been well constrained either but in general cl tends to be enriched in fluid and we accordingly assumed d cl 0 05 with reference to cullen et al 2015 with these parameters the theoretical geothermal water compositions corresponding to varying water rock ratios were calculated and shown in fig 7 the xinzhou samples are basically located near to the xinzhou water rock interaction curve again indicating that the cl in the xinzhou waters was primarily from the leaching of granitic gneiss in contrast all samples from semi and gudui in tibet and xiong an deviate far from their respective modelling curves and the cl contents of the deviated samples are significantly higher than the modeling results it is worth noting that the spring samples collected from daggyai in tibet appear to be close to the modeling curves the main reason is that the daggyai samples contained a high proportion of shallow cold waters as evidenced by their high ca2 and hco3 contents table s1 namely the cl concentrations in deep geothermal fluids in daggyai are significantly higher than in spring samples overall the deep geothermal fluids in all of the geothermal systems in tibet daggyai semi and gudui and xiong an have higher cl contents than the water rock interaction simulation results therefore in addition to the water rock interactions there must be other sources of cl in the xiong an and tibetan geothermal waters e g dissolution of evaporates or input of magmatic fluids 5 1 2 dissolution of evaporates according to the above analysis water rock interaction alone cannot account for the high cl contents in xiong an and tibet previous studies have revealed that the high concentrations of cl in inland basin groundwaters like xiong an generally originate from dissolution of evaporates with halite being the most typical cl bearing mineral recognized or recharge of connate waters such as the palo duro basin the gulf coast basin and the siberian platform eastoe et al 2001 eastoe et al 1999 shouakar stash et al 2007 the chlorine isotope ratio has been demonstrated to be an useful tool for distinguishing between these two sources in an experimental study eggenkamp et al 1995 predicted the evolution of δ37cl values in evaporites during seawater evaporation the results showed that seawater evaporation generates halite with a δ37cl value of 0 26 0 07 and residual seawater with a δ37cl range from 0 5 to 0 given that the δ37cl values of most xiong an geothermal waters range from 0 03 to 0 36 except for xa08 0 73 the dissolution of halite appears to be the primary origins of chloride in xiong an additional geochemical parameters e g cl br and na br molar ratios were also used to confirm the occurrence of halite dissolution fig 8 indeed all the xiong an samples fit the 1 1 m line indicating halite dissolution well providing an extra evidence to support halite dissolution as the dominant process it is noteworthy that the yanshan mountains in the north and the taihang mountains in the west are the main recharge areas for the geothermal waters wang et al 2013 because the surface is dominated by bedrocks evaporation induced halite formation is unlikely thus the source of halite may be closely related to the sedimentary environment of the bohai bay basin it has experienced several periods of transgression and regression over its long geological history and a small amount of residual ancient seawater was buried in the marine carbonate strata cl and na could precipitate from ancient seawater supersaturated with respect to halite due to a long process of evaporation and concentration and the precipitated halite has remained in the carbonate strata so far in contrast the xinzhou and tibet water samples with higher na br and na cl ratios deviate from the 1 1 m line to various degrees which is likely attributed to the leaching of felsic rocks such as granitic gneiss the reservoir hostrock of the xinzhou geothermal system and magmatic rocks the reservoir hostrocks of the investigated tibetan geothermal systems needless to say the silicate minerals in these felsic rocks are rich in na but depleted in cl and br 5 1 3 magmatic fluid input ruling out water rock interaction and dissolution of evaporates as the dominant cl sources for the tibetan geothermal waters we proposed that magmatic fluid input could substantially affect the cl geochemistry in the investigated tibetan geothermal areas indeed many geothermal systems located in tibet are likely heated by magma chambers guo et al 2019 hoke et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 for example the existence of magmatic heat sources below the yangbajain and yangyi geothermal systems has been verified brown et al 1996 guo et al 2007 guo et al 2009 yokoyama et al 1999 zhao et al 2002 although no geophysical studies have been conducted in daggyai semi and gudui the hydrogeochemical and isotopic features of the geothermal waters reveal that shallow magma chambers may be present beneath these three geothermal systems as well in general three types of geothermal waters coexist in a typical magmatic geothermal system hosted by felsic rocks neutral chloride rich waters alkaline bicarbonate rich waters and acid sulfate rich waters giggenbach 1988 guo et al 2014 which can be used as a robust evidence to validate the occurrence of a magma heated geothermal system there are acid hot springs with high sulfate concentrations in daggyai dg01 and dg02 and semi sm03 and the neutral to alkaline geothermal waters there are just nacl and na hco3 types fig 3 in the na k mg triangle diagram fig 9 most of the neutral to alkaline tibetan samples are located in the partially equilibrated or mixed area while the acid samples and two neutral samples sm01 and sm02 mixed with acid waters in the immature water area the neutral to alkaline waters in each hydrothermal area have close na k temperatures about 240 c in daggyai 260 c in gudui and 280 c in semi suggesting that they are possibly derived from a fully equilibrated parent geothermal fluid which is the result of complete neutralization of underlying magmatic fluids moreover volatile compounds e g h2o co2 so2 h2s and hcl can exsolve from deep magmas and have been extensively detected in volcanic gases and geothermal fluids aiuppa et al 2009 aiuppa et al 2005 gerlach 2004 rizzo et al 2013 rodríguez et al 2016 unlike most other chemically reactive compounds e g co2 so2 and h2s the exsolved hcl is highly hydrophilic and capable of efficiently captured and retained in the geothermal fluids above magma chambers despite complex geochemical processes occurring later chloride as a conservative component tends to be preserved in geothermal fluids hence magmatic fluid is promising to be a major contributor for the cl in the affected geothermal fluids like the investigated tibetan geothermal waters 5 2 possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation in geothermal systems since cl is incompatible and does not undergo speciation changes the cl isotope fractionation between rocks and fluids during water rock interaction is generally minimal cullen et al 2019 conducted a laboratory experiment in which rhyolite was reacted with deionized water at 150 350 c and 25 mpa the results showed that cl isotope fractionation is negligible during water rock interaction and the cl isotope compositions of reacted waters are similar to those of the reactant rhyolite given that the cl in xinzhou geothermal waters is primarily derived from water rock interaction the cl isotope fractionation that occurred in this geothermal system should be negligible thus in this study possible cl isotope fractionation processes were identified in the tibetan and xiong an geothermal systems as previously stated the input of magmatic fluids is the primary origin of cl in tibetan geothermal waters in view of the thickened continental crust in tibet around 70 80 km chung et al 2005 yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 the magmas beneath the geothermal systems were unavoidably contaminated by continental crust material marine sediments during their intrusion yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 with the contribution of these crust components the magmas in tibet were supposed to exhibit slightly negative δ37cl values bonifacie et al 2008a sun et al 2007 nonetheless the δ37cl values of the tibetan geothermal waters are all positive it is speculated that cl isotope fractionation may have occurred in the formation and transport of the deep geothermal fluid previous studies have shown that geothermal processes like aqueous and vapor speciation formation of altered minerals and boiling have negligible impact on the chlorine isotope composition of geothermal waters stefánsson and barnes 2016 therefore magma degassing is the most likely process responsible for the positive δ37cl values of the geothermal waters in daggyai semi and gudui during magma degassing cl exists as diatomic hcl in the gas phase but mostly as dissolved cl in the fluid phase because the h cl bond of hcl molecule is stronger than the loosely bound cl in the fluid the 37cl preferentially partitions into the hcl gas sharp et al 2010 according to theoretical calculations and experimental validations the equilibrium fractionation of cl isotope between hcl gas and solvated cl δ37clhcl cl is about 1 5 between 50 c and 100 c schauble et al 2003 sharp et al 2010 at higher temperatures and pressures the equilibrium cl isotope fractionation is generally negligible liebscher et al 2006 nevertheless noticeable kinetic fractionations have been observed in some high temperature volcanic gases such as those collected in central america with δ37cl values up to 12 sharp et al 2010 as a result the input of magmatic gases containing hcl into geothermal waters can account for the positive δ37cl values from 0 02 to 0 46 of the tibetan samples indeed the positive δ37cl values of geothermal waters have also been reported in some other magmatic geothermal areas worldwide e g iceland in a divergent plate boundary stefánsson and barnes 2016 and the cascade range in a convergent plate boundary cullen et al 2015 which were all attributable to magmatic gas partitioning different from the cl in tibetan geothermal waters that in xiong an is mainly from the dissolution of halite in carbonate rocks regionally the cl concentrations are higher in xiong county 1042 6 1331 7 mg l in the east than in rongchen county 903 8 1098 2 mg l and anxin county 1011 2 1098 2 mg l in the west this suggests that the geothermal waters are primarily recharged by the meteoric waters infiltrating into the taihang mountains in the west in agreement with the observations of wang et al 2013 moreover the δ37cl values of the geothermal waters in xiong county 0 23 0 73 are slightly higher than those in rongchen county 0 06 0 36 and anxin county 0 03 0 02 implying that the geothermal waters may be isotopically modified by some physicochemical processes occurring during their flow in the fractured or porous reservoirs it was reported that the main cl isotope fractionation processes of geothermal waters in sedimentary rock formation are diffusion and ion filtration bonifacie et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 diffusion will take place in a permeable medium if an adequate gradient of cl concentration exists since the faster translational velocity of light isotope 35cl diffusing faster than 37cl barnes and sharp 2017 the xiong an geothermal waters show a slight cl increase along the flow direction which is unlikely to result in cl isotope fractionation via diffusion diffusion is a process capable of leading to a decrease in cl isotope ratio from near recharge area to discharge area which is not the case in xiong an therefore ion filtration appears to be the most likely mechanism for fractionating cl isotopes in the xiong an geothermal waters ion filtration is a process that forces ions in fluid e g cl across a charged semi permeable membrane e g a clay layer negatively charged clays repel dissolved cl as the fluids flow since 35cl exhibits higher ionic mobility and more effective repulsion than 37cl the solution behind the membrane is enriched in 37cl relative to the inflow side the main reservoir hostrocks in xiong an are composed of argillaceous limestone and dolostone table 1 which are rich in clay minerals and have a large chemically active surface area in addition the geothermal waters exhibit a slight increase in δ37cl value along the flow direction thus ion filtration is presumed to be a critical process to explain the observed variations in δ37cl however with the limited samples in this study this process as well as its effects cannot yet be verified and more extensive studies are required to confirm the hypothesis 5 3 major implications on the geneses of geothermal systems 5 3 1 implication for magmatic heat source and its composition provided that magmatic fluid input is the primary source of chloride in daggyai semi and gudui as previously discussed the existence of magmatic heat sources beneath these tibetan geothermal systems must be a prerequisite the above mentioned geothermal waters are clearly different in terms of their δ37cl values 0 11 0 24 in daggyai 0 46 in semi and 0 02 in gudui which on one hand could be attributed to the dissolution of different types of reservoir rocks while on the other hand may also reflect the different compositions of magmas beneath the three geothermal systems the chemical compositions of magma chambers in particular may control the chlorine isotopic compositions of released magmatic fluids and further affect the δ37cl values of overlying geothermal waters recently studies have shown that the magma chambers beneath the geothermal systems in southern tibet were derived from a mantle wedge guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 but they were inevitably mixed with large amounts of crustal materials because of the thickened continental crust there yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 particularly the marine sedimentary rocks to date the range of δ37cl values in the mantle is highly debated bonifacie et al 2008b pinti et al 2020 sharp et al 2013 while that in marine sediments sampled by the ocean drilling program is from 2 5 to 0 7 generally negative barnes et al 2009 barnes et al 2008 so the variation in δ37cl values of these tibetan geothermal waters may be influenced to some degree by the heterogeneity of their underlying magmas as a result of the subduction of altered lithosphere including altered oceanic crust and overlying marine sedimentary rocks into the tibetan mantle plume source the variation in 3he 4he ratios of geothermal gases from various geothermal systems e g yangbajain 0 107 0 648 ra yokoyama et al 1999 ra denotes 3he 4he ratio of air daggyai 0 017 0 027 ra hoke et al 2000 menshi 2 24 ra zhao et al 2002 and tirthapuri 0 218 0 373 ra zhang et al 2017 is additional evidence for the heterogeneity of the magma chambers in southern tibetan geothermal systems specifically with the contribution of crust components such as altered oceanic crust and marine sedimentary rocks the magma chambers beneath the tibetan geothermal systems should have negative δ37cl values these magma chambers also have different chlorine isotope compositions due to varying degrees of mixing with crustal material during magma degassing hcl containing magma gases diffuse into the overlying geothermal waters resulting in an increase in their δ37cl values indeed distinctly different chlorine isotope compositions of magma heated geothermal waters have been reported worldwide the taupo volcanic zone in new zealand where magmatic fluids were assumed to be the primary source of cl is a typical example bernal et al 2014 the taupo geothermal waters were classified into two groups according to their δ37cl values 1 geothermal waters related with rhyolitic magmas have positive δ37cl values and higher cl br and li contents and 2 geothermal waters associated with andesitic magmas have negative δ37cl values and lower cl br and li contents to sum up although it is difficult to establish a relationship between δ37cl values of geothermal waters and magma compositions based only on the limited data currently available to claim that the heterogeneity of southern tibetan magmas should have effects on the δ37cl values of the geothermal waters there seems to be reasonable 5 3 2 implication for geothermal water circulation patterns the cl in the xiong an and xinzhou geothermal waters has nothing to do with a magmatic origin chlorine isotope composition in combination with several auxiliary hydrochemical parameters however can be used to indicate the circulation mechanisms of the geothermal waters in these two geothermal systems for the xiong an geothermal system the geothermal waters showed an increase in either chloride concentration or δ37cl value from west to east indicating that they were primarily recharged by the meteoric waters infiltrating into the taihang mountain in the west it is a typical conductive geothermal system of sedimentary basin type with stratified reservoirs formed within the basin during the lateral flow of the waters from west to east the dissolution of halite in carbonate layers increased their chloride concentrations and a concurrent ion filtration process resulted in an increase in δ37cl value the xinzhou geothermal system in contrast is a deep circulation geothermal system meteoric waters infiltrated into the deep subsurface from the marginal fracture zone of the basin absorbing heat from the surrounding rocks and leaching their chemical components e g chlorine the heated geothermal waters flowed upward via secondary fractures in the basin facilitating the formation of both the bedrock reservoir and the quaternary reservoir finally a conceptual model elaborating the geneses of the three types of geothermal systems included in this study was put forward and presented in fig 10 6 conclusion in this study stable chlorine isotope compositions and auxiliary hydrochemical parameters in the geothermal waters from various tectonic regions in china were used to discover the chloride sources and possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation as well as to further identify the geothermal system geneses with the aid of an isotope mass balance model and based on a combined geological hydrochemical and isotopic geochemical investigation the primary sources of chloride in the tibetan xinzhou and xiong an geothermal waters were considered to be input of magmatic fluids water rock interactions and dissolution of halite in carbonate rocks respectively additionally the chlorine isotope compositions of geothermal waters in tibet were somewhat affected by magma degassing while those in xiong an might be controlled by an ion filtration process combining the sources of chloride and the major processes resulting in chlorine isotope fractionation we concluded that daggyai semi and gudui in tibet are magmatic geothermal systems and the magmas beneath these systems show heterogeneity in chemical composition whereas xinzhou and xiong an are deep circulation type and sedimentary basin type geothermal systems respectively stable chlorine isotopes along with relevant geochemical parameters have the potential for identifying the geneses of various types of geothermal

2582,understanding the geneses of geothermal systems is critical for their efficient and sustainable exploitation chlorine is one of the most conservative elements in geothermal waters and capable of providing valuable information related to the formation and evolution of geothermal systems thereby being a promising indicator for identifying geothermal system geneses in this study representative hydrothermal systems located in various tectonic regions in china including daggyai semi and gudui in plate margin as well as xinzhou and xiong an in inland basins were selected for investigating the chloride sources of the geothermal waters and possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation occurring in the relevant geochemical processes the chloride of geothermal waters in tibet originated predominantly from magmatic fluids input whereas water rock interaction was the primary chloride source for the xinzhou geothermal waters as for the chloride in xiong an it was primary derived from the dissolution of halite in carbonate rocks in addition the major processes resulting in the chlorine isotope fractionation were supposed to be magma degassing in the tibetan geothermal systems and ion filtration in the xiong an geothermal system based on the discovered chloride sources and possible processes inducing non negligible chlorine isotope fractionation the geneses of various geothermal systems investigated in this study were proposed this study suggests that stable chlorine isotopes coupled with other geochemical parameters have the potential for discriminating geothermal systems with different geneses keywords chlorine geochemistry stable isotopes fractionation geothermal waters china data availability i have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction geothermal water is a valuable geological resource with diversified applications high temperature geothermal water has been frequently used for power generation while low to medium temperature geothermal water was predominantly used for house heating bathing aquaculture and medical treatment investigating the geothermal system geneses is a critical step in policy making capable of improving geothermal water management and utilization the hydrochemistry of geothermal waters from various geothermal systems is usually quite different and thus can be employed for the identification of geothermal system geneses the geochemical compositions of geothermal waters formed merely via deep circulation of infiltrating waters are primarily controlled by their interactions with reservoir rocks tian et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 for magmatic hydrothermal systems on one hand presence of a relatively shallow magma chamber beneath such geothermal systems greatly increases reservoir temperatures and promotes dissolution of reservoir rocks on the other hand input of magmatic fluids released from underlying magmas is a non negligible or even more important factor affecting geothermal water geochemistry giggenbach 1995 guo and wang 2012 as for geothermal systems formed in the deep subsurface of large scale sedimentary basins they also tend to exhibit distinctly different hydrogeochemistry due to influence of pale sedimentary environments or recharge of connate waters das et al 2022 as a result hydrogeochemical studies of geothermal waters have been commonly applied to tracing the origins of geothermal fluids and to identifying the geological geneses of geothermal systems nonetheless the majority of hydrochemical constituents are chemically reactive and easily affected by shallow subsurface processes increasing the difficulties in discriminating the geneses of different geothermal systems in contrast to other hydrochemical constituents chlorine is unique because 1 chlorine concentrations in geothermal waters vary greatly ranging from 10 mg l to 50 g l li et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 2 chlorine is conservative in natural waters including geothermal waters and barely precipitates during formation of altered minerals arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 and 3 more importantly chlorine is highly hydrophilic and can be easily captured and preserved by the overlying geothermal reservoirs during magma degassing and therefore is helpful in identifying the magmatic heat source of geothermal systems li et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 however chloride concentration alone cannot be used to distinguish the chloride sources of geothermal waters in view that elevated chloride concentrations may be caused by various processes e g host rock leaching seawater mixing or magma degassing stable chlorine isotope compositions on the other hand could indicate different chlorine sources fig 1 for instance geothermal waters with a dominant source of cl from seawater usually have a homogeneous δ37cl value around 0 bonifacie et al 2005 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2014 the δ37cl values of geothermal waters in which cl originated from sedimentary rock leaching range from 2 51 to 0 01 generally negative zhang et al 2007 while those of geothermal waters with magmatic rock leaching as the primary cl source range from 0 3 to 1 3 generally positive cullen et al 2015 cullen et al 2021 stefánsson and barnes 2016 a few measurements on low temperature sediment pore waters from the juan de fuca ridge s eastern flank which are thought to be representative of connate waters show negative δ37cl values varying from 2 80 to 0 12 bonifacie et al 2007 geothermal waters affected by magmatic fluid input have a relatively wide δ37cl range varying from 1 0 to 2 1 bernal et al 2014 cullen et al 2015 li et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 stefánsson and barnes 2016 the geothermal fluids containing cl derived from the mantle seawater and halite dissolution have δ37cl values varying from 3 6 to 0 81 pinti et al 2020 to summarize the chlorine isotopic geochemistry of geothermal waters with different geneses varies greatly making it a suitable indicator for identifying geothermal system geneses in china magmatic geothermal systems are primarily distributed in the yunnan sichuan tibet geothermal province and the taiwan geothermal province such as rehai in yunnan bai et al 1994 shangguan et al 2000 yangbajain and yangyi in tibet guo et al 2007 guo et al 2009 yokoyama et al 1999 zhao et al 2002 and tatun in taiwan dobson et al 2018 liu et al 2011 they are all situated in the plate margins where geological conditions are favorable for formation of magmatic geothermal systems however there are undoubtedly many unproven magmatic and non magmatic geothermal systems in the above geothermal belts in contrast the geothermal systems located in chinese inland basins far from the plate margins are mostly low to medium temperature and do not have a magmatic heat source nevertheless there are also a few cases of high temperature geothermal systems under such geological conditions such as the gonghe basin in qinghai province and the datong basin in shanxi province pan et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 and the geneses of these geothermal systems remain unknown in summary the geologic geneses of a large number of geothermal systems in both plate margins and inland basins are far from being fully understood and more relevant research is required in this study we present the hydrochemical and chlorine isotope compositions of geothermal waters in three geothermal systems daggyai semi and gudui located in the plate margin tibetan plateau and two geothermal systems xinzhou and xiong an located in the inland basins the xinding basin and the bohai bay basin these data were used to assess the chloride sources of the investigated geothermal waters and the possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation involved in the related geochemical processes as well as to further investigate the use of chlorine geochemistry as a tool for identifying the geothermal systems geneses 2 geologic setting it is commonly accepted that the tibetan plateau was generated by the india asia plate collision since the early cenozoic chung et al 2005 tapponnier et al 2001 due to the subsequent subduction of the indian plate a series of east west trending sutures such as the indus tsangpo suture its bangong nu suture bns and jiangshajiang suture js have formed within the tibetan plateau fig 2 a hydrothermal activities can be found throughout the plateau but they are most concentrated in the southern tibetan plateau between the its and bns where intensive surface geothermal manifestations such as geysers boiling springs hot springs steaming ground and hydrothermal alteration are ubiquitously observed tong et al 1981 the hydrothermal activities on the nothern tibetan plateau are relatively weak with low to medium temperature springs predominating but the large scale distribution of sinter suggests that hydrothermal activities were much stronger in the past liao and zhao 1999 these hydrothermal activities on the tibetan plateau are the product of the collision between the indian plate and the eurasian plate and the geothermal fluids contain a wealth of deep information about the compositions of the upper and middle crusts and even the mantle the basement rocks of the southern tibetan plateau are mainly composed of the precambrian metamorphic rocks which are only found in amdo and to the west of the nam lake hu et al 2005 the cover sequences consist of paleozoic to mesozoic sedimentary rocks and mesozoic to cenozoic magmatic rocks zhu et al 2013 previous geophysical and geochemical investigations have revealed the presence of magma chambers in the depths of numerous geothermal systems in southern tibet brown et al 1996 guo et al 2019 hoke et al 2000 klemperer et al 2013 yokoyama et al 1999 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2002 the majority of which were derived from the mantle wedge guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 nonetheless the upward transport of the mantle wedge would inevitably mix with a large amount of crustal materials or induce local remelting of crustal rocks because of the thickened continental crust 70 80 km yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 in this study three hydrothermal systems in tibet daggyai semi and gudui were chosen as representatives of plate margin geothermal systems all of which are located near the indus tsangpo suture although no geophysical survey has been conducted in daggyai and semi the strong surface hydrothermal activity there suggests that magma chambers may exist beneath these geothermal systems detailed geological settings of daggyai semi and gudui are presented in the supplementary data the xinzhou geothermal area is geographically located south of the xinding basin in shanxi province north china the xinding basin is a cenozoic rift basin whose tectonic framework was primarily formed during the late yanshanian epoch zhang et al 2008 it is bounded on the east by the wutai mountain on the south by the jizhou mountain on the west by the yunzhong mountain and on the north by the heng mountain fig 2 b the basement rocks of the xinding basin including the surrounding mountains are primarily archean metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the heng mountain the wutai mountain and the south of the yunzhong mountain the overlying strata consist of cambrian ordovician limestone carboniferous triassic sandy shale tertiary sandstone and basalt and quaternary sediments han 2007 quaternary sediments with thickness ranging from 80 m to 200 m are outcropped throughout the basin the recharge sources of geothermal waters are the meteoric waters infiltrating into the surrounding mountains where limestone and metamorphic rocks mainly outcrop fracture structures were developed along the basin margin and also within the basin dividing the basin into fanzhi graben daixian graben yuanping graben qicun graben and xingding graben from north to south these fracture structures which act as channels for the convective circulation of geothermal fluids play an important role in the formation of the geothermal system han et al 2010 the main reservoir is hosted by weathered metamorphic rocks granitic gneiss belonging to the archean wutai group the xiong an geothermal area is located in the north of the jizhong graben of the bohai bay basin north china it is situated at the junction of the rongcheng and niutuozhen uplifts with the xushui graben to the west the baxian graben to the east and the baoding graben the gaoyang low uplift and the raoyang graben to the south fig 2c the major structures in xiong an are niunan fault niudong fault daxing fault and rongcheng fault which serve as the conduits for the upward transport of deep geothermal fluids the following units were found in increasing depth quaternary sediments neogene continental clastic rocks lower paleozoic to upper middle proterozoic marine carbonate rocks and archean metamorphic rocks zhu et al 2021 the quaternary sediments outcropping in the whole area serve as the cap rocks by providing good thermal insulation the xiong an geothermal system includes two major reservoirs the shallow reservoir is made up of neogene sandstone and the deep reservoir is made up of proterozoic limestone and dolostone all of the geothermal water samples in this study are from the deep reservoir the xiong an geothermal area is far from the plate margin geothermal belts and no continental rift is developed nearby so the likelihood of a shallow magmatic heat source beneath xiong an is negligible the geological and geothermal settings of daggyai semi gudui xinzhou and xiong an are summarized in table1 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sampling and measurements fifty one geothermal water samples were collected in this study including twenty hot spring samples from tibet thirteen from daggyai four from semi and three from gudui in august 2018 ten geothermal well samples from xinzhou in november 2019 and twenty one geothermal well samples from xiong an in december 2018 in addition eight rock core samples one granitic gneiss sample from xinzhou and seven dolomite samples from xiong an from five geothermal wells were also collected fig 2 shows the sampling locations of all the samples unstable parameters e g t ph and ec were tested in situ using a portable water quality analyzer for cations analysis concentrated hno3 was added to lower the ph below 1 while no chemicals were added for anions δd δ18o and δ37cl analysis 3 2 lab analysis and data processing 3 2 1 measurements of hydrochemical components as well as oxygen hydrogen and chlorine isotopes the concentrations of na k ca mg si b sr li and as in geothermal waters were determined by icp oes and icp ms within 2 weeks after sampling with uncertainties of 5 the so4 2 f cl and br were measured by ic with uncertainties of 2 the co2 equilibration method was employed for the determination of 18o 16o ratio of the geothermal waters while the zn reduction method was used to generate h2 for the d h ratio measurement coleman et al 1982 co2 and h2 isotope ratios were determined with a finnigan mat 251 mass spectrometer the δ18o and δd values were reported in reference to the value of the v smow the uncertainties are 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δd notably in high temperature geothermal systems a boiling process usually occurs near the surface because this process is able to cause significant changes in the deuterium and oxygen 18 compositions of subsurface fluids their δd and δ18o values need to be corrected the correction method was described in detail by guo et al 2014 and truesdell et al 1977 in this study the δd and δ18o values of seven hot springs in tibet dg05 dg08 dg11 dg13 sm01 sm02 and sm04 with sampling temperatures close to 85 c corresponding to the boiling point of the elevation at about 4500 m were corrected the chlorine isotope compositions of seventeen geothermal water samples were determined by p tims at the qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences this method has been widely applied to a variety of geological samples including seafloor rocks magenheim et al 1995 salt minerals liu et al 1997 luo et al 2014 seawaters shirodkar et al 2006 and pore fluids wei et al 2008 the geothermal waters were sequentially passed through an h ion and a cs ion exchange resin column to generate cscl solution for the mass spectrometric measurement the cscl solution containing about 10 μg chlorine was loaded onto a tantalum filament that had previously been covered with 2 5 μl of graphite slurry and degassed by being heated at a current of 2 5 a for 1 h the filament was then heated for 1 5 min at a current of 1a before being loaded onto the mass spectrometer the laboratory standard was the isl 354 nacl and the absolute 37cl 35cl ratio was 0 319549 0 000044 wei et al 2012 the external reproducibility of the analysis is 0 13 and the δ37cl value gives the deviation of the 37cl 35cl ratio of the sample relative to that of the standard mean ocean chlorine smoc the δ37cl values of the geothermal water samples were expressed as follows δ 37 cl

and li contents of rocks eight rock core samples were analyzed for cl br b and li contents the nh4hf2 digestion method was used to extract cl and br from rock samples he et al 2019 at high temperatures nh4hf2 is capable of rapidly destroying the silicate mineral structure and its thermal decomposition also releases ammonia which reacts with halogens to form stable ammonium species preventing volatile halogen losses during digestion process a total of 100 mg of rock sample and 400 mg of nh4hf2 was weighed into a teflon vial savillex eden prairie mn and heated at 220 c for 2 h after cooling the digestion cake was diluted to 25 g with a 5 v v nh4oh solution and the supernatant solution was directly measured using an inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometer icpsfms the detection limits for cl and br are 5 μg g and 0 015 μg g respectively a series of reference geological materials were also analyzed to confirm the method s reliability and the measured cl and br values are consistent with the values previously reported in the literatures kendrick et al 2018 michel and villemant 2003 sekimoto and ebihara 2017 as for the determination of b and li concentrations in the rock samples each sample was completely digested with a mixed acid hno3 hclo4 hf and was measured by icp ms the measured cl br b and li contents of rocks are shown in table 3 4 results 4 1 chemistry of geothermal waters according to the sampling location and ph values all the waters were divided into four groups acid geothermal waters in tibet neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in tibet neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in xinzhou and neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in xiong an these four types of geothermal waters have distinct hydrogeochemical properties three acid hot spring samples from tibet two from daggyai and one from semi have a ph range of 3 0 to 4 5 and are of ca na so4 type fig 3 they have low electrical conductivity ec values and chloride concentrations fig 4 a these acid waters are formed by geothermal steams heating shallow cold groundwaters guo et al 2014 and thus contain much less chloride compared to deeply circulated neutral to alkaline geothermal waters in contrast to two acid daggyai hot springs the acid water sample from semi sm03 with higher ec value and chloride concentration could be mixed with neutral cl rich waters as for the neutral to alkaline samples in tibet the ph and ec values range from 6 0 to 8 6 and 1502 to 4184 μs cm respectively and the hydrochemical types are na hco3 cl and nacl fig 3 they represent the major discharge of reservoir fluids and consequently have higher ec values and chloride concentrations fig 4a the geothermal water samples from inland basins xinzhou and xiong an are all neutral or weakly alkaline the xinzhou water samples have ph and ec values ranging from 7 6 to 9 2 and 965 to 3270 μs cm respectively their major ions are na ca2 so4 2 and cl and the hydrochemical types are na ca so4 cl and na cl so4 fig 3 in general their chloride concentrations are lower than those of the non acid tibetan waters fig 4a the xiong an geothermal waters have ph and ec values varying from 6 8 to 8 5 and 4442 to 5457 μs cm respectively and belong to na cl and na cl hco3 types fig 3 their chloride concentrations are significantly higher compared to those from tibet and xinzhou fig 4 4 2 o h and cl stable isotopes the δd and δ18o values vary from 155 69 to 139 09 and from 16 30 to 11 93 for the acid tibetan waters from 163 08 to 137 99 and from 21 43 to 11 93 for the neutral to alkaline tibetan waters from 87 32 to 66 63 and from 12 04 to 8 55 for the xinzhou waters and from 74 48 to 70 35 and from 9 07 to 8 05 for the xiong an waters most water samples exhibit different degrees of oxygen isotope shifts fig 5 which is mainly due to the water rock interaction between geothermal waters and their host rocks notably the oxygen isotope shifts of the tibetan geothermal waters are significantly larger with some samples exceeding 3 possibly due to input of magmatic fluids in contrast the acid spring samples from tibet though featuring large oxygen isotope shifts as well have elevated δ18o values because primarily of the strong evaporation occurring in the spring vents small flow rates and large areas of the vents the δ37cl values of the water samples in tibet xinzhou and xiong an range from 0 02 to 0 46 0 03 to 0 3 and 0 02 to 0 73 respectively most of the samples have positive δ37cl values with the exception of xa11 0 02 and xa12 0 03 in xiong an the difference in δ37cl values among the geothermal waters from these three regions is not significant fig 4b in general there is no a statistically apparent relationship between δ37cl values and cl concentrations but several samples with high cl concentrations have unusually high δ37cl values for examples of the tibetan samples one with the highest chloride concentration sm04 has a quite high δ37cl value of 0 46 and the sample xa08 from xiong an with a chloride content of 1136 5 mg l has a δ37cl value up to 0 73 4 3 geochemistry of rocks the cl and br concentrations of the archean granitic gneiss sample collected in xinzhou 281 ppm and 1 48 ppm respectively are higher than those of the proterozoic dolomite samples collected in xiong an 84 8 168 0 ppm and 0 07 0 68 ppm respectively in contrast the li and b concentrations of the archean granitic gneiss in xinzhou are 0 51 ppm and 1 02 ppm respectively generally lower than those of the proterozoic dolomite rocks in xiong an ranging from 0 26 ppm to 18 73 ppm and 1 93 ppm to 121 01 ppm respectively the cl br molar ratio of the xinzhou granite gneiss sample 427 3 is lower than that of the xiong an dolostone 420 4 3504 7 whereas the cl b and cl li molar ratios 83 8 and 107 1 respectively are significantly higher than that of the xiong an dolostone 0 3 20 2 and 1 5 82 9 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 sources of chloride in geothermal waters 5 1 1 water rock interactions it is acknowledged that interaction between geothermal water and surrounding rock is one of the most predominant origins of dissolved chemical constituents in geothermal waters for either magmatic or non magmatic geothermal systems as a typical soluble and conservative element chlorine can be easily leached out from the reservoir rocks upon their reactions with geothermal waters fig 6 shows the correlations between b or li and cl all of which are regarded to be conservative in waters the cl b and cl li molar ratios of the xinzhou waters 81 3 186 2 and 93 4 496 3 respectively are close to those of the xinzhou granitic gneiss 83 8 and 107 1 respectively indicating that the cl in the xinzhou geothermal waters should originate from the water rock interactions in contrast the cl b and cl li molar ratios of the waters in tibet and xiong an are significantly higher than those of the corresponding reservoir rocks revealing that the chloride should have other sources besides the water rock interactions to further evaluate the contribution of water rock interactions to the chloride in the investigated geothermal waters an isotope mass balance model proposed by yamaoka et al 2015 was used to simulate the interactions between infiltrating meteoric water and different reservoir rocks in this model the cl contents and δ37cl values of the waters and rocks before and after the water rock interactions can be correlated by the following mass balance equation cl rock i rcl water i cl rock f rcl water f cl rock i 37 35 cl rock i rcl water i 37 35 cl water i cl rock i rcl water i cl rock f 37 35 cl rock f rcl rock f 37 35 cl rock f cl rock f rcl water f where cl rock i and cl water i are the cl concentrations of rock and water before interaction respectively r is the water rock mass ratio cl rock f and cl water f are the cl concentrations of rock and water after interaction respectively 37 35 cl rock i and 37 35 cl water i are the 37cl 35cl ratios of rock and water before interaction respectively and 37 35 cl rock f and 37 35 cl water f are the 37cl 35cl ratios of rock and water after interaction respectively the distribution coefficient of chlorine d cl is αdefined by d cl c l rock f c l water f and the isotopic fractionation factor of chlorine by α 37 35 cl rock f 37 35 cl water f based on the above two equations the cl concentration and δ37cl value of geothermal water after water rock interaction can be expressed as cl water f cl rock i r cl water i d cl r δ 37 c l water f c l rock i 1000 δ 37 c l rock i r c l water i 1000 δ 37 c l water i c l rock i r c l water i d cl r α d cl r in this study the initial meteoric waters in the three study regions were assumed to have a cl content of 3 ppm and a δ37cl value of 0 cullen et al 2015 given that the reservoirs in daggyai semi and gudui in tibet are primarily hosted by magmatic rocks table 1 the average cl concentration 359 4 ppm and δ37cl value 0 19 of the magmatic rocks reported by cullen et al 2015 cullen et al 2021 rizzo et al 2013 shinonaga et al 1994 and michel and villemant 2003 were used for the tibetan reservoir rock endmember as for the xinzhou reservoir rock endmember the cl concentration of the granitic gneiss sample 281 ppm analyzed in this study and the average δ37cl value of altered magmatic rocks from seven dsdp odp iodp drill sites 0 28 barnes and cisneros 2012 were used for the xiong an reservoir rock endmember the average cl concentration of the carbonate rock samples collected and analyzed in this study 123 3 ppm and the average δ37cl value of the carbonate rocks reported by arcuri and brimhall 2003 and selverstone and sharp 2015 0 48 were used due to a lack of systematic chlorine isotope fractionation experiments at high temperatures the available chlorine isotope fractionation factors between rocks and geothermal fluids are scarce at 700 c and 0 2 gpa cisneros 2013 determined the cl isotope fractionation factor between amphibole and a cl containing solution and the result showed a slightly positive fractionation 103lnαamphibole fluid 0 1 0 2 schauble et al 2003 determined the equilibrium cl isotope fractionations between silicates and coexisting brine and suggested that silicates had 2 3 higher δ37cl values at room temperature according to the reservoir temperatures in the study areas about 100 c in xinzhou and xiong an and 200 c in tibet the chlorine isotope fractionation coefficient α was set to be 1 001 for the water rock interactions in xinzhou and xiong an and 1 0005 for those in tibet the distribution coefficient of chlorine d cl has not been well constrained either but in general cl tends to be enriched in fluid and we accordingly assumed d cl 0 05 with reference to cullen et al 2015 with these parameters the theoretical geothermal water compositions corresponding to varying water rock ratios were calculated and shown in fig 7 the xinzhou samples are basically located near to the xinzhou water rock interaction curve again indicating that the cl in the xinzhou waters was primarily from the leaching of granitic gneiss in contrast all samples from semi and gudui in tibet and xiong an deviate far from their respective modelling curves and the cl contents of the deviated samples are significantly higher than the modeling results it is worth noting that the spring samples collected from daggyai in tibet appear to be close to the modeling curves the main reason is that the daggyai samples contained a high proportion of shallow cold waters as evidenced by their high ca2 and hco3 contents table s1 namely the cl concentrations in deep geothermal fluids in daggyai are significantly higher than in spring samples overall the deep geothermal fluids in all of the geothermal systems in tibet daggyai semi and gudui and xiong an have higher cl contents than the water rock interaction simulation results therefore in addition to the water rock interactions there must be other sources of cl in the xiong an and tibetan geothermal waters e g dissolution of evaporates or input of magmatic fluids 5 1 2 dissolution of evaporates according to the above analysis water rock interaction alone cannot account for the high cl contents in xiong an and tibet previous studies have revealed that the high concentrations of cl in inland basin groundwaters like xiong an generally originate from dissolution of evaporates with halite being the most typical cl bearing mineral recognized or recharge of connate waters such as the palo duro basin the gulf coast basin and the siberian platform eastoe et al 2001 eastoe et al 1999 shouakar stash et al 2007 the chlorine isotope ratio has been demonstrated to be an useful tool for distinguishing between these two sources in an experimental study eggenkamp et al 1995 predicted the evolution of δ37cl values in evaporites during seawater evaporation the results showed that seawater evaporation generates halite with a δ37cl value of 0 26 0 07 and residual seawater with a δ37cl range from 0 5 to 0 given that the δ37cl values of most xiong an geothermal waters range from 0 03 to 0 36 except for xa08 0 73 the dissolution of halite appears to be the primary origins of chloride in xiong an additional geochemical parameters e g cl br and na br molar ratios were also used to confirm the occurrence of halite dissolution fig 8 indeed all the xiong an samples fit the 1 1 m line indicating halite dissolution well providing an extra evidence to support halite dissolution as the dominant process it is noteworthy that the yanshan mountains in the north and the taihang mountains in the west are the main recharge areas for the geothermal waters wang et al 2013 because the surface is dominated by bedrocks evaporation induced halite formation is unlikely thus the source of halite may be closely related to the sedimentary environment of the bohai bay basin it has experienced several periods of transgression and regression over its long geological history and a small amount of residual ancient seawater was buried in the marine carbonate strata cl and na could precipitate from ancient seawater supersaturated with respect to halite due to a long process of evaporation and concentration and the precipitated halite has remained in the carbonate strata so far in contrast the xinzhou and tibet water samples with higher na br and na cl ratios deviate from the 1 1 m line to various degrees which is likely attributed to the leaching of felsic rocks such as granitic gneiss the reservoir hostrock of the xinzhou geothermal system and magmatic rocks the reservoir hostrocks of the investigated tibetan geothermal systems needless to say the silicate minerals in these felsic rocks are rich in na but depleted in cl and br 5 1 3 magmatic fluid input ruling out water rock interaction and dissolution of evaporates as the dominant cl sources for the tibetan geothermal waters we proposed that magmatic fluid input could substantially affect the cl geochemistry in the investigated tibetan geothermal areas indeed many geothermal systems located in tibet are likely heated by magma chambers guo et al 2019 hoke et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 for example the existence of magmatic heat sources below the yangbajain and yangyi geothermal systems has been verified brown et al 1996 guo et al 2007 guo et al 2009 yokoyama et al 1999 zhao et al 2002 although no geophysical studies have been conducted in daggyai semi and gudui the hydrogeochemical and isotopic features of the geothermal waters reveal that shallow magma chambers may be present beneath these three geothermal systems as well in general three types of geothermal waters coexist in a typical magmatic geothermal system hosted by felsic rocks neutral chloride rich waters alkaline bicarbonate rich waters and acid sulfate rich waters giggenbach 1988 guo et al 2014 which can be used as a robust evidence to validate the occurrence of a magma heated geothermal system there are acid hot springs with high sulfate concentrations in daggyai dg01 and dg02 and semi sm03 and the neutral to alkaline geothermal waters there are just nacl and na hco3 types fig 3 in the na k mg triangle diagram fig 9 most of the neutral to alkaline tibetan samples are located in the partially equilibrated or mixed area while the acid samples and two neutral samples sm01 and sm02 mixed with acid waters in the immature water area the neutral to alkaline waters in each hydrothermal area have close na k temperatures about 240 c in daggyai 260 c in gudui and 280 c in semi suggesting that they are possibly derived from a fully equilibrated parent geothermal fluid which is the result of complete neutralization of underlying magmatic fluids moreover volatile compounds e g h2o co2 so2 h2s and hcl can exsolve from deep magmas and have been extensively detected in volcanic gases and geothermal fluids aiuppa et al 2009 aiuppa et al 2005 gerlach 2004 rizzo et al 2013 rodríguez et al 2016 unlike most other chemically reactive compounds e g co2 so2 and h2s the exsolved hcl is highly hydrophilic and capable of efficiently captured and retained in the geothermal fluids above magma chambers despite complex geochemical processes occurring later chloride as a conservative component tends to be preserved in geothermal fluids hence magmatic fluid is promising to be a major contributor for the cl in the affected geothermal fluids like the investigated tibetan geothermal waters 5 2 possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation in geothermal systems since cl is incompatible and does not undergo speciation changes the cl isotope fractionation between rocks and fluids during water rock interaction is generally minimal cullen et al 2019 conducted a laboratory experiment in which rhyolite was reacted with deionized water at 150 350 c and 25 mpa the results showed that cl isotope fractionation is negligible during water rock interaction and the cl isotope compositions of reacted waters are similar to those of the reactant rhyolite given that the cl in xinzhou geothermal waters is primarily derived from water rock interaction the cl isotope fractionation that occurred in this geothermal system should be negligible thus in this study possible cl isotope fractionation processes were identified in the tibetan and xiong an geothermal systems as previously stated the input of magmatic fluids is the primary origin of cl in tibetan geothermal waters in view of the thickened continental crust in tibet around 70 80 km chung et al 2005 yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 the magmas beneath the geothermal systems were unavoidably contaminated by continental crust material marine sediments during their intrusion yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 with the contribution of these crust components the magmas in tibet were supposed to exhibit slightly negative δ37cl values bonifacie et al 2008a sun et al 2007 nonetheless the δ37cl values of the tibetan geothermal waters are all positive it is speculated that cl isotope fractionation may have occurred in the formation and transport of the deep geothermal fluid previous studies have shown that geothermal processes like aqueous and vapor speciation formation of altered minerals and boiling have negligible impact on the chlorine isotope composition of geothermal waters stefánsson and barnes 2016 therefore magma degassing is the most likely process responsible for the positive δ37cl values of the geothermal waters in daggyai semi and gudui during magma degassing cl exists as diatomic hcl in the gas phase but mostly as dissolved cl in the fluid phase because the h cl bond of hcl molecule is stronger than the loosely bound cl in the fluid the 37cl preferentially partitions into the hcl gas sharp et al 2010 according to theoretical calculations and experimental validations the equilibrium fractionation of cl isotope between hcl gas and solvated cl δ37clhcl cl is about 1 5 between 50 c and 100 c schauble et al 2003 sharp et al 2010 at higher temperatures and pressures the equilibrium cl isotope fractionation is generally negligible liebscher et al 2006 nevertheless noticeable kinetic fractionations have been observed in some high temperature volcanic gases such as those collected in central america with δ37cl values up to 12 sharp et al 2010 as a result the input of magmatic gases containing hcl into geothermal waters can account for the positive δ37cl values from 0 02 to 0 46 of the tibetan samples indeed the positive δ37cl values of geothermal waters have also been reported in some other magmatic geothermal areas worldwide e g iceland in a divergent plate boundary stefánsson and barnes 2016 and the cascade range in a convergent plate boundary cullen et al 2015 which were all attributable to magmatic gas partitioning different from the cl in tibetan geothermal waters that in xiong an is mainly from the dissolution of halite in carbonate rocks regionally the cl concentrations are higher in xiong county 1042 6 1331 7 mg l in the east than in rongchen county 903 8 1098 2 mg l and anxin county 1011 2 1098 2 mg l in the west this suggests that the geothermal waters are primarily recharged by the meteoric waters infiltrating into the taihang mountains in the west in agreement with the observations of wang et al 2013 moreover the δ37cl values of the geothermal waters in xiong county 0 23 0 73 are slightly higher than those in rongchen county 0 06 0 36 and anxin county 0 03 0 02 implying that the geothermal waters may be isotopically modified by some physicochemical processes occurring during their flow in the fractured or porous reservoirs it was reported that the main cl isotope fractionation processes of geothermal waters in sedimentary rock formation are diffusion and ion filtration bonifacie et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 diffusion will take place in a permeable medium if an adequate gradient of cl concentration exists since the faster translational velocity of light isotope 35cl diffusing faster than 37cl barnes and sharp 2017 the xiong an geothermal waters show a slight cl increase along the flow direction which is unlikely to result in cl isotope fractionation via diffusion diffusion is a process capable of leading to a decrease in cl isotope ratio from near recharge area to discharge area which is not the case in xiong an therefore ion filtration appears to be the most likely mechanism for fractionating cl isotopes in the xiong an geothermal waters ion filtration is a process that forces ions in fluid e g cl across a charged semi permeable membrane e g a clay layer negatively charged clays repel dissolved cl as the fluids flow since 35cl exhibits higher ionic mobility and more effective repulsion than 37cl the solution behind the membrane is enriched in 37cl relative to the inflow side the main reservoir hostrocks in xiong an are composed of argillaceous limestone and dolostone table 1 which are rich in clay minerals and have a large chemically active surface area in addition the geothermal waters exhibit a slight increase in δ37cl value along the flow direction thus ion filtration is presumed to be a critical process to explain the observed variations in δ37cl however with the limited samples in this study this process as well as its effects cannot yet be verified and more extensive studies are required to confirm the hypothesis 5 3 major implications on the geneses of geothermal systems 5 3 1 implication for magmatic heat source and its composition provided that magmatic fluid input is the primary source of chloride in daggyai semi and gudui as previously discussed the existence of magmatic heat sources beneath these tibetan geothermal systems must be a prerequisite the above mentioned geothermal waters are clearly different in terms of their δ37cl values 0 11 0 24 in daggyai 0 46 in semi and 0 02 in gudui which on one hand could be attributed to the dissolution of different types of reservoir rocks while on the other hand may also reflect the different compositions of magmas beneath the three geothermal systems the chemical compositions of magma chambers in particular may control the chlorine isotopic compositions of released magmatic fluids and further affect the δ37cl values of overlying geothermal waters recently studies have shown that the magma chambers beneath the geothermal systems in southern tibet were derived from a mantle wedge guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 but they were inevitably mixed with large amounts of crustal materials because of the thickened continental crust there yuan et al 1997 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2001 particularly the marine sedimentary rocks to date the range of δ37cl values in the mantle is highly debated bonifacie et al 2008b pinti et al 2020 sharp et al 2013 while that in marine sediments sampled by the ocean drilling program is from 2 5 to 0 7 generally negative barnes et al 2009 barnes et al 2008 so the variation in δ37cl values of these tibetan geothermal waters may be influenced to some degree by the heterogeneity of their underlying magmas as a result of the subduction of altered lithosphere including altered oceanic crust and overlying marine sedimentary rocks into the tibetan mantle plume source the variation in 3he 4he ratios of geothermal gases from various geothermal systems e g yangbajain 0 107 0 648 ra yokoyama et al 1999 ra denotes 3he 4he ratio of air daggyai 0 017 0 027 ra hoke et al 2000 menshi 2 24 ra zhao et al 2002 and tirthapuri 0 218 0 373 ra zhang et al 2017 is additional evidence for the heterogeneity of the magma chambers in southern tibetan geothermal systems specifically with the contribution of crust components such as altered oceanic crust and marine sedimentary rocks the magma chambers beneath the tibetan geothermal systems should have negative δ37cl values these magma chambers also have different chlorine isotope compositions due to varying degrees of mixing with crustal material during magma degassing hcl containing magma gases diffuse into the overlying geothermal waters resulting in an increase in their δ37cl values indeed distinctly different chlorine isotope compositions of magma heated geothermal waters have been reported worldwide the taupo volcanic zone in new zealand where magmatic fluids were assumed to be the primary source of cl is a typical example bernal et al 2014 the taupo geothermal waters were classified into two groups according to their δ37cl values 1 geothermal waters related with rhyolitic magmas have positive δ37cl values and higher cl br and li contents and 2 geothermal waters associated with andesitic magmas have negative δ37cl values and lower cl br and li contents to sum up although it is difficult to establish a relationship between δ37cl values of geothermal waters and magma compositions based only on the limited data currently available to claim that the heterogeneity of southern tibetan magmas should have effects on the δ37cl values of the geothermal waters there seems to be reasonable 5 3 2 implication for geothermal water circulation patterns the cl in the xiong an and xinzhou geothermal waters has nothing to do with a magmatic origin chlorine isotope composition in combination with several auxiliary hydrochemical parameters however can be used to indicate the circulation mechanisms of the geothermal waters in these two geothermal systems for the xiong an geothermal system the geothermal waters showed an increase in either chloride concentration or δ37cl value from west to east indicating that they were primarily recharged by the meteoric waters infiltrating into the taihang mountain in the west it is a typical conductive geothermal system of sedimentary basin type with stratified reservoirs formed within the basin during the lateral flow of the waters from west to east the dissolution of halite in carbonate layers increased their chloride concentrations and a concurrent ion filtration process resulted in an increase in δ37cl value the xinzhou geothermal system in contrast is a deep circulation geothermal system meteoric waters infiltrated into the deep subsurface from the marginal fracture zone of the basin absorbing heat from the surrounding rocks and leaching their chemical components e g chlorine the heated geothermal waters flowed upward via secondary fractures in the basin facilitating the formation of both the bedrock reservoir and the quaternary reservoir finally a conceptual model elaborating the geneses of the three types of geothermal systems included in this study was put forward and presented in fig 10 6 conclusion in this study stable chlorine isotope compositions and auxiliary hydrochemical parameters in the geothermal waters from various tectonic regions in china were used to discover the chloride sources and possible mechanisms of chlorine isotope fractionation as well as to further identify the geothermal system geneses with the aid of an isotope mass balance model and based on a combined geological hydrochemical and isotopic geochemical investigation the primary sources of chloride in the tibetan xinzhou and xiong an geothermal waters were considered to be input of magmatic fluids water rock interactions and dissolution of halite in carbonate rocks respectively additionally the chlorine isotope compositions of geothermal waters in tibet were somewhat affected by magma degassing while those in xiong an might be controlled by an ion filtration process combining the sources of chloride and the major processes resulting in chlorine isotope fractionation we concluded that daggyai semi and gudui in tibet are magmatic geothermal systems and the magmas beneath these systems show heterogeneity in chemical composition whereas xinzhou and xiong an are deep circulation type and sedimentary basin type geothermal systems respectively stable chlorine isotopes along with relevant geochemical parameters have the potential for identifying the geneses of various types of geothermal

2583,optical remote sensing images are a common data sources for surface water monitoring while they are easily contaminated by clouds cloud shadows terrain shadows etc resulting in spatial gaps in surface water images this paper proposes a surface water gap filling method based on naive bayes classification it uses the historical cloud free binary water non water surface water images as prior data and the uncontaminated pixels in the partially contaminated ternary water non water contaminated pixels surface water image as evidence to identify the category of gap pixels to achieve the purpose of gap filling this method considers the relationship between disconnected water bodies and does not depend on terrain data when the image is heavily covered by clouds this method can also reconstruct the complete water extent accurately five study areas with different scenarios including rivers lakes or reservoirs are selected to evaluate the method results show that the average gap filling accuracy in all five study areas is over 90 after gap filling the time series of surface water area presents a good correlation with the time series of water level e g the coefficient of determination r 2 0 95 in the dartmouth reservoir the proposed method is proved effective in filling gaps caused by clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows in surface water image and it would be suitable for high frequency surface water monitoring and near real time surface water mapping keywords surface water monitoring cloud contamination gap filling naive bayes classification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water plays a major role in hydrology schumacher et al 2018 biogeochemical cycle cheng and basu 2017 etc its extent is a key input for many studies such as quantifying storage acuña et al 2014 avisse et al 2017 busker et al 2019 of lakes and reservoirs flood risk reduction and disaster response sharifi 2020 wetlands monitoring ludwig et al 2019 slagter et al 2020 and water resource availability droogers et al 2012 for example the seasonal interannual variation of surface water evaporation directly affects the availability of local water which could be analyzed using its surface water area changes zhang et al 2017 in view of the large area earth observation eo that can be carried out periodically and repeatedly satellite remote sensing technology including optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar sar has surpassed traditional ground based measurement and become a widely used surface water mapping and monitoring method the potential of sar in water extraction has being explored constantly eilander et al 2014 markert et al 2018 obida et al 2019 shen et al 2019 for its all time and all weather advantages torres et al 2012 however optical remote sensing is still an important choice for water monitoring schwatke et al 2019 2020 yang et al 2020 this is due to the continuity of landsat program over the past 50 years which provides an opportunity to understand the changes of surface water over the past few decades pekel et al 2016 in addition to this optical especially multispectral or hyperspectral is often considered to be more detailed or accurate than sar as it can utilize its numerous bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and does not suffer from sar s speckling verdoliva et al 2015 shao et al 2016 however a major obstacle to extracting surface water from optical remote sensing images is the interference of clouds pekel et al 2016 shen et al 2019 the lack of spectral information of real earth surface under clouds often leads to spatial gaps in optical remote sensing based surface water products pekel et al 2016 gap filling could be an important way to generate spatially continuous water image the commonly used gap filling methods also called reconstruction in some references in remote sensing images could be divided into three categories the first is time series based zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 like time series interpolation hermosilla et al 2015 pekel et al 2016 moreno martínez et al 2020 zhao and duan 2020 and machine learning in time series zhang et al 2020 the second is reference image based melgani 2006 gevaert and garcía haro 2015 avisse et al 2017 with typical examples being spatio temporal fusion methods luo et al 2018 salcedo sanz et al 2020 the third is a combination of the previous two methods pipia et al 2019 the current studies on gap filling methods mainly focus on reconstructing the original remote sensing image zhu et al 2012 or obtaining certain surface parameters such as enhanced vegetation index evi xia et al 2010 poggio et al 2012 land surface temperature lst sun et al 2017 zhao and duan 2020 and leaf area index lai pipia et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 relatively few studies are available on surface water gap filling the presence of surface water is related to the surrounding terrain and nearby water as water naturally flows downhill and accumulates in terrain depressions in addition in the case of less human disturbance evapotranspiration changes of water tend to be relatively consistent with nearby water these means surface water pixels are closely correlated with the surrounding water pixels in recent years some gap filling methods for surface water have been proposed based on this avisse et al 2017 proposed a method to reconstruct the missing parts e g pixels covered by clouds or not captured by the landsat sensor of water in landsat images based on a statistical assumption that the elevation of frequently immersed pixels were likely lower than that of rarely immersed pixels however this method relies on updated topography data that is difficult to obtain in some areas and it may be difficult to capture some water bodies e g new reservoirs that appear after the release date of topography data partially contaminated images may contain valuable information though they reduce the accuracy of water surface extraction zhao and gao 2018 zhao and gao 2018 developed an algorithm for automatically correction of contaminated reservoir from the global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 the assumption of it is that if all uncontaminated pixels with the same water occurrence value α are classified as water the contaminated pixels with water occurrence value greater than or equal to α should also be water yao et al 2019 proposed a method to improve the temporal frequency of lakes and reservoirs water mapping which recovered the inundation areas from the contaminated image through linear interpolation between its nearest isobaths however one limitation of the above two methods zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 is that they are oriented to lakes or reservoirs as independent water types without considering the relationship with other surrounding water bodies so these methods would not work when the lakes or reservoirs are completely covered by clouds bayesian classification is a statistically effective method that can incorporate auxiliary information eilander et al 2014 introduced a bayesian classification method to delineate small reservoirs from sar imagery with a low land water contrast showing the potential of bayes method in identifying water extent in uncertain areas with auxiliary information donchyts et al 2017 proposed a method to automatically estimate surface water from multi source time series satellite image in which a simple bayesian framework was implemented to improve the classification of partially clear water to our best knowledge few studies have adopted naive bayes classification methods to fill spatial gaps caused by clouds cloud shadows terrain shadows etc in rivers lakes or reservoirs therefore we purpose a time series based method to reconstruct surface water extent under cloud cloud shadows or terrain shadows use naive bayes classification by utilizing historical cloud free surface water images and uncontaminated pixels in the partially contaminated water image compared with the methods mentioned above avisse et al 2017 zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 the method proposed considers the historical relationship between connected or disconnected water bodies and does not rely on topography data the objectives of this study are i to test the feasibility of naive bayes classification methods to fill surface water gaps to reconstruct surface water extent ii to evaluate the performance of this method for five different locations around the world 2 study area and data 2 1 study area five water body study fig 1 areas fig 2 are chosen worldwide they are boone lake in united states dartmouth reservoir in australia a segment of madre de dios river in bolivia a segment of irrawaddy river in myanmar and a segment of daning river in china a common characteristic of these study areas is that water extents change rapidly so high frequency surface water monitoring is needed some of these areas are located in cloudy and rainy mountainous areas with tropical or subtropical humid climate that are often covered by clouds all year round resulting in few cloud free images for example for the daning river only 9 cloud free landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2020 are available which is obviously not enough for seasonal water monitoring the madre de dios river in bolivia is located in tropical rainforests less affected by human disturbances while the irrawaddy river in myanmar is heavily affected by sediment loss which leads to morphological changes these study areas are selected to test the applicability of the proposed method over a wide range of geographic climatologic and topographic regions including challenging characteristics for eo derived surface water monitoring table 1 lists the size number of cloud free and contaminated landsat 8 images used as well as topographic and land use characteristic of the five study areas 2 2 landsat 8 the landsat 8 was launched on february 11 2013 with a 16 day repeat cycle and 30 m spatial resolution it carries two sensors the operational land imager oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs landsat 8 could capture about 740 image scenes per day which are approximate 60 more image scenes than landsat 7 this improved data collection ability provides near global seasonal coverage claverie et al 2018 kovalskyy and roy 2013 a landsat 8 scene size is about 185 km 180 km the landsat 8 top of atmosphere toa images acquired from mar 2013 to december 2020 which could be accessed from google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 are used in this study see table 1 for more detailed data description in each study area 2 3 validation data as no direct validation data i e surface water extent is available water levels data from satellite altimetry or in situ measurements are chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed gap filling method this is a commonly used evaluation method in other surface water gap filling studies yao et al 2019 zhao and gao 2018 the temporal resolution of in situ water level data is 1 day while the temporal resolution of water level from satellite altimetry depends on altimeter satellites used e g 27 days for sentinel 3a 10 days for jason dettmering et al 2020 schwatke et al 2015 the sources link type and relative measurement position of the water level are listed in table 2 it should be noted that since it is difficult to obtain water level data in some areas we choose the nearest water level as an alternative which is based on the fact that the adjacent connected water surfaces have similar water level 3 methods 3 1 data pre processing because there are clear separations between water and land in the landsat 8 images they can be distinguished using toa units without converting to surface reflectance or conducting other normalization operations pekel et al 2016 pickens et al 2020 so we directly utilize the landsat 8 toa data from gee in this study the 50 cloud cover threshold commonly used in other studies tulbure et al 2016 heimhuber et al 2018 is adopted to first filter landsat 8 images with cloud cover greater than it then some invalid data caused by certain artifacts in satellite borne sensors department of the interior u s geological survey 2019 and some serious water detect error caused by such as haze are removed after water detection step in this study fig 3 surface water images are detected from landsat 8 toa by using a non parametric unsupervised method donchyts et al 2016 which was based on the canny edge filter and otsu thresholding for uncontaminated images the detect results are binary images i e 1 water 0 non water for contaminated images the results are ternary images i e 1 water 0 non water 2 contamination pixels in which the contamination refers to cloud cloud shadow or terrain shadow here the contaminated pixels mask is created manually based on the following two considerations one is that although there are already a number of automatic cloud mask algorithms frey et al 2008 foga et al 2017 such as cfmask foga et al 2017 these all suffer from certain issues e g difficulties to recognize the shadows cast by clouds on adjacent scenes another is that terrain shadow can be masked as contaminated pixels using a manual method the binary image time series and the contaminated ternary image are then taken as inputs of the proposed gap filling method the former is used as training data to calculate water prior probability p y w a t e r and p x i y in the naive bayes classification method introduced in section 3 2 a gap filled image time series could be obtained after all the ternary contaminated images are reconstructed one by one 3 2 naive bayes classification bayesian classification methods can deal with multivariate data in a statistical way and allow additional information to be added to classification rules by assigning a pixel to the class with the largest member probability according to a posteriori probability the basic formula of bayesian classification is equation 1 equation 2 is the implementation of equation 1 in this study in which y denotes the gap pixel s category i e water or non water and x denotes clear pixels in a contaminated image 1 p y x p y p x y p x 2 p w a t e r c l e a r p i x e l s i n c o n t a min a t e d i m a g e p w a t e r p c l e a r p i x e l s i n c o n t a min a t e d i m a g e w a t e r p c l e a r p i x e l s i n c o n t a min a t e d i m a g e where p y x is the posterior probability of a pixel belonging to y class given feature vector x in this study y y 0 y 1 0 means non water and 1 means water p x y is a likelihood function and refers to the probability of occurrence of feature x when a gap pixel is classified as water or non water p y is the prior probability and p x is the marginal probability we take the uncontaminated pixels in the contaminated water image as feature vectors also called evidence x x x 1 x 2 x n which also means that the historical correspondence within connected or disconnected water are considered in this case a bayesian classification could be expressed as equation 3 3 p y x p y p x 1 x 2 x 3 x n y p x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where the features of x 1 x 2 x 3 x n refer to the value 0 or 1 of uncontaminated pixels in the contaminated water image and n is the number of selected uncontaminated pixels when features are independent that is the presence of one particular feature does not affect another then the method is a naive bayes resulting in equation 4 4 p y x p y p x 1 y p x 2 y p x 3 y p x n y p x 1 p x 2 p x 3 p x n since denominators are same for both categories i e water and non water the posterior probability is proportional to the numerator as shown in equation 5 the prior probability of y is calculated with equation 6 and the conditional probability of the feature could be calculated with equation 7 5 p y x p y i 0 n p x i y 6 p y c o u n t y n 7 p x i y c o u n t x i y c o u n t y where n is the number of historical cloud free images used and c o u n t y is the number of times that a gap pixel is classified as water or non water in all historical cloud free water images while c o u n t x i y refers to the number of times that feature x i is water or non water in all historical cloud free water images given that a gap pixel is water or non water for a given category i e water and non water of y the conditional probability of a certain feature may be zero due to limitations of samples here are historical cloud free images sample errors errors in evidence factors etc after multiplication the right side in equation 5 will be zero when such features appear in both categories the obtained posterior probabilities of both categories will be zero i e p y 1 x p y 0 x 0 then it is impossible to conduct classification therefore we modified the conditional probability in equation 7 and expressed it by equation 8 8 p c x i y 1 n p x i y 0 p x i y p x i y 0 to reduce redundant calculations features x i with same value of p x i y for different y categories are filtered and then the following is to find the y category which could get the maximum as in equation 9 9 y arg max y p y i 0 n p c x i y e x c l u d e i w h e r e p x i y 1 p x i y 0 there are a large number of features so the multiplication calculation may result in infinitesimal values therefore logarithm is introduced to transform the calculation into an addition form as in equation 10 10 p y x ln p y i 0 n p c x i y ln p y i 0 n ln p c x i y thus the final task is changed to find the category that could get the maximum value as in equation 11 11 y arg max y ln p y i 0 n ln p c x i y 3 3 surface water gap filling in contaminated areas based on the above naive bayes classification method we could reconstruct those pixels covered by clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows thus gaps in a water image will be filled in this method historical cloud free binary images water and non water extracted based on landsat 8 are used as training data and those uncontaminated pixels in contaminated ternary water image water non water and contaminated pixels are used as auxiliary information to update prior probability there are mainly four steps in the proposed gap filling method fig 4 the first step is to calculate water prior probability p y 1 of each pixel based on historical cloud free binary water images the water prior probability reflects the occurrence of water the second step is to assign the category of water to gap pixels with a water prior probability equal to 1 and the category of non water to gap pixels with a water prior probability equal to 0 the third step is to select key features for surface water in somewhere usually has a specific change relationship with its surrounding water those clear pixels with water probability between 0 and 1 that is water fluctuation area in a contaminated image could provide useful information to determine the category of a gap pixel therefore we choose these pixels as the key features the fourth step is to perform naive bayes classification method on those gap pixels with a prior probability between 0 and 1 fig 5 illustrates an example of the gap filling process fig 5a is the original landsat 8 toa image acquired on july 02 2014 where some parts of water are covered by clouds and cloud shadows masked as rose red areas in fig 5b after removing those pixels with prior probability equal to 1 or 0 from all pixels in clouds or cloud shadows gap those black points in fig 5b are gap pixels that need to be classified using naive bayes classification method fig 5c displays the final classification result i e the gap filled image fig 5d is the water prior probability calculated based on historical cloud free binary water images the orange area in fig 5e is the key features pixels of one gap pixel the black point in fig 5e 3 4 accuracy assessment confusion matrix is adopted to measure the classification accuracy which contains four values true positive tp false positive fp true negative tn and false negative fn olson and delen 2008 as shown in table 3 three indicators of accuracy recall and precision are introduced to quantitatively evaluate classification performance of the method it is often difficult to obtain accurate water extent as reference at the same date with the contaminated image here we evaluate the effect of gap filling through the following method firstly clouds are added to the cloud free water images manually and randomly and then proposed gap filling method is implemented finally the gap filled results and the original cloud free water images are used to calculate the confusion matrix this evaluation method is conducted on each cloud free water images the indicator of accuracy refers to the proportion of the number of correctly classified pixels tp tn to the total number of pixels tp tn fp fn and its calculation is shown in equation 12 12 accuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n the indicator of recall is the proportion of the number of pixels correctly classified as water tp to the total number of pixels representing water in a cloud free image tp fn it implies that of all real water i e water in the original cloud free image how much is correctly identified 13 recall tp tp f n the indicator of precision refers to the proportion of the number of pixels correctly classified as water tp to the total number of pixels classified as water in a classified image tp fp it means that in all classified water how much is real water 14 precision tp tp f p water level data is often used to evaluate the accuracy of water gap filling for there are usually synchronous or coordinated changes between water level and water area over time schwatke et al 2019 zhao and gao 2018 considering that water level data are not always available on the date when the contaminated images are acquired a linear interpolation algorithm will be implemented when needed 4 results 4 1 gap filled results and correlation analysis with water levels fig 6 shows the water area time series from gap filled water images blue points and original water image detected from landsat 8 toa images with no contamination mask gray points in boone lake where there is a climate of temperate without dry season and has hot summer beck et al 2018 the water level sequence of the lake is shown with red points in fig 6a the cloud cover cc of each water image is also plotted in fig 6a to further evaluate the proposed method we draw scatter plots between the water area time series before and after gap filling with water level time series and then calculate their coefficient of determination r 2 respectively the water level time series used here is in situ data the r 2 improves a little after gap filling 0 009 vs 0 013 and there is no obvious correlation between water area and water level in the scatter plot whether before or after gap filling one possible reason is that in 2015 the authorities lowered the water level due to potential safety consideration for there was hazard found at boone dam in 2014 gilbert et al 2017 the continuous low water level has caused serious environmental problems and garbage accumulation in the lake we speculate that the connectivity of the boone lake may be reduced as a result which leads to a reduction of the correlation between water surface area and water level the original images and gap filled water images on august 16 2013 and march 28 2020 with very different water area are shown in fig 6c and d respectively in the image acquired on august 16 2013 water under cloud and haze could not be identified resulting in an underestimation of water extent from the original landsat 8 toa image see the gap filled results from gee app at https 1021403057 users earthengine app view resultsshow while the water area in the gap filled image is closer to its real situation by visual interpretation in the image acquired on march 28 2020 for cloud shadows have similar spectral characteristics to water they are also identified as water which will cause an overestimation of the water extent the water area after filling is more accurate by checking its consistency with the before and after water area in the time series and the coordination with the water level series for the study area in dartmouth reservoir we present similar figures as in fig 7 the dartmouth reservoir is located in a cloudy mountainous region with a climate of temperate without dry season warm summer beck et al 2018 since the main function of this reservoir is for drought reserve watts et al 2010 its surface water level does not show regular seasonal changes the water area time series after gap filling has a strong linear relationship with the in situ water level time series which can be seen from fig 7a and the scatter plot fig 7b the coefficient of determination r 2 after gap filling is as high as 0 957 fig 7c and fig 7d display the original and gap filled images on may 19 2016 and march 19 2017 respectively water levels on the two dates are very different and there are serious effects from clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows it is easily to overestimate the water area from the landsat 8 image on may 19 2016 due to the presence of terrain shadows while to underestimate the water area from the landsat 8image on march 19 2017 due to the clouds the water area after gap filling is more accurate than that on both dates it is worth noting that the water level has a big change between the two date points fig 7a and the gap filled results restore this change trend for the other three study areas similar figures are plotted in figs 8 10 respectively fig 8 shows the water area time series in a segment of the madre de dio river this part is less disturbed by human activities and with a tropical savannah climate beck et al 2018 and its water levels exhibits regular seasonal variations most lakes and reservoirs usually present a good linear relationship between water area and water level busker et al 2019 but in some regions a polynomial relationship is a better fit li et al 2020 schwatke et al 2019 here the water levels and water area show a fairly good polynomial fitting the r 2 after gap filling increases from 0 795 to 0 856 it is worth noting that the water level in this segment is obtained by sentinel 3a which has a temporal resolution of 27 days while the temporal resolution of the landsat 8 is 16 days so the water level data for correlation analysis fig 8b is results of linear interpolation at the water image acquisition dates data on september 02 2016 and october 29 2019 are selected to demonstrate their gap filling results due to the clouds the water results detected from landsat 8 images are both underestimated while water area after gap filling are more reasonable as they show good consistency with the long term changes of water level as to the irrawaddy river area it has a temperate dry winter hot summer climate beck et al 2018 and shows a seasonal variation in water level the water area and water level in this region has a good linear relationship after gap filling with the r 2 increasing from 0 847 to 0 864 however since there are relatively little water level data only available from 2019 in this region the correlation coefficients are not representative for correlation analysis fig 9c and fig 9d show original landsat 8 toa images and gap filled results on december 18 2015 and december 29 2019 respectively the original image on december 29 2019 is heavily contaminated by clouds and it is probably to underestimate surface water from fig 9d it could be seen that the shape of the river has been reconstructed well according to the change trend of water surface area time series the water surface is more accurate after gap filling in addition in fig 9d some scattered water completely blocked by clouds and disconnected from the mainstream have also been also reconstructed which cannot be realized by the method proposed by yao et al 2019 this is because the feature selection is carried out in the whole region so the relationships within connected water or within disconnected water are considered the last study area is a segment of daning river which belongs to the three gorges reservoir and locates in a mountainous region and climate there is temperate without dry season hot summer beck et al 2018 after gap filling the water level and water area present a very good linear relationship with the r 2 increasing from 0 437 to 0 944 similarly data at two date points are displayed to demonstrate their reconstruction effects fig 10c and d due to heavy contamination from thin or thick clouds it is very difficult to extract water shown by the red line in fig 10c and d from landsat 8 images while reconstructed water present fairly good accuracy from above consistency analysis between gap filled water area time series and water level data in five study areas it proves that effects from clouds cloud shadows or terrain shadows could be corrected fairly well and in all the five study areas the water area time series after gap filling show stronger correlation with the water levels than before gap filling 4 2 accuracy assessment quantitative evaluation results are shown in fig 11 all the five study areas have a high overall accuracy of over 90 and the median precision and recall in the five regions are also above 85 the reason for the lower recalls and precisions compared to the overall accuracy is due to the imbalance of the samples in water and non water and we could see that water occupies only a small portion in all study areas and most filled areas are recognized as non water results indicate that the gap filling accuracy in boone lake daning river and dartmouth reservoirs scenarios is higher while for the irrawaddy river and madre de dios river the accuracy is lower this may be due to the uniqueness of the water surface extent caused by the existence of river sediment loss in addition because the evaluation is carried out on gap pixels here referred to as cloud pixels the distribution of clouds will affect the assessment results for example if clouds exist only in non water locations it may cause a water recall of 0 5 discussion the proposed gap filling method performs well in rivers lakes or reservoirs especially in lakes or reservoirs this may be due to the relatively stable terrain around lakes and reservoirs while the topographic environments of rivers are relatively unstable due to some man made or natural elements such as sediment delivery robinson et al 2007 river constantly scouring or river diversion schulenberg et al 2007 in this situation the features used in the proposed method cannot correct the prior probability the proposed method also performs well on images heavily contaminated by clouds cloud shadows or terrain shadows e g figs 7d and 10d this is because the gap filling accuracy is related to location rather than percentage of contamination see fig s1 in the supplementary materials we plot the gap filling accuracy with the total cloud percentage and the cloud percentage with a prior probability of water between 0 and 1 by excluding cloud areas where p y 1 equals 0 or 1 in each gap filled image it can be seen that there is little relationship between gap filling accuracy and cloud percentage generally speaking as long as there exist key features clear pixels with water probability between 0 and 1 in a contaminated image prior probability will work when there are enough key features the predicted probability will very close to real probability if key features are blocked by cloud or cloud shadow masking the accuracy of filling results will also be reduced while it can be improved by expanding the spatial range for feature selection for some situations that the water shape has a low probability the proposed method can also reconstruct the shape accurately take the boone lake outlined with highlighted yellow ellipse in fig 12 as an example if only based on the water prior probability there is a high probability that its shape is narrow however after implementing the proposed method a wider water body is reconstructed the images acquired at the closest date to the example image july 2 2014 from other sensors e g landsat mission sentinel 2 could be used for verification in this case two landsat 7 images acquired on june 24 2014 and july 10 2014 are selected the outlined water body in these two landsat 7 images both shows a wide shape which strengthens the confidence that it also exhibits a wide shape in the gap date this demonstrates that with additional information the proposed method has more advantages than those methods which only depend on the water prior probability accurate water detection and contaminated pixels mask are premises of the gap filling algorithm as they are inputs if classification error occurred in pixels which belong to the key features in the gap image the error will be transmitted to the reconstruction result through p x i y errors in historical cloud free images will reduce the accuracy of the reconstructed results by affecting p y and p x i y so in regions where water surface monitoring is difficult such as in mountainous areas if mountain shadows or other contaminated pixels cannot be accurately masked the accuracy of water gap filling may be poor since water or cloud detection algorithms are not the focus of this paper manual masking is taken to ensure a high accuracy of input data to make the gap filling process more automatic a possible solution is to buffer the cloud mask which could reduce water omission errors that often occur the cloud water junction while may sacrifice some useful information some water bodies especially those in regions less disturbed by human activities often have the characteristics of seasonal changes the non stability of historical cloud free image which mainly affected by seasonal clouds will also affect the accuracy of gap filling if the historical cloud free data are concentrated in winter the uncertainty of gap filling water bodies in summer will increase in this paper all cloud free historical water images are selected as the training data of naive bayes classification if consider historical cloud free water images with the same season as training data it can be expected that this will improve the accuracy of water gap filling there are still some limitations in the proposed gap filling method one is that it only takes the uncontaminated pixels in the contaminated image as features and uses historical cloud free binary water images as empirical data so it could reconstruct water that once exists in the historical image time series however it is difficult to reconstruct the water that never exists in historical water image time series for example if one gap pixel has never been identified as water in time series the gap pixel will not be classified as water no matter what the uncontaminated information is in view of this for regions with less correlation in water and surrounding water pixels such as paddy field region with more human interference this region also has the challenge of accurate water detect applying this method may be challenging another limitation is that the feature selection is based on entire study area which is computationally intensive and will limit its application to a large area pixel by pixel spatial neighborhood operation could be considered in the future in addition one of the input data is historical cloud free water images which are easy to obtain in small regions while when it goes to a large extent cloud free images may be difficult to obtain in this case block computing or introducing other sensors such as sentinel 1 which can penetrate clouds is a solution besides landsat 8 images the proposed method can also be used to other optical remote sensing images such as landsat 7 and sentinel 2 meanwhile it applies not only for the gaps caused by clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows but also for the gaps induced by ice snow as well as for stripes that exist in landsat 7 scan line corrector slc off images when dealing with water extraction this method is suitable for high frequency surface water monitoring by utilizing the proposed method the cloud contaminated optical images can be used effectively which will help to increase the temporal resolution of surface water extent monitoring in a sense this method can help near real time surface water monitoring as it can quickly generate relatively complete surface water extents after an optical image becomes available this is important for flood detection and better understanding of the land hydrological processes 6 conclusions the proposed surface water gap filling method is based on naive bayes classification it uses historical cloud free binary water images and clear pixels in the partly contaminated water image to reconstruct the pixels which are contaminated by clouds cloud shadows terrain shadows etc this method makes use of the historical correspondence within connected or unconnected water which means that it can work when a single water body such as small ponds is completely covered evaluation results show that the proposed method performs well in rivers reservoirs or lakes especially in lake or reservoirs where there are small terrain variations this gap filling method can also be applied to fill gaps in water image caused by ice snow as well as the landsat 7 slc off it could contribute to high frequency water surface mapping and monitoring of reservoirs and lakes it does not rely on terrain data and can enrich the water gap filling community credit authorship contribution statement bingxin bai developed the algorithm designed the experiments gennadii donchyts

2583,optical remote sensing images are a common data sources for surface water monitoring while they are easily contaminated by clouds cloud shadows terrain shadows etc resulting in spatial gaps in surface water images this paper proposes a surface water gap filling method based on naive bayes classification it uses the historical cloud free binary water non water surface water images as prior data and the uncontaminated pixels in the partially contaminated ternary water non water contaminated pixels surface water image as evidence to identify the category of gap pixels to achieve the purpose of gap filling this method considers the relationship between disconnected water bodies and does not depend on terrain data when the image is heavily covered by clouds this method can also reconstruct the complete water extent accurately five study areas with different scenarios including rivers lakes or reservoirs are selected to evaluate the method results show that the average gap filling accuracy in all five study areas is over 90 after gap filling the time series of surface water area presents a good correlation with the time series of water level e g the coefficient of determination r 2 0 95 in the dartmouth reservoir the proposed method is proved effective in filling gaps caused by clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows in surface water image and it would be suitable for high frequency surface water monitoring and near real time surface water mapping keywords surface water monitoring cloud contamination gap filling naive bayes classification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water plays a major role in hydrology schumacher et al 2018 biogeochemical cycle cheng and basu 2017 etc its extent is a key input for many studies such as quantifying storage acuña et al 2014 avisse et al 2017 busker et al 2019 of lakes and reservoirs flood risk reduction and disaster response sharifi 2020 wetlands monitoring ludwig et al 2019 slagter et al 2020 and water resource availability droogers et al 2012 for example the seasonal interannual variation of surface water evaporation directly affects the availability of local water which could be analyzed using its surface water area changes zhang et al 2017 in view of the large area earth observation eo that can be carried out periodically and repeatedly satellite remote sensing technology including optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar sar has surpassed traditional ground based measurement and become a widely used surface water mapping and monitoring method the potential of sar in water extraction has being explored constantly eilander et al 2014 markert et al 2018 obida et al 2019 shen et al 2019 for its all time and all weather advantages torres et al 2012 however optical remote sensing is still an important choice for water monitoring schwatke et al 2019 2020 yang et al 2020 this is due to the continuity of landsat program over the past 50 years which provides an opportunity to understand the changes of surface water over the past few decades pekel et al 2016 in addition to this optical especially multispectral or hyperspectral is often considered to be more detailed or accurate than sar as it can utilize its numerous bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and does not suffer from sar s speckling verdoliva et al 2015 shao et al 2016 however a major obstacle to extracting surface water from optical remote sensing images is the interference of clouds pekel et al 2016 shen et al 2019 the lack of spectral information of real earth surface under clouds often leads to spatial gaps in optical remote sensing based surface water products pekel et al 2016 gap filling could be an important way to generate spatially continuous water image the commonly used gap filling methods also called reconstruction in some references in remote sensing images could be divided into three categories the first is time series based zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 like time series interpolation hermosilla et al 2015 pekel et al 2016 moreno martínez et al 2020 zhao and duan 2020 and machine learning in time series zhang et al 2020 the second is reference image based melgani 2006 gevaert and garcía haro 2015 avisse et al 2017 with typical examples being spatio temporal fusion methods luo et al 2018 salcedo sanz et al 2020 the third is a combination of the previous two methods pipia et al 2019 the current studies on gap filling methods mainly focus on reconstructing the original remote sensing image zhu et al 2012 or obtaining certain surface parameters such as enhanced vegetation index evi xia et al 2010 poggio et al 2012 land surface temperature lst sun et al 2017 zhao and duan 2020 and leaf area index lai pipia et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 relatively few studies are available on surface water gap filling the presence of surface water is related to the surrounding terrain and nearby water as water naturally flows downhill and accumulates in terrain depressions in addition in the case of less human disturbance evapotranspiration changes of water tend to be relatively consistent with nearby water these means surface water pixels are closely correlated with the surrounding water pixels in recent years some gap filling methods for surface water have been proposed based on this avisse et al 2017 proposed a method to reconstruct the missing parts e g pixels covered by clouds or not captured by the landsat sensor of water in landsat images based on a statistical assumption that the elevation of frequently immersed pixels were likely lower than that of rarely immersed pixels however this method relies on updated topography data that is difficult to obtain in some areas and it may be difficult to capture some water bodies e g new reservoirs that appear after the release date of topography data partially contaminated images may contain valuable information though they reduce the accuracy of water surface extraction zhao and gao 2018 zhao and gao 2018 developed an algorithm for automatically correction of contaminated reservoir from the global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 the assumption of it is that if all uncontaminated pixels with the same water occurrence value α are classified as water the contaminated pixels with water occurrence value greater than or equal to α should also be water yao et al 2019 proposed a method to improve the temporal frequency of lakes and reservoirs water mapping which recovered the inundation areas from the contaminated image through linear interpolation between its nearest isobaths however one limitation of the above two methods zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 is that they are oriented to lakes or reservoirs as independent water types without considering the relationship with other surrounding water bodies so these methods would not work when the lakes or reservoirs are completely covered by clouds bayesian classification is a statistically effective method that can incorporate auxiliary information eilander et al 2014 introduced a bayesian classification method to delineate small reservoirs from sar imagery with a low land water contrast showing the potential of bayes method in identifying water extent in uncertain areas with auxiliary information donchyts et al 2017 proposed a method to automatically estimate surface water from multi source time series satellite image in which a simple bayesian framework was implemented to improve the classification of partially clear water to our best knowledge few studies have adopted naive bayes classification methods to fill spatial gaps caused by clouds cloud shadows terrain shadows etc in rivers lakes or reservoirs therefore we purpose a time series based method to reconstruct surface water extent under cloud cloud shadows or terrain shadows use naive bayes classification by utilizing historical cloud free surface water images and uncontaminated pixels in the partially contaminated water image compared with the methods mentioned above avisse et al 2017 zhao and gao 2018 yao et al 2019 the method proposed considers the historical relationship between connected or disconnected water bodies and does not rely on topography data the objectives of this study are i to test the feasibility of naive bayes classification methods to fill surface water gaps to reconstruct surface water extent ii to evaluate the performance of this method for five different locations around the world 2 study area and data 2 1 study area five water body study fig 1 areas fig 2 are chosen worldwide they are boone lake in united states dartmouth reservoir in australia a segment of madre de dios river in bolivia a segment of irrawaddy river in myanmar and a segment of daning river in china a common characteristic of these study areas is that water extents change rapidly so high frequency surface water monitoring is needed some of these areas are located in cloudy and rainy mountainous areas with tropical or subtropical humid climate that are often covered by clouds all year round resulting in few cloud free images for example for the daning river only 9 cloud free landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2020 are available which is obviously not enough for seasonal water monitoring the madre de dios river in bolivia is located in tropical rainforests less affected by human disturbances while the irrawaddy river in myanmar is heavily affected by sediment loss which leads to morphological changes these study areas are selected to test the applicability of the proposed method over a wide range of geographic climatologic and topographic regions including challenging characteristics for eo derived surface water monitoring table 1 lists the size number of cloud free and contaminated landsat 8 images used as well as topographic and land use characteristic of the five study areas 2 2 landsat 8 the landsat 8 was launched on february 11 2013 with a 16 day repeat cycle and 30 m spatial resolution it carries two sensors the operational land imager oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs landsat 8 could capture about 740 image scenes per day which are approximate 60 more image scenes than landsat 7 this improved data collection ability provides near global seasonal coverage claverie et al 2018 kovalskyy and roy 2013 a landsat 8 scene size is about 185 km 180 km the landsat 8 top of atmosphere toa images acquired from mar 2013 to december 2020 which could be accessed from google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 are used in this study see table 1 for more detailed data description in each study area 2 3 validation data as no direct validation data i e surface water extent is available water levels data from satellite altimetry or in situ measurements are chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed gap filling method this is a commonly used evaluation method in other surface water gap filling studies yao et al 2019 zhao and gao 2018 the temporal resolution of in situ water level data is 1 day while the temporal resolution of water level from satellite altimetry depends on altimeter satellites used e g 27 days for sentinel 3a 10 days for jason dettmering et al 2020 schwatke et al 2015 the sources link type and relative measurement position of the water level are listed in table 2 it should be noted that since it is difficult to obtain water level data in some areas we choose the nearest water level as an alternative which is based on the fact that the adjacent connected water surfaces have similar water level 3 methods 3 1 data pre processing because there are clear separations between water and land in the landsat 8 images they can be distinguished using toa units without converting to surface reflectance or conducting other normalization operations pekel et al 2016 pickens et al 2020 so we directly utilize the landsat 8 toa data from gee in this study the 50 cloud cover threshold commonly used in other studies tulbure et al 2016 heimhuber et al 2018 is adopted to first filter landsat 8 images with cloud cover greater than it then some invalid data caused by certain artifacts in satellite borne sensors department of the interior u s geological survey 2019 and some serious water detect error caused by such as haze are removed after water detection step in this study fig 3 surface water images are detected from landsat 8 toa by using a non parametric unsupervised method donchyts et al 2016 which was based on the canny edge filter and otsu thresholding for uncontaminated images the detect results are binary images i e 1 water 0 non water for contaminated images the results are ternary images i e 1 water 0 non water 2 contamination pixels in which the contamination refers to cloud cloud shadow or terrain shadow here the contaminated pixels mask is created manually based on the following two considerations one is that although there are already a number of automatic cloud mask algorithms frey et al 2008 foga et al 2017 such as cfmask foga et al 2017 these all suffer from certain issues e g difficulties to recognize the shadows cast by clouds on adjacent scenes another is that terrain shadow can be masked as contaminated pixels using a manual method the binary image time series and the contaminated ternary image are then taken as inputs of the proposed gap filling method the former is used as training data to calculate water prior probability p y w a t e r and p x i y in the naive bayes classification method introduced in section 3 2 a gap filled image time series could be obtained after all the ternary contaminated images are reconstructed one by one 3 2 naive bayes classification bayesian classification methods can deal with multivariate data in a statistical way and allow additional information to be added to classification rules by assigning a pixel to the class with the largest member probability according to a posteriori probability the basic formula of bayesian classification is equation 1 equation 2 is the implementation of equation 1 in this study in which y denotes the gap pixel s category i e water or non water and x denotes clear pixels in a contaminated image 1 p y x p y p x y p x 2 p w a t e r c l e a r p i x e l s i n c o n t a min a t e d i m a g e p w a t e r p c l e a r p i x e l s i n c o n t a min a t e d i m a g e w a t e r p c l e a r p i x e l s i n c o n t a min a t e d i m a g e where p y x is the posterior probability of a pixel belonging to y class given feature vector x in this study y y 0 y 1 0 means non water and 1 means water p x y is a likelihood function and refers to the probability of occurrence of feature x when a gap pixel is classified as water or non water p y is the prior probability and p x is the marginal probability we take the uncontaminated pixels in the contaminated water image as feature vectors also called evidence x x x 1 x 2 x n which also means that the historical correspondence within connected or disconnected water are considered in this case a bayesian classification could be expressed as equation 3 3 p y x p y p x 1 x 2 x 3 x n y p x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where the features of x 1 x 2 x 3 x n refer to the value 0 or 1 of uncontaminated pixels in the contaminated water image and n is the number of selected uncontaminated pixels when features are independent that is the presence of one particular feature does not affect another then the method is a naive bayes resulting in equation 4 4 p y x p y p x 1 y p x 2 y p x 3 y p x n y p x 1 p x 2 p x 3 p x n since denominators are same for both categories i e water and non water the posterior probability is proportional to the numerator as shown in equation 5 the prior probability of y is calculated with equation 6 and the conditional probability of the feature could be calculated with equation 7 5 p y x p y i 0 n p x i y 6 p y c o u n t y n 7 p x i y c o u n t x i y c o u n t y where n is the number of historical cloud free images used and c o u n t y is the number of times that a gap pixel is classified as water or non water in all historical cloud free water images while c o u n t x i y refers to the number of times that feature x i is water or non water in all historical cloud free water images given that a gap pixel is water or non water for a given category i e water and non water of y the conditional probability of a certain feature may be zero due to limitations of samples here are historical cloud free images sample errors errors in evidence factors etc after multiplication the right side in equation 5 will be zero when such features appear in both categories the obtained posterior probabilities of both categories will be zero i e p y 1 x p y 0 x 0 then it is impossible to conduct classification therefore we modified the conditional probability in equation 7 and expressed it by equation 8 8 p c x i y 1 n p x i y 0 p x i y p x i y 0 to reduce redundant calculations features x i with same value of p x i y for different y categories are filtered and then the following is to find the y category which could get the maximum as in equation 9 9 y arg max y p y i 0 n p c x i y e x c l u d e i w h e r e p x i y 1 p x i y 0 there are a large number of features so the multiplication calculation may result in infinitesimal values therefore logarithm is introduced to transform the calculation into an addition form as in equation 10 10 p y x ln p y i 0 n p c x i y ln p y i 0 n ln p c x i y thus the final task is changed to find the category that could get the maximum value as in equation 11 11 y arg max y ln p y i 0 n ln p c x i y 3 3 surface water gap filling in contaminated areas based on the above naive bayes classification method we could reconstruct those pixels covered by clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows thus gaps in a water image will be filled in this method historical cloud free binary images water and non water extracted based on landsat 8 are used as training data and those uncontaminated pixels in contaminated ternary water image water non water and contaminated pixels are used as auxiliary information to update prior probability there are mainly four steps in the proposed gap filling method fig 4 the first step is to calculate water prior probability p y 1 of each pixel based on historical cloud free binary water images the water prior probability reflects the occurrence of water the second step is to assign the category of water to gap pixels with a water prior probability equal to 1 and the category of non water to gap pixels with a water prior probability equal to 0 the third step is to select key features for surface water in somewhere usually has a specific change relationship with its surrounding water those clear pixels with water probability between 0 and 1 that is water fluctuation area in a contaminated image could provide useful information to determine the category of a gap pixel therefore we choose these pixels as the key features the fourth step is to perform naive bayes classification method on those gap pixels with a prior probability between 0 and 1 fig 5 illustrates an example of the gap filling process fig 5a is the original landsat 8 toa image acquired on july 02 2014 where some parts of water are covered by clouds and cloud shadows masked as rose red areas in fig 5b after removing those pixels with prior probability equal to 1 or 0 from all pixels in clouds or cloud shadows gap those black points in fig 5b are gap pixels that need to be classified using naive bayes classification method fig 5c displays the final classification result i e the gap filled image fig 5d is the water prior probability calculated based on historical cloud free binary water images the orange area in fig 5e is the key features pixels of one gap pixel the black point in fig 5e 3 4 accuracy assessment confusion matrix is adopted to measure the classification accuracy which contains four values true positive tp false positive fp true negative tn and false negative fn olson and delen 2008 as shown in table 3 three indicators of accuracy recall and precision are introduced to quantitatively evaluate classification performance of the method it is often difficult to obtain accurate water extent as reference at the same date with the contaminated image here we evaluate the effect of gap filling through the following method firstly clouds are added to the cloud free water images manually and randomly and then proposed gap filling method is implemented finally the gap filled results and the original cloud free water images are used to calculate the confusion matrix this evaluation method is conducted on each cloud free water images the indicator of accuracy refers to the proportion of the number of correctly classified pixels tp tn to the total number of pixels tp tn fp fn and its calculation is shown in equation 12 12 accuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n the indicator of recall is the proportion of the number of pixels correctly classified as water tp to the total number of pixels representing water in a cloud free image tp fn it implies that of all real water i e water in the original cloud free image how much is correctly identified 13 recall tp tp f n the indicator of precision refers to the proportion of the number of pixels correctly classified as water tp to the total number of pixels classified as water in a classified image tp fp it means that in all classified water how much is real water 14 precision tp tp f p water level data is often used to evaluate the accuracy of water gap filling for there are usually synchronous or coordinated changes between water level and water area over time schwatke et al 2019 zhao and gao 2018 considering that water level data are not always available on the date when the contaminated images are acquired a linear interpolation algorithm will be implemented when needed 4 results 4 1 gap filled results and correlation analysis with water levels fig 6 shows the water area time series from gap filled water images blue points and original water image detected from landsat 8 toa images with no contamination mask gray points in boone lake where there is a climate of temperate without dry season and has hot summer beck et al 2018 the water level sequence of the lake is shown with red points in fig 6a the cloud cover cc of each water image is also plotted in fig 6a to further evaluate the proposed method we draw scatter plots between the water area time series before and after gap filling with water level time series and then calculate their coefficient of determination r 2 respectively the water level time series used here is in situ data the r 2 improves a little after gap filling 0 009 vs 0 013 and there is no obvious correlation between water area and water level in the scatter plot whether before or after gap filling one possible reason is that in 2015 the authorities lowered the water level due to potential safety consideration for there was hazard found at boone dam in 2014 gilbert et al 2017 the continuous low water level has caused serious environmental problems and garbage accumulation in the lake we speculate that the connectivity of the boone lake may be reduced as a result which leads to a reduction of the correlation between water surface area and water level the original images and gap filled water images on august 16 2013 and march 28 2020 with very different water area are shown in fig 6c and d respectively in the image acquired on august 16 2013 water under cloud and haze could not be identified resulting in an underestimation of water extent from the original landsat 8 toa image see the gap filled results from gee app at https 1021403057 users earthengine app view resultsshow while the water area in the gap filled image is closer to its real situation by visual interpretation in the image acquired on march 28 2020 for cloud shadows have similar spectral characteristics to water they are also identified as water which will cause an overestimation of the water extent the water area after filling is more accurate by checking its consistency with the before and after water area in the time series and the coordination with the water level series for the study area in dartmouth reservoir we present similar figures as in fig 7 the dartmouth reservoir is located in a cloudy mountainous region with a climate of temperate without dry season warm summer beck et al 2018 since the main function of this reservoir is for drought reserve watts et al 2010 its surface water level does not show regular seasonal changes the water area time series after gap filling has a strong linear relationship with the in situ water level time series which can be seen from fig 7a and the scatter plot fig 7b the coefficient of determination r 2 after gap filling is as high as 0 957 fig 7c and fig 7d display the original and gap filled images on may 19 2016 and march 19 2017 respectively water levels on the two dates are very different and there are serious effects from clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows it is easily to overestimate the water area from the landsat 8 image on may 19 2016 due to the presence of terrain shadows while to underestimate the water area from the landsat 8image on march 19 2017 due to the clouds the water area after gap filling is more accurate than that on both dates it is worth noting that the water level has a big change between the two date points fig 7a and the gap filled results restore this change trend for the other three study areas similar figures are plotted in figs 8 10 respectively fig 8 shows the water area time series in a segment of the madre de dio river this part is less disturbed by human activities and with a tropical savannah climate beck et al 2018 and its water levels exhibits regular seasonal variations most lakes and reservoirs usually present a good linear relationship between water area and water level busker et al 2019 but in some regions a polynomial relationship is a better fit li et al 2020 schwatke et al 2019 here the water levels and water area show a fairly good polynomial fitting the r 2 after gap filling increases from 0 795 to 0 856 it is worth noting that the water level in this segment is obtained by sentinel 3a which has a temporal resolution of 27 days while the temporal resolution of the landsat 8 is 16 days so the water level data for correlation analysis fig 8b is results of linear interpolation at the water image acquisition dates data on september 02 2016 and october 29 2019 are selected to demonstrate their gap filling results due to the clouds the water results detected from landsat 8 images are both underestimated while water area after gap filling are more reasonable as they show good consistency with the long term changes of water level as to the irrawaddy river area it has a temperate dry winter hot summer climate beck et al 2018 and shows a seasonal variation in water level the water area and water level in this region has a good linear relationship after gap filling with the r 2 increasing from 0 847 to 0 864 however since there are relatively little water level data only available from 2019 in this region the correlation coefficients are not representative for correlation analysis fig 9c and fig 9d show original landsat 8 toa images and gap filled results on december 18 2015 and december 29 2019 respectively the original image on december 29 2019 is heavily contaminated by clouds and it is probably to underestimate surface water from fig 9d it could be seen that the shape of the river has been reconstructed well according to the change trend of water surface area time series the water surface is more accurate after gap filling in addition in fig 9d some scattered water completely blocked by clouds and disconnected from the mainstream have also been also reconstructed which cannot be realized by the method proposed by yao et al 2019 this is because the feature selection is carried out in the whole region so the relationships within connected water or within disconnected water are considered the last study area is a segment of daning river which belongs to the three gorges reservoir and locates in a mountainous region and climate there is temperate without dry season hot summer beck et al 2018 after gap filling the water level and water area present a very good linear relationship with the r 2 increasing from 0 437 to 0 944 similarly data at two date points are displayed to demonstrate their reconstruction effects fig 10c and d due to heavy contamination from thin or thick clouds it is very difficult to extract water shown by the red line in fig 10c and d from landsat 8 images while reconstructed water present fairly good accuracy from above consistency analysis between gap filled water area time series and water level data in five study areas it proves that effects from clouds cloud shadows or terrain shadows could be corrected fairly well and in all the five study areas the water area time series after gap filling show stronger correlation with the water levels than before gap filling 4 2 accuracy assessment quantitative evaluation results are shown in fig 11 all the five study areas have a high overall accuracy of over 90 and the median precision and recall in the five regions are also above 85 the reason for the lower recalls and precisions compared to the overall accuracy is due to the imbalance of the samples in water and non water and we could see that water occupies only a small portion in all study areas and most filled areas are recognized as non water results indicate that the gap filling accuracy in boone lake daning river and dartmouth reservoirs scenarios is higher while for the irrawaddy river and madre de dios river the accuracy is lower this may be due to the uniqueness of the water surface extent caused by the existence of river sediment loss in addition because the evaluation is carried out on gap pixels here referred to as cloud pixels the distribution of clouds will affect the assessment results for example if clouds exist only in non water locations it may cause a water recall of 0 5 discussion the proposed gap filling method performs well in rivers lakes or reservoirs especially in lakes or reservoirs this may be due to the relatively stable terrain around lakes and reservoirs while the topographic environments of rivers are relatively unstable due to some man made or natural elements such as sediment delivery robinson et al 2007 river constantly scouring or river diversion schulenberg et al 2007 in this situation the features used in the proposed method cannot correct the prior probability the proposed method also performs well on images heavily contaminated by clouds cloud shadows or terrain shadows e g figs 7d and 10d this is because the gap filling accuracy is related to location rather than percentage of contamination see fig s1 in the supplementary materials we plot the gap filling accuracy with the total cloud percentage and the cloud percentage with a prior probability of water between 0 and 1 by excluding cloud areas where p y 1 equals 0 or 1 in each gap filled image it can be seen that there is little relationship between gap filling accuracy and cloud percentage generally speaking as long as there exist key features clear pixels with water probability between 0 and 1 in a contaminated image prior probability will work when there are enough key features the predicted probability will very close to real probability if key features are blocked by cloud or cloud shadow masking the accuracy of filling results will also be reduced while it can be improved by expanding the spatial range for feature selection for some situations that the water shape has a low probability the proposed method can also reconstruct the shape accurately take the boone lake outlined with highlighted yellow ellipse in fig 12 as an example if only based on the water prior probability there is a high probability that its shape is narrow however after implementing the proposed method a wider water body is reconstructed the images acquired at the closest date to the example image july 2 2014 from other sensors e g landsat mission sentinel 2 could be used for verification in this case two landsat 7 images acquired on june 24 2014 and july 10 2014 are selected the outlined water body in these two landsat 7 images both shows a wide shape which strengthens the confidence that it also exhibits a wide shape in the gap date this demonstrates that with additional information the proposed method has more advantages than those methods which only depend on the water prior probability accurate water detection and contaminated pixels mask are premises of the gap filling algorithm as they are inputs if classification error occurred in pixels which belong to the key features in the gap image the error will be transmitted to the reconstruction result through p x i y errors in historical cloud free images will reduce the accuracy of the reconstructed results by affecting p y and p x i y so in regions where water surface monitoring is difficult such as in mountainous areas if mountain shadows or other contaminated pixels cannot be accurately masked the accuracy of water gap filling may be poor since water or cloud detection algorithms are not the focus of this paper manual masking is taken to ensure a high accuracy of input data to make the gap filling process more automatic a possible solution is to buffer the cloud mask which could reduce water omission errors that often occur the cloud water junction while may sacrifice some useful information some water bodies especially those in regions less disturbed by human activities often have the characteristics of seasonal changes the non stability of historical cloud free image which mainly affected by seasonal clouds will also affect the accuracy of gap filling if the historical cloud free data are concentrated in winter the uncertainty of gap filling water bodies in summer will increase in this paper all cloud free historical water images are selected as the training data of naive bayes classification if consider historical cloud free water images with the same season as training data it can be expected that this will improve the accuracy of water gap filling there are still some limitations in the proposed gap filling method one is that it only takes the uncontaminated pixels in the contaminated image as features and uses historical cloud free binary water images as empirical data so it could reconstruct water that once exists in the historical image time series however it is difficult to reconstruct the water that never exists in historical water image time series for example if one gap pixel has never been identified as water in time series the gap pixel will not be classified as water no matter what the uncontaminated information is in view of this for regions with less correlation in water and surrounding water pixels such as paddy field region with more human interference this region also has the challenge of accurate water detect applying this method may be challenging another limitation is that the feature selection is based on entire study area which is computationally intensive and will limit its application to a large area pixel by pixel spatial neighborhood operation could be considered in the future in addition one of the input data is historical cloud free water images which are easy to obtain in small regions while when it goes to a large extent cloud free images may be difficult to obtain in this case block computing or introducing other sensors such as sentinel 1 which can penetrate clouds is a solution besides landsat 8 images the proposed method can also be used to other optical remote sensing images such as landsat 7 and sentinel 2 meanwhile it applies not only for the gaps caused by clouds cloud shadows and terrain shadows but also for the gaps induced by ice snow as well as for stripes that exist in landsat 7 scan line corrector slc off images when dealing with water extraction this method is suitable for high frequency surface water monitoring by utilizing the proposed method the cloud contaminated optical images can be used effectively which will help to increase the temporal resolution of surface water extent monitoring in a sense this method can help near real time surface water monitoring as it can quickly generate relatively complete surface water extents after an optical image becomes available this is important for flood detection and better understanding of the land hydrological processes 6 conclusions the proposed surface water gap filling method is based on naive bayes classification it uses historical cloud free binary water images and clear pixels in the partly contaminated water image to reconstruct the pixels which are contaminated by clouds cloud shadows terrain shadows etc this method makes use of the historical correspondence within connected or unconnected water which means that it can work when a single water body such as small ponds is completely covered evaluation results show that the proposed method performs well in rivers reservoirs or lakes especially in lake or reservoirs where there are small terrain variations this gap filling method can also be applied to fill gaps in water image caused by ice snow as well as the landsat 7 slc off it could contribute to high frequency water surface mapping and monitoring of reservoirs and lakes it does not rely on terrain data and can enrich the water gap filling community credit authorship contribution statement bingxin bai developed the algorithm designed the experiments gennadii donchyts

2584,this study provides new insight into how to predict flow discharges of partly vegetated channels with emergent vegetation by adapting for the first time the interacting divided channel method idcm applied with a curved interface approach and with the presence of large scale roughness elements not considered in previous studies the total and zonal discharges of partly vegetated channels were predicted based on a series of experimental results in this study together with collected data from previous studies consideration of transverse momentum transfer in terms of apparent shear stress at curved interface plane showed better performance with idcm than the divided channel method dcm with both curved and classic vertical diagonal divisions in this study we also proposed a series of expressions easily applicable to predict the zonal discharges of a partly vegetated channel many experiments were carried out in a physical model of a very large rectangular channel with the presence of rows of vertical rigid circular and rough steel cylinders representing emergent rigid vegetation the rows of cylinders were partially mounted on the bottom of the channel leaving lateral

river channels is significant for the design and operation of hydraulic structures river restoration and sustainable development planning huthoff et al 2008 al khatib et al 2012 yang et al 2019 currently the world is facing the challenge of climate change which contributes to increasing the intensity and frequency of floods accurate estimation of flow conveyance in natural watercourses can help reduce the impact of floods on human life and property in nature many watercourses are composite compound channels consisting of different subareas of varying geometry and roughness channels with fringing vegetation are found in many important environmental settings white and nepf 2008 partly vegetated channels show similar hydrodynamic behaviors as a compound channel consisting of a main channel and one or two side floodplains of varying geometry and roughness tang 2017 yang et al 2019 pradhan and khatua 2020 at the interface between the main channel and an adjacent vegetated area a shear layer takes place the large velocity gradient that occurs at the interface generates high turbulence and transverse momentum transfer from faster to slower flow subareas reducing the velocity in the main channel and increasing it in the obstructed area the variation in flow structures between different subsections increases the difficulty in accurately estimating flow discharge in composite compound channels the familiar methods often used to determine the flow conveyance for river channels are the single channel method scm and divided channel method dcm both methods are based on standard chezy manning and darcy weisbach equations treating the cross section as a single channel or dividing it horizontally vertically or diagonally into noninteracting subareas huthoff et al 2008 tang 2017 pradhan and khatua 2020 several workers have experimentally and numerically studied the flow in composite vegetated channels white and nepf 2008 summarizing different models and approaches to describe and predict flow features at the interface of partly vegetated channels indicated that most models have used simplified one dimensional approaches with an empirical darcy weisbach friction factor or a simple eddy viscosity model for the turbulence structure based on the double averaged of navier stokes equations neglection the effect of vertical velocity component white and nepf 2008 chen et al 2010 ben meftah et al 2014 lima and izumi 2014 and ben meftah and mossa 2016 li et al 2022 as an example proposed analytical solutions to predict the typical transversal profile of the mean flow velocity at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas despite the difficult application these solutions can be used to predict the flow discharge in partly vegetated channels in previous studies e g prinos and townsend 1984 al khatib et al 2012 parsaie et al 2016 it was confirmed that conventional scm and dcm methods overestimate or underestimate flow discharge the scm is known to underestimate the discharge capacity of compound channels while dcm overestimates it myers and brennan 1990 pradhan and khatua 2020 in general the dcm predicts better results as compared to scm and it is currently used because of its simplicity for most practical models for open channel flows i e hec ras sobek mike 11 farooq et al 2016 tang 2017 the classical divided channel method dcm without consideration of the interfacial effect due to lateral momentum transfer between the different subsections usually overestimates and underestimates the discharge in the main channel and floodplains respectively singh and tang 2020 several approaches are proposed in the literature to improve the reliability of conveyance capacity prediction in compound channels huthoff et al 2008 and singh and tang 2020 have well summarized most of these advanced approaches classifying them into three classes i ignorance of momentum transfer while shifting the position and shape of the interfaces which modifies the wetted area and perimeter in the manning equations ii introduction of interfacial apparent shear stress based on the secondary current and reynolds stresses distribution due to flow velocity fluctuation the interfacial apparent shear stress is usually parametrized in terms of the difference between main channel and floodplain velocities iii continuum models based on solving the depth integrated and time averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations or shallow water equations this method is considered impractical because transverse numerical integration of the depth averaged of the streamwise velocity is required to obtain a stage discharge relationship in addition to the abovementioned three classes of methods in literature there are many other approaches e g ackers 1993 parsaie et al 2016 tang 2017 farhadi et al 2019 pradhan and khatua 2020 proposed to estimate the zonal and overall discharge in compound channels the large velocity gradient occurring at the interface between the main channel and the floodplain generates high turbulence and transverse momentum transfer from the fastest to the slowest flow area reducing velocity in the main channel and increasing it in the floodplains the momentum transfer mechanism due to the formation of vortex structures at the interface between subsections was experimentally discovered for the first time by sellin 1964 since this discovery several studies e g myers 1978 knight and demetriou 1983 huthoff et al 2008 tang 2019 pradhan and khatua 2020 have focused on considering the contribution of momentum transfer in terms of apparent shear stress for estimating flow discharge it was concluded that interface momentum transfer accounting better predicts zonal and overall flow discharges in compound channels most of the previous studies which predict flow discharge dealt with compound channels of similar or different bottom roughness in both the main channel and the floodplain compartments natural compound channels commonly consist of a main channel and floodplains covered with vegetation aquatic vegetation has different properties height shape roughness bending stiffness density and can occupy the whole or part of a section of a watercourse ben meftah and mossa 2016 in addition to the ecological functions the presence of vegetation adjacent to watercourses also increases the flow resistance and affects the conveyance capacity hamidifar et al 2016 despite the several studies conducted on vegetated channels naot et al 1996 nepf 1999 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 white and nepf 2007 ghisalberti 2010 cheng and nguyen 2011 ben meftah and mossa 2013 ben meftah et al 2015 liu and zeng 2017 mossa et al 2017 de serio et al 2018 van rooijen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 sonnenwald et al 2019 stewart et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 penna et al 2022 evaluating and predicting different flow properties roughness resistance turbulence structures velocity distribution etc few studies on the prediction of discharge capacity based on traditional 1 d methods have been observed in the literature kiczko et al 2020 because the classical 1 d methods such as the dcm method are simple and easy to apply for modelling stage discharge relations in compound channels in this study we try to adopt the interacting divided channel method idcm proposed by huthoff et al 2008 for compound channels with floodplains without large scale roughness elements such as vegetation stems to predict the discharge of a partly vegetated channel the peculiarity of the idcm method is that it includes the effects of lateral momentum transfer which improves the reliability of discharge predictions the novelty of this study is the consideration of both large scale roughness elements consisting of vegetation stems and a curved division interface plane by applying the idcm method to make the model operational a procedure to follow for the prediction of the zonal and total discharges of a partly vegetated channel is proposed sect 2 2 this proposed model is very simple to apply because it depends on the characteristic variables of a partly vegetated channel that practitioners can easily define 2 theoretical considerations the flow configuration considered in this study addresses uniform flow in a very large rectangular channel of total width b partially covered with an array of emergent rigid circular and rough steel cylinders this morphology is representative of emergent vegetation like reeds bamboos rushes and many other trees of cylindrical rigid trunks sometimes have well arranged distribution in floodplains representing channel with vegetation patches the array of cylinders is mounted on the central channel bottom over a full width of 2b o two unobstructed symmetrical side regions each of width b are present near the side walls of the channel the cylinders were arranged in a square configuration and spaced with a distance s the cylinders have the same diameter d and height h fig 1 shows a definition sketch of the considered problem since the flow field is symmetrical to the axis of the channel we focus only on the flow in the half of the channel cross section fig 1a shows that along the y transversal direction in half cross section the turbulent flow is characterized by two main regions an obstructed region and an unobstructed region white and nepf 2007 ben meftah et al 2014 ben meftah and mossa 2016 the flow velocity in the obstructed vegetated region zone i in fig 1 is indicated by u1 defined as the average pore velocity over time and space the unobstructed region is divided into sub zones i a free stream zone indicated by zone ii near the side wall where the flow reaches a full and constant velocity u2 and ii a zone of shear layer indicated by zone iii in which u continuously increases from a velocity o u1 at the interface y 0 to the full velocity u2 the flow velocities u and u2 are the depth and time averaged velocity in each transversal position y the total flow resistance of the considered configuration is composed of three main components i the boundary shear stress surface skin resistance including bed and side wall stresses of the channel ii the additional drag caused by vegetation drag form and iii the apparent shear stress due to lateral momentum exchange at the interface between the obstructed and unobstructed areas the apparent shear stress is usually significantly greater than the boundary shear stress of the main channel helmiö 2004 white and nepf 2007 since the flow hydrodynamic structures of the considered configuration consisting of a main area constituted by the unobstructed region of high velocities and a subarea obstructed by vegetation of low velocities are very similar to those of a compound channel the interacting divided channel method idcm proposed by huthoff et al 2008 is physically adaptable to partly vegetated flow configuration tang 2019 applying the idcm method with an inclined interface plane between the mean channel and floodplains also observed a significant improvement of the predicted discharge compared to classical dcm method with vertical interface 2 1 adaptation of the interacting divided channel method idcm due to the great similarity between the flow hydrodynamic structures presence of main subsection of largest velocity subsections of lowest velocity development of a shear layer at the interface between subsections in compound and partly vegetated channels in this study we adapt the idcm method by huthoff et al 2008 based on the concept of apparent shear stress at an arbitrary curved inclined interface plane between the obstructed and unobstructed regions fig 2 shows a descriptive scheme cross section of zone iii of the curved inclined interface plane the curved line originates from the bottom boundary layer at the intersection between zone i and zone iii y ym and ends at the free surface flow at the intersection between zone iii and zone ii where ym is the effective shear layer origin the curved line separates the cross section area a 3 of zone iii into subareas of cross sections aa 3 subject of apparent shear stress and ab 3 subject of boundary shear stress to simplify the calculation of the length of the curved line and the surfaces aa 3 and ab 3 the curved line has been replaced by two segments eo and og which intersect at point o located on the diagonal dashed line in fig 2 of section a 3 note that by changing the position of point o along the diagonal of section a 3 it is possible to obtain the different classic dividing interface planes used in the dcm method vertical when eo equal to the flow depth h diagonal when eo og and horizontal when eo equal to the width of the shear layerδ the horizontal interface plane is not applicable for this study because the obstructed and unobstructed regions have the same flow depth in fig 2 k and k indicate the vertical and transversal distances of point o from the channel bottom and the zone ii iii interface respectively the momentum balance per unit length in the streamwise direction of channel subareas separated by the curved interface as shown in fig 1b and defined

d 1 2 ρ c d n b o h d u 1 2 where n is the vegetation density according to previous studies e g huthoff et al 2008 tang 2019 singh and tang 2020 the interfacial apparent shear stress is directly proportional to the difference in squared velocities u23 and u13 of the mean and obstructed subareas and can be expressed as 4 τ a 1 2 ρ γ u 23 2 u 13 2 where γ is an interface coefficient to be determined substituting the expression of the apparent shear stress eq 4 into eq 1 and after some arrangement and simplification we get an expression of the mean velocity u23 as 5 u 23 2 u 23 0 2 1 2

step 1 the process begins with a detailed determination of the different characteristics of the partly vegetated channel as shown in fig 1 the difficulty here is how to define the ym and δ this will be discussed below in sect 4 1 step 2 calculate the interface length h using eq 17 after calculating k and k with a given value of α in this step we can also calculate the value of λ using eq 19 step 3 calculate the hydraulic radii r 23 and r 13 using eqs 14 and 15 respectively step 4 calculate the coefficients 23 and 13 using eqs 7 and 10 respectively herein the frictional factors will be calculated based on manning s formulas as f 23 g n 23 2 r 23 1 3 and f 13 g n 13 2 r 13 1 3 the equivalent values of the manning coefficients n 23 and n 13 depend on the nature of materials constituting the solid boundaries of each subarea step 5 calculate the zonal mean velocities u 23 0 and u 13 0 using eqs 6 and 9 respectively the wetted perimeters are determined as p 23 b ym β h and p 13 1 φ bo ym β h the vegetated induced drag force fd eq 4 will be calculated by defining a drag coefficient cd and by assuming a value of u 1 u 13 0 and therefore eq 9 becomes as follows 20 u 13 0 2 g r 13 s f 13 1 1 2 c d a b o h f 13 p 13 note that the subscript 0 in u13 0 indicates that the interface stress is not considered interface coefficient γ 0 and the solution is presented in terms of the flow velocity obtained with the classical dcm method therefore u13 0 is approximately of order u1 step 6 calculate the predicted zonal mean velocities u 23 and u 13 based on eqs 12 and 13

the department of civil environmental building engineering and chemistry at the polytechnic university of bari italy the channel consists of base and lateral walls made of glass the channel is 15 m long 4 m large and 0 4 m deep the water is supplied from a large downstream steel tank to an upstream one using a flygt centrifugal electric pump in a closed hydraulic circuit a side channel spillway of adjustable height is installed in the upstream tank to maintain constant flow head condition the overflow water is drained through a pipeline to the downstream tank the pumped and overflow water discharges are measured using two electromagnetic flowmeters mounted on the channel s hydraulic circuit the difference between the two flow discharges defines the total discharge of the channel to create a smooth flow transition from the upstream tank to the flume a set of stilling grids are installed in the upstream tank to dampen inlet turbulence the channel is equipped with an upstream and a downstream gate to define both the depth and the mean velocity of the flow fig 3 the vegetation array consists of vertical rigid circular and threaded steel cylinders the cylinder height h is 0 31 m and its diameter d is 0 003 m the cylinders were inserted into a bottom plywood plaque 9 0 m long 4 0 m wide and 0 02 m thick the array of cylinders is partially mounted in the central part of the channel forming the experimental area of 3 m long and 2bo width two symmetric lateral regions immediately adjacent to the channel sides each of width b are left for free flow circulation see fig 1 four experimental configurations based on the contraction ratio cr were investigated varying b and bo the 3 m extension of the plywood plaque both upstream and downstream of the array of cylinders and its taping to the channel bottom helps to minimize flow disturbance cylinders are regularly arranged and spaced longitudinally and transversally with the same distance s 5 0 cm giving rise to a density n of 400 cylinders m2 the origin of the x axis x 0 is taken at the upstream edge of the array of cylinders while that of the y axis y 0 is taken at the array edge interface between the obstructed and unobstructed domains the z axis has its origin at the channel bottom since the flow within the canopy is turbulent and highly heterogeneous at the scale of the individual cylinder the measurement of the three dimensional flow is of crucial importance the three flow velocity components were accurately measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino manufactured by nortek using the adv vectrino a velocity range of 0 30 m s a vertical extension of sampling volume of 7 mm a sampling rate of 150 hz and a time of acquisition of 2 min were established the acquired data were filtered based on tukey s method and the bad samples snr 15 and correlation coefficient 70 were removed detailed information on the measurements performed is summarized in table 1 where red u1d ν is the reynolds number based on cylinder diameter re 2 u2h ν is the reynolds number based on flow depth qm is the measured main channel discharge ν is the water kinematic viscosity and δ is a modified width of zone iii explained below in sect 4 1 in addition to the experimental data of the present study some data obtained in previous studies are also considered and illustrated in table 1 the white and nepf s 2007 2008 data were obtained in a laboratory flume 13 m long and 1 2 m wide partially obstructed with a 40 cm wide emergent array adjacent to a side wall of the flume of 6 5 mm diameter wooden circular cylinders fig 4 the cylinder density the flow depth and the flow discharge were varied during the experimentation the measurements of flow velocity were made with a laser doppler velocimetry ldv system the data of caroppi 2018 were obtained in a rectangular channel 8 m long 0 40 m wide and 0 4 m deep a lateral area of width 0 1625 m along the entire length of the flume was obstructed by an array of aligned emergent cylinders of 4 5 mm diameter fig 4 different cylinder packing densities flow depth and flow rates were tested instantaneous velocity measurements were performed with a sontek micro acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 4 results and discussion 4 1 prediction of shear layer width and vegetation drag coefficient the shear boundary layer zone iii in figs 1 and 4 is characterized by a width δ which originates at a lateral distance ym from the vegetation edge these two characteristic parameters δ ym explicitly depend on the flow vegetation interaction dynamics white and nepf 2007 2008 ben meftah and mossa 2016 li et al 2022 and their determination requires detailed information on the lateral distribution of the flow velocity according to previous studies e g white and nepf 2007 2008 ben meftah and mossa 2016 ym is usually significantly small compared to δ to make the procedure of discharge predicting easily applicable we have combined ym and δ into a new δ ym δ length scale with this consideration the width of zone iii becomes δ instead of δ including the length scale ym fig 5 shows the trend of δ b as a function of the dimensionless parameter 1 φ crra the data plotted in fig 5 refer to the present study and previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 as shown in table 1 fig 5 indicates a clear increasing trend of δ b with the increase of 1 φ crra a logarithmic regression analysis of these data leads to an expression for predicting δ as follows 26 δ b 0 11 l n 1 φ c r r a 0 61 the drag coefficient cd represents a key parameter to calculate the total drag force by vegetation determining cd is a challenging task due to its complex dependence on the macro and microstructure of vegetation arrays as well as flow characteristics ben meftah 2013 huai et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in the last decades several experimental theorical and numerical studies were conducted to predict the drag coefficient in vegetated channel flows recently liu et al 2020 provided a good summary of several methodologies used to measure the drag coefficient cd of emergent vegetation in open channel flows presenting a comprehensive list of existing predictors of cd the authors also proposed an innovative robust predictor of cd using genetic programming gp and machine learning ml techniques based on natural selection of large series of published data to find an easy expression predicting the drag coefficient in this study we aim to find out a relationship between cd and the reynolds number re 23 0 u 23 0 r 23 ν of the main channel area where u 23 0 and r 23 calculated based on eqs 6 and 14 using δ instead of δ and annulling ym ym 0 it is worth mentioning that re 23 0 is expressed as a function of variables that practitioners can easily define in fig 6 we plot the experimentally estimated values of cd table 1 obtained in the present study and previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 versus re 23 0 cd shows a decreasing trend with an increase of re 23 0 the best fit to the data leads to the following expression to predict the drag coefficient 27 c d 182 re 23 0 0 47 4 2 results of discharge prediction by applying idcm with a curved interface all the experiments of this study and the previous studies used to predict the flow discharges were of steady uniform and fully developed flow the channels have rectangular cross sections made of glass plexiglas and are characterized by fixed beds the roughness was identified in terms of a manning coefficient n considered constant and determined based on the nature of the material constituting each laboratory channel since the channel bed of the present study is covered with a plywood plaque fig 3 an equivalent manning roughness coefficient of n 0 013 was assumed whereas a value of n 0 01 was considered for both previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 the free surface slope s which is theoretically equal to the bed slope with a uniform flow was determined based on the measured flow velocity u2 of constant value through zone ii the average value of all runs of s is almost equal to 2x10 4 1x10 4 and 2x10 3 for the present study the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and that by caroppi 2018 respectively fig 7 shows a comparison between the measured and predicted applying the idcm method total discharges for the present study fig 7a and the previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 as shown in fig 7b and 7c respectively it is worth mentioning that the results depicted in fig 7 were obtained after testing different values of the curved interface line h to reach the best performance by varying the values of α between 0 and 1 and γ furthermore in the calculation procedure sect 2 2 δ was used instead of δ annulling ym and cd was estimated using eq 27 for the present study the values of α 0 20 λ 0 80 and γ 0 023 lead to the most accurate discharge prediction a good performance of the idcm method was also obtained with a similar value of γ 0 020 in a previous study by huthoff et al 2008 predicting flow discharges in a compound channel for the previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 the best idcm performances were achieved with values of α 0 39 γ 0 037 and α 0 10 γ 0 012 respectively according to tang 2019 the mean absolute percentage error mape of predicted discharge has already been used as a criterion for the method s accuracy and calculated as follows 28 e q q p q m q m 100 where eq is the percentage error of the predicted discharge qp is the predicted discharge and qm is the measured discharge in fig 7 the eq values of the different runs are shown above the histograms for the present study fig 7a eq shows for most runs a value 8 except for 5 runs where it varies between 13 and 23 the average value of eq for the 20 runs shown in fig 7a is slightly below 6 indicating the good performance of the idcm method white and nepf 2007 2008 in their original papers only indicated the range of discharge variation of their experiments the five measured discharges presented in fig 7b were estimated based on available detailed data runs i iv vi vii x of transversal distribution of the streamwise velocity depicted in the study by white and nepf 2008 despite the uncertainty in estimating the white and nepf s 2007 2008 measured discharges eq indicates four values less or equal to 9 and an average value of order 10 the predicted discharges shown in fig 7c also indicate good accuracy most of the values of eq vary between 0 and 10 giving an average value of 7 for all runs the application of the idcm method with α 0 20 and γ 0 023 values that led to the best idcm performance with the data of this study to the white and nepf s 2007 2008 and caroppi s 2018 data yields an average value of eq almost equals to 11 and 10 respectively here we notice that there is a slight variation of the average value of eq from 10 and 7 as best idcm performance with the data of white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 to 11 and 10 obtained with α 0 20 and γ 0 023 respectively this allows us to consider a value of α 0 23 λ 0 77 and γ 0 024 obtained averaging the α and γ values of best performances for the three analyzed datasets for the combined data hereafter we indicate by combined data the set of data of the present study and the studies of white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 treated together with α 0 23 and γ 0 024 we obtained an average value of eq of almost

datasets present study s white and nepf s 2007 2008 and caroppi s 2018 data applying the dcm method with the same values of α as in fig 7 note that with the dcm method the contribution of the apparent shear stress is not considered i e γ 0 as indicated by the subscript 0 in qt 0 fig 8 shows a significant underestimation of the predicted discharges compared to those measured most values of eq are higher than 30 for the three datasets used for analysis eq is of average value approximately equal to 29 30 and 33 for the present study with α 0 20 the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 with α 0 39 and that by caroppi 2018 with α 0 10 respectively with α 0 23 eq is almost equal to 28 35 and 25 for the present study the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and the study by caroppi 2018 respectively and it is approximately 29 for the combined data however it was observed that eq significantly decreases with a high value of α eq reaches a minimum average value approximately equal to 7 14 and 3 for the present study with α 0 90 λ 0 10 the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 with α 0 92 λ 0 08 and that of caroppi 2018 with α 0 62 λ 0 38 respectively with α 0 81 average of the three α values of 0 90 0 92 and 0 62 for the combined data eq is of average value approximately equal to 13 it is worth remembering that with α 0 23 and γ 0 024 the average value of eq applying the idcm method for the combined data is almost 9 this implies that the idcm method predicts more accurately the flow discharges than the dcm method table 2 shows a comparison between the performance of the idcm and dcm methods fig 9 shows a comparison between the predicted and measured normalized discharges in the three different subareas i e zone i zone ii zone iii both predicted and measured discharges are normalized by the total predicted discharge qt the data presented in fig 9 were obtained applying the idcm method with a curved interface plane of α 0 23 λ 0 77 and γ 0 024 the zonal predicted discharges were calculated using eqs 21 23 fig 9a shows the normalized discharges in the obstructed region zone i for all runs of the present study and the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 the idcm method shows an overestimation of the discharge q 1 the data scattering in fig 9a may be due to the high uncertainty of both the measured velocity u1 and the drag coefficient estimation fig 9b shows the data of q 2 qt discharge in the free stream zone zone ii subject of constant velocity u 2 in this zone the idcm method underestimates the discharge q 2 by a value around 20 as shown by the deviated dashed line from the perfect fitted line solid line the good collapse of data onto a single curve in fig 9b reflects more precision in measuring the flow velocity u 2 fig 9c presents the normalized discharge q 3 qt in the shear layer zone zone iii despite the slight data scattering shown in fig 9c the predicted and measured discharges indicate a good correlation where most data collapse at and close to the perfect fitted line solid line it should be underlined that with α 0 50 we obtain the classic diagonal divisional channel method this division method showed low performance in predicting the total discharges compared to the curved division with α 0 50 for the combined data the idcm method with γ 0 02 gives an average value of eq approximately equal to 16 while the dcm method showed a value of almost 18 4 3 dependence of zonal discharges to the cross section characteristic parameters with the aim of finding practical expressions to predict the zonal flow discharges we conducted further analysis based on the channel sectional characteristic parameters figs 1 and 4 in fig 10 a we plot the normalized predicted discharge q 1 qt of the obstructed region zone i versus the dimensionless parameter 1 φ crra 0 1 it is worth point out that the predicted discharges presented in fig 10 are results of the idcm method with a curved interface of α 0 23 and γ 0 024 fig 10a shows a perfect collapse of the data from the different studies onto a single increasing curve a logarithmic regression of the combined data yields an empirical expression of coefficient of determination r2 0 99 to predict the discharge in the obstructed region q 1 as follows 29 q 1 q t 0 20 l n 1 φ c r r a 0 10 0 50 fig 10b shows the normalized predicted discharge q 2 qt in the free stream region zone ii plotted against the parameter 1 φ crra 0 5 fig 10b points out that q 2 qt systematically decreases as 1 φ crra 0 5 increases following an almost perfect trend a logarithmic regression of the combined data also leads to an empirical expression of coefficient of determination r2 0 99 for the discharge q 2 in the free stream region as follows 30 q 2 q t 0 17 l n 1 φ c r r a 0 50 0 20 since by continuity qt q 1 q 2 q 3 an expression to predict the discharge q 3 in the interface between the obstructed and unobstructed

determination of the flow velocity in each compartment expectation of possible erosion or deposition of solid materials river restoration and management hydraulic capacity improvement flow impact on ecological health the discharge predictors shown in eqs 29 31 are expressed as a function of variables that practitioners can easily define making them very simple to apply for partly vegetated channels especially after having defined the total discharge qt 4 4 results of discharge prediction with vertical interface based on the curved interface approach proposed in this study the vertical interface occurs when α 1 00 λ 0 00 here the peculiarity is that the length of the interface h becomes equal to the distance eo see fig 2 which is necessarily equal to the flow depth h it has been observed that by setting the value of α 1 the consideration of the apparent shear stress effect i e γ 0 has no impact on achieving better idcm performance the best performance in predicting the flow discharges was obtained with a value of γ 0 i e with the dcm method fig 11 illustrates a comparison between the predicted and measured total discharges for the present study and previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 for the present study fig 11a most of the predicted discharges are comparable to those measured with an eq ranging between 1 and 12 the average value of eq of all the 19 runs is approximately equal to 10 which is almost double that obtained applying the idcm method with a curved surface of α 0 20 and γ 0 023 see table 2 fig 11b and 11c show significantly lower performances compared to the present study analyzing white and nepf s 2007 2008 and caroppi s 2018 data eq indicates an average value of approximately 12 and 28 with the dataset of white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 respectively the average value of eq for the combined data is of order 17 against a value of 9 and 13 table 2 obtained applying the idcm α 0 23 and γ 0 024 and dcm α 0 81 with curved interface plane respectively this implies that the curved divisional channel method shows better performance than classic vertical division fig 12 shows the predicted versus measured total discharges obtained applying the idcm and dcm methods with curved and vertical interface planes both the idcm and dcm with a curved interface show better performance in predicting channel discharges than the dcm with a vertical interface which overestimates most discharges by more than 20 as indicated by the dashed line in fig 12 with the consideration of a curved interface plane the best performance was achieved with the idcm method as can also be distinguished from table 2 4 5 vortical structure in the shear layer region analysis of the flow behavior in the shear layer region zone iii as shown in fig 13 shows the development of a clockwise vortex of a length scale of order δ width of zone iii fig 13 indicates that the secondary current cell occupies the largest cross section area of zone iii which is subject to considerable transverse momentum transfer this momentum transfer generates considerable apparent resistance affecting the flow velocity distribution and therefore the flow discharge through this zone the apparent resistance should be physically proportional to the cross section area subject to considerable transverse momentum transfer due to the dominated vortex structure in zone iii giving rise to consider a curved interface fig 2 to better represent the proportionality of this area defined above as λ to the total cross section area of zone iii a 3 the introduction of a curved interface approach is strongly confirmed by the best performance of the idcm method in predicting the flow discharges 5 conclusions in this study we adopted for the first time the idcm method to predict flow discharge in a partly vegetated channel with emergent rigid vegetation transverse momentum transfer was considered in terms of apparent shear stress acting on a curved interface plane in this study the choice of a curved interface approach was justified by the dominance of a vortical structure in the shear layer region it was observed that most of the interface area zone iii in this study is subject to the development of a typical vortex of a length scale on the order of the width of this interface area this study confirms that a curved divisional channel method better physically represents the effect of apparent resistance in the shear layer region the idcm method applied with a curved interface leads to find practical analytical expressions of the flow velocity on the main and obstructed subsections of a partly vegetated channel giving rise to discharge prediction to make these expressions simple and easily applicable by practitioners we proposed empirical formulas to predict the width of the interface zone and the drag coefficient due to vegetation stems characteristic parameters essential for the calculation procedure the idcm applied with a curved interface plane is characterized by two free coefficients α coefficient to define the interface curved length and γ interface coefficient for the apparent shear stress the flow discharge prediction based on laboratory experiments shows a sensitivity of the idcm method to α and γ values comparison of the different analyzed datasets shows that the best idcm performance was achieved with values of α and γ in the range 0 10 0 39 and 0 012 0 037 respectively the results of the combined data of the different laboratory experiments lead to better performance of idcm with α 0 23 and γ 0 024 the best performance of the dcm method was obtained with values of α ranging between 0 62 and 0 92 treating separately the data of the different studies and with α 0 81 for combined data based on the results achieved in this study the idcm method with a curved interface plane showed better performance in predicting the flow discharge in partly vegetated channels than the dcm method furthermore the idcm method applied with a curved interface also showed better performance than dcm with classic vertical or transversal division methods in this study we also proposed a series of expressions easily applicable to predict the zonal discharges of the different characteristic subareas in a partly vegetated channel further sophisticated experiments in partly vegetated channels are recommended for future studies to determine more accurate values of the characteristic coefficients α and γ credit authorship contribution statement mouldi ben meftah

2584,this study provides new insight into how to predict flow discharges of partly vegetated channels with emergent vegetation by adapting for the first time the interacting divided channel method idcm applied with a curved interface approach and with the presence of large scale roughness elements not considered in previous studies the total and zonal discharges of partly vegetated channels were predicted based on a series of experimental results in this study together with collected data from previous studies consideration of transverse momentum transfer in terms of apparent shear stress at curved interface plane showed better performance with idcm than the divided channel method dcm with both curved and classic vertical diagonal divisions in this study we also proposed a series of expressions easily applicable to predict the zonal discharges of a partly vegetated channel many experiments were carried out in a physical model of a very large rectangular channel with the presence of rows of vertical rigid circular and rough steel cylinders representing emergent rigid vegetation the rows of cylinders were partially mounted on the bottom of the channel leaving lateral areas of free circulation near the walls the three dimensional components of the flow velocity were measured using a 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino keywords partly vegetated channels

river channels is significant for the design and operation of hydraulic structures river restoration and sustainable development planning huthoff et al 2008 al khatib et al 2012 yang et al 2019 currently the world is facing the challenge of climate change which contributes to increasing the intensity and frequency of floods accurate estimation of flow conveyance in natural watercourses can help reduce the impact of floods on human life and property in nature many watercourses are composite compound channels consisting of different subareas of varying geometry and roughness channels with fringing vegetation are found in many important environmental settings white and nepf 2008 partly vegetated channels show similar hydrodynamic behaviors as a compound channel consisting of a main channel and one or two side floodplains of varying geometry and roughness tang 2017 yang et al 2019 pradhan and khatua 2020 at the interface between the main channel and an adjacent vegetated area a shear layer takes place the large velocity gradient that occurs at the interface generates high turbulence and transverse momentum transfer from faster to slower flow subareas reducing the velocity in the main channel and increasing it in the obstructed area the variation in flow structures between different subsections increases the difficulty in accurately estimating flow discharge in composite compound channels the familiar methods often used to determine the flow conveyance for river channels are the single channel method scm and divided channel method dcm both methods are based on standard chezy manning and darcy weisbach equations treating the cross section as a single channel or dividing it horizontally vertically or diagonally into noninteracting subareas huthoff et al 2008 tang 2017 pradhan and khatua 2020 several workers have experimentally and numerically studied the flow in composite vegetated channels white and nepf 2008 summarizing different models and approaches to describe and predict flow features at the interface of partly vegetated channels indicated that most models have used simplified one dimensional approaches with an empirical darcy weisbach friction factor or a simple eddy viscosity model for the turbulence structure based on the double averaged of navier stokes equations neglection the effect of vertical velocity component white and nepf 2008 chen et al 2010 ben meftah et al 2014 lima and izumi 2014 and ben meftah and mossa 2016 li et al 2022 as an example proposed analytical solutions to predict the typical transversal profile of the mean flow velocity at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas despite the difficult application these solutions can be used to predict the flow discharge in partly vegetated channels in previous studies e g prinos and townsend 1984 al khatib et al 2012 parsaie et al 2016 it was confirmed that conventional scm and dcm methods overestimate or underestimate flow discharge the scm is known to underestimate the discharge capacity of compound channels while dcm overestimates it myers and brennan 1990 pradhan and khatua 2020 in general the dcm predicts better results as compared to scm and it is currently used because of its simplicity for most practical models for open channel flows i e hec ras sobek mike 11 farooq et al 2016 tang 2017 the classical divided channel method dcm without consideration of the interfacial effect due to lateral momentum transfer between the different subsections usually overestimates and underestimates the discharge in the main channel and floodplains respectively singh and tang 2020 several approaches are proposed in the literature to improve the reliability of conveyance capacity prediction in compound channels huthoff et al 2008 and singh and tang 2020 have well summarized most of these advanced approaches classifying them into three classes i ignorance of momentum transfer while shifting the position and shape of the interfaces which modifies the wetted area and perimeter in the manning equations ii introduction of interfacial apparent shear stress based on the secondary current and reynolds stresses distribution due to flow velocity fluctuation the interfacial apparent shear stress is usually parametrized in terms of the difference between main channel and floodplain velocities iii continuum models based on solving the depth integrated and time averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations or shallow water equations this method is considered impractical because transverse numerical integration of the depth averaged of the streamwise velocity is required to obtain a stage discharge relationship in addition to the abovementioned three classes of methods in literature there are many other approaches e g ackers 1993 parsaie et al 2016 tang 2017 farhadi et al 2019 pradhan and khatua 2020 proposed to estimate the zonal and overall discharge in compound channels the large velocity gradient occurring at the interface between the main channel and the floodplain generates high turbulence and transverse momentum transfer from the fastest to the slowest flow area reducing velocity in the main channel and increasing it in the floodplains the momentum transfer mechanism due to the formation of vortex structures at the interface between subsections was experimentally discovered for the first time by sellin 1964 since this discovery several studies e g myers 1978 knight and demetriou 1983 huthoff et al 2008 tang 2019 pradhan and khatua 2020 have focused on considering the contribution of momentum transfer in terms of apparent shear stress for estimating flow discharge it was concluded that interface momentum transfer accounting better predicts zonal and overall flow discharges in compound channels most of the previous studies which predict flow discharge dealt with compound channels of similar or different bottom roughness in both the main channel and the floodplain compartments natural compound channels commonly consist of a main channel and floodplains covered with vegetation aquatic vegetation has different properties height shape roughness bending stiffness density and can occupy the whole or part of a section of a watercourse ben meftah and mossa 2016 in addition to the ecological functions the presence of vegetation adjacent to watercourses also increases the flow resistance and affects the conveyance capacity hamidifar et al 2016 despite the several studies conducted on vegetated channels naot et al 1996 nepf 1999 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 white and nepf 2007 ghisalberti 2010 cheng and nguyen 2011 ben meftah and mossa 2013 ben meftah et al 2015 liu and zeng 2017 mossa et al 2017 de serio et al 2018 van rooijen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 sonnenwald et al 2019 stewart et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 penna et al 2022 evaluating and predicting different flow properties roughness resistance turbulence structures velocity distribution etc few studies on the prediction of discharge capacity based on traditional 1 d methods have been observed in the literature kiczko et al 2020 because the classical 1 d methods such as the dcm method are simple and easy to apply for modelling stage discharge relations in compound channels in this study we try to adopt the interacting divided channel method idcm proposed by huthoff et al 2008 for compound channels with floodplains without large scale roughness elements such as vegetation stems to predict the discharge of a partly vegetated channel the peculiarity of the idcm method is that it includes the effects of lateral momentum transfer which improves the reliability of discharge predictions the novelty of this study is the consideration of both large scale roughness elements consisting of vegetation stems and a curved division interface plane by applying the idcm method to make the model operational a procedure to follow for the prediction of the zonal and total discharges of a partly vegetated channel is proposed sect 2 2 this proposed model is very simple to apply because it depends on the characteristic variables of a partly vegetated channel that practitioners can easily define 2 theoretical considerations the flow configuration considered in this study addresses uniform flow in a very large rectangular channel of total width b partially covered with an array of emergent rigid circular and rough steel cylinders this morphology is representative of emergent vegetation like reeds bamboos rushes and many other trees of cylindrical rigid trunks sometimes have well arranged distribution in floodplains representing channel with vegetation patches the array of cylinders is mounted on the central channel bottom over a full width of 2b o two unobstructed symmetrical side regions each of width b are present near the side walls of the channel the cylinders were arranged in a square configuration and spaced with a distance s the cylinders have the same diameter d and height h fig 1 shows a definition sketch of the considered problem since the flow field is symmetrical to the axis of the channel we focus only on the flow in the half of the channel cross section fig 1a shows that along the y transversal direction in half cross section the turbulent flow is characterized by two main regions an obstructed region and an unobstructed region white and nepf 2007 ben meftah et al 2014 ben meftah and mossa 2016 the flow velocity in the obstructed vegetated region zone i in fig 1 is indicated by u1 defined as the average pore velocity over time and space the unobstructed region is divided into sub zones i a free stream zone indicated by zone ii near the side wall where the flow reaches a full and constant velocity u2 and ii a zone of shear layer indicated by zone iii in which u continuously increases from a velocity o u1 at the interface y 0 to the full velocity u2 the flow velocities u and u2 are the depth and time averaged velocity in each transversal position y the total flow resistance of the considered configuration is composed of three main components i the boundary shear stress surface skin resistance including bed and side wall stresses of the channel ii the additional drag caused by vegetation drag form and iii the apparent shear stress due to lateral momentum exchange at the interface between the obstructed and unobstructed areas the apparent shear stress is usually significantly greater than the boundary shear stress of the main channel helmiö 2004 white and nepf 2007 since the flow hydrodynamic structures of the considered configuration consisting of a main area constituted by the unobstructed region of high velocities and a subarea obstructed by vegetation of low velocities are very similar to those of a compound channel the interacting divided channel method idcm proposed by huthoff et al 2008 is physically adaptable to partly vegetated flow configuration tang 2019 applying the idcm method with an inclined interface plane between the mean channel and floodplains also observed a significant improvement of the predicted discharge compared to classical dcm method with vertical interface 2 1 adaptation of the interacting divided channel method idcm due to the great similarity between the flow hydrodynamic structures presence of main subsection of largest velocity subsections of lowest velocity development of a shear layer at the interface between subsections in compound and partly vegetated channels in this study we adapt the idcm method by huthoff et al 2008 based on the concept of apparent shear stress at an arbitrary curved inclined interface plane between the obstructed and unobstructed regions fig 2 shows a descriptive scheme cross section of zone iii of the curved inclined interface plane the curved line originates from the bottom boundary layer at the intersection between zone i and zone iii y ym and ends at the free surface flow at the intersection between zone iii and zone ii where ym is the effective shear layer origin the curved line separates the cross section area a 3 of zone iii into subareas of cross sections aa 3 subject of apparent shear stress and ab 3 subject of boundary shear stress to simplify the calculation of the length of the curved line and the surfaces aa 3 and ab 3 the curved line has been replaced by two segments eo and og which intersect at point o located on the diagonal dashed line in fig 2 of section a 3 note that by changing the position of point o along the diagonal of section a 3 it is possible to obtain the different classic dividing interface planes used in the dcm method vertical when eo equal to the flow depth h diagonal when eo og and horizontal when eo equal to the width of the shear layerδ the horizontal interface plane is not applicable for this study because the obstructed and unobstructed regions have the same flow depth in fig 2 k and k indicate the vertical and transversal distances of point o from the channel bottom and the zone ii iii interface respectively the momentum balance per unit length in the streamwise direction of channel subareas separated by the curved interface as shown in fig 1b and defined in detail in fig 2 can be written as 1 ρ g a 23 s ρ f 23 u 23 2 p 23 τ a h 2 ρ g a 13 s ρ f 13 u 13 2 p 13 f d τ a h the left hand sides of eqs 1 and 2 represent the streamwise component of the

at the interface curved plane and h eo og fig 2 is the interface length the vegetated induced drag force per unit length fd can be expressed using the drag coefficient for a single cylinder cd as 3 f d 1 2 ρ c d n b o h d u 1 2 where n is the vegetation density according to previous studies e g huthoff et al 2008 tang 2019 singh and tang 2020 the interfacial apparent shear stress is directly proportional to the difference in squared velocities u23 and u13 of the mean and obstructed subareas and can be expressed as 4 τ a 1 2 ρ γ u 23 2 u 13 2 where γ is an interface coefficient to be determined substituting the expression of the apparent shear stress eq 4 into eq 1 and after some arrangement and simplification we get an expression of the mean velocity u23 as 5 u 23 2 u 23 0 2 1 2 γ 23 u 23 2 u 13 2 where 6 u 23 0 2 g r 23 s f 23 7 23 h f 23 p 23 the substitution of eq 4 into eq 2 leads to the following expression of u13 8 u 13 2 u 13 0 2 1 2 γ 13 u 23 2 u 13 2 where 9 u 13 0 2 g r 13 s f 13 f d ρ f 13 p 13 10 13 h f 13 p 13 to adapt the idcm method by huthoff et al 2008 to partly vegetated channel the novelty of this study lies in the consideration of the vegetation drag effect not addressed in previous studies in the expression of u 13 0 as shown in eq 9 by subtracting eq 8 from eq 5 we obtain the following expression of the squared velocity difference 11 u 23 2 u 13 2 u 23 0 2 u 13 0 2 1 1 2 γ 23 13 after the substitution of eq 11 in eqs 5 and 8 one obtains the following unified equations for u23 and u13 12 u 23 2 u 23 0 2 1 2 γ 23 1 1 2 γ 23 13 u 23 0 2 u 13 0 2

step 1 the process begins with a detailed determination of the different characteristics of the partly vegetated channel as shown in fig 1 the difficulty here is how to define the ym and δ this will be discussed below in sect 4 1 step 2 calculate the interface length h using eq 17 after calculating k and k with a given value of α in this step we can also calculate the value of λ using eq 19 step 3 calculate the hydraulic radii r 23 and r 13 using eqs 14 and 15 respectively step 4 calculate the coefficients 23 and 13 using eqs 7 and 10 respectively herein the frictional factors will be calculated based on manning s formulas as f 23 g n 23 2 r 23 1 3 and f 13 g n 13 2 r 13 1 3 the equivalent values of the manning coefficients n 23 and n 13 depend on the nature of materials constituting the solid boundaries of each subarea step 5 calculate the zonal mean velocities u 23 0 and u 13 0 using eqs 6 and 9 respectively the wetted perimeters are determined as p 23 b ym β h and p 13 1 φ bo ym β h the vegetated induced drag force fd eq 4 will be calculated by defining a drag coefficient cd and by assuming a value of u 1 u 13 0 and therefore eq 9 becomes as follows 20 u 13 0 2

the department of civil environmental building engineering and chemistry at the polytechnic university of bari italy the channel consists of base and lateral walls made of glass the channel is 15 m long 4 m large and 0 4 m deep the water is supplied from a large downstream steel tank to an upstream one using a flygt centrifugal electric pump in a closed hydraulic circuit a side channel spillway of adjustable height is installed in the upstream tank to maintain constant flow head condition the overflow water is drained through a pipeline to the downstream tank the pumped and overflow water discharges are measured using two electromagnetic flowmeters mounted on the channel s hydraulic circuit the difference between the two flow discharges defines the total discharge of the channel to create a smooth flow transition from the upstream tank to the flume a set of stilling grids are installed in the upstream tank to dampen inlet turbulence the channel is equipped with an upstream and a downstream gate to define both the depth and the mean velocity of the flow fig 3 the vegetation array consists of vertical rigid circular and threaded steel cylinders the cylinder height h is 0 31 m and its diameter d is 0 003 m the cylinders were inserted into a bottom plywood plaque 9 0 m long 4 0 m wide and 0 02 m thick the array of cylinders is partially mounted in the central part of the channel forming the experimental area of 3 m long and 2bo width two symmetric lateral regions immediately adjacent to the channel sides each of width b are left for free flow circulation see fig 1 four experimental configurations based on the contraction ratio cr were investigated varying b and bo the 3 m extension of the plywood plaque both upstream and downstream of the array of cylinders and its taping to the channel bottom helps to minimize flow disturbance cylinders are regularly arranged and spaced longitudinally and transversally with the same distance s 5 0 cm giving rise to a density n of 400 cylinders m2 the origin of the x axis x 0 is taken at the upstream edge of the array of cylinders while that of the y axis y 0 is taken at the array edge interface between the obstructed and unobstructed domains the z axis has its origin at the channel bottom since the flow within the canopy is turbulent and highly heterogeneous at the scale of the individual cylinder the measurement of the three dimensional flow is of crucial importance the three flow velocity components were accurately measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino manufactured by nortek using the adv vectrino a velocity range of 0 30 m s a vertical extension of sampling volume of 7 mm a sampling rate of 150 hz and a time of acquisition of 2 min were established the acquired data were filtered based on tukey s method and the bad samples snr 15 and correlation coefficient 70 were removed detailed information on the measurements performed is summarized in table 1 where red u1d ν is the reynolds number based on cylinder diameter re 2 u2h ν is the reynolds number based on flow depth qm is the measured main channel discharge ν is the water kinematic viscosity and δ is a modified width of zone iii explained below in sect 4 1 in addition to the experimental data of the present study some data obtained in previous studies are also considered and illustrated in table 1 the white and nepf s 2007 2008 data were obtained in a laboratory flume 13 m long and 1 2 m wide partially obstructed with a 40 cm wide emergent array adjacent to a side wall of the flume of 6 5 mm diameter wooden circular cylinders fig 4 the cylinder density the flow depth and the flow discharge were varied during the experimentation the measurements of flow velocity were made with a laser doppler velocimetry ldv system the data of caroppi 2018 were obtained in a rectangular channel 8 m long 0 40 m wide and 0 4 m deep a lateral area of width 0 1625 m along the entire length of the flume was obstructed by an array of aligned emergent cylinders of 4 5 mm diameter fig 4 different cylinder packing densities flow depth and flow rates were tested instantaneous velocity measurements were performed with a sontek micro acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 4 results and discussion 4 1 prediction of shear layer width and vegetation drag coefficient the shear boundary layer zone iii in figs 1 and 4 is characterized by a width δ which originates at a lateral distance ym from the vegetation edge these two characteristic parameters δ ym explicitly depend on the flow vegetation interaction dynamics white and nepf 2007 2008 ben meftah and mossa 2016 li et al 2022 and their determination requires detailed information on the lateral distribution of the flow velocity according to previous studies e g white and nepf 2007 2008 ben meftah and mossa 2016 ym is usually significantly small compared to δ to make the procedure of discharge predicting easily applicable we have combined ym and δ into a new δ ym δ length scale with this consideration the width of zone iii becomes δ instead of δ including the length scale ym fig 5 shows the trend of δ b as a function of the dimensionless parameter 1 φ crra the data plotted in fig 5 refer to the present study and previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 as shown in table 1 fig 5 indicates a clear increasing trend of δ b with the increase of 1 φ crra a logarithmic regression analysis of these data leads to an expression for predicting δ as follows 26 δ b 0 11 l n 1 φ c r r a 0 61 the drag coefficient cd represents a key parameter to calculate the total drag force by vegetation determining cd is a challenging task due to its complex dependence on the macro and microstructure of vegetation arrays as well as flow characteristics ben meftah 2013 huai et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in the last decades several experimental theorical and numerical studies were conducted to predict the drag coefficient in vegetated channel flows recently liu et al 2020 provided a good summary of several methodologies used to measure the drag coefficient cd of emergent vegetation in open channel flows presenting a comprehensive list of existing predictors of cd the authors also proposed an innovative robust predictor of cd using genetic programming gp and machine learning ml techniques based on natural selection of large series of published data to find an easy expression predicting the drag coefficient in this study we aim to find out a relationship between cd and the reynolds number re 23 0 u 23 0 r 23 ν of the main channel area where u 23 0 and r 23 calculated based on eqs 6 and 14 using δ instead of δ and annulling ym ym 0 it is worth mentioning that re 23 0 is expressed as a function of variables that practitioners can easily define in fig 6 we plot the experimentally estimated values of cd table 1 obtained in the present study and previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 versus re 23 0 cd shows a decreasing trend with an increase of re 23 0 the best fit to the data leads to the following expression to predict the drag coefficient 27 c d 182 re 23 0 0 47 4 2 results of discharge prediction by applying idcm with a curved interface all the experiments of this study and the previous studies used to predict the flow discharges were of steady uniform and fully developed flow the channels have rectangular cross sections made of glass plexiglas and are characterized by fixed beds the roughness was identified in terms of a manning coefficient n considered constant and determined based on the nature of the material constituting each laboratory channel since the channel bed of the present study is covered with a plywood plaque fig 3 an equivalent manning roughness coefficient of n 0 013 was assumed whereas a value of n 0 01 was considered for both previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 the free surface slope s which is theoretically equal to the bed slope with a uniform flow was determined based on the measured flow velocity u2 of constant value through zone ii the average value of all runs of s is almost equal to 2x10 4 1x10 4 and 2x10 3 for the present study the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and that by caroppi 2018 respectively fig 7 shows a comparison between the measured and predicted applying the idcm method total discharges for the present study fig 7a and the previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 as shown in fig 7b and 7c respectively it is worth mentioning that the results depicted in fig 7 were obtained after testing different values of the curved interface line h to reach the best performance by varying the values of α between 0 and 1 and γ furthermore in the calculation procedure sect 2 2 δ was used instead of δ annulling ym and cd was estimated using eq 27 for the present study the values of α 0 20 λ 0 80 and γ 0 023 lead to the most accurate discharge prediction a good performance of the idcm method was also obtained with a similar value of γ 0 020 in a previous study by huthoff et al 2008 predicting flow discharges in a compound channel for the previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 the best idcm performances were achieved with values of α 0 39 γ 0 037 and α 0 10 γ 0 012 respectively according to tang 2019 the mean absolute percentage error mape of predicted discharge has already been used as a criterion for the method s accuracy and calculated as follows 28 e q q p q m q m 100 where eq is the percentage error of the predicted discharge qp is the predicted discharge and qm is the measured discharge in fig 7 the eq values of the different runs are shown above the histograms for the present study fig 7a eq shows for most runs a value 8 except for 5 runs where it varies between 13 and 23 the average value of eq for the 20 runs shown in fig 7a is slightly below 6 indicating the good performance of the idcm method white and nepf 2007 2008 in their original papers only indicated the range of discharge variation of their experiments the five measured discharges presented in fig 7b were estimated based on available detailed data runs i iv vi vii x of transversal distribution of the streamwise velocity depicted in the study by white and nepf 2008 despite the uncertainty in estimating the white and nepf s 2007 2008 measured discharges eq indicates four values less or equal to 9 and an average value of order 10 the predicted discharges shown in fig 7c also indicate good accuracy most of the values of eq vary between 0 and 10 giving an average value of 7 for all runs the application of the idcm method with α 0 20 and γ 0 023 values that led to the best idcm performance with the data of this study to the white and nepf s 2007 2008 and caroppi s 2018 data yields an average value of eq almost equals to 11 and 10 respectively here we notice that there is a slight variation of the average value of eq from 10 and 7 as best idcm performance with the data of white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 to 11 and 10 obtained with α 0 20 and γ 0 023 respectively this allows us to consider a value of α 0 23 λ 0 77 and γ 0 024 obtained averaging the α and γ values of best performances for the three analyzed datasets for the combined data hereafter we indicate by combined data the set of data of the present study and the studies of white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 treated together with α 0 23 and γ 0 024 we obtained an average value of eq of almost 6 with the present study 11 for both studies of nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 and 9 for the combined data fig 8 shows the results of the predicted and measured total discharges for the different datasets present study s white and nepf s 2007 2008 and caroppi s 2018 data applying the dcm method with the same values of α as in fig 7 note that with the dcm method the contribution of the apparent shear stress is not considered i e γ 0 as indicated by the subscript 0 in qt 0 fig 8 shows a significant underestimation of the predicted discharges compared to those measured most values of eq are higher than 30 for the three datasets used for analysis eq is of average value approximately equal to 29 30 and 33 for the present study with α 0 20 the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 with α 0 39 and that by caroppi 2018 with α 0 10 respectively with α 0 23 eq is almost equal to 28 35 and 25 for the present study the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and the study by caroppi 2018 respectively and it is approximately 29 for the combined data however it was observed that eq significantly decreases with a high value of α eq reaches a minimum average value approximately equal to 7 14 and 3 for the present study with α 0 90 λ 0 10 the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 with α 0 92 λ 0 08 and that of caroppi 2018 with α 0 62 λ 0 38 respectively with α 0 81 average of the three α values of 0 90 0 92 and 0 62 for the combined data eq is of average value approximately equal to 13 it is worth remembering that with α 0 23 and γ 0 024 the average value of eq applying the idcm method for the combined data is almost 9 this implies that the idcm method predicts more accurately the flow discharges than the dcm method table 2 shows a comparison between the performance of the idcm and dcm methods fig 9 shows a comparison between the predicted and measured normalized discharges in the three different subareas i e zone i zone ii zone iii both predicted and measured discharges are normalized by the total predicted discharge qt the data presented in fig 9 were obtained applying the idcm method with a curved interface plane of α 0 23 λ 0 77 and γ 0 024 the zonal predicted discharges were calculated using eqs 21 23 fig 9a shows the normalized discharges in the obstructed region zone i for all runs of the present study and the studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 the idcm method shows an overestimation of the discharge q 1 the data scattering in fig 9a may be due to the high uncertainty of both the measured velocity u1 and the drag coefficient estimation fig 9b shows the data of q 2 qt discharge in the free stream zone zone ii subject of constant velocity u 2 in this zone the idcm method underestimates the discharge q 2 by a value around 20 as shown by the deviated dashed line from the perfect fitted line solid line the good collapse of data onto a single curve in fig 9b reflects more precision in measuring the flow velocity u 2 fig 9c presents the normalized discharge q 3 qt in the shear layer zone zone iii despite the slight data scattering shown in fig 9c the predicted and measured discharges indicate a good correlation where most data collapse at and close to the perfect fitted line solid line it should be underlined that with α 0 50 we obtain the classic diagonal divisional channel method this division method showed low performance in predicting the total discharges compared to the curved division with α 0 50 for the combined data the idcm method with γ 0 02 gives an average value of eq approximately equal to 16 while the dcm method showed a value of almost 18 4 3 dependence of zonal discharges to the cross section characteristic parameters with the aim of finding practical expressions to predict the zonal flow discharges we conducted further analysis based on the channel sectional characteristic parameters figs 1 and 4 in fig 10 a we plot the normalized predicted discharge q 1 qt of the obstructed region zone i versus the dimensionless parameter 1 φ crra 0 1 it is worth point out that the predicted discharges presented in fig 10 are results of the idcm method with a curved interface of α 0 23 and γ 0 024 fig 10a shows a perfect collapse of the data from the different studies onto a single increasing curve a logarithmic regression of the combined data yields an empirical expression of coefficient of determination r2 0 99 to predict the discharge in the obstructed region q 1 as follows 29 q 1 q t 0 20 l n 1 φ c r r a 0 10 0 50 fig 10b shows the normalized predicted discharge q 2 qt in the free stream region zone ii plotted against the parameter 1 φ crra 0 5 fig 10b points out that q 2 qt systematically decreases as 1 φ crra 0 5 increases following an almost perfect trend a logarithmic regression of the combined data also leads to an empirical expression of coefficient of determination r2 0 99 for the discharge q 2 in the free stream region as follows 30 q 2 q t 0 17 l n 1 φ c r r a 0 50 0 20 since by continuity qt q 1 q 2 q 3 an expression to predict the discharge q 3 in the interface between the obstructed and unobstructed regions zone iii can be easily obtained based on eqs 29 and 30 as 31 q 3 q t 0 03 l n 1 φ c r r a 2 17 0 30 the prediction of zonal discharges is of crucial importance for many reasons i e determination of the flow velocity in each compartment expectation of possible erosion or deposition of solid materials river restoration and management hydraulic capacity improvement flow impact on ecological health the discharge predictors shown in eqs 29 31 are expressed as a function of variables that practitioners can easily define making them very simple to apply for partly vegetated channels especially after having defined the total discharge qt 4 4 results of discharge prediction with vertical interface based on the curved interface approach proposed in this study the vertical interface occurs when α 1 00 λ 0 00 here the peculiarity is that the length of the interface h becomes equal to the distance eo see fig 2 which is necessarily equal to the flow depth h it has been observed that by setting the value of α 1 the consideration of the apparent shear stress effect i e γ 0 has no impact on achieving better idcm performance the best performance in predicting the flow discharges was obtained with a value of γ 0 i e with the dcm method fig 11 illustrates a comparison between the predicted and measured total discharges for the present study and previous studies by white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 for the present study fig 11a most of the predicted discharges are comparable to those measured with an eq ranging between 1 and 12 the average value of eq of all the 19 runs is approximately equal to 10 which is almost double that obtained applying the idcm method with a curved surface of α 0 20 and γ 0 023 see table 2 fig 11b and 11c show significantly lower performances compared to the present study analyzing white and nepf s 2007 2008 and caroppi s 2018 data eq indicates an average value of approximately 12 and 28 with the dataset of white and nepf 2007 2008 and caroppi 2018 respectively the average value of eq for the combined data is of order 17 against a value of 9 and 13 table 2 obtained applying the idcm α 0 23 and γ 0 024 and dcm α 0 81 with curved interface plane respectively this implies that the curved divisional channel method shows better performance than classic vertical division fig 12 shows the predicted versus measured total discharges obtained applying the idcm and dcm methods with curved and vertical interface planes both the idcm and dcm with a curved interface show better performance in predicting channel discharges than the dcm with a vertical interface which overestimates most discharges by more than 20 as indicated by the dashed line in fig 12 with the consideration of a curved interface plane the best performance was achieved with the idcm method as can also be distinguished from table 2 4 5 vortical structure in the shear layer region analysis of the flow behavior in the shear layer region zone iii as shown in fig 13 shows the development of a clockwise vortex of a length scale of order δ width of zone iii fig 13 indicates that the secondary current cell occupies the largest cross section area of zone iii which is subject to considerable transverse momentum transfer this momentum transfer generates considerable apparent resistance affecting the flow velocity distribution and therefore the flow discharge through this zone the apparent resistance should be physically proportional to the cross section area subject to considerable transverse momentum transfer due to the dominated vortex structure in zone iii giving rise to consider a curved interface fig 2 to better represent the proportionality of this area defined above as λ to the total cross section area of zone iii a 3 the introduction of a curved interface approach is strongly confirmed by the best performance of the idcm method in predicting the flow discharges 5 conclusions in this study we adopted for the first time the idcm method to predict flow discharge in a partly vegetated channel with emergent rigid vegetation transverse momentum transfer was considered in terms of apparent shear stress acting on a curved interface plane in this study the choice of a curved interface approach was justified by the dominance of a vortical structure in the shear layer region it was observed that most of the interface area zone iii in this study is subject to the development of a typical vortex of a length scale on the order of the width of this interface area this study confirms that a curved divisional channel method better physically represents the effect of apparent resistance in the shear layer region the idcm method applied with a curved interface leads to find practical analytical expressions of the flow velocity on the main and obstructed subsections of a partly vegetated channel giving rise to discharge prediction to make these expressions simple and easily applicable by practitioners we proposed empirical formulas to predict the width of the interface zone and the drag coefficient due to vegetation stems characteristic parameters essential for the calculation procedure the idcm applied with a curved interface plane is characterized by two free coefficients α coefficient to define the interface curved length and γ interface coefficient for the apparent shear stress the flow discharge prediction based on laboratory experiments shows a sensitivity of the idcm method to α and γ values comparison of the different analyzed datasets shows that the best idcm performance was achieved with values of α and γ in the range 0 10 0 39 and 0 012 0 037 respectively the results of the combined data of the different laboratory experiments lead to better performance of idcm with α 0 23 and γ 0 024 the best performance of the dcm method was obtained with values of α ranging between 0 62 and 0 92 treating separately the data of the different studies and with α 0 81 for combined data based on the results achieved in this study the idcm method with a curved interface plane showed better performance in predicting the flow discharge in partly vegetated channels than the dcm method furthermore the idcm method applied with a curved interface also showed better performance than dcm with classic vertical or transversal division methods in this study we also proposed a series of expressions easily applicable to predict the zonal discharges of the different characteristic subareas in a partly vegetated channel further sophisticated experiments in partly vegetated channels are recommended for future studies to determine more accurate values of the characteristic coefficients α and γ credit authorship contribution statement mouldi ben meftah
