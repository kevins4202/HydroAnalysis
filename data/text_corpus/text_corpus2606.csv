photocatalyst for the photodegradation of phenanthrene in wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons encapsulated go zno nanocomposite photocatalytic degradation uv visible light phenanthrene 1 introduction environmental issues such as water pollution have become a global hazard for economic growth and human health over several decades leading to a sustained research effort in environmental remediation 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are long lasting compounds that can accrue in animals and plants as they move up the food chain as a result pahs were discovered in a wide range of marine habitats including polluted water treatment facilities underground water and saltwater 2 3 organic chemicals and heavy metals in the water have wreaked havoc on aquatic life and ecosystems 4 the international agency for research on cancer has identified pahs as likely carcinogens posing a risk to human health and ecosystems furthermore the us environmental protection agency usepa has categorized some pahs as primary regulated pollutants 5 the name phenanthrene is created from different terms phenyl and anthracene previously known as benzene as a recognized contaminant it has been studied extensively in many matrices phenanthrene was the most prevalent pah in tap water accounting for around one third of the sixteen usepa priority pahs according to one reported article 6 a considerable amount of phenanthrene was released into the environment by manufacturing coke liquefaction of fossil fuels and volcanic eruptions 7 phenanthrene s ozonation products cause hepatic toxicity than phenanthrene itself with the probable impact of nephrotoxicity 8 as a result of this compound s widespread distribution and destructive potential it is critical to tracked it down and remove it from the ecosystem given the threats or concerns posed by specific pahs and associated metabolites hourly needs for sophisticated water treatment systems that are effective cheap and or convenient to control have evolved 9 the discovery of effective methods for removing phenanthrene from aqueous solutions has garnered considerable interest during the last few decades numerous approaches including chemical oxidation microbial degradation phytoremediation adsorption and chemical precipitation have been used 10 however the adsorbent used in the adsorption process is crucial for maximizing the removal method s efficiency 11 multi walled carbon nanotubes have a greater capacity for adsorption due to their interior tube cavity s unique layout and hydrophobic surface 12 along with conventional adsorbents graphene oxide multifunctional nanocomposites mesoporous molecules and electric nanofibrous membranes have been employed as effective adsorbents for phenanthrene removal from aqueous solutions 13 nevertheless nanocomposite materials with a rising water dispersibility might affect the possibility of secondary pollution additionally using standard methods such as filtration and centrifugation recovering the nanocomposite from the processed aqueous matrix may result in material damage 14 the employment of classic separation technologies in a large scale actual water purification process may extend the time and monetary expenditure that is incompatible with the application of sustainable chemistry 2 to solve these concerns photocatalytic degradation is a method that is ecologically friendly and results in no secondary pollution particularly when a variety of pollutants are efficiently degraded reactive oxygen species have been linked to the degradation of pollutants carbon based compounds like graphene fullerenes carbon nanotubes and activated carbon have demonstrated promise because of their potential to mix with heterojunction compounds to boost photo efficiency the development of multifunctional photocatalytic materials has been greatly aided by the use of graphene and its derivatives 15 16 zinc oxide zno is one of the common catalysts with its greater exciton binding energy 60 mev larger intrinsic electron motility 300 cm2 vs and broad bandgap 3 37 ev zno semiconductors were employed as an excellent catalyst to remove organic contaminants zno is a better catalyst than tio2 17 zno s varied one and two dimensional nanostructures may be generated hydrothermally by altering the ph according to kumaresan et al 18 the ph values of 7 9 11 and 13 were used to introduce hexagonal discs spindle nanorods and floral nanorods the combination of holes and electrons is a key issue that has a negative impact on the efficiency of zno based photocatalysts limiting their effectiveness as a result multiple tactics were used to inhibit electron hole recombination and increase zno s photocatalytic effectiveness one of the effective methods was the addition of go and metal nanoparticles to boost the photocatalytic efficiency of the material 19 it was also discovered that microwave irradiation might be used to make go cuo nanocomposites and the impact of go on the photocatalytic performance of the cuo catalyst for deterioration of organic pollutants after 60 min of ultraviolet irradiation was investigated the generated go cuo nanocomposite was shown to be 4 48 times more efficient than pure cuo additionally it is discovered that raising the go ratio accelerates deterioration 20 this is primarily owing to the synergetic impact of go and metal oxides on electron hole dissociation but also because the occurrence of go enhanced the probability of adsorption of contaminants on the nanocomposite s surface 21 22 because of the ability of noble metals to promote photoactivity the use of noble metal hybrids in semiconductor photocatalysts has received considerable interest recently 23 hybrid photocatalysts with various go zno weight ratios were manufactured by zhang et al 24 using a hydrothermal method it was discovered that when exposed to organic contamination go composite had a more significant photodegradation potential than zno under uv irradiation the go zno nanoparticles had more efficiency than zno itself zno photocatalytic activity could be improved by using go because of its excellent phenanthrene degradation and charge separation capabilities 25 26 distinct porous structure electrochemical characteristics acidity and adsorbing capacity make carbonaceous materials a significant asset in the field graphene activated carbon and carbon nanotubes are among the products that fall under this category of materials one of the advanced applications of carbon based composites is the removal of water pollutants by methods like photocatalysis and adsorption the integration of graphene and zno is expected to be suitable for delivering superior photocatalytic efficiency due to the combined graphene structure which allows charge separation for photocatalysis 27 because of their outstanding properties zno nanoparticles are ideally suited for this approach 28 meanwhile go has increased interest as it has the same properties as graphene and unique surface structures for the manufacture of go containing nanomaterials in conjunction with the added carboxyl and hydroxyl groups 29 because of their vast applicability in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation semiconducting oxide nanocatalysts were chosen as the subject of this research 30 an effective water disinfection solution was therefore needed semiconductor mediated photocatalysis is a desirable water disinfection technique because it uses renewable sunlight produces no hazardous pollutants and operates at room temperature 31 in this work a photocatalytic method for removing phenanthrene from contaminated water in the presence of uv visible irradiation using go zno nanoparticles has been explored many parameters such as photocatalyst dose ph phenanthrene concentration and reaction kinetics were determined to achieve maximum degradation separate studies were also performed in dark conditions and in the presence of uv visible irradiation to validate enhanced photocatalytic activity of go zno through photo induced electron transfer among metallic ions as well as phenanthrene by detecting byproducts in uv visible light exposed samples degradation pathways were shown the nanocomposite has been characterized by ft ir uv vis drs xrd sem with edx bet tem and raman spectroscopy as a result the effectiveness of the photocatalyst was thoroughly studied concerning several factors such as phenanthrene concentration the dosage of go zno nanocomposite ph reaction kinetics and reusability green synthesis and photocatalytic efficacy for eliminating phenanthrene from go zno nanocomposite are unreported in the literature so far because of its widespread dispersion and hazardous potential this molecule must be tracked and eliminated from the environment to our knowledge rice husk derived go zno nanocomposite has never been tested as a possible photocatalyst under ultraviolet visible irradiation to aid in the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene the greatest photodegradation efficiency was calculated in comparison to previous research and minor by products are identified using gc ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials methanol and phenanthrene 97 were purchased from fisher scientific sodium nitrate nano3 99 0 from bendosen laboratory chemicals zinc oxide zno was obtained from sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid hcl potassium hydroxide koh potassium

preparation of rice husk derived graphite powder the graphite powder production from rice husk was carried out in the manner reported by muramatsu et al 32 in which 4 to 5 g of raw rice husk was pulverized and treated for 2 h at 400 c in a carbolite furnace rice husk ash rha was the solid residue recovered the rha was then chemically activated by impregnating it with koh at a 1 2 impregnation ratio following that the blend was compressed in a ceramic crucible to begin the crucible was inserted into the midst of a bigger ceramic crucible the gap surrounding the ceramic crucible was filled by packaging and compressing the atoning rha adequately the atoning rha is utilized to protect the blend to counter oxidation when exposed to air at elevated temperatures for 2 h the crucibles were warmed up to 800 c following completion of the chemical activation process post treatment was performed the chemically triggered rha was soaked in 50 ml distilled water for 30 min and agitated to remove any remaining potassium ions for 15 min the mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm the mixture was then ultrasonicated in 100 ml of distilled water for 3 min at 50 amplitude following that the mixture was washed in 50 ml distilled water through suction filtering via a 0 22 mm pore size ptfe membrane following that the product was kept for 12 h at 80 c in a drying oven 2 2 2 synthesis of graphene oxide go go was manufactured through modified hummer s process using graphite powder generated from rice husk in a conventional process 100 ml of 98 h2so4 was poured to 0 5 g of graphite powder and stirred continuously for 1 h at 0 c in an ice bath within 2 h the solution was progressively supplemented with 2 5 g of nano3 and 1 5 g of kmno4 as mentioned earlier at the defined times following that the solution was agitated for 24 h at a temperature of 25 c before being diluted with 200 ml deionized water following that kmno4 was flushed out with 6 ml of h2o2 33 for 2 h the blend was stirred continuously with a magnetic agitator and magnetic bar the mixture was noticed to be dark brown in color purification of the final product was monitored by a wash with deionized water as far as the ph reached 7 followed by 12 h of drying at 80 c in an oven the mixture was then stored in an airtight container for practical usage after dispersing the go in purified water to a concentration of 1 g l it was ultrasonically exfoliated for 3 h to obtain go nanostructures 34 2 2 3 synthesis of graphene oxide zinc oxide go zno nanocomposite for 2 h go was dissolved in an ethanol solution and labelled as go solution in the zno solution the zno nanoparticles dissolved in the methanol and chloroform combination were ultrasonicated for 2 h chloroform and methanol are typically mixed at a ratio of about 8 9 zno nanoparticles can be dissolved in a clear solution by balancing the volumetric ratio of the two solvents for 24 h the zno solution and the go solution were mixed and stirred continuously centrifugation and methanol cleaning numerous times were used to extract the residue the product was freeze dried overnight and marked as go zno nanomaterials 35 36 2 3 characterization of nanocomposites the prepared go zno nanocomposites were reported by xrd bruker d8 advance equipped with cu k α 1 radiation tube wavelength 1 54056 å a sem zeiss model dsm 960 paired with edx germany and tem zeiss libra 120 field emission electron microscope pleasanton ca usa was used to investigate photocatalyst structure particle size and surface morphology the uv visible spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 25 usa was used to study uv vis drs spectra bet was employed to measure the surface area by autosorb i quantachrome corporation usa ftir spectroscopy was used to confirm the bonding between the various constituents of go zno nanocomposites by nicolet is10 smart omni transmission thermo scientific madison wi usa the structural characteristics of the produced graphite go and go zno nanocomposite were investigated using raman spectroscopy renishaw invia raman microscope uk 2 4 photocatalytic action this study evaluated the photocatalytic activity of green synthesized go zno nanocomposites 100 mg in the breakdown of phenanthrene introduced to synthetic water 25 ppm a solution was magnetically agitated for 45 min in the dark to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium before exposure to uv vis light for 120 min at room temperature and pressure 10 ml min of air bubbles were used in the experiment every 20 min 2 ml of solution was collected and filtered through 0 22 m polyether sulfone syringe filters to remove the photocatalyst the concentration of phenanthrene 5 30 ppm go zno nanocomposite 1 4 g l and ph 3 30 11 were studied to improve removal supernatants obtained from optimized samples were eventually examined using a uv spectrophotometer to estimate the percentage depreciation of phenanthrene in the samples the phenanthrene concentration was determined using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer with a maximum absorbance wavelength of 295 nm the aqueous phase concentration of phenanthrene was employed in this investigation the free to total phenanthrene ratio was originally considered to remain constant throughout the photocatalytic degradation process allowing for the complete adjustment of the adsorption desorption equilibrium byproducts of phenanthrene degradation were identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms qp2010 ultra bpx5 column with helium as carrier gas besides the studies investigating the influence of ph on photocatalysis the overall ph of the phenanthrene solution in the remaining decomposition trials was around 6 80 without any ph alteration 37 to compute the photocatalytic degradation efficiency the following eq 1 was utilized 1 degradation efficiency co ct co 100 where co represents the initial concentration of phenanthrene and ct represents the concentration of phenanthrene at a time t with the help of eq 2 we were able to determine the degradation rate constants kobs of phenanthrene under different situations 2 ln c o c t k obs t it was necessary to extract the go zno photocatalyst and wash it with methanol and distilled water before freezing it and using it for the next cycle to determine the regeneration and reusability of the go zno nanocomposite four cycles of studies were investigated to assess the stability and reusability of the go zno photocatalyst 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ftir analysis the ft ir study provides the qualitative characteristics of the oxygen group within the go spectrum fig 1 a shows the spectrum for graphite go and go zno nanocomposite respectively the bending and stretching vibrations of the cooh group at 2390 61 cm 1 the cc peak at 1636 44 cm 1 and the c oh group at 3445 67 cm 1 matched with the carbon content of graphite that were discovered in the graphite spectrum the peaks detected between 1209 13 cm 1 and 1099 19 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibrations on graphene oxide revealing skeletal vibrations from the unoxidized graphitic domain co2 expands into the crevices among graphene sheets during fast warming resulting in the appearance of the co at 1675 91 cm 1 in the go spectrum this is due to the exfoliation mechanism bera et al 38 discovered that the absence of any major peak in the ftir spectra of graphite showed the chemical inertness of bulk graphite because of water molecules received via ambient exposure and hydrogen from the unextractable water molecules both c oh and cooh are likely to be formed as binding elements the carbonyl groups that remain after the contraction process are responsible for the co stretching vibrations seen at 1099 19 cm 1 thema et al 39 studied that the peeling of the graphitic structure is primarily responsible for the exfoliation process which allows oxygen to enter the cell during the oxidation process consequently the go spectra revealed four distinct peaks at 1209 13 cm 1 1099 19 cm 1 1675 91 cm 1 and 1430 95 cm 1 corresponding to the epoxy co alkoxy co carbonyl co and tertiary c oh functional groups the peak at 3391 33 cm 1 is ascribed to the oh bond stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups residual sp2 bonds in go may be indicated by a peak at 1538 96 cm 1 the prominent peak at 3633 33 cm 1 in the go zno nanocomposite spectrum could be ascribed to the oh stretching vibration of the c oh groups and water in contrast the peak at 671 07 cm 1 could be attributed to the zno stretching vibration the peaks at 1750 cm 1 and 1650 95 cm 1 determine the co stretching bonds are seen in the go zno nanocomposite spectrum the shifting of the co stretching bond in the go zno nanocomposite spectrum was possible due to composite formation studied by chauhan et al 40 3 1 2 uv vis drs analysis as illustrated in fig 1 b the absorbance spectra of the go zno nanocomposite exhibit a peak at 230 23 nm corresponding to the go sheet incorporated in the nanocomposite and another peak at 376 55 nm corresponding to zno zno does not absorb the visible light range of the spectrum but go absorbs the entire solar spectrum the absorbance spectrum of zno exhibits a distinct peak at around 354 nm which corresponds to the fundamental band gap absorption of zno azarang et al 41 studied that the absorbance peak of zno was shifted from 354 to 376 55 nm owing to a small alteration in the nanostructure of commercial zno the absorbance peak of go at 232 nm is due to the π π transition of aromatic cc which occurs at this wavelength umar et al 42 have reported a similar study describing π π transition of aromatic cc which occurred nearly at the same wavelength zhong et al 43 examined the composites spectra and discovered an absorption peak at nearly the same wavelength that could be ascribed to the absorption of zno particles attached to the surface as a result the absorbance efficiency of the go zno nanocomposite is greater than that of commercial zno as demonstrated by the absorption spectrum the enhanced absorption efficiency is advantageous for optoelectronic applications including photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene the synthesized go zno nanocomposite bandgap value was estimated by plotting αhν 2 versus photon energy hν curve following kubelka munk theory the following eq 3 has been used to calculate the optical band gap 3 αhν a hν eg n where α denotes the absorption coefficient of the catalyst a is an energy independent constant hν is photon energy eg is bandgap energy and n is a constant defining the kind of optical transition n 1 2 for direct permitted transition the bandgap of the go zno nanocomposite was 3 16 ev as shown in fig 2 however huang et al 44 theoretically projected a bandgap rise from 0 11 to 3 0 ev by progressively and partially converting graphene to graphene oxide go owing to oxygen incorporation in graphene increasing from 6 25 to 50 norlida et al 45 projected that zno would be one of the most significant metal oxides due to its distinctive broad and wide bandgap 3 37 ev and high exciton binding energy 60 mev therefore increased charge carrier concentration in a go sheet reduces the bandgap energy the go zno nanocomposite has a lower bandgap allowing it to better use sunlight s photon energy in forming electron hole pairs resulting in more significant photocatalytic activity 3 1 3 xrd analysis fig 1 c shows the xrd patterns of graphite go and go zno nanocomposite the characteristic peaks of graphite were seen at 2θ 24 9 which corresponded to diffraction plane 222 a similar study was shown by umar et al 42 where a diffused peak band of graphite appeared in the same diffraction plane the go sheet s characteristic plane 001 is reflected in the diffraction peak at 2θ value 13 08 nearly same diffraction peak was determined by hu et al 46 corresponded to the diffraction plane 001 the xrd pattern of the go zno nanocomposite indicated the existence of zno peaks at each point the appearance of the diffraction peak at 2θ 10 6 corresponded to the diffraction plane 001 of the go sheet in contrast the xrd pattern of commercial zno demonstrated the presence of zno peaks at 2θ 33 8 and 35 7 respectively representing planes 002 and 101 it has been studied by azarang et al 47 that it is possible to link all peaks to the zno hexagonal wurtzite structure jcpds card no 00 036 1451 chauhan et al 40 studied that zno nanoparticles have exfoliated and entrapped pristine go layers as seen by the shifting of the go peak in the purest form of go sheets are piled on top of one another however following doping and sonication with zno solution the stack collapsed and the sheets disintegrated additionally zno nanoparticles can be embedded into the interlayers of graphene oxide sheets 3 1 4 raman analysis the raman analysis of the synthesized materials is shown in fig 1 d generally two key elements the d and g bands describe the raman spectrum of any graphene based materials the d band at approximately raman shift of 1330 cm 1 represents the breathing mode of aromatic rings caused by defects in the samples during oxidation cancado et al 48 studied that the d band is caused by six atom ring breathing modes and is activated by a defect occurred at nearly the same raman shift in contrast the g band at approximately raman shift of 1575 cm 1 is caused by first order scattering of e2g phonons by the sp2 atom ring resulting from the breathing mode of j point photons with a1g symmetry the g band is associated with the brillouin zone s e2g phonon at the same raman shift studied by fan et al 49 the raman spectrum of as prepared graphite by rice husk serves as the benchmark for all other processed samples which exhibited the d band and g band at 1330 cm 1 and 1575 cm 1 respectively the raman spectra of go exhibits two prominent distinctive peaks corresponding to d band and g band at around 1340 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 respectively how et al 50 studied that the d band appears while g band comes from in plane vibrations of sp2 carbon atoms and a doubly generated phonon mode because of the layering of go sheets and the reduction in the functional group in the case of go zno nanocomposite these peaks are widened but have less intensity than in pure go the e2 high vibration mode and e2l b1h fundamental phonon modes of hexagonal zno are represented by the peaks at around 500 cm 1 and 730 cm 1 in the spectra of go zno nanocomposite respectively shah et al 51 demonstrated a similar investigation in which the peaks match the e2l b1h fundamental phonon modes of hexagonal zno 3 1 5 sem and edx analysis as depicted in fig 3 the scanning electron micrograph morphology reveals go sheets an intact go mass and an independent flat go mass with crumples at a magnification of 10 000 times fig 3 a reveals folding and overlapping as well as a huge interspace between graphene oxide s narrower margins the graphic demonstrates that during the annealing process the differential thermal factors between graphene sheets and the substrate decreased whereas the go sheets coincided identically in fig 3 b at 15 000 times magnification they appeared slippery and there was no interspace between the graphene oxide s narrower margins fig 3 c shows that a large quantity of zno nanoparticles has been situated over and agglomerated with go nanosheets furthermore the images revealed that the zno nanoparticles were distributed with a high degree of homogeneity fig 3 d depicts the compact go sheets that have been adorned with multiple zno nanosheets that have been arranged in various orientations al rawashdeh et al 19 studied that the presence of nanosheets might boost the surface area of the produced nanomaterial leading to enhanced adsorption capability edx elemental analyses of photocatalyst go shows around 27 29 carbon by weight and 72 71 oxygen by weight as shown in fig 3 e and f according to the edx go zno contains around 27 61 zn by weight 54 48 o by weight and a 17 91 c content as shown in fig 3 g fig 3 h shows the elemental composition of zno which is primarily composed of zn 62 62 o 31 36 and carbon 6 02 by weight 3 1 6 tem and bet analysis transmission electron microscopy images of the go zno nanocomposite are depicted in fig 4 a massive go nanosheet with a nanometer scale size has been discovered near the apex of the framework as shown in fig 4 a in which it exhibits complete transparency and undulated silk wave expressions the creases and crumpled areas are due to go but the tiny spots distributed over go nanosheet are due to zno particles as shown in fig 4 b as a result the nanosheet of go and zno in the nanocomposite is approved by both images the elimination propensity of the nanomaterial was assumed to be reliant on its surface area the bet technique was used to measure the surface area of the go zno nanocatalyst material after heating the sample to 250 c to eliminate any adsorbed moisture nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm versus relative pressure at 77 k was performed the findings of this experiment reveal a type iv isotherm which indicates that the nanostructured material is porous as shown in fig 5 a and b shows bjh barrett joyner halenda pore size distribution for go zno nanocomposite mesoporosity with pore condensation at increased pressure is suggested by the hysteresis loop the bet surface area of the go zno nanocomposite was computed from the amount of monolayer of nitrogen gas adsorbed it was found to be 15 39845 m2 g based on the quantity of monolayer of nitrogen gas adsorbed the photocatalytic process was aided by these structures large surface areas which allowed for more light absorption 52 likewise the go zno nanocomposite has an average pore size of 5 07 nm the decrease in surface area and average pore size is due to go sheets that prevent the dendritic petals of zno nanoparticles from being exposed 3 2 assessment of photocatalytic activity within 120 min of direct uv visible light irradiation the maximum degradation was reached at 25 ppm phenanthrene concentration a definite amount of nanocomposite 100 mg and a ph value of 6 80 it is necessary to note that when optimizing each parameter the others were maintained constant under optimal circumstances the highest photocatalytic removal capability of go zno nanocomposite with swirling was 86 06 followed by photolysis no photocatalyst 15 56 go zno without swirling 40 28 go zno in dark with stirring 47 40 and commercial zno 62 84 as shown in fig 6 a this effect is described to the go zno nanocomposite s high surface area 15 39845 m2 g as well as its sharp morphology and crystallinity in the case of pure phenanthrene without go zno nanocomposites there is a modest drop in the photocatalytic efficiency of phenanthrene upon ultraviolet visible light irradiation suggesting that phenanthrene is barely destroyed in the absence of a photocatalyst under ultraviolet visible light in a blank photocatalysis experiment the degradation rate was just 15 56 as shown in fig 6 b it was evident that as the irradiation period increases the concentrations of phenanthrene drop demonstrating that all these materials exhibit photocatalytic activity for phenanthrene degradation as illustrated in fig 6 b the enhanced degradation of phenanthrene revealed the photocatalytic efficacy of the go zno nanostructured materials in the presence of ultraviolet visible light 86 06 for phenanthrene compared to the dark 40 50 for phenanthrene due to its high bet surface area the go zno nanocomposite could only adsorb phenanthrene throughout its surface in the absence of uv visible light when the photoactive catalyst is exposed to light it experiences electronic excitation resulting in the formation of successive oh radicals and electron hole pairs in the presence of o2 and h2o due to the integration of two metal oxides go and zno with discrete band gaps charge carriers created in situ may be able to survive in transition bands for a longer period rachna et al 53 also studied that charge separation is strengthened due to doping or coupling charge recombination is prevented allowing e and h to reside in the conduction and valence bands for a more extended period this discovery strengthened the case for enormous oh generation to efficiently degrade the bulky and toxic phenanthrene as shown in fig 7 a probable photodegradation mechanism might be explained using the following eqs 4 9 4 uv visible light go zno go zno h e 5 go zno h e zno h go e 6 go e o 2 o 2 7 zno h h 2 o oh h 8 o 2 h 2 o oh h o o 2 9 oh phenanthrene c o 2 h 2 o mineralized products 3 2 1 effect of phenanthrene concentration it can be shown that the as manufactured go zno photocatalyst might achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium in the dark condition for 45 min as demonstrated in fig 8 a maximal phenanthrene degradation was achieved at 25 ppm concentration this could be because the catalyst has a higher proportion of surface sites available for the minimum concentration of phenanthrene compounds at greater concentrations the deterioration rate was reduced one probable explanation is that when the concentration of photons entering the solution grew the route length of photons entering the solution reduced affecting the photodegradation capability of the catalyst furthermore phenanthrene molecules might absorb a considerable quantity of light at greater concentrations than the photocatalyst shanker et al 54 also studied that when the concentration was increased the surface area of the photocatalyst gets constrained reducing the catalyst reactant ratio and therefore reduce the efficiency of phenanthrene adsorption 3 2 2 effect of go zno dosage nanocomposite dose had a significant impact on the degradation of the carcinogenic phenanthrene as depicted in fig 8 b at first glance an increase in degradation produced by the addition of go zno up to 2 g l may be explained by enhanced accessibility of surface sites rachna et al 53 conducted a similar investigation demonstrating that the active sites on the surface of nanocatalysts are believed to be responsible for the photodegradation of organic contaminants an increased number of sites on the photocatalyst surface may contribute to forming a significant number of oh radicals which were previously linked to an increase in degradation the modest decline in the graph with increasing catalyst loading i e 3 g l and 4 g l is due to particle accumulation in the confined container resulting in a constrained exposed surface area for phenanthrene adsorption kasiri et al 55 discovered that when the nanocatalyst concentration increases the solid particles gradually impede photon penetration reducing the total number of photons reaching h2o2 molecules as a result the efficiency with which oh radicals are produced diminishes rani et al 56 also demonstrated that due to the screening effect of the catalyst particles on the light source light penetration may be hindered uv visible 3 2 3 effect of ph it should be noted that ph is a significant parameter in the photodegradation analysis of organic molecules for the breakdown of phenanthrene 25 ppm a wide ph range 3 11 was explored aqueous solutions with ph variations of 3 4 3 6 8 9 3 and 10 5 were obtained as shown in fig 8 c the photodegradation of phenanthrene was greatest at basic ph 96 44 than in neutral ph 86 06 and least at acidic ph 15 06 ph 6 8 was considered as optimum ph because it was the original ph of the solution without doing any modifications in the solution however the results were better at ph 10 5 because we modified a solution by adding few drops of sodium hydroxide to achieve better results hence to check the trend in acidic neutral and basic condition we modified the solution for comparative study these occurrences could be linked to a variety of factors rani et al 57 demonstrated that first the acidic character of go zno photocatalyst was enhanced by the coupling of zno by go second photocatalytic degradation was reduced due to ion screening at acidic and basic ph due to the secondary interactions created by the hydroxyl chlorate and hydronium ions furthermore at acidic ph the parallelism in charges between the photocatalyst and phenanthrene created repulsion among molecules bechambi et al 58 investigated that photocatalysts and phenanthrene do not repel each other at basic ph which might also illustrate that basic ph results are significantly better the high π electron density of phenanthrenes contributes to their chemical stability when these π electrons encountered the positive surface of nanocatalysts they may form cation π complexes with the catalysts reported by shanker et al 59 it is also possible to initiate secondary contacts chlorate ion catalyst and hydroxyl hydroxyl interactions by adding hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to acidic and basic solutions accordingly this may limit the contact that is intended due to acidic solutions the synergistic impact creation of massive e h pairs the maximum surface activity and the restricted recombination of charge carriers the overall degradation was substantial at basic ph investigated by rani et al 60 3 2 4 reaction kinetics under optimal circumstances 2 g l go zno 6 80 ph and uv visible light the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene 25 ppm obeyed first order kinetics as seen in the ln co ct v s time curve in fig 9 the rapid degradation of phenanthrene within 120 min demonstrates this phenomenon clearly 86 06 of initially spiked phenanthrene as previously stated the slope of the fitted straight line represents the reaction s observed rate constant kobs kobs value with correlation coefficient r2 was obtained for phenanthrene degradation by go zno nanocomposite 0 0375 min 1 0 9903 followed by commercial zno 0 0186 min 1 0 9348 go zno in dark with stirring 0 0129 min 1 0 9547 and go zno without stirring 0 0104 min 1 0 9695 the go zno nanocomposite s higher rate constant suggests improved photocatalysis and phenanthrene degradation the experimentally determined values of the rate constant half life correlation coefficient and degradation efficiency for various catalysts are listed in table 1 3 3 photocatalytic degradation pathways of phenanthrene using go zno nanocomposite phenanthrene degradation on go zno surface under optimal conditions produced a variety of minor and relatively safe products through oxidation or hydrolysis as shown in fig 10 electronic excitation of highly reactive oh radicals under uv visible light degraded phenanthrene into more minor byproducts the photooxidation of phenanthrene produced byproducts with a higher molecular weight in the total ion chromatogram as shown in fig 10 a and b initially it was considered that the tiny peak equivalent to 3 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid 1 m z 188 05 was generated by hydroxylation of the sterically restricted ring of precursor phenanthren 9 ol and subsequent ring breakage by oxidization benzene 1 2 4 triol 1a m z 126 03 may be formed due to further ring opening and hydroxylation of the byproduct 1 which is a monocyclic molecule rachna et al 56 also investigated the generation of same monocyclic degradation byproduct by further ring opening and hydroxylation additionally z 3 hydroxyacrylic acid 1b and z 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid 1c m z 100 were formed as minor byproducts rani et al 61 studied that these products were subsequently oxidized as a result of the assault of oh h and o2 fig 10 c illustrates the overall degradation pathways for phenanthrene 4 comparison with other catalysts table 2 shows that different nanomaterials employed for photocatalytic degradation to remove phenanthrene go zno nanomaterials degraded phenanthrene at a rate of 86 06 to 96 44 and doped zno reduced its half life from 66 min to 18 min in 120 min owing to their dual properties as semiconductors and good adsorbents in addition go zno nanocomposites were more efficient in the quick and quantitative breakdown of phenanthrene 86 06 into smaller and nontoxic compounds than other methods with the benefits of two semiconductors go zno can produce more oh radicals and greater electrical excitation furthermore go zno photocatalytic efficiency can be improved by reducing the recombination of charge carriers as an added benefit go zno nanocomposites have an excellent compatibility enduring charge carriers greater surface areas a cumulative effect and a low bandgap the tio2 graphene composite p25 gr removed phenanthrene from amorphous areas with enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic activity hydrothermal processes were used to produce p25 gr photocatalysts with varied gr addition ratios due to its selective adsorption capabilities and improved charge transfer the p25 2 5 gr displayed supremacy in removing phenanthrene the composite demonstrated increased photocatalytic effectiveness at extremely high phenanthrene concentrations 2 0 4 0 g ml and in basic media in addition the detection of intermediates revealed the conditional declination pathways for phenanthrene 65 co deposited titanate nanotubes co tnts 600 with titanium oxide p25 as a precursor were used in a bi step progression for efficient phenanthrene photocatalytic oxidation beginning with the hydrothermal process at 150 c followed by the calcination process at 600 c the phenomenal photocatalytic activity was revealed by co tnts 600 which showed 98 6 extraction of roughly 1 g l dosage in 12 h of sunlight exposure the initial kinetic model was able to correctly comprehend the dynamic information provided by the experiment study results suggest a probable rate constant of 0 39 h 1 which is 23 times more than the titanate nanotubes tnts and 10 times greater than p25 calcination crystallization and co deposition combined to provide the remarkable synergistic impact of co tnts 600 phenanthrene photocatalysis was shown to be equivalent to that of some photocatalysts due to the enhanced activity of the co tnts 600 2 2 dicarboxaldehyde and 1 1 biphenyl 2 2 dicarboxylic acid were expected to be mineralized intermediate products 66 sol gel and calcination methods have already yielded a specific type of wo3 tio2 sio2 nanocomposite photocatalyst in addition more than seven times more photocatalytic activity in visible light than commercial tio2 was demonstrated for phenanthrene oxidation by the freshly prepared photocatalyst p25 degradation of phenanthrene made 9 phenanthrenol 9 phenanthrenol and 9 10 phenanthrenedione based on these compounds and density functional theory dft measurements they figured out the degradation pathway of phenanthrene 68 however the synthesized go zno nanocomposite has a 100 nm average diameter hexagonal wurtzite structure with good crystallinity the nanocomposites absorb up to 96 of the entire intensity of the light source employed in the experiment which has a primary emission wavelength of 395 nm the go zno nanocomposite synthesis process used in this study is simple uncomplicated and low cost it does not exhibit greater temperature or pressure enabling a more extensive range of substrates and suggesting a better likelihood of scalability in the economy after 120 min of irradiation with a uv visible light source at 395 nm up to 96 of the phenanthrene in aqueous solution was degraded using the produced go zno nanocomposite as photocatalyst for the photodegradation of phenanthrene solutions however no substantial degradation of phenanthrene was found in the absence of the photocatalyst the reproducibility of the experimental procedures was assessed and a very consistent result was obtained suggesting that the experimental data produced was very reliable 5 reusability of the photocatalyst the reusability of synthesized go zno nanocomposites was used to investigate their operational stability viability and efficiency the catalyst was recovered and reused in subsequent cycles via filtration as demonstrated in fig 11 the breakdown rate of phenanthrene after four recycling trials was still maintained at 85 only around 1 loss showing that go zno displayed excellent stability during the operation of photocatalytic degradation kumar et al 73 also studied that the modest decline of degradation efficiency can occur from the buildup of certain oxidation products at the catalyst s surface consequently inhibiting numerous active sites of the catalyst it was clear that the recycled samples had not undergone any significant phase or structural changes indicating that go zno is exceptionally stable considering the results as mentioned earlier go zno nanocomposite had remarkable reusability and stability and showed considerable promise for practical use the easy preparation of go zno nanocomposite its vast raw material supply and lack of noble metals make it an attractive photocatalyst in addition the material s high redox ability allows it to achieve outstanding degrading performance for the target pollutants at low dosages significantly lowering the material s cost of application furthermore the photocatalyst operates effectively across a broad ph range demonstrating its potential for adaptation to complicated water quality thus go zno nanocomposite offers practical utility in the removal of pollutants as a visible light responsive catalyst 6 conclusions a novel green go zno nanocomposite photocatalyst using rice husk with a homogeneous configuration and inclusion was successfully synthesized the photocatalyst exhibited a high absorption coefficient in the ultraviolet visible region by enhancing electron mobility heterojunction formation between go and zno aided electron hole severance and increased photocatalytic efficacy this go zno nanocomposite synthesized from rice husk exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity comparable to other photocatalyst arrangements beneath comparable situations even after four photocatalysis cycles the go zno nanocomposite removed nearly 85 of phenanthrene demonstrating its excellent stability and reusability for practical applications go zno had the highest photocatalytic removal 86 06 under optimal conditions 6 80 ph uv visible light radiation and phenanthrene concentration of 25 ppm this is because the go zno nanocomposite has a greater surface area 15 39845 m2 g with average pore size of 5 07 nm and is more stable when compared to other nanomaterials go zno nanocomposites exhibit enhanced charge separation and visible light excitation phenanthrene was proficiently degraded using the nanocomposites prepared via adsorption cum first order degradation kinetics comprising semiconductor mechanisms the improved interactions of excited charge pairs e and h with h2o and o2 led to the production of a significant number of oh radicals which photodegraded the phenanthrene to minor products and eventually culminated in mineralization declaration of

40 28 go zno in the dark with stirring 47 40 and commercial zno 62 84 this is due to the largest surface area which was enhanced by the doping of go in commercial zno phenanthrene photodegradation by

photocatalyst for the photodegradation of phenanthrene in wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons encapsulated go zno nanocomposite photocatalytic degradation uv visible light phenanthrene 1 introduction environmental issues such as water pollution have become a global hazard for economic growth and human health over several decades leading to a sustained research effort in environmental remediation 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are long lasting compounds that can accrue in animals and plants as they move up the food chain as a result pahs were discovered in a wide range of marine habitats including polluted water treatment facilities underground water and saltwater 2 3 organic chemicals and heavy metals in the water have wreaked havoc on aquatic life and ecosystems 4 the international agency for research on cancer has identified pahs as likely carcinogens posing a risk to human health and ecosystems furthermore the us environmental protection agency usepa has categorized some pahs as primary regulated pollutants 5 the name phenanthrene is created from different terms phenyl and anthracene previously known as benzene as a recognized contaminant it has been studied extensively in many matrices phenanthrene was the most prevalent pah in tap water accounting for around one third of the sixteen usepa priority pahs according to one reported article 6 a considerable amount of phenanthrene was released into the environment by manufacturing coke liquefaction of fossil fuels and volcanic eruptions 7 phenanthrene s ozonation products cause hepatic toxicity than phenanthrene itself with the probable impact of nephrotoxicity 8 as a result of this compound s widespread distribution and destructive potential it is critical to tracked it down and remove it from the ecosystem given the threats or concerns posed by specific pahs and associated metabolites hourly needs for sophisticated water treatment systems that are effective cheap and or convenient to control have evolved 9 the discovery of effective methods for removing phenanthrene from aqueous solutions has garnered considerable interest during the last few decades numerous approaches including chemical oxidation microbial degradation phytoremediation adsorption and chemical precipitation have been used 10 however the adsorbent used in the adsorption process is crucial for maximizing the removal method s efficiency 11 multi walled carbon nanotubes have a greater capacity for adsorption due to their interior tube cavity s unique layout and hydrophobic surface 12 along with conventional adsorbents graphene oxide multifunctional nanocomposites mesoporous molecules and electric nanofibrous membranes have been employed as effective adsorbents for phenanthrene removal from aqueous solutions 13 nevertheless nanocomposite materials with a rising water dispersibility might affect the possibility of secondary pollution additionally using standard methods such as filtration and centrifugation recovering the nanocomposite from the processed aqueous matrix may result in material damage 14 the employment of classic separation technologies in a large scale actual water purification process may extend the time and monetary expenditure that is incompatible with the application of sustainable chemistry 2 to solve these concerns photocatalytic degradation is a method that is ecologically friendly and results in no secondary pollution particularly when a variety of pollutants are efficiently degraded reactive oxygen species have been linked to the degradation of pollutants carbon based compounds like graphene fullerenes carbon nanotubes and activated carbon have demonstrated promise because of their potential to mix with heterojunction compounds to boost photo efficiency the development of multifunctional photocatalytic materials has been greatly aided by the use of graphene and its derivatives 15 16 zinc oxide zno is one of the common catalysts with its greater exciton binding energy 60 mev larger intrinsic electron motility 300 cm2 vs and broad bandgap 3 37 ev zno semiconductors were employed as an excellent catalyst to remove organic contaminants zno is a better catalyst than tio2 17 zno s varied one and two dimensional nanostructures may be generated hydrothermally by altering the ph according to kumaresan et al 18 the ph values of 7 9 11 and 13 were used to introduce hexagonal discs spindle nanorods and floral nanorods the combination of holes and electrons is a key issue that has a negative impact on the efficiency of zno based photocatalysts limiting their effectiveness as a result multiple tactics were used to inhibit electron hole recombination and increase zno s photocatalytic effectiveness one of the effective methods was the addition of go and metal nanoparticles to boost the photocatalytic efficiency of the material 19 it was also discovered that microwave irradiation might be used to make go cuo nanocomposites and the impact of go on the photocatalytic performance of the cuo catalyst for deterioration of organic pollutants after 60 min of ultraviolet irradiation was investigated the generated go cuo nanocomposite was shown to be 4 48 times more efficient than pure cuo additionally it is discovered that raising the go ratio accelerates deterioration 20 this is primarily owing to the synergetic impact of go and metal oxides on electron hole dissociation but also because the occurrence of go enhanced the probability of adsorption of contaminants on the nanocomposite s surface 21 22 because of the ability of noble metals to promote photoactivity the use of noble metal hybrids in semiconductor photocatalysts has received considerable interest recently 23 hybrid photocatalysts with various go zno weight ratios were manufactured by zhang et al 24 using a hydrothermal method it was discovered that when exposed to organic contamination go composite had a more significant photodegradation potential than zno under uv irradiation the go zno nanoparticles had more efficiency than zno itself zno photocatalytic activity could be improved by using go because of its excellent phenanthrene degradation and charge separation capabilities 25 26 distinct porous structure electrochemical characteristics acidity and adsorbing capacity make carbonaceous materials a significant asset in the field graphene activated carbon and carbon nanotubes are among the products that fall under this category of materials one of the advanced applications of carbon based composites is the removal of water pollutants by methods like photocatalysis and adsorption the integration of graphene and zno is expected to be suitable for delivering superior photocatalytic efficiency due to the combined graphene structure which allows charge separation for photocatalysis 27 because of their outstanding properties zno nanoparticles are ideally suited for this approach 28 meanwhile go has increased interest as it has the same properties as graphene and unique surface structures for the manufacture of go containing nanomaterials in conjunction with the added carboxyl and hydroxyl groups 29 because of their vast applicability in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation semiconducting oxide nanocatalysts were chosen as the subject of this research 30 an effective water disinfection solution was therefore needed semiconductor mediated photocatalysis is a desirable water disinfection technique because it uses renewable sunlight produces no hazardous pollutants and operates at room temperature 31 in this work a photocatalytic method for removing phenanthrene from contaminated water in the presence of uv visible irradiation using go zno nanoparticles has been explored many parameters such as photocatalyst dose ph phenanthrene concentration and reaction kinetics were determined to achieve maximum degradation separate studies were also performed in dark conditions and in the presence of uv visible irradiation to validate enhanced photocatalytic activity of go zno through photo induced electron transfer among metallic ions as well as phenanthrene by detecting byproducts in uv visible light exposed samples degradation pathways were shown the nanocomposite has been characterized by ft ir uv vis drs xrd sem with edx bet tem and raman spectroscopy as a result the effectiveness of the photocatalyst was thoroughly studied concerning several factors such as phenanthrene concentration the dosage of go zno nanocomposite ph reaction kinetics and reusability green synthesis and photocatalytic efficacy for eliminating phenanthrene from go zno nanocomposite are unreported in the literature so far because of its widespread dispersion and hazardous potential this molecule must be tracked and eliminated from the environment to our knowledge rice husk derived go zno nanocomposite has never been tested as a possible photocatalyst under ultraviolet visible irradiation to aid in the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene the greatest photodegradation efficiency was calculated in comparison to previous research and minor by products are identified using gc ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials methanol and phenanthrene 97 were

preparation of rice husk derived graphite powder the graphite powder production from rice husk was carried out in the manner reported by muramatsu et al 32 in which 4 to 5 g of raw rice husk was pulverized and treated for 2 h at 400 c in a carbolite furnace rice husk ash rha was the solid residue recovered the rha was then chemically activated by impregnating it with koh at a 1 2 impregnation ratio following that the blend was compressed in a ceramic crucible to begin the crucible was inserted into the midst of a bigger ceramic crucible the gap surrounding the ceramic crucible was filled by packaging and compressing the atoning rha adequately the atoning rha is utilized to protect the blend to counter oxidation when exposed to air at elevated temperatures for 2 h the crucibles were warmed up to 800 c following completion of the chemical activation process post treatment was performed the chemically triggered rha was soaked in 50 ml distilled water for 30 min and agitated to remove any remaining potassium ions for 15 min the mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm the mixture was then ultrasonicated in 100 ml of distilled water for 3 min at 50 amplitude following that the mixture was washed in 50 ml distilled water through suction filtering via a 0 22 mm pore size ptfe membrane following that the product was kept for 12 h at 80 c in a drying oven 2 2 2 synthesis of graphene oxide go go was manufactured through modified hummer s process using graphite powder generated from rice husk in a conventional process 100 ml of 98 h2so4 was poured to 0 5 g of graphite powder and stirred continuously for 1 h at 0 c in an ice bath within 2 h the solution was progressively supplemented with 2 5 g of nano3 and 1 5 g of kmno4 as mentioned earlier at the defined times following that the solution was agitated for 24 h at a temperature of 25 c before being diluted with 200 ml deionized water following that kmno4 was flushed out with 6 ml of h2o2 33 for 2 h the blend was stirred continuously with a magnetic agitator and magnetic bar the mixture was noticed to be dark brown in color purification of the final product was monitored by a wash with deionized water as far as the ph reached 7 followed by 12 h of drying at 80 c in an oven the mixture was then stored in an airtight container for practical usage after dispersing the go in purified water to a concentration of 1 g l it was ultrasonically exfoliated for 3 h to obtain go nanostructures 34 2 2 3 synthesis of graphene oxide zinc oxide go zno nanocomposite for 2 h go was dissolved in an ethanol solution and labelled as go solution in the zno solution the zno nanoparticles dissolved in the methanol and chloroform combination were ultrasonicated for 2 h chloroform and methanol are typically mixed at a ratio of about 8 9 zno nanoparticles can be dissolved in a clear solution by balancing the volumetric ratio of the two solvents for 24 h the zno solution and the go solution were mixed and stirred continuously centrifugation and methanol cleaning numerous times were used to extract the residue the product was freeze dried overnight and marked as go zno nanomaterials 35 36 2 3

confirm the bonding between the various constituents of go zno nanocomposites by nicolet is10 smart omni transmission thermo scientific madison wi usa the structural characteristics of the produced graphite go and go zno nanocomposite were investigated using raman spectroscopy renishaw invia raman microscope uk 2 4 photocatalytic action this study evaluated the photocatalytic activity of green synthesized go zno nanocomposites 100 mg in the breakdown of phenanthrene introduced to synthetic water 25 ppm a solution was magnetically agitated for 45 min in the dark to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium before exposure to uv vis light for 120 min at room temperature and pressure 10 ml min of air bubbles were used in the experiment every 20 min 2 ml of solution was collected and filtered through 0 22 m polyether sulfone syringe filters to remove the photocatalyst the concentration of phenanthrene 5 30 ppm go zno nanocomposite 1 4 g l and ph 3 30 11 were studied to improve removal supernatants obtained from optimized samples were eventually examined using a uv spectrophotometer to estimate the percentage depreciation of phenanthrene in the samples the phenanthrene concentration was determined using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer with a maximum absorbance wavelength of 295 nm the aqueous phase concentration of phenanthrene was employed in this investigation the free to total phenanthrene ratio was originally considered to remain constant throughout the photocatalytic degradation process allowing for the complete adjustment of the adsorption desorption equilibrium byproducts of phenanthrene degradation were identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms qp2010 ultra bpx5 column with helium as carrier gas besides the studies investigating the influence of ph on photocatalysis the overall ph of the phenanthrene solution in the remaining decomposition trials was around 6 80 without any ph alteration 37 to compute the photocatalytic degradation efficiency the following eq 1 was utilized 1 degradation efficiency co ct co 100 where co represents the initial concentration of phenanthrene and ct represents the concentration of phenanthrene at a time t with the help of eq 2 we were able to determine the degradation rate constants kobs of phenanthrene under different situations 2 ln c o c t k obs t it was necessary to extract the go zno photocatalyst and wash it with methanol and distilled water before freezing it and using it for the next cycle to determine the regeneration and reusability of the go zno nanocomposite four cycles of studies were investigated to assess the stability and reusability of the go zno photocatalyst 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ftir analysis the ft ir study provides the qualitative characteristics of the oxygen group within the go spectrum fig 1 a shows the spectrum for graphite go and go zno nanocomposite respectively the bending and stretching vibrations of the cooh group at 2390 61 cm 1 the cc peak at 1636 44 cm 1 and the c oh group at 3445 67 cm 1 matched with the carbon content of graphite that were discovered in the graphite spectrum the peaks detected between 1209 13 cm 1 and 1099 19 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibrations on graphene oxide revealing skeletal vibrations from the unoxidized graphitic domain co2 expands into the crevices among graphene sheets during fast warming resulting in the appearance of the co at 1675 91 cm 1 in the go spectrum this is due to the exfoliation mechanism bera et al 38 discovered that the absence of any major peak in the ftir spectra of graphite showed the chemical inertness of bulk graphite because of water molecules received via ambient exposure and hydrogen from the unextractable water molecules both c oh and cooh are likely to be formed as binding elements the carbonyl groups that remain after the contraction process are responsible for the co stretching vibrations seen at 1099 19 cm 1 thema et al 39 studied that the peeling of the graphitic structure is primarily responsible for the exfoliation process which allows oxygen to enter the cell during the oxidation process consequently the go spectra revealed four distinct peaks at 1209 13 cm 1 1099 19 cm 1 1675 91 cm 1 and 1430 95 cm 1 corresponding to the epoxy co alkoxy co carbonyl co and tertiary c oh functional groups the peak at 3391 33 cm 1 is ascribed to the oh bond stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups residual sp2 bonds in go may be indicated by a peak at 1538 96 cm 1 the prominent peak at 3633 33 cm 1 in the go zno nanocomposite spectrum could be ascribed to the oh stretching vibration of the c oh groups and water in contrast the peak at 671 07 cm 1 could be attributed to the zno stretching vibration the peaks at 1750 cm 1 and 1650 95 cm 1 determine the co stretching bonds are seen in the go zno nanocomposite spectrum the shifting of the co stretching bond in the go zno nanocomposite spectrum was possible due to composite formation studied by chauhan et al 40 3 1 2 uv vis drs analysis as illustrated in fig 1 b the absorbance spectra of the go zno nanocomposite exhibit a peak at 230 23 nm corresponding to the go sheet incorporated in the nanocomposite and another peak at 376 55 nm corresponding to zno zno does not absorb the visible light range of the spectrum but go absorbs the entire solar spectrum the absorbance spectrum of zno exhibits a distinct peak at around 354 nm which corresponds to the fundamental band gap absorption of zno azarang et al 41 studied that the absorbance peak of zno was shifted from 354 to 376 55 nm owing to a small alteration in the nanostructure of commercial zno the absorbance peak of go at 232 nm is due to the π π transition of aromatic cc which occurs at this wavelength umar et al 42 have reported a similar study describing π π transition of aromatic cc which occurred nearly at the same wavelength zhong et al 43 examined the composites spectra and discovered an absorption peak at nearly the same wavelength that could be ascribed to the absorption of zno particles attached to the surface as a result the absorbance efficiency of the go zno nanocomposite is greater than that of commercial zno as demonstrated by the absorption spectrum the enhanced absorption efficiency is advantageous for optoelectronic applications including photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene the synthesized go zno nanocomposite bandgap value was estimated by plotting αhν 2 versus photon energy hν curve following kubelka munk theory the following eq 3 has been used to calculate the optical band gap 3 αhν a hν eg n where α denotes the absorption coefficient of the catalyst a is an energy independent constant hν is photon energy eg is bandgap energy and n is a constant defining the kind of optical transition n 1 2 for direct permitted transition the bandgap of the go zno nanocomposite was 3 16 ev as shown in fig 2 however huang et al 44 theoretically projected a bandgap rise from 0 11 to 3 0 ev by progressively and partially converting graphene to graphene oxide go owing to oxygen incorporation in graphene increasing from 6 25 to 50 norlida et al 45 projected that zno would be one of the most significant metal oxides due to its distinctive broad and wide bandgap 3 37 ev and high exciton binding energy 60 mev therefore increased charge carrier concentration in a go sheet reduces the bandgap energy the go zno nanocomposite has a lower bandgap allowing it to better use sunlight s photon energy in forming electron hole pairs resulting in more significant photocatalytic activity 3 1 3 xrd analysis fig 1 c shows the xrd patterns of graphite go and go zno nanocomposite the characteristic peaks of graphite were seen at 2θ 24 9 which corresponded to diffraction plane 222 a similar study was shown by umar et al 42 where a diffused peak band of graphite appeared in the same diffraction plane the go sheet s characteristic plane 001 is reflected in the diffraction peak at 2θ value 13 08 nearly same diffraction peak was determined by hu et al 46 corresponded to the diffraction plane 001 the xrd pattern of the go zno nanocomposite indicated the existence of zno peaks at each point the appearance of the diffraction peak at 2θ 10 6 corresponded to the diffraction plane 001 of the go sheet in contrast the xrd pattern of commercial zno demonstrated the presence of zno peaks at 2θ 33 8 and 35 7 respectively representing planes 002 and 101 it has been studied by azarang et al 47 that it is possible to link all peaks to the zno hexagonal wurtzite structure jcpds card no 00 036 1451 chauhan et al 40 studied that zno nanoparticles have exfoliated and entrapped pristine go layers as seen by the shifting of the go peak in the purest form of go sheets are piled on top of one another however following doping and sonication with zno solution the stack collapsed and the sheets disintegrated additionally zno nanoparticles can be embedded into the interlayers of graphene oxide sheets 3 1 4 raman analysis the raman analysis of the synthesized materials is shown in fig 1 d generally two key elements the d and g bands describe the raman spectrum of any graphene based materials the d band at approximately raman shift of 1330 cm 1 represents the breathing mode of aromatic rings caused by defects in the samples during oxidation cancado et al 48 studied that the d band is caused by six atom ring breathing modes and is activated by a defect occurred at nearly the same raman shift in contrast the g band at approximately raman shift of 1575 cm 1 is caused by first order scattering of e2g phonons by the sp2 atom ring resulting from the breathing mode of j point photons with a1g symmetry the g band is associated with the brillouin zone s e2g phonon at the same raman shift studied by fan et al 49 the raman spectrum of as prepared graphite by rice husk serves as the benchmark for all other processed samples which exhibited the d band and g band at 1330 cm 1 and 1575 cm 1 respectively the raman spectra of go exhibits two prominent distinctive peaks corresponding to d band and g band at around 1340 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 respectively how et al 50 studied that the d band appears while g band comes from in plane vibrations of sp2 carbon atoms and a doubly generated phonon mode because of the layering of go sheets and the reduction in the functional group in the case of go zno nanocomposite these peaks are widened but have less intensity than in pure go the e2 high vibration mode and e2l b1h fundamental phonon modes of hexagonal zno are represented by the peaks at around 500 cm 1 and 730 cm 1 in the spectra of go zno nanocomposite respectively shah et al 51 demonstrated a similar investigation in which the peaks match the e2l b1h fundamental phonon modes of hexagonal zno 3 1 5 sem and edx analysis as depicted in fig 3 the scanning electron micrograph morphology reveals go sheets an intact go mass and an independent flat go mass with crumples at a magnification of 10 000 times fig 3 a reveals folding and overlapping as well as a huge interspace between graphene oxide s narrower margins the graphic demonstrates that during the annealing process the differential thermal factors between graphene sheets and the substrate decreased whereas the go sheets coincided identically in fig 3 b at 15 000 times magnification they appeared slippery and there was no interspace between the graphene oxide s narrower margins fig 3 c shows that a large quantity of zno nanoparticles has been situated over and agglomerated with go nanosheets furthermore the images revealed that the zno nanoparticles were distributed with a high degree of homogeneity fig 3 d depicts the compact go sheets that have been adorned with multiple zno nanosheets that have been arranged in various orientations al rawashdeh et al 19 studied that the presence of nanosheets might boost the surface area of the produced nanomaterial leading to enhanced adsorption capability edx elemental analyses of photocatalyst go shows around 27 29 carbon by weight and 72 71 oxygen by weight as shown in fig 3 e and f according to the edx go zno contains around 27 61 zn by weight 54 48 o by weight and a 17 91 c content as shown in fig 3 g fig 3 h shows the elemental composition of zno which is primarily composed of zn 62 62 o 31 36 and carbon 6 02 by weight 3 1 6 tem and bet analysis transmission electron microscopy images of the go zno nanocomposite are depicted in fig 4 a massive go nanosheet with a nanometer scale size has been discovered near the apex of the framework as shown in fig 4 a in which it exhibits complete transparency and undulated silk wave expressions the creases and crumpled areas are due to go but the tiny spots distributed over go nanosheet are due to zno particles as shown in fig 4 b as a result the nanosheet of go and zno in the nanocomposite is approved by both images the elimination propensity of the nanomaterial was assumed to be reliant on its surface area the bet technique was used to measure the surface area of the go zno nanocatalyst material after heating the sample to 250 c to eliminate any adsorbed moisture nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm versus relative pressure at 77 k was performed the findings of this experiment reveal a type iv isotherm which indicates that the nanostructured material is porous as shown in fig 5 a and b shows bjh barrett joyner halenda pore size distribution for go zno nanocomposite mesoporosity with pore condensation at increased pressure is suggested by the hysteresis loop the bet surface area of the go zno nanocomposite was computed from the amount of monolayer of nitrogen gas adsorbed it was found to be 15 39845 m2 g based on the quantity of monolayer of nitrogen gas adsorbed the photocatalytic process was aided by these structures large surface areas which allowed for more light absorption 52 likewise the go zno nanocomposite has an average pore size of 5 07 nm the decrease in surface area and average pore size is due to go sheets that prevent the dendritic petals of zno nanoparticles from being exposed 3 2 assessment of photocatalytic activity within 120 min of direct uv visible light irradiation the maximum degradation was reached at 25 ppm phenanthrene concentration a definite amount of nanocomposite 100 mg and a ph value of 6 80 it is necessary to note that when optimizing each parameter the others were maintained constant under optimal circumstances the highest photocatalytic removal capability of go zno nanocomposite with swirling was 86 06 followed by photolysis no photocatalyst 15 56 go zno without swirling 40 28 go zno in dark with stirring 47 40 and commercial zno 62 84 as shown in fig 6 a this effect is described to the go zno nanocomposite s high surface area 15 39845 m2 g as well as its sharp morphology and crystallinity in the case of pure phenanthrene without go zno nanocomposites there is a modest drop in the photocatalytic efficiency of phenanthrene upon ultraviolet visible light irradiation suggesting that phenanthrene is barely destroyed in the absence of a photocatalyst under ultraviolet visible light in a blank photocatalysis experiment the degradation rate was just 15 56 as shown in fig 6 b it was evident that as the irradiation period increases the concentrations of phenanthrene drop demonstrating that all these materials exhibit photocatalytic activity for phenanthrene degradation as illustrated in fig 6 b the enhanced degradation of phenanthrene revealed the photocatalytic efficacy of the go zno nanostructured materials in the presence of ultraviolet visible light 86 06 for phenanthrene compared to the dark 40 50 for phenanthrene due to its high bet surface area the go zno nanocomposite could only adsorb phenanthrene throughout its surface in the absence of uv visible light when the photoactive catalyst is exposed to light it experiences electronic excitation resulting in the formation of successive oh radicals and electron hole pairs in the presence of o2 and h2o due to the integration of two metal oxides go and zno with discrete band gaps charge carriers created in situ may be able to survive in transition bands for a longer period rachna et al 53 also studied that charge separation is strengthened due to doping or coupling charge recombination is prevented allowing e and h to reside in the conduction and valence bands for a more extended period this discovery strengthened the case for enormous oh generation to efficiently degrade the bulky and toxic phenanthrene as shown in fig 7 a probable photodegradation mechanism might be explained using the following eqs 4 9 4 uv visible light go zno go zno h e 5 go zno h e zno h go e 6 go e o 2 o 2 7 zno h h 2 o oh h 8 o 2 h 2 o oh h o o 2 9 oh phenanthrene c o 2 h 2 o mineralized products 3 2 1 effect of phenanthrene concentration it can be shown that the as manufactured go zno photocatalyst might achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium in the dark condition for 45 min as demonstrated in fig 8 a maximal phenanthrene degradation was achieved at 25 ppm concentration this could be because the catalyst has a higher proportion of surface sites available for the minimum concentration of phenanthrene compounds at greater concentrations the deterioration rate was reduced one probable explanation is that when the concentration of photons entering the solution grew the route length of photons entering the solution reduced affecting the photodegradation capability of the catalyst furthermore phenanthrene molecules might absorb a considerable quantity of light at greater concentrations than the photocatalyst shanker et al 54 also studied that when the concentration was increased the surface area of the photocatalyst gets constrained reducing the catalyst reactant ratio and therefore reduce the efficiency of phenanthrene adsorption 3 2 2 effect of go zno dosage nanocomposite dose had a significant impact on the degradation of the carcinogenic phenanthrene as depicted in fig 8 b at first glance an increase in degradation produced by the addition of go zno up to 2 g l may be explained by enhanced accessibility of surface sites rachna et al 53 conducted a similar investigation demonstrating that the active sites on the surface of nanocatalysts are believed to be responsible for the photodegradation of organic contaminants an increased number of sites on the photocatalyst surface may contribute to forming a significant number of oh radicals which were previously linked to an increase in degradation the modest decline in the graph with increasing catalyst loading i e 3 g l and 4 g l is due to particle accumulation in the confined container resulting in a constrained exposed surface area for phenanthrene adsorption kasiri et al 55 discovered that when the nanocatalyst concentration increases the solid particles gradually impede photon penetration reducing the total number of photons reaching h2o2 molecules as a result the efficiency with which oh radicals are produced diminishes rani et al 56 also demonstrated that due to the screening effect of the catalyst particles on the light source light penetration may be hindered uv visible 3 2 3 effect of ph it should be noted that ph is a significant parameter in the photodegradation analysis of organic molecules for the breakdown of phenanthrene 25 ppm a wide ph range 3 11 was explored aqueous solutions with ph variations of 3 4 3 6 8 9 3 and 10 5 were obtained as shown in fig 8 c the photodegradation of phenanthrene was greatest at basic ph 96 44 than in neutral ph 86 06 and least at acidic ph 15 06 ph 6 8 was considered as optimum ph because it was the original ph of the solution without doing any modifications in the solution however the results were better at ph 10 5 because we modified a solution by adding few drops of sodium hydroxide to achieve better results hence to check the trend in acidic neutral and basic condition we modified the solution for comparative study these occurrences could be linked to a variety of factors rani et al 57 demonstrated that first the acidic character of go zno photocatalyst was enhanced by the coupling of zno by go second photocatalytic degradation was reduced due to ion screening at acidic and basic ph due to the secondary interactions created by the hydroxyl chlorate and hydronium ions furthermore at acidic ph the parallelism in charges between the photocatalyst and phenanthrene created repulsion among molecules bechambi et al 58 investigated that photocatalysts and phenanthrene do not repel each other at basic ph which might also illustrate that basic ph results are significantly better the high π electron density of phenanthrenes contributes to their chemical stability when these π electrons encountered the positive surface of nanocatalysts they may form cation π complexes with the catalysts reported by shanker et al 59 it is also possible to initiate secondary contacts chlorate ion catalyst and hydroxyl hydroxyl interactions by adding hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to acidic and basic solutions accordingly this may limit the contact that is intended due to acidic solutions the synergistic impact creation of massive e h pairs the maximum surface activity and the restricted recombination of charge carriers the overall degradation was substantial at basic ph investigated by rani et al 60 3 2 4 reaction kinetics under optimal circumstances 2 g l go zno 6 80 ph and uv visible light the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene 25 ppm obeyed first order kinetics as seen in the ln co ct v s time curve in fig 9 the rapid degradation of phenanthrene within 120 min demonstrates this phenomenon clearly 86 06 of initially spiked phenanthrene as previously stated the slope of the fitted straight line represents the reaction s observed rate constant kobs kobs value with correlation coefficient r2 was obtained for phenanthrene degradation by go zno nanocomposite 0 0375 min 1 0 9903 followed by commercial zno 0 0186 min 1 0 9348 go zno in dark with stirring 0 0129 min 1 0 9547 and go zno without stirring 0 0104 min 1 0 9695 the go zno nanocomposite s higher rate constant suggests improved photocatalysis and phenanthrene degradation the experimentally determined values of the rate constant half life correlation coefficient and degradation efficiency for various catalysts are listed in table 1 3 3 photocatalytic degradation pathways of phenanthrene using go zno nanocomposite phenanthrene degradation on go zno surface under optimal conditions produced a variety of minor and relatively safe products through oxidation or hydrolysis as shown in fig 10 electronic excitation of highly reactive oh radicals under uv visible light degraded phenanthrene into more minor byproducts the photooxidation of phenanthrene produced byproducts with a higher molecular weight in the total ion chromatogram as shown in fig 10 a and b initially it was considered that the tiny peak equivalent to 3 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid 1 m z 188 05 was generated by hydroxylation of the sterically restricted ring of precursor phenanthren 9 ol and subsequent ring breakage by oxidization benzene 1 2 4 triol 1a m z 126 03 may be formed due to further ring opening and hydroxylation of the byproduct 1 which is a monocyclic molecule rachna et al 56 also investigated the generation of same monocyclic degradation byproduct by further ring opening and hydroxylation additionally z 3 hydroxyacrylic acid 1b and z 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid 1c m z 100 were formed as minor byproducts rani et al 61 studied that these products were subsequently oxidized as a result of the assault of oh h and o2 fig 10 c illustrates the overall degradation pathways for phenanthrene 4 comparison with other catalysts table 2 shows that different nanomaterials employed for photocatalytic degradation to remove phenanthrene go zno nanomaterials degraded phenanthrene at a rate of 86 06 to 96 44 and doped zno reduced its half life from 66 min to 18 min in 120 min owing to their dual properties as semiconductors and good adsorbents in addition go zno nanocomposites were more efficient in the quick and quantitative breakdown of phenanthrene 86 06 into smaller and nontoxic compounds than other methods with the benefits of two semiconductors go zno can produce more oh radicals and greater electrical excitation furthermore go zno photocatalytic efficiency can be improved by reducing the recombination of charge carriers as an added benefit go zno nanocomposites have an excellent compatibility enduring charge carriers greater surface areas a cumulative effect and a low bandgap the tio2 graphene composite p25 gr removed phenanthrene from amorphous areas with enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic activity hydrothermal processes were used to produce p25 gr photocatalysts with varied gr addition ratios due to its selective adsorption capabilities and improved charge transfer the p25 2 5 gr displayed supremacy in removing phenanthrene the composite demonstrated increased photocatalytic effectiveness at extremely high phenanthrene concentrations 2 0 4 0 g ml and in basic media in addition the detection of intermediates revealed the conditional declination pathways for phenanthrene 65 co deposited titanate nanotubes co tnts 600 with titanium oxide p25 as a precursor were used in a bi step progression for efficient phenanthrene photocatalytic oxidation beginning with the hydrothermal process at 150 c followed by the calcination process at 600 c the phenomenal photocatalytic activity was revealed by co tnts 600 which showed 98 6 extraction of roughly 1 g l dosage in 12 h of sunlight exposure the initial kinetic model was able to correctly comprehend the dynamic information provided by the experiment study results suggest a probable rate constant of 0 39 h 1 which is 23 times more than the titanate nanotubes tnts and 10 times greater than p25 calcination crystallization and co deposition combined to provide the remarkable synergistic impact of co tnts 600 phenanthrene photocatalysis was shown to be equivalent to that of some photocatalysts due to the enhanced activity of the co tnts 600 2 2 dicarboxaldehyde and 1 1 biphenyl 2 2 dicarboxylic acid were expected to be mineralized intermediate products 66 sol gel and calcination methods have already yielded a specific type of wo3 tio2 sio2 nanocomposite photocatalyst in addition more than seven times more photocatalytic activity in visible light than commercial tio2 was demonstrated for phenanthrene oxidation by the freshly prepared photocatalyst p25 degradation of phenanthrene made 9 phenanthrenol 9 phenanthrenol and 9 10 phenanthrenedione based on these compounds and density functional theory dft measurements they figured out the degradation pathway of phenanthrene 68 however the synthesized go zno nanocomposite has a 100 nm average diameter hexagonal wurtzite structure with good crystallinity the nanocomposites absorb up to 96 of the entire intensity of the light source employed in the experiment which has a primary emission wavelength of 395 nm the go zno nanocomposite synthesis process used in this study is simple uncomplicated and low cost it does not exhibit greater temperature or pressure enabling a more extensive range of substrates and suggesting a better likelihood of scalability in the economy after 120 min of irradiation with a uv visible light source at 395 nm up to 96 of the phenanthrene in aqueous solution was degraded using the produced go zno nanocomposite as photocatalyst for the photodegradation of phenanthrene solutions however no substantial degradation of phenanthrene was found in the absence of the photocatalyst the reproducibility of the experimental procedures was assessed and a very consistent result was obtained suggesting that the experimental data produced was very reliable 5 reusability of the photocatalyst the reusability of synthesized go zno nanocomposites was used to investigate their operational stability viability and efficiency the catalyst was recovered and reused in subsequent cycles via filtration as demonstrated in fig 11 the breakdown rate of phenanthrene after four recycling trials was still maintained at 85 only around 1 loss showing that go zno displayed excellent stability during the operation of photocatalytic degradation kumar et al 73 also studied that the modest decline of degradation efficiency can occur from the buildup of certain oxidation products at the catalyst s surface consequently inhibiting numerous active sites of the catalyst it was clear that the recycled samples had not undergone any significant phase or structural changes indicating that go zno is exceptionally stable considering the results as mentioned earlier go zno nanocomposite had remarkable reusability and stability and showed considerable promise for practical use the easy preparation of go zno nanocomposite its vast raw material supply and lack of noble metals make it an attractive photocatalyst in addition the material s high redox ability allows it to achieve outstanding degrading performance for the target pollutants at low dosages significantly lowering the material s cost of application furthermore the photocatalyst operates effectively across a broad ph range demonstrating its potential for adaptation to complicated water quality thus go zno nanocomposite offers practical utility in the removal of pollutants as a visible light responsive catalyst 6 conclusions a novel green go zno nanocomposite photocatalyst using rice husk with a homogeneous configuration and inclusion was successfully synthesized the photocatalyst exhibited a high absorption coefficient in the ultraviolet visible region by enhancing electron mobility heterojunction formation between go and zno aided electron hole severance and increased photocatalytic efficacy this go zno nanocomposite synthesized from rice husk exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity comparable to other photocatalyst arrangements beneath comparable situations even after four photocatalysis cycles the go zno nanocomposite removed nearly 85 of phenanthrene demonstrating its excellent stability and reusability for practical applications go zno had the highest photocatalytic removal 86 06 under optimal conditions 6 80 ph uv visible light radiation and phenanthrene concentration of 25 ppm this is because the go zno nanocomposite has a greater surface area 15 39845 m2 g with average pore size of 5 07 nm and is more stable when compared to other nanomaterials go zno nanocomposites exhibit enhanced charge separation and visible light excitation phenanthrene was proficiently degraded using the nanocomposites prepared via adsorption cum first order degradation kinetics comprising semiconductor mechanisms the improved interactions of excited charge pairs e and h with h2o and o2 led to the production of a significant number of oh radicals which photodegraded the phenanthrene to minor products and eventually culminated in mineralization declaration of

13031,water is a critical commodity and a strategic compound for health and economic prosperity its availability is key for sustainable industrial activities this paper presents a novel energy efficient forward osmosis freeze concentration fo fc hybrid process able to recover water as ice in this process fo operating with a soluble inorganic draw solution can reduce the volume of aqueous streams by spontaneous osmotic dewatering water is in turn recovered as ice by fc while simultaneously concentrating and regenerating the draw solution water recovery by freezing is up to 7 times more energy efficient thermodynamically than by distillation the water recovered in fo fc is not intended for drinking purposes but rather for reuse in industrial operations in an effort to minimize industrial fresh water intakes we tested both di water and a hydrometallurgical effluent as the feed solution in fo fc our fo results suggest an increase in membrane selectivity as the operating temperature decreases using mgcl2 as the draw solution and di water as the feed solution in fo further a significant rejection namely 90 of the elements dissolved in the hydrometallurgical effluent used as the feed solution was achieved our fc results indicate 66 water recovery as ice with 80 96 recovery efficiency and 0 12 0 05 mol kg impurities in the ice finally the regenerated concentrated draw solution concentration is 2 8 4 higher compared to the dilute draw solution and is therefore suitable to be reused in the fo step graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sustainable processing forward osmosis freeze concentration effluent desalination cold regions 1 introduction despite having vast quantities of fresh water its global supply is limited and thus responsible and intelligent use and reuse of this valuable resource is the responsibility of the scientific community contaminated wastewater from industrial activities such as mining and mineral and metal processing is often disposed for a processing fee a practice that can be expensive while posing a significant threat to the sustainability of the operation our ability to dewater aqueous wastewater streams in addition to the generation of fresh water strengthens the industry s ability to operate competitively in an era of fresh water use restrictions especially in regions suffering from water scarcity 1 2 the preferred water treatment technologies are those capable of producing fresh water without altering the waste stream chemistry 3 evaporative processes brine concentration bc reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and membrane distillation md are some of the available conventional desalination processes which meet the above requirements 4 13 despite optimization desalination processes are still expensive relatively inefficient and often limited in their application especially in the treatment of high salinity effluents in cold regions 11 14 17 ro though energy efficient is limited in its ability to treat high salinity solutions due to the increased cost and fouling md can treat solutions of high total dissolved content up to 350 g l but faces challenges which are primarily associated with an intense pretreatment of the feed solution to avoid membrane fouling and low membrane fluxes due to temperature polarization evaporative technologies although able to treat a wide range of saline solutions low to high salinity are energy intensive an in depth comparison of the energy consumption required for the desalination of seawater and industrial effluents has been presented by panagopoulos in 2021 18 19 forward osmosis freeze concentration fo fc is a novel promising hybrid desalination process 20 23 able to produce clean water from contaminated mine waters and mineral and metal processing effluents especially in northern regions and reduce the industrial aqueous waste volume in the fo fc process fig 1 a feed solution is first subjected to a forward osmosis step whereby water spontaneously permeates from the feed solution into a concentrated draw solution cds through a semi permeable membrane subsequently water is separated from the resulting diluted draw solution dds via freezing ice is produced and grown to the extent required to recover the amount of water that permeated into the cds while simultaneously regenerating the latter the ice produced may in turn be melted using low grade waste heat which is readily available in all process plants to produce water that can be reused in the process circuits the cds left behind can be recycled in the fo process for continuous water recovery in principle both freezing and distillation aim to recover fresh water from aqueous solutions however fc is less prone to corrosion and scaling phenomena compared to evaporative processes 24 25 while also energetically outperforming them specifically fc requires up to 7 times less energy input than evaporation 14 26 27 since the latent heat of freezing is 333 5 kj kg compared to the latent heat of evaporation i e 2256 7 kj kg 14 recently an energy comparison between fc and a conventional evaporative desalination technology namely multi stage flash distillation has been presented showcasing the advantages of fc especially when climate driven refrigeration i e cold regions or waste cold energy i e local cryogenic plants producing o2 from air for use in refractory gold pressure oxidation and steelmaking plants can be used for cooling 28 the selection of the proper draw solute is critical for the sustainability of fo as both the fresh water recovery yield and the energy efficiency of the process depend on it an ideal draw solute must be highly soluble in water to generate a cds of high osmotic pressure and easy to separate from the dds to produce fresh water and regenerate the cds with low energy input 29 inorganic salts e g nacl cacl2 mgcl2 are non toxic and highly soluble in water thus generating environmentally benign solutions of high osmotic pressure and water draw capability 30 therefore the use of inorganic salts as the draw solutes in fo is advantageous nevertheless to date their usage has been prohibited due to the lack of an energy efficient way to separate them from the dds 31 32 thus thermolytic salts i e tma co2 h2o or nh3 co2 h2o have been preferred in fo 8 33 36 however these salts are often toxic or noxious 37 41 and require thermal energy to be separated from the dds and regenerate the cds the objective and novelty of this work was to assess the potential of coupling fo with fc to recover water from aqueous solutions in cold regions in 2019 kolliopoulos and papangelakis 20 filed for a patent on a hybrid fo fc process for the recovery of water from challenging industrial multi component effluents using non toxic inorganic salts as the draw solutes in the process le et al 21 then also investigated the application of progressive freezing for the regeneration of three common fo draw solutions at 20 15 c nacl 0 2 1 0 m mgcl2 0 5 2 0 m and edta 2na 0 05 0 2 m and achieved to reconcentrate the dds by circa 1 9 times in this work both the performance of fo at low temperatures namely below room temperature from 5 to 25 c and the effectiveness of fc to regenerate the cds by recovering water from the dds across a broad range of operating temperatures from 10 to 40 c were studied three soluble inorganic chloride salts nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 were used as model electrolytes to emulate the cds in fo and in turn the dds in fc while both di water and a real world hydrometallurgical effluent were used as the feed solution in fo the results presented will be useful for the successful simultaneous cds regeneration and production of fresh water with a level of impurities suitable for reuse in industrial process circuits therefore they indicate the potential success of this novel hybrid fo fc process which promises to energetically outperform current cutting edge water recovery processes especially from cold mine waters and mineral and metal processing effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium chloride nacl 99 6 and magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o 99 salts were purchased from fisher scientific calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o 99 and anhydrous magnesium chloride mgcl2 99 salts were purchased from acros organics and afla aesar respectively ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm from a millipore milli q system was used to prepare all solutions 2 2 experimental methodology 2 2 1 forward osmosis the fo apparatus consists of a rectangular stainless steel cf042 fo cell purchased from sterlitech active area of 42 cm2 an asymmetric cellulose triacetate cta membrane purchased from fluid technology solutions fts was used it was oriented so that the active layer faced the feed stream we operated the fo cell counter currently and controlled the flowrates using a thermo fischer easy load ii peristaltic pump experiments were performed at 5 15 and 25 c to evaluate the effect of temperature on the fo performance the temperature was controlled using a thermo scientific forma frgl1204a laboratory fridge for the 5 c and 15 c tests the fo set up was placed in the fridge while the 25 c tests were performed outside of the fridge in our fo lab scale batch experiments we used 0 5 1 2 3 and 3 5 m nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 as the cds and di water as well as a hydrometallurgical effluent as the feed solution the draw solutions were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of salt in di water the draw and feed solutions were recirculated in a closed loop in the fo cell both the draw and feed solution reservoirs were of a large enough volume to ensure an approximately constant concentration for the experiment duration a mass flowrate of 8000 g h 2 1 cm s crossflow velocity was used for both streams the mass of each reservoir was digitally recorded every 30 s using mettler toledo balances with draw and feed solution samples taken at steady state which was reached after 15 min and again after the duration of the experiment 1 h both the draw and feed solution cation concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes prior to analysis the samples were diluted with 5 nitric acid 50 for the feed samples and 1000 for the draw solution samples the water flux was determined based on the draw solution mass change while the reverse solute flux was determined based on the final solute concentration in the feed the fo experiments were performed in triplicates 2 2 2 freeze concentration the ddss used in the fc series of experiments were prepared in the laboratory by dissolving the appropriate amount of each salt in di water the initial concentration of the solutions prepared was measured by icp oes the ddss were placed in beakers 150 ml inside a thermo scientific forma 8600 series chest freezer model 713ca freezer purchased from fisher sci the ddss were exposed to the targeted temperature inside the freezer for 24 h until they reached equilibrium the resulting slurry was in turn vacuum filtered for 2 7 min to separate the solid and the liquid phases after the cds and ice samples were collected and weighed the final ice product was washed with 10 15 g of chilled deionized di water 4 c the samples were diluted using di water to a known volume of 100 ml and 200 ml for the ice and cds respectively the above diluted samples were further diluted by 1000 using 5 nitric acid and were analyzed for cation content using icp oes two fc modes were studied experimentally single stage and multi stage fc during single stage fc ddss of 0 5 mol kg were exposed to near the eutectic temperature of each draw solution in multi stage fc the ddss were gradually exposed to lower temperatures in a stepwise process whereby the resulting liquid phase of the first step was reprocessed at a lower temperature while the resulting ice was collected all fc experiments described above were carried out in triplicates the temperature range for each dds was selected by consulting their respective phase diagrams which were prepared using oli mse software www olisystems com 3 results and discussion 3 1 forward osmosis 3 1 1 water and reverse solute flux results at room temperature the water flux was determined from the rate of change of the draw solution mass per unit of membrane area expressed in units of l m2 h the reverse draw solute flux was determined from the rate of change of the feed solute concentration per unit of membrane area expressed in units of mol m2 h water and reverse solute flux data at room temperature with nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 as the draw solutions and di water as the feed solution are reported and compared to literature values in fig 2 30 37 42 45 the water flux using nacl cds has been studied by achilli et al 30 phillip et al 42 and boo et al 37 it has been found that the water flux ranges from 9 6 to 19 7 l m2 h using nacl cdss of 0 6 4 m our results are in good agreement with the above studies for water flux values in the range of 6 4 to 16 2 l m2 h using 0 5 3 5 m nacl cdss our reverse solute flux results range from 0 13 to 0 34 mol m2 h depending on the nacl draw solution concentration they are in good agreement with literature data from achilli et al 30 phillip et al 42 and boo et al 37 at the draw solution concentration range of 0 5 1 m but are higher at higher concentrations the performance of cacl2 as the draw solution in fo has been studied by achilli et al 30 and phuntsho et al 43 achilli et al 30 reported water flux values ranging from 9 5 to 11 6 l m2 h in 0 4 0 6 m cacl2 cdss on the contrary phuntsho et al 43 estimated the water flux from 6 7 to 11 5 l m2 h in 1 3 m cacl2 cdss in our experiments the water flux ranged from 7 9 to 16 9 l m2 h using 0 5 3 5 m cacl2 cdss our findings proved similar water flux values to literature data using cdss of up to 2 m cacl2 concentration which accounts for the majority of experimental results reported in literature however at higher cds concentrations our water flux results appear to be higher compared to phuntsho et al 43 regarding the cacl2 reverse solute flux our experimental results follow a similar trend compared to literature values 30 43 however higher absolute reverse solute flux values were estimated ranging from 0 07 to 0 22 mol m2 h hancock and cath 45 achilli et al 30 and su and chung 44 studied the water flux in mgcl2 cds hancock and cath 45 and su and chung 44 reported consistent water flux values ranging from 6 1 to 8 3 l m2 h in cdss of 0 5 2 m however achilli et al 30 reported higher water flux values 8 3 9 7 l m2 h using cdss of lower concentration i e 0 35 0 5 m our experimental water flux results range from 8 6 to 16 9 l m2 h using 0 5 3 5 m mgcl2 cdss our data are in good agreement with achilli et al 30 using 0 5 m cds but are significantly higher using higher concentration mgcl2 cds our experimental reverse solute flux results for mgcl2 are in excellent agreement with literature data 30 44 45 the reverse solute flux ranges from 0 09 to 0 18 mol m2 h depending on the draw solution concentration as expected the water flux increases with increasing draw solution concentration due to the increased driving force for water transfer across the membrane 46 47 however the increase in water flux with draw solution concentration is non linear suggesting increased concentration polarization effects at higher concentrations 48 on the contrary higher reverse draw solute flux values were observed in this study compared to literature reported values 30 37 42 45 this likely correlates with the increased water flux as they increase simultaneously with draw solution concentration comparing the draw solutes studied nacl and mgcl2 display the highest and lowest reverse draw solute flux respectively suggesting that the membrane has a greater selectivity for divalent draw solutes which is consistent with literature 49 50 a comprehensive model of the membrane characterization has been published elsewhere 48 overall the results obtained in this study agree with those reported in literature thus validating the experimental methodology used in this work 3 1 2 effect of temperature on forward osmosis performance as the aim of this work was to combine fo with fc we investigated the effect of lowering the fo operating temperature on the process performance using 1 and 3 m nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 draw solutions and di water as the feed solution the results of our study in terms of water flux reverse solute flux and specific flux namely the ratio of water flux to reverse solute flux expressed in units of l of water per mol draw solute are presented in fig 3 the water flux decreased from 31 6 to 46 8 at system temperatures of 5 c compared to room temperature exacerbated for draw solutions of higher concentrations this may be attributed to the decreased draw solute diffusivity and increased draw solution viscosity at lower temperatures which hinders the transport of the draw solute to the active layer of the membrane thus decreasing the osmotic driving force although the magnitude of the water flux decrease is similar for the draw solutions studied nacl displays the largest decrease at both 1 and 3 m likely due to a greater decrease in diffusivity with decreasing temperature compared to mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions comparing our experimental results for the three draw solutions studied similar water fluxes were observed for all draw solutions with cacl2 and mgcl2 displaying greater water flux compared to nacl at both 1 and 3 m concentrations respectively the reverse draw solute flux was also found to decrease with temperature due to increased mass transfer resistance and lower driving force for solute permeation similar to the water flux nacl presented the largest reduction in reverse draw solute flux with temperature approaching the values of the divalent salts at 5 c the specific water flux displayed an inverse relationship with temperature indicating an increase in selectivity of the membrane for water over the draw solute at lower temperatures therefore while lower temperatures reduce the amount of water recovered less draw solute is released into the feed solution during operation the latter is expected to reduce the overall operating expenditure comparing each draw solute nacl and mgcl2 display the lowest and highest specific water flux respectively with mgcl2 exhibiting the largest increase in specific water flux with decreasing temperature notably there is only a minor increase in the specific water flux for cacl2 at lower temperatures suggesting negligible benefits to operating at temperatures below 25 c for this draw solution overall based on the water and reverse draw solute flux results mgcl2 is the most promising draw solute as it produces a higher water flux with less draw solute permeation across all the temperatures and concentrations examined in the present study 3 1 3 water flux and salt rejection results from a hydrometallurgical effluent a hydrometallurgical effluent was received treated with mgo and filtered to adjust its ph from circa 1 7 to 3 5 which is slightly higher than the lowest operating limit of the membranes used in this work ph 3 the handling and pretreatment of this solution prior to its use in fo has been presented elsewhere 51 table 1 presents the composition of the treated effluent which served as the feed solution in fo mgcl2 was used as the draw solution in this round of experiments following the positive observations described in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 fig 4 presents the resulting water flux as a function of the draw solution concentration water flux increased from circa 1 to 2 l m2 h upon increasing the cds concentration from circa 1 5 to 2 m which is a low but operatable water flux range 52 more than 90 of the elements dissolved in the feed solution were rejected by the membrane during the fo experiments specifically more than 98 93 97 and 98 rejection was achieved for as cu na and s fig 5 rejection was calculated using eq 1 1 rejection 1 j s j w c f where js is the salt flux jw is the water flux and cf is the concentration of the solute in the feed solution this outcome is significant especially for cu since its recovery may become possible from the resulting concentrated brines therefore fo has the potential to be applied in liquid mining as a concentration step prior to metal recovery from dilute resources including effluent streams with diluted valuable metal content as has been demonstrated in literature 53 56 3 2 freeze concentration the fc experimental matrix is presented in table 2 alongside our single stage and multi stage fc experimental results for the simultaneous cds regeneration and water recovery as ice starting from 0 5 mol kg ddss as the feed in fc a summary of our results with regards to the water recovery yield and the level of impurities in the recovered water are presented in fig 6 while the solute impurities in the ice increase as the dds concentration increases the resulting

13031,water is a critical commodity and a strategic compound for health and economic prosperity its availability is key for sustainable industrial activities this paper presents a novel energy efficient forward osmosis freeze concentration fo fc hybrid process able to recover water as ice in this process fo operating with a soluble inorganic draw solution can reduce the volume of aqueous streams by spontaneous osmotic dewatering water is in turn recovered as ice by fc while simultaneously concentrating and regenerating the draw solution water recovery by freezing is up to 7 times more energy efficient thermodynamically than by distillation the water recovered in fo fc is not intended for drinking purposes but rather for reuse in industrial operations in an effort to minimize industrial fresh water intakes we tested both di water and a hydrometallurgical effluent as the feed solution in fo fc our fo results suggest an increase in membrane selectivity as the operating temperature decreases using mgcl2 as the draw solution and di water as the feed solution in fo further a significant rejection namely 90 of the elements dissolved in the hydrometallurgical effluent used as the feed solution was achieved our fc results indicate 66 water recovery as ice with 80 96 recovery efficiency and 0 12 0 05 mol kg impurities in the ice finally the regenerated concentrated draw solution concentration is 2 8 4 higher compared to the dilute draw solution and is therefore suitable to be reused in the fo step graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sustainable processing forward osmosis freeze concentration effluent desalination cold regions 1 introduction despite having vast quantities of fresh water its global supply is limited and thus responsible and intelligent use and reuse of this valuable resource is the responsibility of the scientific community contaminated wastewater from industrial activities such as mining and mineral and metal processing is often disposed for a processing fee a practice that can be expensive while posing a significant threat to the sustainability of the operation our ability to dewater aqueous wastewater streams in addition to the generation of fresh water strengthens the industry s ability to operate competitively in an era of fresh water use restrictions especially in regions suffering from water scarcity 1 2 the preferred water treatment technologies are those capable of producing fresh water without altering the waste stream chemistry 3 evaporative processes brine concentration bc reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and membrane distillation md are some of the available conventional desalination processes which meet the above requirements 4 13 despite optimization desalination processes are still expensive relatively inefficient and often limited in their application especially in the treatment of high salinity effluents in cold regions 11 14 17 ro though energy efficient is limited in its ability to treat high salinity solutions due to the increased cost and fouling md can treat solutions of high total dissolved content up to 350 g l but faces challenges which are primarily associated with an intense pretreatment of the feed solution to avoid membrane fouling and low membrane fluxes due to temperature polarization evaporative technologies although able to treat a wide range of saline solutions low to high salinity are energy intensive an in depth comparison of the energy consumption required for the desalination of seawater and industrial effluents has been presented by panagopoulos in 2021 18 19 forward osmosis freeze concentration fo fc is a novel promising hybrid desalination process 20 23 able to produce clean water from contaminated mine waters and mineral and metal processing effluents especially in northern regions and reduce the industrial aqueous waste volume in the fo fc process fig 1 a feed solution is first subjected to a forward osmosis step whereby water spontaneously permeates from the feed solution into a concentrated draw solution cds through a semi permeable membrane subsequently water is separated from the resulting diluted draw solution dds via freezing ice is produced and grown to the extent required to recover the amount of water that permeated into the cds while simultaneously regenerating the latter the ice produced may in turn be melted using low grade waste heat which is readily available in all process plants to produce water that can be reused in the process circuits the cds left behind can be recycled in the fo process for continuous water recovery in principle both freezing and distillation aim to recover fresh water from aqueous solutions however fc is less prone to corrosion and scaling phenomena compared to evaporative processes 24 25 while also energetically outperforming them specifically fc requires up to 7 times less energy input than evaporation 14 26 27 since the latent heat of freezing is 333 5 kj kg compared to the latent heat of evaporation i e 2256 7 kj kg 14 recently an energy comparison between fc and a conventional evaporative desalination technology namely multi stage flash distillation has been presented showcasing the advantages of fc especially when climate driven refrigeration i e cold regions or waste cold energy i e local cryogenic plants producing o2 from air for use in refractory gold pressure oxidation and steelmaking plants can be used for cooling 28 the selection of the proper draw solute is critical for the sustainability of fo as both the fresh water recovery yield and the energy efficiency of the process depend on it an ideal draw solute must be highly soluble in water to generate a cds of high osmotic pressure and easy to separate from the dds to produce fresh water and regenerate the cds with low energy input 29 inorganic salts e g nacl cacl2 mgcl2 are non toxic and highly soluble in water thus generating environmentally benign solutions of high osmotic pressure and water draw capability 30 therefore the use of inorganic salts as the draw solutes in fo is advantageous nevertheless to date their usage has been prohibited due to the lack of an energy efficient way to separate them from the dds 31 32 thus thermolytic salts i e tma co2 h2o or nh3 co2 h2o have been preferred in fo 8 33 36 however these salts are often toxic or noxious 37 41 and require thermal energy to be separated from the dds and regenerate the cds the objective and novelty of this work was to assess the potential of coupling fo with fc to recover water from aqueous solutions in cold regions in 2019 kolliopoulos and papangelakis 20 filed for a patent on a hybrid fo fc process for the recovery of water from challenging industrial multi component effluents using non toxic inorganic salts as the draw solutes in the process le et al 21 then also investigated the application of progressive freezing for the regeneration of three common fo draw solutions at 20 15 c nacl 0 2 1 0 m mgcl2 0 5 2 0 m and edta 2na 0 05 0 2 m and achieved to reconcentrate the dds by circa 1 9 times in this work both the performance of fo at low temperatures namely below room temperature from 5 to 25 c and the effectiveness of fc to regenerate the cds by recovering water from the dds across a broad range of operating temperatures from 10 to 40 c were studied three soluble inorganic chloride salts nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 were used as model electrolytes to emulate the cds in fo and in turn the dds in fc while both di water and a real world hydrometallurgical effluent were used as the feed solution in fo the results presented will be useful for the successful simultaneous cds regeneration and production of fresh water with a level of impurities suitable for reuse in industrial process circuits therefore they indicate the potential success of this novel hybrid fo fc process which promises to energetically outperform current cutting edge water recovery processes especially from cold mine waters and mineral and metal processing effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium chloride nacl 99 6 and magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o 99 salts were purchased from fisher scientific calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o 99 and anhydrous magnesium chloride mgcl2 99 salts were purchased from acros organics and afla aesar respectively ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm from a millipore milli q system was used to prepare all solutions 2 2 experimental methodology 2 2 1 forward osmosis the fo apparatus consists of a rectangular stainless steel cf042 fo cell purchased from sterlitech active area of 42 cm2 an asymmetric cellulose triacetate cta membrane purchased from fluid technology solutions fts was used it was oriented so that the active layer faced the feed stream we operated the fo cell counter currently and controlled the flowrates using a thermo fischer easy load ii peristaltic pump experiments were performed at 5 15 and 25 c to evaluate the effect of temperature on the fo performance the temperature was controlled using a thermo scientific forma frgl1204a laboratory fridge for the 5 c and 15 c tests the fo set up was placed in the fridge while the 25 c tests were performed outside of the fridge in our fo lab scale batch experiments we used 0 5 1 2 3 and 3 5 m nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 as the cds and di water as well as a hydrometallurgical effluent as the feed solution the draw solutions were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of salt in di water the draw and feed solutions were recirculated in a closed loop in the fo cell both the draw and feed solution reservoirs were of a large enough volume to ensure an approximately constant concentration for the experiment duration a mass flowrate of 8000 g h 2 1 cm s crossflow velocity was used for both streams the mass of each reservoir was digitally recorded every 30 s using mettler toledo balances with draw and feed solution samples taken at steady state which was reached after 15 min and again after the duration of the experiment 1 h both the draw and feed solution cation concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes prior to analysis the samples were diluted with 5 nitric acid 50 for the feed samples and 1000 for the draw solution samples the water flux was determined based on the draw solution mass change while the reverse solute flux was determined based on the final solute concentration in the feed the fo experiments were performed in triplicates 2 2 2 freeze concentration the ddss used in the fc series of experiments were prepared in the laboratory by dissolving the appropriate amount of each salt in di water the initial concentration of the solutions prepared was measured by icp oes the ddss were placed in beakers 150 ml inside a thermo scientific forma 8600 series chest freezer model 713ca freezer purchased from fisher sci the ddss were exposed to the targeted temperature inside the freezer for 24 h until they reached equilibrium the resulting slurry was in turn vacuum filtered for 2 7 min to separate the solid and the liquid phases after the cds and ice samples were collected and weighed the final ice product was washed with 10 15 g of chilled deionized di water 4 c the samples were diluted using di water to a known volume of 100 ml and 200 ml for the ice and cds respectively the above diluted samples were further diluted by 1000 using 5 nitric acid and were analyzed for cation content using icp oes two fc modes were studied experimentally single stage and multi stage fc during single stage fc ddss of 0 5 mol kg were exposed to near the eutectic temperature of each draw solution in multi stage fc the ddss were gradually exposed to lower temperatures in a stepwise process whereby the resulting liquid phase of the first step was reprocessed at a lower temperature while the resulting ice was collected all fc experiments described above were carried out in triplicates the temperature range for each dds was selected by consulting their respective phase diagrams which were prepared using oli mse software www olisystems com 3 results and discussion 3 1 forward osmosis 3 1 1 water and reverse solute flux results at room temperature the water flux was determined from the rate of change of the draw solution mass per unit of membrane area expressed in units of l m2 h the reverse draw solute flux was determined from the rate of change of the feed solute concentration per unit of membrane area expressed in units of mol m2 h water and reverse solute flux data at room temperature with nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 as the draw solutions and di water as the feed solution are reported and compared to literature values in fig 2 30 37 42 45 the water flux using nacl cds has been studied by achilli et al 30 phillip et al 42 and boo et al 37 it has been found that the water flux ranges from 9 6 to 19 7 l m2 h using nacl cdss of 0 6 4 m our results are in good agreement with the above studies for water flux values in the range of 6 4 to 16 2 l m2 h using 0 5 3 5 m nacl cdss our reverse solute flux results range from 0 13 to 0 34 mol m2 h depending on the nacl draw solution concentration they are in good agreement with literature data from achilli et al 30 phillip et al 42 and boo et al 37 at the draw solution concentration range of 0 5 1 m but are higher at higher concentrations the performance of cacl2 as the draw solution in fo has been studied by achilli et al 30 and phuntsho et al 43 achilli et al 30 reported water flux values ranging from 9 5 to 11 6 l m2 h in 0 4 0 6 m cacl2 cdss on the contrary phuntsho et al 43 estimated the water flux from 6 7 to 11 5 l m2 h in 1 3 m cacl2 cdss in our experiments the water flux ranged from 7 9 to 16 9 l m2 h using 0 5 3 5 m cacl2 cdss our findings proved similar water flux values to literature data using cdss of up to 2 m cacl2 concentration which accounts for the majority of experimental results reported in literature however at higher cds concentrations our water flux results appear to be higher compared to phuntsho et al 43 regarding the cacl2 reverse solute flux our experimental results follow a similar trend compared to literature values 30 43 however higher absolute reverse solute flux values were estimated ranging from 0 07 to 0 22 mol m2 h hancock and cath 45 achilli et al 30 and su and chung 44 studied the water flux in mgcl2 cds hancock and cath 45 and su and chung 44 reported consistent water flux values ranging from 6 1 to 8 3 l m2 h in cdss of 0 5 2 m however achilli et al 30 reported higher water flux values 8 3 9 7 l m2 h using cdss of lower concentration i e 0 35 0 5 m our experimental water flux results range from 8 6 to 16 9 l m2 h using 0 5 3 5 m mgcl2 cdss our data are in good agreement with achilli et al 30 using 0 5 m cds but are significantly higher using higher concentration mgcl2 cds our experimental reverse solute flux results for mgcl2 are in excellent agreement with literature data 30 44 45 the reverse solute flux ranges from 0 09 to 0 18 mol m2 h depending on the draw solution concentration as expected the water flux increases with increasing draw solution concentration due to the increased driving force for water transfer across the membrane 46 47 however the increase in water flux with draw solution concentration is non linear suggesting increased concentration polarization effects at higher concentrations 48 on the contrary higher reverse draw solute flux values were observed in this study compared to literature reported values 30 37 42 45 this likely correlates with the increased water flux as they increase simultaneously with draw solution concentration comparing the draw solutes studied nacl and mgcl2 display the highest and lowest reverse draw solute flux respectively suggesting that the membrane has a greater selectivity for divalent draw solutes which is consistent with literature 49 50 a comprehensive model of the membrane characterization has been published elsewhere 48 overall the results obtained in this study agree with those reported in literature thus validating the experimental methodology used in this work 3 1 2 effect of temperature on forward osmosis performance as the aim of this work was to combine fo with fc we investigated the effect of lowering the fo operating temperature on the process performance using 1 and 3 m nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 draw solutions and di water as the feed solution the results of our study in terms of water flux reverse solute flux and specific flux namely the ratio of water flux to reverse solute flux expressed in units of l of water per mol draw solute are presented in fig 3 the water flux decreased from 31 6 to 46 8 at system temperatures of 5 c compared to room temperature exacerbated for draw solutions of higher concentrations this may be attributed to the decreased draw solute diffusivity and increased draw solution viscosity at lower temperatures which hinders the transport of the draw solute to the active layer of the membrane thus decreasing the osmotic driving force although the magnitude of the water flux decrease is similar for the draw solutions studied nacl displays the largest decrease at both 1 and 3 m likely due to a greater decrease in diffusivity with decreasing temperature compared to mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions comparing our experimental results for the three draw solutions studied similar water fluxes were observed for all draw solutions with cacl2 and mgcl2 displaying greater water flux compared to nacl at both 1 and 3 m concentrations respectively the reverse draw solute flux was also found to decrease with temperature due to increased mass transfer resistance and lower driving force for solute permeation similar to the water flux nacl presented the largest reduction in reverse draw solute flux with temperature approaching the values of the divalent salts at 5 c the specific water flux displayed an inverse relationship with temperature indicating an increase in selectivity of the membrane for water over the draw solute at lower temperatures therefore while lower temperatures reduce the amount of water recovered less draw solute is released into the feed solution during operation the latter is expected to reduce the overall operating expenditure comparing each draw solute nacl and mgcl2 display the lowest and highest specific water flux respectively with mgcl2 exhibiting the largest increase in specific water flux with decreasing temperature notably there is only a minor increase in the specific water flux for cacl2 at lower temperatures suggesting negligible benefits to operating at temperatures below 25 c for this draw solution overall based on the water and reverse draw solute flux results mgcl2 is the most promising draw solute as it produces a higher water flux with less draw solute permeation across all the temperatures and concentrations examined in the present study 3 1 3 water flux and salt rejection results from a hydrometallurgical effluent a hydrometallurgical effluent was received treated with mgo and filtered to adjust its ph from circa 1 7 to 3 5 which is slightly higher than the lowest operating limit of the membranes used in this work ph 3 the handling and pretreatment of this solution prior to its use in fo has been presented elsewhere 51 table 1 presents the composition of the treated effluent which served as the feed solution in fo mgcl2 was used as the draw solution in this round of experiments following the positive observations described in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 fig 4 presents the resulting water flux as a function of the draw solution concentration water flux increased from circa 1 to 2 l m2 h upon increasing the cds concentration from circa 1 5 to 2 m which is a low but operatable water flux range 52 more than 90 of the elements dissolved in the feed solution were rejected by the membrane during the fo experiments specifically more than 98 93 97 and 98 rejection was achieved for as cu na and s fig 5 rejection was calculated using eq 1 1 rejection 1 j s j w c f where js is the salt flux jw is the water flux and cf is the concentration of the solute in the feed solution this outcome is significant especially for cu since its recovery may become possible from the resulting concentrated brines therefore fo has the potential to be applied in liquid mining as a concentration step prior to metal recovery from dilute resources including effluent streams with diluted valuable metal content as has been demonstrated in literature 53 56 3 2 freeze concentration the fc experimental matrix is presented in table 2 alongside our single stage and multi stage fc experimental results for the simultaneous cds regeneration and water recovery as ice starting from 0 5 mol kg ddss as the feed in fc a summary of our results with regards to the

13032,textile wastewater comprises a complex mixture of chemical substances and dyes such as disperse dyes which have a high potential as carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic textile wastewater effluent contributes 20 of the water pollution with a high contribution to environmental contamination where about 50 000 tons year of dyes are dumped into the environment the advanced oxidation processes aops which includes photocatalytic degradation pd using nanophotocatalysts is a rising technology causing in completing the mineralization of the dyes compared to traditional treatment techniques such as the absorption method which transfers the pollutants to other stages photolysis is capable of partially degrading 50 to 80 of micro pollutants like dyes using nanophotocatalysts the literature indicates that about 70 to 80 of studies use photocatalysis using zno tio2 as a photocatalyst in wastewater treatment however the photocatalysts used have limited potential for removing dyes from textile wastewater thus it is urgent to improve the zno nps synthesis to maximize the pd efficiency to degrading textile wastewater dyes the present review focuses on exploring the efficiency and mechanism of the photodegradation of textile wastewater dyes using zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps synthesized in the plant extract the highest photolysis efficiency was found at low dye concentrations and ph to improve the initial operating parameters photolysis increases with increasing photocatalysis in the surface area and with an optimum amount of photocatalyst furthermore appropriate photoirradiation is also necessary to conduct the photocatalytic process at room temperature keywords photocatalysis photocatalyst plant extract disperse azo dyes textile wastewater zno nanoparticles zno nps dye degradation 1 introduction the textile industry is among the major producers of contaminated wastewater in the world globally dye production is around 7 106 tons year of which approximately 10 is lost during the dyeing process which was then released into the environment after dying and processing 1 the world bank stated that 20 of industrial water pollution in the world emerging from textile industries 2 as per the u s environmental protection agency 100 200 l of water is consumed per kilogram of fabric processed 2 3 textile wastewater contains a complex of chemicals dyes and reagents with minimal biodegradation and high salinity the discharge of textile wastewater with dispersed dyes into the environment has dangerous effects due to the high potential as carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans the discharge of textile wastewater into the water bodies prevents the penetration of sunlight which is essential for the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and animals the most dangerous effect is interfere with the oxygen transport mechanism between air and water thereby hindering the water self purification process disperse dyes with complex aromatic structures are not completely eliminated during textile wastewater treatment due to has antioxidant potential metal chelating ability and low solubility in water physical and chemical methods such as ultrafiltration chlorination chemical coagulation adsorption on activated carbon reverse osmosis and ion exchange are the most current used for removing the textile dyes these methods are not destructive to the dyes and they transfer the pollutants from one state to the other moreover advanced oxidation processes aops such as photocatalytic degradation pd are an eco friendly technology where pollutants are degraded into less toxic or non toxic components pd is characterized by low operating cost a technique that operates under ambient pressure and temperature which can accomplish complete mineralization for the dyes studies on the biotoxicity of dye degraded by pd confirm the absence of toxic by products 4 the photocatalytic method relies on the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide anion o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to degrade organic dye compounds nanoparticles nps are attracting great interest because of the vast surface area to volume ratio and electronic and thermal features which promote the catalytic activity of absorbing intense ultraviolet uv light and boost photocatalysis process efficiency 5 zno nps are deemed to be ideal due to their broad bandgap 3 37 ev as well as their great ability to absorb uv radiation with a wavelength comparable to or lower than 385 nm 7 8 the chemically synthesized zno nps possess a significant tendency to aggregation due to their considerable surface area to volume ratio which can significantly reduce its photocatalytic activity in addition in an aqueous solution zno has a high recombination rate of the photogenerated electron hole pairs as well as photo instability resulting in a major reduction in pure photocatalytic activity the chemicals used for the synthesis of zno nps and their stabilization are toxic and lead to harmful by products 9 10 these gaps encourage researchers to find an alternative method for the stable and non toxic zno nps synthesis the zno nps synthesis in plant extracts has generated a great deal of interest in providing a new pathway for researchers to find the substances as they are safe and environmentally friendly methods 9 11 green zno nps are among the most successful and advanced solutions for treating dye contaminated water since they are safe and employ sustainable techniques with no toxic by products 11 the present review aimed to summarize the data available in the literature on dye treatment and focus on photocatalysis with a nanophotocatalyst as a highly efficient technology for textile wastewater treatment this review identified the appropriate procedures and mechanisms for the green zno nps synthesis the authors focus in particular on the recent developments of green zno nps in plant extracts and their applications in textile wastewater dyes treatment additionally to optimize the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of textile wastewater treatment regulate initial operating parameters which include pollutant concentration reaction time temperature ph and catalyst loading the literature and data collection were investigated using the google scholar database in the period 2010 2021 to search for articles related to textile wastewater green synthesis and photocatalysis studies using zno nps and then examined the resulting articles more thoroughly then further examination using more specific words such as pigment degradation catalytic degradation efficiency improvement exclusion of irrelevant articles 2 characteristics of textile wastewater due to the high consumption of water for processing fabric in the textile factories where huge quantities of high color wastewater containing multiple chemical substances are released into the environment 12 textile wastewater comprises high concentrations of non biodegradable inorganic and organic pollutants with strong color that contribute to increases in biological oxygen demand bod an enormously fluctuating ph chemical oxygen demand cod as well as significant amounts of suspended solids due to fabric production processes such as the fixing bleaching and dyeing agents used for fabric processing at different stages 13 disperse dyes

aromatic ring substituted by a sulfonate group so3 a hydroxyl group oh or even amino group in contrast to natural dyes azo dyes account for more than 50 of all dyes being utilized given their simple

pollutants in textile wastewater it is characterized by low operational cost operates under ambient pressure temperature and achieve complete mineralization as well as is environmentally friendly 4 the advantage of photocatalytic technology is its effectiveness for degrading dyes 56 photocatalytic degradation using sunlight is cost effective 57 the basic principle of the photocatalytic method depends on the generation of oh o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to degrade organic dye pollutants 34 semiconductors for example zno cds tio2 and zns are employed as catalysts and they are activated by ultraviolet and or sunlight to form potent oxidants with the presence of oxygen 11 43 44 zno nps have been employed as photocatalysts for environmental treatment which include the organic pollutants degradation in water given to their exceptional high surface area to volume ratio including their electronic and thermal features 9 when a semiconductor is activated by light the photocatalytic mechanism of pollutant degradation begins with light excitation the light source s photon energy moves electrons from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb culminating in holes

5 in the oxidation process vb h react with electron donors like water to constitute oh radicals the oh free radical is the essential oxidizing process since it is the primary free radical engaged in

maximum excitation wavelength and has a large exciton binding energy 60 mev similar to tio2 7 8 among the characteristics of the ideal photocatalysis of zno are chemical substances optical stability the ability to absorb the reactants under active photocatalysis the possession of bandgaps where there is a definite possibility of hydroxyl radicals and the possibility of reducing superoxide radicals within the gap and a low cost zno has a large number of active sites which makes it a highly active photocatalyst 63 the disadvantage is that it is susceptible to light induced corrosion and the use of ultraviolet light will cause photocatalytic activity to decrease 64 zno catalyzes photocatalytic degradation reactions by exploiting the uv tail which impacts the ground and amounts to around 5 8 of solar radiation on the surface lessening energy costs in organic substances degradation processes 65 the features of zno nps were determined utilizing the microstructures of the materials for instance crystalline density morphology and crystal size 66 a semiconductor catalyst s catalytic activity is anticipated to enhance as the surface area and surface properties vary 67 when the surface to volume ratio of the catalyst particle drops to nanometers in comparison to the bulk material the number of active sites for adsorption grows 67 68 6 green synthesis of zno nps utilizing plant extract for large scale np manufacturing plant extract is the most favored source of nanoparticle np synthesis 69 microwave radiation ultrasonic treatment solid state thermal decomposition laser vaporization hydrothermal as well as sol gel methods are examples of chemical and physical approaches used in the synthesis nps require high energy space and expensive equipment 70 in the comparison of chemical and physical methods green biosynthesis of nps provides an environmentally friendly low cost and safe option 71 the plant parts are washed with well running water to remove mud and suspended impurities after removing exotic materials and defective parts and carefully sorted from other plants next the plant parts are dried in the sun for a period of 3 to 4 days the dried sample mash containing less than 10 moisture using a blender is used to prepare simplicial powder to generate the extract the plant parts are boiled in various solvents ethanol water and later heated to 60 c fig 3 69 the plant extract is mixed witht0 5 mm of zinc oxide hydrated zinc nitrate or zinc sulfate as a metal precursor it is boiled at the required temperature and time unit the phytochemical is formed and the color of the mixture turns out to be pale white or yellow where it represents visual evidence of the nps formation through heat treatment zno nps are obtained zno nps are separated using a centrifuge washed with water and absolute ethanol the precipitate is calcined at a high temperature at 500 c for 3 h to improve the crystallization of zno nps to obtain crystal size fig 4 72 73 the green synthesis studies of zno np with distinct parts of plant extracts are shown in table 3 69 plant extracts are made up of biologically active terpenoids sugars phenolic acids alkaloids proteins and polyphenols which is essential in first reducing metal ions and stabilizing them 75 a nucleophilic aromatic ring in phenols works as an antioxidant and metal chelating agent flavonoids are the most prominent biological reducing agents in plant extracts given their tendency to give hydrogen and electrons atoms the protein functions as a reducing agent supplying electrons to metal ions and therefore stabilizing the reaction indicating the formation of nps 76 in previous literature various plants have been reported to be effective in the zno nps green synthesis 7 application of zno nps in textile wastewater treatment the zno nps has many industrial applications in the piezoelectric devices gas sensors solar cells catalysts energy storage and conversion applications led lights antifungals and bacteria as well as its uses as photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants 89 90 the use of zno nps photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation is a green chemical process for the dyes 91 as zno nps are broadly utilized in the treatment of various organic pollutants in wastewater besides the catalytic treatment works to reduce toxicity and phytotoxicity the disadvantages of application zno nps as photocatalysts of photolysis processes in textile wastewater treatment are the photostability due to photocorrosion under uv light irradiation in addition the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron hole pairs leads to a significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity modification or incorporation of photocatalysts may be a promising method to overcome these problems 92 the potential for wastewater biodegradation 93 isa et al 94 treated methyl orange dye using zno mfs as a photocatalyst the removal rate of dye concentrations and 10 ppm was 99 6 of methyl orange dye with 300 min and 150 mg of the dose at ph 7 inderyas et al 45 recorded fast acid black 1 dye ab1 degradation by zno puf by seeding of zno np 86 with uv for 75 min and 65 by solar after 240 min djebli et al 47 researched methyl orange mo degradation utilizing zinc nitroprusside zn fe cn 5no discovering that the removal efficiency under sunlight was 80 and that the greatest outcomes for photocatalytic degradation of mo on zn fe cn 5no were acquired employing a photocatalyst dose of 0 5 g l1 after a 20 min contact time table 4 8 factors that affect photocatalytic degradation dye concentration light and catalysts are all important elements in the photocatalytic process the photocatalysis process is influenced by the nature of the catalyst and the target pollutant as well as the loading of the catalyst the pollutant concentration light intensity as well as wavelength interfering substances in the solution medium and the ph value of the solution 34 8 1 initial compound concentration the photocatalytic degradation of the dye depends on the initial concentration of the dye s an important factor to consider study the effect of the initial concentration of dye in aqueous solution or synthetic textile wastewater samples with prepare samples of different dye concentration the proportion of photocatalytic degradation declines while dye concentration and catalyst quantity remain constant 101 the photocatalytic degradation percentage decreases with increasing dye concentration which is rationalized based on the following reasons as the concentration of methyl orange rises tio2 surface adsorbs more organic substances while lesser photons can be utilized to attain the catalyst s surface thus it led to a reduction in the degradation rate as the formation of oh reduces 102 as a result the initial dye concentration 25 100 mg l 1 affect the photocatalysis of methylene blue and eosin y with zno np the efficiency of degradation reduced from 87 to 40 the degradation efficiency of eosin y dropped from 93 to 63 when the initial concentration of the solution was raised from 25 to 50 mg l 1 103 in addition the greater the concentration of dye effluent degradation the greater the concentration of intermediates furthermore these intermediates adsorb on the catalyst s surface lowering the photocatalytic degradation efficiency the proportion of photocatalytic degradation diminishes with growing dye concentration while preserving a constant amount of catalyst due to the adsorption of additional organic matter or intermediate materials at a larger concentration on the photocatalyst surface 8 2 catalyst loading as the catalyst loading rises the initial rate of mineralization and degradation rises until the limit is exceeded at which point the rate of mineralization and degradation decreases with high catalyst loading the catalyst absorbs a fraction of the incident light in the suspension and the surge in mineralization and photocatalytic degradation processes characterizes a heterogeneous catalytic system 104 on the other hand excessive catalyst loading hides the photosensitive surface and inhibits light from entering the catalyst thus the catalyst has reduced the activity of releasing hydroxyl radicals and decreased the rate of mineralization and photocatalytic degradation 105 this is because as the catalyst loading density rises the collisions between particles increase 106 according to the findings whenever the dosage is raised to 150 mg br51 degradation achieves a high of 97 33 light scattering by zno nps which is connected to active sites on the zno nps surface lowered br51 degradation at 200 mg as a consequence the ideal dosage of zno nps was established to be 150 mg 107 8 3 time contact time is a crucial factor in the degradation process that must be optimized when the compound to be degraded is exposed to ultraviolet rays for a long time the degradation rate will increase as the oxidation process in the existence of hydroxyl radical rises 108 in contrast because the limit has been reduced the degradation rate has dropped when catalysts are used up the degradation rate decreases 109 the decrease in the reaction rate with the irradiation time is due to the fact that competition for decomposition occurs between the intermediate products and the reactant here the sluggish kinetics of dye decomposition over time is also ascribed to the challenge of interacting short chain aliphatic compounds with oh since methyl orange photolysis was revealed to be stronger at 3 h of visible light irradiation the photocatalyst s life was shortened due to inactivation of the active sites due to precipitation of the intermediate products 110 therefore this confirms that the photodegradation of the photocatalytic reaction rises with increasing irradiation time 8 4 ph a solution s ph influences the dyes photodegradation when the ph of the solution varies the surface charge of the photocatalyst particles varies affecting the catalytic reaction s potential as a consequence the dye s surface adsorption is varied which causes changes in the reaction rate according to previous studies most researchers report that when ph is between 6 and 8 the degradation rate increases and at 9 and 10 the degradation rate will decrease this is due to the fact that the compound has a positive charge at low ph as a result of the adsorption of hydrogen ions in a protonated form and the presence of a catalyst moreover at high ph the degradation and the catalysts decrease and photocatalytic degradation enhances the catalyst surface however gets negatively charged and repulses the compound at a specific ph value restricting photocatalytic degradation 106 at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 150 mg of zno np and 5 ppm of br51 the degradation of br51 was investigated with rising ph the photocatalytic degradation rate is reduced peaking at 98 67 and dropping to 83 67 at ph 11 zno nps have a positive charge since they adsorb hydrogen h 111 8 5 reaction temperature although higher temperatures stimulate charge carrier recombination and organic compound adsorption on the photocatalyst surface temperatures 80 c promote charge carrier recombination and facilitate organic compound adsorption on the photocatalyst surface decreasing the temperature below 0 c boosts the apparent activation energy whereas reducing the temperature below 80 c encourages adsorption as a result the 20 to 80 c temperature range is believed to be an effective photosensitive optimal temperature organic matter mineralization 112 temperature affects the photodegradation of methyl orange and methyl red in the existence of tio2 co as well as la altered tio2 as reported from the investigation the photodegradation efficiency of the dye is proven to be most efficient at higher temperatures although it is least efficient at lower temperatures the enhanced dye molecule interaction with the photocatalyst surface is the cause for this as a result the adsorption intensifies making photodegradation of the dye easier 113 9 optimization of the initial operating parameters using rsm response surface methodology rsm is effectively used in experimental research to improve various initial operating parameters for instance wavelength reaction time ph temperature as well as catalyst loading to enhance the dye efficiency removal in aqueous samples rsm is utilized to reduce the cost of analysis methods as well as the associated digital noise 109 110 in view of this fact optimization has become a choice for improving the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation to achieve the ideal operating parameters for the degradation of disperse dyes as a dye textile wastewater model by zno nps by photocatalysis in an aqueous solution were determined by reviewing the literature relying on the reviews presented in table 5 it can be summarized that some researchers have achieved the best degradation efficiencies in a range of parameter values for example hosseini and babbei 100 treated methylene blue mb from wastewater using a go zno nanocomposite as a photocatalyst to degrade the dye the removal rate was 99 with the highest degradation occurring in the parameter value range of parameters value in 20 140 min and catalyst loading 0 1 2 1 g catalyst loading venkataraghavan et al 116 recorded fast degradation of textile dye degradation efficiency of 92 65 the highest degradation occurred in the range of parameters values in 120 180 min with 10 30 mg l 1 dye concentration employing commercial zno powder yadav et al 117 observed the optimum degradation of methylene blue dye from synthetic textile effluent the removal rate was 94 where the highest degradation occurred in the parameter value range of parameters value in 80 100 min with catalyst loading 0 1 0 3 g catalyst loading and 3 7 of ph which is the parameter value range of parameters value utilizing a hybrid system nanofiltration and photocatalysis in this investigation the central composite design ccd approach of rsm will be utilized to maximize operating parameters to achieve efficiency for photocatalytic degradation of dispersed dyes the range and level of variables are shown the range and level of variables identified by looking at the literature for example design expert v 1l software is used for response surface modeling statistical analysis and optimization 10 conclusions a review of the previous literature showed that dispersed dyes are industrial dyes of a large group employed in the textile industries moreover 85 of dispersed dyes are azos or anthraquinone dyes whereas azo dyes are 50 of the dyes utilized in the textile industry besides textile wastewater comprises a complex mixture of chemical substances and dyes such as disperse dyes which have a high potential as carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic textile wastewater depends on water usage patterns type of chemicals used the level of occupancy and time the discharge of textile wastewater dyes into the environment has dangerous effects thus it is critical to treat dyes in textile wastewater properly chemical and physical methods are frequently employed methods for removing textile dyes still these methods are not destructive and they just transfer pollutants from one stage to the other and need further treatment however aops based on photocatalytic degradation using nanophotocatalysts are promising technologies to degrade the pollutants in textile wastewater which is able to degrade 50 80 of micropollutants like dyes partially zno nps synthesized from plant extract are one of the most frequently utilized photocatalysts

synthesis it contains biomolecules that facilitate the mitigation of metal ions and the stability of nps as a photocatalyst it is a simple convenient and cost effective approach and it has exciting properties for the photocatalysis of dye contaminants it has been reported that to improve the initial operating parameters such as 0 1 2 1 g l 1 catalyst loading 3 6 ph 20 140 of reaction time and 10

13032,textile wastewater comprises a complex mixture of chemical substances and dyes such as disperse dyes which have a high potential as carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic textile wastewater effluent contributes 20 of the water pollution with a high contribution to environmental contamination where about 50 000 tons year of dyes are dumped into the environment the advanced oxidation processes aops which includes photocatalytic degradation pd using nanophotocatalysts is a rising technology causing in completing the mineralization of the dyes compared to traditional treatment techniques such as the absorption method which transfers the pollutants to other stages photolysis is capable of partially degrading 50 to 80 of micro pollutants like dyes using nanophotocatalysts the literature indicates that about 70 to 80 of studies use photocatalysis using zno tio2 as a photocatalyst in wastewater treatment however the photocatalysts used have limited potential for removing dyes from textile wastewater thus it is urgent to improve the zno nps synthesis to maximize the pd efficiency to degrading textile wastewater dyes the present review focuses on exploring the efficiency and mechanism of the photodegradation of textile wastewater dyes using zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps synthesized in the plant extract the highest photolysis efficiency was found at low dye concentrations and ph to improve the initial operating parameters photolysis increases with increasing photocatalysis in the surface area and with an optimum amount of photocatalyst furthermore appropriate photoirradiation is also necessary to conduct the photocatalytic process at room temperature keywords photocatalysis photocatalyst plant extract disperse azo dyes textile wastewater zno nanoparticles zno nps dye degradation 1 introduction the textile industry is among the major producers of contaminated wastewater in the world globally dye production is around 7 106 tons year of which approximately 10 is lost during the dyeing process which was then released into the environment after dying and processing 1 the world bank stated that 20 of industrial water pollution in the world emerging from textile industries 2 as per the u s environmental protection agency 100 200 l of water is consumed per kilogram of fabric processed 2 3 textile wastewater contains a complex of chemicals dyes and reagents with minimal biodegradation and high salinity the discharge of textile wastewater with dispersed dyes into the environment has dangerous effects due to the high potential as carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans the discharge of textile wastewater into the water bodies prevents the penetration of sunlight which is essential for the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and animals the most dangerous effect is interfere with the oxygen transport mechanism between air and water thereby hindering the water self purification process disperse dyes with complex aromatic structures are not completely eliminated during textile wastewater treatment due to has antioxidant potential metal chelating ability and low solubility in water physical and chemical methods such as ultrafiltration chlorination chemical coagulation adsorption on activated carbon reverse osmosis and ion exchange are the most current used for removing the textile dyes these methods are not destructive to the dyes and they transfer the pollutants from one state to the other moreover advanced oxidation processes aops such as photocatalytic degradation pd are an eco friendly technology where pollutants are degraded into less toxic or non toxic components pd is characterized by low operating cost a technique that operates under ambient pressure and temperature which can accomplish complete mineralization for the dyes studies on the biotoxicity of dye degraded by pd confirm the absence of toxic by products 4 the photocatalytic method relies on the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide anion o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to degrade organic dye compounds nanoparticles nps are attracting great interest because of the vast surface area to volume ratio and electronic and thermal features which promote the catalytic activity of absorbing intense ultraviolet uv light and boost photocatalysis process efficiency 5 zno nps are deemed to be ideal due to their broad bandgap 3 37 ev as well as their great ability to absorb uv radiation with a wavelength comparable to or lower than 385 nm 7 8 the chemically synthesized zno nps possess a significant tendency to aggregation due to their considerable surface area to volume ratio which can significantly reduce its photocatalytic activity in addition in an aqueous solution zno has a high recombination rate of the photogenerated electron hole pairs as well as photo instability resulting in a major reduction in pure photocatalytic activity the chemicals used for the synthesis of zno nps and their stabilization are toxic and lead to harmful by products 9 10 these gaps encourage researchers to find an alternative method for the stable and non toxic zno nps synthesis the zno nps synthesis in plant extracts has generated a great deal of interest in providing a new pathway for researchers to find the substances as they are safe and environmentally friendly methods 9 11 green zno nps are among the most successful and advanced solutions for treating dye contaminated water since they are safe and employ sustainable techniques with no toxic by products 11 the present review

when the surface to volume ratio of the catalyst particle drops to nanometers in comparison to the bulk material the number of active sites for adsorption grows 67 68 6 green synthesis of zno nps utilizing plant extract for large scale np manufacturing plant extract is the most favored source of nanoparticle np synthesis 69 microwave radiation ultrasonic treatment solid state thermal decomposition laser vaporization hydrothermal as well as sol gel methods are examples of chemical and physical approaches used in the synthesis nps require high energy space and expensive equipment 70 in the comparison of chemical and physical methods green biosynthesis of nps provides an environmentally friendly low cost and safe option 71 the plant parts are washed with well running water to remove mud and suspended impurities after removing exotic materials and defective parts and carefully sorted from other plants next the plant parts are dried in the sun for a period of 3 to 4 days the dried sample mash containing less than 10 moisture using a blender is used to prepare simplicial powder to generate the extract the plant parts are boiled in various solvents ethanol water and later heated to 60 c fig 3 69 the plant extract is mixed witht0 5 mm of zinc oxide hydrated zinc nitrate or zinc sulfate as a metal precursor it is boiled at the required temperature and time unit the phytochemical is formed and the color of the mixture turns out to be pale white or yellow where it represents visual evidence of the nps formation through heat treatment zno nps are obtained zno nps are separated using a centrifuge washed with water and absolute ethanol the precipitate is calcined at a high temperature at 500 c for 3 h to improve the crystallization of zno nps to obtain crystal size fig 4 72 73 the green synthesis studies of zno np with distinct parts of plant extracts are shown in table 3 69 plant extracts are made up of biologically active terpenoids sugars phenolic acids alkaloids proteins and polyphenols which is essential in first reducing metal ions and stabilizing them 75 a nucleophilic aromatic ring in phenols works as an antioxidant and metal chelating agent flavonoids are the most prominent biological reducing agents in plant extracts given their tendency to give hydrogen and electrons atoms the protein functions as a reducing agent supplying electrons to metal ions and therefore stabilizing the reaction indicating the formation of nps 76 in previous literature various plants have been reported to be effective in the zno nps green synthesis 7 application of zno nps in textile wastewater treatment the zno nps has many industrial applications in the piezoelectric devices gas sensors solar cells catalysts energy storage and conversion applications led lights antifungals and bacteria as well as its uses as photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants 89 90 the use of zno nps photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation is a green chemical process for the dyes 91 as zno nps are broadly utilized in the treatment of various organic pollutants in wastewater besides the catalytic treatment works to reduce toxicity and phytotoxicity the disadvantages of application zno nps as photocatalysts of photolysis processes in textile wastewater treatment are the photostability due to photocorrosion under uv light irradiation in addition the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron hole pairs leads to a significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity modification or incorporation of photocatalysts may be a promising method to overcome these problems 92 the potential for wastewater biodegradation 93 isa et al 94 treated methyl orange dye using zno mfs as a photocatalyst the removal rate of dye concentrations and 10 ppm was 99 6 of methyl orange dye with 300 min and 150 mg of the dose at ph 7 inderyas et al 45 recorded fast acid black 1 dye ab1 degradation by zno puf by seeding of zno np 86 with uv for 75 min and 65 by solar after 240 min djebli et al 47 researched methyl orange mo degradation utilizing zinc nitroprusside zn fe cn 5no discovering that the removal efficiency under sunlight was 80 and that the greatest outcomes for photocatalytic degradation of mo on zn fe cn 5no were acquired employing a photocatalyst dose of 0 5 g l1 after a 20 min contact time table 4 8 factors that affect photocatalytic degradation dye concentration light and catalysts are all important elements in the photocatalytic process the photocatalysis process is influenced by the nature of the catalyst and the target pollutant as well as the loading of the catalyst the pollutant concentration light intensity as well as wavelength interfering substances in the solution medium and the ph value of the solution 34 8 1 initial compound concentration the photocatalytic degradation of the dye depends on the initial concentration of the dye s an important factor to consider study the effect of the initial concentration of dye in aqueous solution or synthetic textile wastewater samples with prepare samples of different dye concentration the proportion of photocatalytic degradation declines while dye concentration and catalyst quantity remain constant 101 the photocatalytic degradation percentage decreases with increasing dye concentration which is rationalized based on the following reasons as the concentration of methyl orange rises tio2 surface adsorbs more organic substances while lesser photons can be utilized to attain the catalyst s surface thus it led to a reduction in the degradation rate as the formation of oh reduces 102 as a result the initial dye concentration 25 100 mg l 1 affect the photocatalysis of methylene blue and eosin y with zno np the efficiency of degradation reduced from 87 to 40 the degradation efficiency of eosin y dropped from 93 to 63 when the initial concentration of the solution was raised from 25 to 50 mg l 1 103 in addition the greater the concentration of dye effluent degradation the greater the concentration of intermediates furthermore these intermediates adsorb on the catalyst s surface lowering the photocatalytic degradation efficiency the proportion of photocatalytic degradation diminishes with growing dye concentration while preserving a constant amount of catalyst due to the adsorption of additional organic matter or intermediate materials at a larger concentration on the photocatalyst surface 8 2 catalyst loading as the catalyst loading rises the initial rate of mineralization and degradation rises until the limit is exceeded at which point the rate of mineralization and degradation decreases with high catalyst loading the catalyst absorbs a fraction of the incident light in the suspension and the surge in mineralization and photocatalytic degradation processes characterizes a heterogeneous catalytic system 104 on the other hand excessive catalyst loading hides the photosensitive surface and inhibits light from entering the catalyst thus the catalyst has reduced the activity of releasing hydroxyl radicals and decreased the rate of mineralization and photocatalytic degradation 105 this is because as the catalyst loading density rises the collisions between particles increase 106 according to the findings whenever the dosage is raised to 150 mg br51 degradation achieves a high of 97 33 light scattering by zno nps which is connected to active sites on the zno nps surface lowered br51 degradation at 200 mg as a consequence the ideal dosage of zno nps was established to be 150 mg 107 8 3 time contact time is a crucial factor in the degradation process that must be optimized when the compound to be degraded is exposed to ultraviolet rays for a long time the degradation rate will increase as the oxidation process in the existence of hydroxyl radical rises 108 in contrast because the limit has been reduced the degradation rate has dropped when catalysts are used up the degradation rate decreases 109 the decrease in the reaction rate with the irradiation time is due to the fact that competition for decomposition occurs between the intermediate products and the reactant here the sluggish kinetics of dye decomposition over time is also ascribed to the challenge of interacting short chain aliphatic compounds with oh since methyl orange photolysis was revealed to be stronger at 3 h of visible light irradiation the photocatalyst s life was shortened due to inactivation of the active sites due to precipitation of the intermediate products 110 therefore this confirms that the photodegradation of the photocatalytic reaction rises with increasing irradiation time 8 4 ph a solution s ph influences the dyes photodegradation when the ph of the solution varies the surface charge of the photocatalyst particles varies affecting the catalytic reaction s potential as a consequence the dye s surface adsorption is varied which causes changes in the reaction rate according to previous studies most researchers report that when ph is between 6 and 8 the degradation rate increases and at 9 and 10 the degradation rate will decrease this is due to the fact that the compound has a positive charge at low ph as a result of the adsorption of hydrogen ions in a protonated form and the presence of a catalyst moreover at high ph the degradation and the catalysts decrease and photocatalytic degradation enhances the catalyst surface however gets negatively charged and repulses the compound at a specific ph value restricting photocatalytic degradation 106 at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 150 mg of zno np and 5 ppm of br51 the degradation of br51 was investigated with rising ph the photocatalytic degradation rate is reduced peaking at 98 67 and dropping to 83 67 at ph 11 zno nps have a positive charge since they adsorb hydrogen h 111 8 5 reaction temperature although higher temperatures stimulate charge carrier recombination and organic compound adsorption on the photocatalyst surface temperatures 80 c promote charge carrier recombination and facilitate organic compound adsorption on the photocatalyst surface decreasing the temperature below 0 c boosts the apparent activation energy whereas reducing the temperature below 80 c encourages adsorption as a result the 20 to 80 c temperature range is believed to be an effective photosensitive optimal temperature organic matter mineralization 112 temperature affects the photodegradation of methyl orange and methyl red in the existence of tio2 co as well as la altered tio2 as reported from the investigation the photodegradation efficiency of the dye is proven to be most efficient at higher temperatures although it is least efficient at lower temperatures the enhanced dye molecule interaction with the photocatalyst surface is the cause for this as a result the adsorption intensifies making photodegradation of the dye easier 113 9 optimization of the initial operating parameters using rsm response surface methodology rsm is effectively used in experimental research to improve various initial operating parameters for instance wavelength reaction time ph temperature as well as catalyst loading to enhance the dye efficiency removal in aqueous samples rsm is utilized to reduce the cost of analysis methods as well as the associated digital noise 109 110 in view of this fact optimization has become a choice for improving the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation to achieve the ideal operating parameters for the degradation of disperse dyes as a dye textile wastewater model by zno nps by photocatalysis in an aqueous solution were determined by reviewing the literature relying on the reviews presented in table 5 it can be summarized that some researchers have achieved the best degradation efficiencies in a range of parameter values for example hosseini and babbei 100 treated methylene blue mb from wastewater using a go zno nanocomposite as a photocatalyst to degrade the dye the removal rate was 99 with the highest degradation occurring in the parameter value range of parameters value in 20 140 min and catalyst loading 0 1 2 1 g catalyst loading venkataraghavan et al 116 recorded fast degradation of textile dye degradation efficiency of 92 65 the highest degradation occurred in the range of parameters values in 120 180 min with 10 30 mg l 1 dye concentration employing commercial zno powder yadav et al 117 observed the optimum degradation of methylene blue dye from synthetic textile effluent the removal rate was 94 where the highest degradation occurred in the parameter value range of parameters value in 80 100 min with catalyst loading 0 1 0 3 g catalyst loading and 3 7 of ph which is the parameter value range of parameters value utilizing a hybrid system nanofiltration and photocatalysis in this investigation the central composite design ccd approach of rsm will be utilized to maximize operating parameters to achieve efficiency for photocatalytic degradation of dispersed dyes the range and level of variables are shown the range and level of variables identified by looking at the literature for example design expert v 1l software is used for response surface modeling statistical analysis and optimization 10 conclusions a review of the previous literature showed that dispersed dyes are industrial dyes of a large group employed in the textile industries moreover 85 of dispersed dyes are azos or anthraquinone dyes whereas azo dyes are 50 of the dyes utilized in the textile industry besides textile wastewater comprises a complex mixture of chemical substances and dyes such as disperse dyes which have a high potential as carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic textile wastewater depends on water usage patterns type of chemicals used the level of occupancy and time the discharge of textile wastewater dyes into the environment has dangerous effects thus it is critical to treat dyes in textile wastewater properly chemical and physical methods are frequently employed methods for removing textile dyes still these methods are not destructive and they just transfer pollutants from one stage to the other and need further treatment however aops based on photocatalytic degradation using nanophotocatalysts are promising technologies to degrade the pollutants in textile wastewater which is able to degrade 50 80 of micropollutants like dyes partially zno nps synthesized from plant extract are one of the most frequently utilized photocatalysts in the photolysis of dangerous organic and inorganic pollutants such as dyes for the large scale production of stable nps of diverse shapes and sizes plants are the most prevalent source of np synthesis it contains biomolecules that facilitate the mitigation of metal ions and the stability of nps as a photocatalyst it is a simple convenient and cost effective approach and it has exciting properties for the photocatalysis of dye contaminants it has been reported that to improve the initial operating parameters such as 0 1 2 1 g l 1 catalyst loading 3 6 ph 20 140 of reaction time and 10 30 pollutant concentration by using rsm to enhance the efficiency of dye removal in aqueous media finally the review of this literature focuses on addressing the highlighted gaps in the literature to understand the relationship between the synthesis of a green method photocatalytic activity of zno nps photocatalyst from plant extract in the decomposition of disperse dyes in aqueous media and textile wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial

13033,reverse electrodialysis red generates electricity from the potential energy created by mixed water solutions producing a salinity gradient this study presents a review of the most important

an acid and a base through a bipolar membrane and a heat engine are studied additionally this work presents key electrochemical properties operational parameters and stack designs a key drawback of all membrane processes is fouling this work reviews the types of fouling faced by red and the available antifouling strategies the pilot scale and limitations of red commercialization are discussed a new red hybrid process is proposed for potable water production hydrogen generation and desalination applications which simultaneously produce energy keywords fouling ion exchange membranes reverse electrodialysis salinity gradient power blue energy abbreviations red reverse electro dialysis iem ion exchang membrane aem anion exchange membrane cem cation exchange membrane 1 introduction the generation and utilization of energy is a direct indicator of societal advancement the environmental impact of fossil fuels primarily leading to greenhouse gas emissions and pollution and increasing demands for energy for industrialization population growth and urban expansion have led to the need for the advanced development of renewable energy for the sustainable development of human civilization the extraction of clean energy from the environment is essential because of safety considerations nuclear energy cannot replace fossil fuels 1 4 therefore other efficient renewable energy sources are urgently required several types of renewable energy e g tidal wind geothermal and solar have been developed but they are available only at limited times 3 5 according to the international renewable energy agency energy consumption and demand will increase by 80 by 2050 6 salinity power is renewable and has no significant operational hazards and does not cause co2 emissions 7 8 salinity gradient power sgp is extracted by mixing water streams of different salinities the spontaneous and irreversible mixing of seawater and river water leads to an increase in system entropy this change in potential can be utilized to produce electrical energy salinity gradient energy is the second largest energy source in the world theoretically a magnificent amount of 1 4 2 6 tw year power could be produced by utilizing the worldwide salinity gradient the estimated total global salinity power would be sufficient to meet the global electricity demand 2 tw or 16 of the total present energy consumption 9 10 membrane techniques for capturing sgp include reverse electrodialysis red and pressure retarded osmosis pro in red the transport of positive and negative ions through selective ion exchange membranes iems occurs whereas semipermeable membranes transfer water molecules using pro based on the literature red has a higher power generation potential than pro for seawater and river water and it is less sensitive to membrane fouling 3 7 11 14 the mechanical reliability owing to the absence of moving parts energy source sustainability e g seawater river water and wastewater and high energy efficiencies achieved by the direct conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy are advantages of red 15 16 up to now some articles have reviewed the red process 11 16 19 but they have provided limited aspects of red also in recent years many studies have investigated different points of the red process that have not been reviewed in previous review articles this article thoroughly studies reverse electrodialysis and its considerations a stack of red is similar to regular electrodialysis ed the same devices can be used in both systems however cell specifications should be optimized for each process the thickness of spacers is typically between 0 3 and 1 mm in commercial electrodialysis whereas it is 0 1 0 3 mm for the red process owing to the reduction in electrical resistance and the enhancement of power density 20 fig 1 shows a schematic of the red system which consists of cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems cations and anions in the concentrated stream move toward the dilute stream owing to salt concentration difference through the cems and aems the salinity difference on either side of the membrane facilitates ion transport via the iems which can be converted to electricity using electrodes i e anode and cathode ion transport via the electrodes is converted to electrical energy by a reversible redox reaction in large scale applications there are multiple cems and aems between the two electrodes 11 12 20 21 spacers are used to maintain an appropriate distance between the membranes and to create compartments for feed solutions 22 owing to their different aims the optimal designs of red and ed are not identical ed requires a large feedwater compartment and high flow velocity due to reduced salt depletion in the boundary layers near the membrane 12 moreover the co ion and counter ion fluxes have the same direction in red whereas they are different in ed it is due to the driving force of red is the salt concentration difference between the dilute and concentrate compartments whereas externally applied voltage is the driving force in ed 20 low thickness for iems is desirable in both processes to minimize electrical resistance however membranes are thicker in ed because of their mechanical stability in different feed conditions different ph temperature etc membranes having high thicknesses are not preferred due to the high electrical resistance in red that leads to a reduction of power density in red 23 some studies have modeled and simulated different aspects of the red process 24 32 2 red performance 2 1 power density in red systems the net power density as a representative of their performance is expressed in watts per square meter of membrane area eq 1 the net power density is the difference between the gross power density and the power loss by pumping 33 35 1 p net p gross p pumping e ocv 2 4 n m r i where pgross is gross power density ppump is pumping power nm is the number of membranes ri is the total internal area resistance and eocv is the open circuit voltage ocv 2 2 energy efficiency the actual processes are not completely reversible owing to the unavoidable production of entropy based on the second law of thermodynamics entropy production leads to reduction in the amount of energy available for conversion to useful work energy efficiency η is the percentage of the gibbs free energy of feedwater mixing δg mix which is converted to useful work w it quantifies the amount of available energy for the process eq 2 36 39 2 η w δg mix 100 2 3 ocv the ocv is the maximum voltage that can be achieved in the red system it can be measured under zero current conditions i e at the initial time when no current is applied the voltage can be estimated using eq 3 this voltage is eocv 40 42 3 e ocv 2 n r t f i n α i z i ln a i hcc a i lcc where α is the permselectivity of ionic species i th n is the number of membrane pairs r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the absolute temperature k f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol n is the number of the ion species ai is the activity of the ionic species i th in the solution and zi is the valance of the diffusion ion eq mol 1 subscripts hcc and lcc indicate high and low concentrated solution respectively 2 4 potential ratio the potential ratio is another parameter used to express red performance it is calculated as the value of permselectivity α over area resistance α2 r permselectivity and area resistance are the main factors that affect the maximum power density in red systems therefore the potential ratio can be an indication of the performance of iems in red 43 3 red membranes 3 1 iems the concept of ion transport by selective membranes for energy generation in red has attracted considerable attention in recent years the principle of red is based on the selective transport of cations or anions through iems under the influence of concentration difference 20 44 45 iems are polymeric films with anionic or cationic exchange groups that transport counter ions 46 47 in an ideal case only counter ions can pass through the iem whereas the co ions and water are rejected in practical situations iems are not 100 selective and they allow the transportation of ions having the same charge i e co ions 48 49 iems are the primary components of red especially on a large scale currently available commercial iems do not satisfy red requirements because they have not been designed for this purpose 43 50 51 to scale up the iems for red efficiency and durability are the key factors 52 in practical red applications the most desirable properties of iems are high selectivity low electrical resistance good mechanical strength and high chemical stability 47 the properties of iems are related to the presence of charged groups the type distribution and amount of ion exchange groups determine the iem properties based on the type of the fixed charge group iems can be classified as weak and strong acid membranes i e cems or weak and strong base membranes i e aems strong cems contain sulfonic groups whereas weak cems have carboxylic groups as fixed charged groups aems contain quaternary and tertiary amine groups as fixed positively charged groups amphoteric bipolar and charge mosaic membranes are other types of iems 46 48 53 based on the distribution of ion exchange groups iems can be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous both have advantages and limitations heterogeneous iems have easier preparation procedures higher mechanical strength and lower production costs however they exhibit inadequate electrochemical properties homogeneous membranes exhibit better electrochemical properties but low mechanical strength 54 55 the development of approaches for iem preparation using inexpensive materials is a major factor most iem preparation processes are complicated and require toxicity risk management they also involve several manufacturing steps and long process times moreover they typically are not energy efficient 45 52 56 homogeneous membranes have been prepared using different techniques such as homogeneous polymerization or polycondensation of monomers and the introduction of an anionic or cationic group into a polymer followed by the dissolution of the polymer and casting 43 at the lab scale iems are generally fabricated using the following processes dissolution of polymeric materials for preparing iems in solvents casting of solutions onto a flat plate evaporation of solvents and selective post modifications 56 the bilayer iems are another kind of ion exchange membranes that are permeable for both co ions and counter ions in solution with different diffusivities and they have increased the selective properties compared to homogeneous membranes with the same value of the fixed charge density these membranes consist of two homogeneous charged layers from the same or different material or modifying one side of the membrane by highly charged layers 57 moya 57 studied the behavior of bilayer iems in a red stack based on the nernst planck donnan equations the ocv and the maximum power output in a bilayer iems were higher than a homogeneous membrane with an identical value of the fixed charge concentration in the equivalent system the ocv and the maximum power enhanced when the degree of inhomogeneity in the fixed charge distribution of the membrane increased an increase in the thickness of the diffusion boundary layers or decrease in leads to a slight increase in ocv and power output between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems another fabrication method is radiation grafting this technique is used in electrochemical technologies for fuel cells red systems and redox flow batteries it uses γ rays or electron beams to irradiate the polymer films the films are activated to create active centers via exposure to high energy radiation and the introduction of chemical groups such as radicals and peroxides the preparation of graft copolymer membranes can be initiated by the copolymerization of a range of vinyl monomers radiation exposure generates active centers on the surface and film bulk even at high thicknesses based on their requirements these grafts can be further modified for post effect 45 58 it has been reported that the stability of iems can be improved through radiation chemical grafting polymerization in hydrocarbon polymers it can also be improved by crosslinking divinylbenzene or other agents modification can be achieved by incorporating functional groups into the polymers which is a commonly used method for synthesizing polymeric iems 45 the selection of different polymeric matrices variation of functional groups use of various additives alteration of crosslinking density surface modification polymer blending and more uniform distribution of functional groups are interesting approaches for iem fabrication 55 an important advantage of grafting polymerization utilizing the post effect is that the stages of irradiation and grafting polymerization are temporally separated this approach opens broad prospects for the preparation of materials with the required thickness from the commercially available films 3 1 1 material for iems preparation the selection of appropriate membrane materials is a major challenge to the red development of effective iems several polymers have been used as inert matrices generally materials for the preparation of homogeneous membranes can be classified based on hydrocarbon and perfluorocarbon bases perfluorocarbon membranes are typically used in applications having high chemical and thermal stabilities such as chloro alkali processes and fuel cells 43 45 47 polyethylene polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride are examples of hydrocarbon based analogs and poly vinyl fluoride poly vinylidene fluoride and poly tetrafluoroethylene are examples of fluorinated analogs alongside the base polymers the membrane transport properties are related to the nature and concentration of the charged groups sulfonic acid groups having fixed negative charges and quaternary ammonium groups with fixed positive charge are common in most commercially available iems these charge groups maintain high conductivity of membranes by their dissociation over the ph range so3 coo po3 2 pho2 aso3 2 and seo3 are negatively charged moieties n h2r n hr2 n r3 p r3 and s r3 are positively charged moieties 45 47 59 poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide ppo is commonly used for red membrane preparation 21 43 50 60 ppo is a polymer that has excellent membrane forming properties low cost high glass transition temperature tg 210 c and exhibits high thermal chemical and hydrolytic stabilities owing to the hydrophobicity of ppo and its dissolution in conventional dipolar solvents charged groups have been introduced this process causes ppos to become highly hydrophilic and more ion exchangeable 52 60 63 a sulfonated ppo sppo is the desired polymer for cem the basic molecular structure of sppo is shown in fig 2 52 64 generally sulfonic groups are functional groups in fuel cells and red membranes the sulfonation reaction is performed using chlorosulfonic sulfuric acid in dichloroethane and silver sulfate is used as a catalyst 45 47 50 65 additionally membranes containing sulfonic groups can be obtained via grafting copolymerization 45 sulfonation reactions are carried out to enhance the hydrophilicity and ion exchange capacity iec and supply better conditions for chemical modification 50 66 3 1 2 electrochemical and physical properties the electrochemical properties of iems have a significant effect on their red performance the optimization of these properties is challenging because of their counteracting effects thus it is worthwhile to study the membrane properties of red if performance optimization is desired the important membrane properties in the red process are permselectivity area resistance swelling degree sd ion exchange capacity iec and fixed charge density cd 43 50 67 the main iem properties for effective and practical red systems are membrane resistance and permselectivity these parameters are affected by sd and iec additionally desirable chemical and mechanical stabilities and low cost membranes are required in electrochemical systems 20 67 68 3 1 2 1 iec the iec is the milli equivalent of ion exchange groups per unit of dry membrane mass 1 g dry membrane iec presents information about the density of ionizable functional groups in the membrane which are responsible for conductivity and charged nature of the membrane iec measurements are carried out via the exchange of ionic species first the membranes are immersed in a solution containing the first ionic species after equilibrium it is rinsed with demineralized water and equilibrated with another salt solution the ions exchanged and extracted from the membrane are measured using titration ion chromatography or inductively coupled plasma 67 69 71 3 1 2 2 sd by immersing dry membranes in water they absorb a certain amount of water the indication for water absorption by the membrane due to hydration is degree of swelling in the red systems which can be measured based on the membrane weight the membranes are immersed in water for at least 24 h after removing the membranes the surface water is removed the membranes are then weighed the wet membrane is then dried in a vacuum oven until a constant dry weight is achieved using eq 4 the sd is calculated where mwet and mdry are the masses of the wet and dry membranes respectively 18 67 72 4 sd m wet m dry m dry 100 the sd depends on the structure and material of the membrane as well as the outer solution conditions and it is limited by cross linking a high sd leads to a decrease in the cd thus a low sd is favorable and a high sd is considered to have a negative effect polymers containing charged groups i e active polymers often lead to a high degree of swelling hence to obtain a high cd the ratio between reinforcing and active polymers is usually optimized a high sd can have a positive effect when the area resistance of the membrane decreases especially for aems the increase in hydrophilicity is mainly related to the low degree of crosslinking the hydrophilic nature of the membrane has a desired effect on the sd and area resistance controlling the swelling behavior of the iems is crucial for achieving high permselectivity and ion conductivity the sd is also affected by the mechanical properties ion selectivity dimensional stability and electrical resistance of the membranes 18 43 67 70 3 1 2 3 fixed cd the fixed cd is the milli equivalent of fixed groups attached to the polymer backbone in iems per unit volume of absorbed water in the membrane i e meq l 1 which can be obtained by the iec over the membrane sd see eq 5 a higher cd indicates stronger exclusion of co ions therefore a decrease in co ion permeation increases the selective transport of counter ions and cd resulting in high permselectivity 60 67 73 5 cd fix iec sd 3 1 2 4 resistance electrical resistance is an essential property of iems because it directly affects the maximum power output of red the feedwater compartments salt concentrations and temperatures have a significant influence on the electrical resistance of the red stack 12 43 46 the electrical resistance comprises the ohmic and non ohmic resistances the ohmic resistance is related to the conductivity of the iems and feed streams i e aem cem river and seawater compartments non ohmic resistance refers to the change in the concentration of the bulk solution and the diffusive boundary layer near the membrane surface i e concentration polarization 12 34 74 via the transfer of ions from the seawater toward the river water side and the onset of an electrical current the non ohmic resistance develops slowly the migration of ions leads to a reduction in the salinity gradient and consequently reduces the driving electromotive force which can be introduced as a non ohmic resistance when it is divided by the electrical current the unit of membrane resistance is generally ω cm2 34 46 the total electrical resistance of a red stack is the sum of its ohmic and non ohmic resistances as shown in eq 6 theoretically the resistances can be estimated based on water conductivity membrane specification flow rate cell dimensions and water temperature 34 42 6 r total r ohmic r non ohmic the applied electrical current is suddenly interrupted to determine the ohmic and non ohmic resistances a sudden jump in voltage reveals ohmic resistance the time dependent voltage change is related to the non ohmic resistance because the transfer of ions leads to the reduction of the concentration gradient between the concentrated and diluted solutions over time resulting in a decrease in the potential difference 12 67 fig 3 shows the measurements of the ohmic and non ohmic resistances the pure membrane resistance can be determined via two experiments with and without the membrane blank run the slope of the curve of the current density versus the potential difference is the resistance the pure membrane area resistance is obtained by subtracting the measured resistance in the blank run from the resistance in the run with the membrane 46 72 in ideal system the power density is in maximum value when the load resistance is equal to the stack resistance but moya 75 and weiner et al 76 exhibited the load resistance that maximizes the gross power density is smaller than the stack resistance due to variations of salinity along with the stack and concentration polarization moya investigated the effect of the concentration polarization on the maximum power density for the red system it was done based on the comparison of the internal and optimal load resistances for non ideal selective membranes with different fixed charge densities the concentration polarization leads to a reduction of power in the red stack it is more evident when the electric current increases they also exhibited a decrease in the membrane fixed charge concentration reduces the power harvesting and the behavior of the system is similar to the ideally selective membrane at the high values of the membrane fixed charge concentration 3 1 2 5 permselectivity based on the donnan exclusion the fixed charged groups in the iems reject the ions having the same charge permselectivity is the ability of the membrane to transfer selective specific ions and is a practical parameter related to donnan exclusion in iems arising from the nature of the membrane for discriminating co and counter ions this type of distinction is caused by the magnitude and nature of the membrane fixed charge 67 70 71 77 78 a higher permselectivity results in an increase in voltage output ideally the permselectivity of iems is one indicating that the membrane transfers counter ions through the membrane and completely rejects co ions the co ions also pass through the membrane in practical systems consequently membrane permselectivity is less than one 11 permselectivity is related to the electrochemical potential difference between river water and seawater in the red system the increase in electrochemical potential leads to the achievement of high power density per unit membrane area factors such as cd counter ion binding affinity and dilute solution mobility are influenced by membrane permselectivity high counter ion binding affinities to the fixed charge group in the membrane and the polarizability of the co ion show lower permselectivity because of counter ion condensation for example ammonium ions have a high binding affinity to cation exchange resins than do sodium ions consequently the permselectivity is lower highly concentrated brine reduces permselectivity 22 70 79 80 permselectivity ps or α is measured based on the number of counter ions as expressed in eq 7 7 p s t m t 1 t where t is the number of counter ions transported in the solution phase and t m is the counter ion transport number in the membrane phase to determine the permselectivity of the ion conductivity and to distinguish between the preferred cation and anion transport properties the membrane remains in contact with the electrolyte on both sides and the transfer of electrons is completely blocked therefore the ionic conductivity can be determined by measuring the ionic current through the membrane as a function of the potential drop across the membrane it is well known that both the volumetric and gravimetric sds of iems are caused by the presence of active functional groups i e fixed charges as expected membranes having a high degree of swelling exhibit low area resistances a high iec does not simultaneously occur with a low area resistance but the cd plays a more important role than the iec other factors must also be considered such as the density of the polymer network the cd the morphology of the membrane and the hydrophilic property of the matrix polymer permselectivity depends on the fixed cd which is a function of the sd and iec iems having a high iec can possess low permselectivity owing to their high degree of swelling however by controlling the sd of membranes improvements to the iec can yield a higher permselectivity 70 73 81 strong interactions between fixed charge groups in iems and counter ions in solutions i e binding affinity may lead to counter ion condensation fig 4 resulting in lower membrane permselectivity counter ion condensation increases the transport of co ions through the iems the effects of polarizability and counter ion sizes should be considered permselectivity increases with increased counter ion polarizability and the size of the counter ion 79 3 1 2 6 mechanical strength the mechanical strength of the membrane is a crucial parameter for maintaining high durability under hydraulic pressure over the membrane and the osmotic pressure arises from the concentration gradient it is neither serious nor critical for red unlike the ed and pro a high salinity gradient in some ed systems e g deionization leads to the exertion of osmotic pressure on the membrane whereas the concentration difference is in the range of 0 01 0 5 m in typical river water seawater cases a bit above order of range 18 3 1 3 modification several modification methods have been used to improve the properties of iems and obtain specific properties these methods include surface modification 69 82 85 variations of functional groups 70 use of different polymers and additives 52 61 86 91 polymer blending 43 54 and special treatment of the base membrane after fabrication 54 92 93 membrane modification generally imparts promising advantages such as fouling prevention lower power consumption lower pretreatment cost and high membrane hydrophilicity 94 95 table 1 provides information about the tailor made iems for red the membrane made by safronova et al shows the highest power density between the tailored membrane under the optimal condition pe grafted by polysulfone with ps grafting degree 32 wt and crosslinking agent vol 3 5 3 1 3 1 blending with additives adding additives e g dope solutions is a simple method of improving iem properties additive properties such as hydrophilicity electrical conductivity and adsorption capacity lead to the production of a membrane having favorable electrochemical properties several studies have reported improvements in membrane performance by incorporating nanoparticles nps and inorganic additives into the cast solutions in this method additives polymers and solvents are mixed finally the membrane is prepared by casting the preparation solution and evaporating the solvent 54 60 96 98 it has been demonstrated that the incorporation of nps into the membrane matrix improves and modifies membrane properties according to different aspects including the structure physicochemical properties hydrophilicity and thermal chemical and mechanical stabilities of the membranes the presence of nps facilitates ion migration and consequently increases the conductivity of the membrane by providing extra ion exchange functional groups in the membrane thus it has been widely used by many researchers in recent decades 61 71 95 99 it has been noted that the membrane performance and properties change at different np concentrations the oxide nanomaterials show a high adsorption capacity owing to the high proportion of active sites at the corners or edges nps can also be covered by other chemicals or polymeric layers to modify their properties and create novel features the modifier layer can comprise monomers with different functional groups incorporated on the surface of the nps in iems the flux of ions and ionic permeability depend on the electrochemical properties and structure of the membranes 66 99 fe2o3 is an inorganic additive employed in membrane solutions to improve membrane properties 52 100 the surface sulfonation of iron oxide has led to extensive modifications in the chemical and morphological i e physical behaviors 101 sulfonated fe2o3 improves the conductivity and hydrophilicity and creates a large specific surface area owing to the decreased crystallite size caused by the functionalization of the so4 2 group compared with the fe2o3 surface this property leads to easy incorporation into the membrane matrix and easy coating ability on different surfaces 50 60 102 hong et al prepared a new type of organic inorganic nanocomposite cem using an optimal amount of fe2o3 so4 2 0 5 0 7 wt which caused enhanced selectivity up to 87 65 and a decreased area resistance 0 87 ω cm2 their results showed that the nanocomposite iems are suitable candidates for energy generation by red 60 in another study hong et al prepared a porous nanocomposite cem in the presence of functionalized iron iii oxide fe2o3 so4 2 this led to significantly improved electrochemical properties a cem containing an optimal amount of fe2o3 so4 2 0 7 wt achieved a gross power density of 1 4 w m 2 in an red system that was higher than commercial combined sewer overflow cso selemiontm japan membranes 50 a negative thin layer in commercial aems comprising sppo and two types of nanomaterials i e oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes or fe2o3 so4 2 nps showed improvements to fouling resistance owing to the modification of the physicochemical characteristics of the membrane surface e g roughness charge and hydrophilicity 95 the results of heidary et al revealed a positive effect on the transport properties and hydrophilicity of iems using fe2o3 nps 52 silica nanoparticles have favorable properties such as superior hydrophilic characteristics high surface energy nontoxicity low cost and thermal resistance 92 the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of the membranes depend on the sio2 np content membranes having an optimal value of sio2 nps show good selectivity iec water content and membrane conductivity thus they can be used in electro membrane applications 71 surface modification of sio2 nps by a sulfonation reaction results in increased conductivity hydrophilicity and mechanical stability of the membranes the size of the inorganic particle fillers affects the pore formation and membrane structure at the interfacial region of the filler and polymer it has been reported that membranes containing larger particle fillers have higher porosities and larger pore sizes than membranes containing smaller particle fillers it is also expected that inorganic fillers with smaller sizes will have a better interaction between the polymer and particles owing to the smaller interfacial gaps 61 researchers have investigated the effects of concentrations and particle sizes 15 and 70 nm silica nps and their electrochemical properties and cem structures in the red process the membranes contain larger particles 70 nm at 0 5 wt sio2 so3h exhibits desirable electrochemical properties and power performance the pore size and porosity increases due to the presence of nps and large pores may lead to a reduction in the selectivity of the membrane caused by the disruption of the functional groups of the polymer matrix however the area resistance of the membrane may decrease 50 multiwall carbon nanotubes mwcnts are a new class of advanced additives utilized in membrane fabrication to improve the physicochemical and electrochemical properties these additives possess attractive features and capacities such as superior electrical and mechanical characteristics 93 tong et al prepared a new type of nanocomposite cem that uses oxidized mwcnts o mwcnts an improvement in the anti fouling properties and power density was observed the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of these cems in optimal inorganic loadings were improved compared with those of membranes without o mwcnts 21 3 1 3 2 blending of two polymers the blending of polymers offers a novel structure with specific characteristics for iem preparation the membranes are expected to be dimensionally and mechanically stable and ion exchangeable 52 55 103 zhang et al prepared a cem by incorporating two organic polymers for red applications including a functionalized sppo polymer and sulfated polyvinyl alcohol spva the prepared membranes in the optimal range of spva 2 10 wt improved the area resistance down to 1 31 ω cm2 and the permselectivity up to 87 which is comparable to commercially available fks fuel cell core fumasep1 germany membranes the highest gross power density was achieved in the membranes containing 5 wt pva which is 14 more than that of fks fuel cell power generation 43 ariono et al prepared a heterogeneous cem by blending polysulfone and polyethylene glycol peg400 the enhancement of water uptake conductivity and iec of the membrane resulted from the hydrophilicity of peg400 the iec and conductivity decreased at high concentrations of peg400 this may have been caused by some ion exchange particles being washed out during membrane immersion 54 3 1 3 3 surface modification modification of the membrane surface can improve its properties the surface properties of membranes play a crucial role in membrane separation their surfaces change during formation or during other enhancement step to provide desired performance thresholds or reduce drawbacks of membrane processes 47 different methods such as plasma modification flame treatment graft polymerization and corona discharge have been utilized in membrane surface modification to obtain appropriate physicochemical properties without affecting bulk properties 69 modification of the membrane surface was performed by guler et al by coating a commercial membrane for the design of monovalent selective aems the coating layer consisted of 2 acryloylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid as the active polymer and n n methylene bis acrylamide as the cross linker an increase in hydrophilicity monovalent ion selectivity and sufficient antifouling properties were observed by the modified membranes but they were not very effective for obtaining higher power densities in red 85 the chemical polymerization of pyrrole on the surfaces of commercial cems leads to the creation of a rigid and tight structure that increases the monovalent selectivity in multi ion solutions for red testing this membrane was designed using polypyrrole ppy chitosan cs composites under polymerization time and a controlled molar concentration of ppy in the composite solution ppy and cs with a focus on red applications under high salinity feed conditions the presence of cs reduces the channel size owing to membrane crosslinking chitosan also contains amino groups that supply a cationic moiety to the membrane structure improvement of the monovalent selectivity na vs mg2 power density and ocv was observed when modified membranes were used 23 amino modification of the cem surface improved the electrochemical properties by increasing the reactivity of the iem surface enhancement of the water affinity and donnan potential has been reported by amino functionalization swaminathan et al found that the ion selectivity of cem was increased by the amine modification surface they used butylamine and two forms of diamine the diamines exhibited better performance owing to the incorporation of crosslinks 107 it has been reported that using nano metal oxides can also modify the membrane surface by incorporating them into the coating solution 66 3 1 4 membrane structure thickness and porosity the morphology of iems is generally dense owing to the efficient donnan exclusion however iems with more open structures can facilitate co ion exclusion and enhance the ion conductivity because of their larger interstitial volume 51 108 the change in the iem structure affects the area resistance and permselectivity membranes with large pores are generally more conductive which leads to a decrease in membrane resistance the results of theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated that thin iems with nano sized pores exhibit ultra permeability and high selectivity therefore these iems are promising candidates for reds 50 109 the thickness of an iem affects its electrochemical properties such as permselectivity and area resistance thin membranes have a relatively lower area resistance than what is desired for red but they may also have low permselectivity which is not favorable however the use of relatively thin membranes is advantageous for the red process because they allow faster ion transfer 73 110 the distribution of particles in the membrane bulk or surface is crucial when fillers such as nps are used a uniform distribution of particles generates more conducting regions in the membranes and provides simple flow channels for the transportation of counter ions the concentration polarization phenomenon can be reduced by strengthening the intensity of the electrical field around the membrane owing to the large conducting regions 86 the membrane structure affects the mobility of ions and their electrochemical properties for example the control of membrane porosity in organic inorganic composite iems has improved conductivity permselectivity water uptake and iec thereby imparting high mechanical and thermal properties generally the porosity and pore size of the membrane are increased in the presence of inorganic particle fillers the use of high concentrations of inorganic fillers leads to agglomeration and forms large voids and pores in the membrane large pores may reduce the membrane selectivity and area resistance they also disrupt the functional groups in the membrane hence controlling the porosity and structure of the membrane is a crucial parameter in red in addition to the filler concentration the size of inorganic fillers affects the porosity and structure of the membranes 61 3 1 5 commercial membrane several studies have investigated commercial cems and aems in the red process as presented in tables 2 and 3 the properties of commercial membranes are different from each other owing to differences in the composition and molecular structure of iems the properties of the iems that are important in the red process are presented in table 2 the manufacturers of commercial iems include nafion dow astom asahi glass selemion fumatech the high cost of some commercial iems limits their wide scale applications 51 106 generally commercial iems possess high permselectivity 0 9 the power densities based on membrane properties stack design and operational conditions is summarized in table 3 based on table 3 cmx manufactured by astom corp ltd japan is a general commercial cation exchange membrane that was investigated under red conditions cmx membranes owing to their good properties such as high charge density mechanical stability ion conductivity and permselectivity are appropriate candidates for the red process unfortunately common commercial iems not been designed for red they are not generally appropriate for red operations especially for hyper concentrated brines 45 51 based on table 3 daniilidis et al achieved 6 7 and 5 8 w m2 power density which is the highest value reported thus far 3 2 nanoporous membrane maximizing the ionic selectivity of two dimensional 2d nanopores is a design technique used in power generators and is achieved by increasing the surface charge and decreasing the pore size generally ion selectivity increases with an increase in channel length smaller pore size and higher density of surface charges on the pore walls the power density is influenced by selectivity power is generated using ion selective pores or channels of nano dimensions in combinatorial membrane materials practically nanopores can be introduced into 2d materials by physical methods such as plasma etching ion bombardment and electron beam irradiation however the process scalability is difficult and the production of high quality large scale 2d membranes is technically challenging additionally the chemical functionality of the pores is poorly controlled it has been reported that the bottom up fabrication of 2d nanoporous membranes can solve these problems 39 109 liu et al 109 presented the bottom up synthesis of thin nanoporous carbon membranes with the distribution of nanopores from core rim structured monomers through a two step approach the thermally stable core forms the frame of the membrane and the thermally unstable rim decomposes and crosslinks the cores the membrane is ultra permeable to cations and exhibits excellent ionic conductivity and high power density consequently it is a suitable candidate for red 3 3 nanofluidic red nfred system recently solid state nanofluidic channels or nanopores having high selectivity and ultra permeability have been proposed for the red process 120 nanopores are filled with an aqueous solution that causes surface charging these charge surfaces absorb counter ions and repel the co ions cations or anions can preferentially pass more preferentially than other types of charged nanopores for example alumina preferentially transfers cations whereas silica nanopores transfer anions the surface of the nanochannels is charged because of ion adsorption surface ionization and ion dissolution under a concentration gradient and because of the ion selectivity of nanopores the diffusion and flow rates of anions and cations are different and not equal consequently an electric current flows in the nanopores this electrical current can provide electrical power by placing electrodes in solutions i e electrochemical redox reactions on electrode surfaces 15 109 120 122 these functional nanofluidic channels or nanopores can be easily modified to obtain high ion selectivity the red system with nanoporous membranes is a desirable candidate for power generation because it contains a parallel structure of nanofluidic channels among various materials for this type of membrane such as polymers silicon and alumina polymeric materials have been applied in different fields owing to their simple fabrication process relatively low cost and excellent biocompatibility fig 5 shows a schematic of the nfred in negatively charged nanopores connecting two reservoirs with different concentrations 15 power generation is affected by the pore number pore geometry dimensions of the nanofluidic channels pores surface chemistry of the nanopore and ph variation of the working solutions it increases by reducing the channel length owing to the low resistance 123 125 temperature is a significant operational factor that affects the performance of nanofluidic reverse electrodialysis nred almost all physicochemical properties such as viscosity permselectivity ion diffusivity electrical conductance of a nanochannel and ionic mobility depend on the temperature an increase in temperature can have positive or negative effects on nred performance the electrical conductivity increased with an increasing temperature in aqueous solutions owing to the decrease in water viscosity which leads to easier ions migration the sensitivity of ion mobility to temperature changes is different temperature changes affect the equilibrium constants of the dissociation the protonation reactions of sialons groups the dissociation constant of water liquid viscosity and ion diffusivity in silica aqueous solution systems all parameters affect the conductance of nanofluidic channels pores moreover an additional increase in temperature may induce bubble nucleation especially in highly concentrated salt solutions in this type of solution hydrophobic pieces are created on the pore surfaces via the salting out effect that covers charged surfaces the weakened polarity in mesopores leads to the entry of more co ions reducing the potential difference across the film and causing a considerable degradation of nred performance 125 127 table 4 provides a summary of nfred studies 3 4 pore filling membrane the pore filling iem consists of a thin polymeric porous substrate and a gel type electrolyte monomer or polymer that fills the substrate pores fig 6 the substrate provides mechanical strength and chemical stability and restricts swelling of the filling polymer electrolyte polymers in pore filling iems allow ion conductivity electrolyte polymer filled pores must have sufficiently high iecs to increase the ion conductivity 56 137 138 pore filling iems exhibit high selectivity and low swelling and porous substrates exhibit lower hydrophilicity compared to electrolyte polymers 56 the desired characteristics can be obtained using a substrate and filling polymer 138 immersing the substrate in an electrolyte or pouring the electrolyte onto the substrate surface leads to impregnation the substrate pores are filled with electrolytes using these two methods solvent evaporation of polymeric electrolytes is used to complete the pore filling of the iem fabrication post modifications can be performed depending on the type of electrolyte used the impregnation process can be repeated to achieve high quality pore filling iems 56 kim et al 137 fabricated pore filling membranes one aem kier aem1 and two types of cems to achieve high gross power density red applications kier aem1 consists of a polymer cross linked using n n bis acryloyl piperazine and vinyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride in a porous polyolefin substrate kier cem1 consists of a polymer cross linked using n n0 ethylene bis acrylamide and vinyl sulfonic acid yang et al proposed a pore filling cem with a porous polyethylene substrate and two types of anionic monomeric electrolytes for use in red they obtained a power density of 1 95 w m2 56 in the next section the profiled membranes show that their fabrication strategy physical is similar to that of pore filling membranes 3 5 profiled membrane spacers are used to separate the iems from each other and the flowing water between them in common ed and red systems however these spacers are generally non conductive hence a large portion of the conductive membrane area was covered with these spacers consequently the available membrane area will be smaller ion transport is reduced and area resistance increases this phenomenon is known as the spacer shadow effect 104 profiled membranes have been proposed as alternatives to traditional net spacers because they possess relief on the surface to separate the iems and supply channels for solution flow profiled iems have improved the performance of red and ed systems by removing the spacer shadow effect and reducing hydraulic losses 31 104 139 the other advantages of profiled membranes are their economic feasibility and cost effectiveness they increase the active membrane area and reduce the ohmic resistance of the stack resulting in lower sensitivity to fouling than that stacks with net spacers the use of profiled membranes also they reduces pumping costs and eliminates the requirement of expensive materials and non conductive spacers 31 140 red stacks with net spacers face high electrical resistance low active membrane area and increased pressure drop corrugations and patterns of profiled iems are essential for exploiting the beneficial effects of these membranes 140 appropriate profiled membrane geometries and reynolds numbers can lead to a reduction of polarization phenomena 31 pawlowski et al simulated fluid behaviors in channels created using different profiled membranes the highest net power density values were obtained in the chevron form because of the increase in the available membrane area and the balance between the enhancement of mass transfer and the pressure drop in the channel 139 the creation of corrugated structures on one or both sides of the membrane were performed using different methods such as casting a membrane solution into a mold followed by solvent evaporation fig 7 hot pressing of a thermoplastic polymer including suitable functional groups and roll pressing i e calendaring of a thermoplastic ion exchange film between corrugated rollers at a high temperature one of the problems of the hot pressing technique is the deformation of the microstructures when the membrane film is released from the mold this problem can be resolved by slightly inclining the sidewalls of the mold or by using anti adhesive coatings 104 using profiled membranes in ed applications has been reported 141 144 but vermaas et al 35 investigated the first successful red operation they investigated heterogeneous iems made by the hot pressing method with ridges and compared their performance with a red stack having flat membranes and non conductive spacers some characteristics of the profiled membranes for red are presented in table 5 4 other concept of red 4 1 red as a flow battery by bipolar membrane generally bipolar membranes are used for the production of acids and bases in the electrodialysis process the neutralization reaction of the acid and base by the bipolar membrane leads to the production of electricity in a red system these membranes are specific types of iems that consist of polymeric films with fixed charges of opposite polarity 5 47 the driving force of red with bipolar membranes is the neutralization reaction of oh with h under ambient conditions acids and bases are the fuels in this system the potential advantages of a neutralization flow battery with bipolar membranes include low environmental impact inexpensive electrolytes and high energy density at high electrolyte concentrations this helps overcome common self discharging problems 4 148 the red bipolar membrane stacks consist of many repeating cell units between electrode compartments in each cell unit there are acid and base compartments on the sides of the bipolar membrane a salt chamber was separated from the base or acid chamber using a cem or aem fig 8 shows a schematic of the stack undercharge lower half and discharge conditions upper half 5 148 the red bp unit can be utilized as a battery by connecting it to an external load electricity is produced by moving h from hcl and oh from naoh toward the water inside each bipolar membrane the role of electrode reactions is converting the ion current to the electronic current that flows by the load of the external circuit 5 by increasing the number of charging discharging cycles the battery performance decreased and the compartments are polluted an increase in the concentration of acid base salt compartments or even their volumes enhances the capacity of the battery it also increases the power density and charge discharge efficiency and reduces the ionic resistivity however these methods are harmful to the process 4 148 4 2 red heat engine closed loop salinity gradient power in recent years new and different applications of sgp technologies have gained attention the sgp unit pro or red operates in a closed loop with artificial saline solutions as feed fluids this closed loop system can be considered a coupled system in which a thermal regeneration process is integrated with sgp processes the advantage of this system is the choice of a saline solution to increase the overall performance the attentive selective of the artificial feed solution leads to the availability of a large volume of gibbs free energy arising mixing low energy consumption in the regeneration unit to restore the original concentration levels of feed solutions and use of waste heat at low temperature as an available and cheap source i e waste heat from industrial processes the existing solutions can be regenerated by a suitable regeneration stage and sent back to the sgp step this makes it an economic system based on waste heat from different industrial processes it can also be considered an sgp heat engine in which low grade heat is transformed to electricity through the sgp technology the use of thermolytic salts such as nh4hco3 can be an appropriate option for converting low grade waste heat into electric current in a red closed loop 149 151 the thermolytic red heat engine consists of two units a red unit and a thermal regeneration unit power is produced in the red unit by extracting the salinity gradient between the nh4hco3 solutions in the second unit low grade waste heat is employed to restitute the initial conditions of the outlet currents of the red unit as the regeneration unit based on fig 9 the concentrate and dilute nh4hco3 are pumped to the red unit to transform their sg to electricity because of the osmotic flux water is transmitted from dilute to concentrated during this process and a part of the salt content in the concentrate solution is transmitted to the dilute solution both salt and water transport must be promoted in the opposite direction to restore the initial conditions of the two currents in the regeneration unit 149 recently researchers have investigated the performance of red units fed with nh4hco3 water solutions bevacqua et al 150 investigated an red system by feeding nh4hco3 solutions to maximize the process performance based on finding operating parameters based on their results feed flow rates higher than one cm s have a negative effect on the power output owing to the pressure drop their findings also revealed that ammonium bicarbonate is an appropriate salt for the red process kim et al 152 developed a model to predict the performance of a red system using nh4hco3 solutions their model substitutes all properties of the solution and membrane for nh4hco3 instead of nacl 5 obstacles of red performance 5 1 fouling in practical applications the use of natural water sources introduces challenges such as fouling fouling is the accumulation of undesired materials at the phase interfaces of the iem membranes this phenomenon is one of the most common drawbacks of all membrane processes this is preventable for large scale red systems iems face several types of fouling such as the adhesion of organic substances biofouling scaling and colloidal fouling the deposition of substances at the interface or inside iems reduces the ion flux and power density and increases the stack and membrane resistance in the red process therefore it is necessary to minimize membrane fouling 21 95 116 145 153 155 fouling affects the major operational parameters it decreases the ocv retards ion migration and increases the feed channel pressure drop and electrical resistance ohmic and non ohmic changes in these parameters affect red performance and may limit the applicability of red for sustainable power generation 111 156 157 fouling is classified into different types based on the nature of the foulants organic fouling is caused by the dissolved organic substances in the membrane matrix colloids or non dissolved suspended solids cause colloidal fouling pore blocking occurs via the deposition of particles having sizes identical to those of membrane pores additionally pore narrowing is created by micro colloidal and soluble organics having a smaller size than the membrane pores the deposition of large particles on the membrane surface and dissolved salts leads to the formation of a cake layer and scaling respectively typical scaling consists of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 and co3 2 95 158 160 biofouling wherein a biofilm is formed on the membrane surface is caused by live microorganisms and bacteria followed by the growth and increase of sessile cells eventually generating a complex structure 161 fouling causes an increase in electrical resistance through two mechanisms first dissolved charged foulants i e organic fouling can counterbalance charged groups in the membrane and increase ohmic resistance which is common in aems second the adherence of colloids on the membrane surface enhances the thickness of the concentration boundary layer and consequently increases the non ohmic resistance 34 mikhaylin et al reviewed the main types of iem fouling by considering the primary factors affecting fouling formation and development they also investigated modern and conventional strategies for controlling and preventing of fouling 162 pawlowski et al utilized 2d fluorescence spectroscopy as to monitor fouling in a red system including fluorescence excitation emission matrices of iem surfaces and natural streams accumulated during one month of red operation they also investigated the efficiency of cleaning strategies their results showed that 2d fluorescence spectroscopy and principal component analysis have high potential for antifouling analysis 163 one fouling problem is preferential channeling which blocks a portion of the feedwater compartments through scaling or colloidal fouling in red this phenomenon causes a significant reduction of power density 74 additionally fouling leads to a pressure drop in the feedwater compartment 109 5 1 1 fouling in aems aems generally undergo with fouling due to the presence of natural organic compounds arising from the negative nature of organic foulants and they are more susceptible to this type of fouling than cems studies have shown that in the absence of antifouling strategies the thickness of the boundary layer increases with the adherence of colloids leading to an increase in the non ohmic resistance and a decrease in red performance 34 95 164 generally fouling in aems is controlled by an increase in hydrophilicity and or negative cd on the membrane surface 21 vaselbehagh improved the anti biofouling properties of aems through surface modification by a polydopamine pda coating the pda coating improved the anti biofouling properties of aems during red operation 165 rijnaarts et al investigated the red performance and fouling of six different aems using natural sea and river water in the netherlands aems are divided into three groups based on their chemistry polymer backbone aromatic and aliphatic acrylamide iec high and medium support thickness and porosity low medium high all aems are homogeneous membranes rijnaarts et al reported that natural fouling is highly dependent on the associated membrane properties and their corresponding chemistries for each aem aromatic aems showed a decrease in permselectivity and enhanced resistance aliphatic aems with a medium sd showed only an increase in membrane resistance whereas aliphatic aems with high sds presented only a decrease in permselectivity rijnaarts et al observed that the negative effect of spacer fouling on the power density was stronger than that of aem fouling 116 additionally vaselbehagh et al showed that a polydopamine coating improved the anti biofouling properties of aems the generated electric field and current prevented bacterial attachment to the aem surface the anti biofouling properties were improved by pda modification 164 5 1 2 fouling in cems generally cems undergo inorganic fouling or scaling which causes problems during red operation the precipitation of salts e g calcium carbonate calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide on the cem surface leads to fouling fouling studies are very scarce in cems because ofthe lack of efficient and clear techniques 17 21 157 regular antifouling treatments such as pretreatment with ultrafiltration are expensive or environmentally undesirable e g disinfectants or coagulants therefore cheap and environmentally friendly antifouling strategies are required disturbances in flow conditions lead to reduced fouling 145 5 1 3 strategies for fouling prevention to maintain high power density and low pressure drop antifouling strategies are required without antifouling strategies the power density decreases by more than 60 during the first hours of red operation 21 145 fouling prevention or control is performed by chemical and physical methods such as mechanical removal air sparging 145 pretreatment of solutions periodic feedwater switching i e reversal polarity 145 cleaning agents 163 166 and membrane modification 17 95 162 table 6 summarizes the fouling studies of red 5 1 3 1 periodic feedwater switching the reversal of periodic feedwater switching is an example of an antifouling strategy the reversal of the electrical field induces osmotic shock and the feedwater pressure increases this method decreases the fouling of charged colloids and organic acids capacitive electrodes are used in the periodic switching of the feedwater vermaas et al used this method as an antifouling method in the red process 145 5 1 3 2 cleaning agents or chemical cleaning the use of chemical cleaning agents is a simple and appropriate method for preventing fouling on the surface of iems during the red process however this method may have a negative effect on membrane performance for example cleaning with alkali solutions may cause the degradation of ion exchange groups or the use of oxidants may lead to the degradation of ion exchange groups 162 166 5 1 3 3 two phase flow cleaning a two phase flow of gas liquid in the membrane process can be utilized to create hydrodynamic instabilities in order to reduce concentration polarization remove cake layers and eliminate biofouling from membrane surfaces or net spacers air is a common gas used in the two phase flow because of its availability ease of storage and handling air sparging is performed by injecting air bubbles into feedwater compartments moreno et al conducted t water co2 sparging they dissolved co2 in the water at a pressure higher than the working pressure of the membrane process and observed that water was supersaturated in co2 upon entrance to the membrane module causing the co2 bubbles to nucleate via to depressurization the co2 nucleation effect such as the spontaneous creation of bubbles occurs at the spacer filaments owing to local pressure differences a phenomenon similar to such as that when opening of a bottle of carbonated drink when the co2 saturated water exits the spacer filled channel co2 dissolution in water is stopped and co2 is released into the atmosphere thus permanent changes do not occur in the nature of the system additionally the induction of co2 in water leads to a decrease in system ph which is a type of chemical cleaning in place two main reasons have been reported about the need for more effective control of fouling in water co2 saturated injection compared with that of water air saturation the stack resistance is increased in the air sparging method owing to the presence of stagnant bubbles in the stack after each air sparging cycle additionally because of the nucleation effect and the decrease in the feedwater ph fouling is reduced with the injection of co2 117 145 5 1 3 4 modification of the membrane surface another method of fouling reduction or prevention includes modifying the membrane surface the use of sulfonating agents or nanomaterials and layer by layer deposition are some approaches to membrane surface modification for fouling prevention and mitigation such techniques improve the physicochemical characteristics of membrane surfaces because the membrane hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and surface charge can be changed using these methods the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and charged foulants can be improved via surface modification and by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface membranes having smooth surfaces have been reported to help decrease fouling by reducing the contact area to avoid the binding of foulants to the membrane surface 17 95 5 2 negative flows iems having fixed charge groups allow counter ions to pass whereas water and co ions are completely rejected in an ideal case in real cases membranes are not ideal selective barriers co ions and water also pass through leading to the reduction of process performance 20 49 to obtain efficient power generation using iems three parameters must be optimized the membrane resistance must be reduced the membrane selectivity must be maximized and molar water permeation should be minimized 39 water transport is affected by hydrostatic pressure electric potential differences in salt concentration friction with ions and pore walls 49 167 5 2 1 effect of water transport in iems to enhance the performance of iems in the red process the molar water permeation across the membrane must be low and the water transference coefficients must be as close to zero as possible water transport is typically induced by hydrostatic pressure differences across the membrane osmosis electro osmosis and water transport in the hydration shell around the ions 39 49 168 tedesco et al investigated the mechanisms of water transport across membranes in red 49 5 2 2 osmosis and electro osmosis osmosis is the non ideal transport of water from the diluted i e river water compartment toward the concentrated i e seawater compartment owing to the difference in water concentration e g osmotic pressure difference across the membrane it is assumed that this effect causes dilution of salt concentrations in the membrane consequently a concave internal concentration profile would yield under ocv conditions osmosis most likely has a negative effect on the thermodynamic efficiency and power density in red because of counter ion diffusion through the membranes and dilution of the boundary layer on the seawater side the effects of co ion and osmosis transport are analogous to self discharge in normal batteries electro osmosis in red is the transport of water molecules with salt ions caused by solvation phenomena in a direction opposite to the direction of the normal osmotic flow this counterbalances the negative effects of normal osmosis 49 67 168 172 5 2 3 co ion transport for ideal iems counter ions only pass through the membrane however in the case of non ideal iems the transport of co ions i e those having the same charge as the fixed ion exchange groups has a negative impact on the power density and consequently leads to a decrease in performance the transport of the co ions occurs in the same direction as that of the counter ions the performance of the red process depends on the membrane properties i e diffusion coefficients and fixed cd and the operating conditions i e residence time inlet concentration and cell pair voltage the fixed cd of the membrane influences the concentration of co ions inside the membrane the transport of co ions under zero current conditions causes the diffusion of nacl through the iem and can be compared to the self discharge phenomenon of batteries 2 20 49 169 173 6 operating parameters 6 1 feed concentration the stack resistance and ocv are increased by lowering the dilute concentration at a constant concentration of the concentrated compartment to counteract the power output high ocv and low stack resistance are desirable for the red process the optimal concentration range depends on factors such as membrane properties stack geometry and flow velocity 18 tedesco et al observed a slight increase in power density when the dilute concentration was less than 0 1 m the increase in chigh leads to an increase in power density at a constant concentration in the diluted compartment owing to the beneficial effect of reducing the stack resistance and enhancing the process driving force e g ocv additionally an increase in chigh leads to a permselectivity reduction because of the presence of a highly concentrated solution in the system 22 generally the permselectivity of iems is reduced when highly concentrated brines are used because of presence of co ions 18 158 zhu et al investigated the effect of two different types of salts in the feed solution on red performance the power density of the red stack with nh4hco3 was lower than that of the stack containing nacl at similar concentrations owing to lower ion activity 174 6 2 divalent and multivalent ions the power density strongly depends on the composition of dilute and concentrated solutions the presence of divalent and multivalent ions i e mg2 ca2 so4 2 is a significant challenge to red it leads to a decrease in the power density ocv permselectivity and an increase in the stack resistance because of the transport of multivalent ions against the concentration gradient i e the uphill transport phenomenon hence the exchange of divalent cations in the dilute chamber with monovalent cations in the concentrated chamber acts against their concentration gradient fig 10 shows different membrane strategies to reduce the influence of multivalent ions in the red process 2 13 48 158 the presence of magnesium ions in natural water significantly affects the performance of the red system ocv and power density even at low concentration 23 115 in uphill transport the resistance increases and the obtainable voltage is reduced in this phenomenon the transport of counter ions in both directions creates equilibrium and removes the net flux of electrical charges removing divalent and multivalent ions can improve the power density of the red process 48 158 post et al investigated the effect of multivalent ions on red performance showing that the presence of multivalent ions leads to high stack resistance and a lowering effect on the stack voltage post et al suggested using monovalent selective membranes in the case of high multivalent ion content in the dilute compartment 13 moreno et al reported that the negative effect of uphill transport was significantly minimized when monovalent selective membranes were used for red e g aem coated selemion cso membrane or highly cross linked neosepta cms membrane 48 river water and seawater primarily constitute na and cl species a complex situation is created because of the presence of both monovalent and multivalent ions hence two monovalent ions are exchanged with one divalent ion the producing voltage is reduced by 7 in the presence of multivalent ions the voltage produced by monovalent ions is twice the creating voltage of multivalent ions eq 1 34 the results of hong et al showed 20 decrease with sodium sulfate 15 with magnesium chloride and 9 with magnesium sulfate compared to the maximum power density with nacl because of the high internal stack resistance 41 several effects of divalent and multivalent ions on the red performance have been reported 115 175 178 there are many divalent cations such as mg2 and ca2 in natural water that are not conducive to power production through red donnan dialysis dd has been proposed as a pretreatment for removing divalent cations 179 it is an attractive process to reduce resistance by exchanging divalent cations with monovalent cations this exchange in the draw solution causes an increase in the concentrations of monovalent cations and a decrease in the concentrations of divalent cations in the feed solution of an red system 19 158 rijnaart et al investigated the effect of dd pretreatment on red power extraction using natural rivers and seawater and compared it with theoretical models their results showed improved gross and net power densities through low resistance due to the exchange between divalent and monovalent cations 158 6 3 natural feed the obtained power density rapidly decreased by 80 from the theoretical expectation by feeding red stacks with natural river water and seawater owing to the presence of natural organic matter nom and membrane fouling nom type and salt concentration are critical parameters for determining the effect of noms on the generated power density nom such as polysaccharides from the decomposition of organic substances humic substances from water through peatland and proteins from organic waste can be found in estuaries nom serves as organic foulants that can form films on the membrane surface 180 181 susanto et al observed different power density behaviors for different types of nom added to diluted saltwater168 kingsbury et al measured power generation from five real water pairs containing mixtures of nom and ions in laboratory scale red stacks they reported that the effect of nom on the power density was stronger than that of inorganic solutes the presence of nom led to increased membrane resistance and reduction of ocv membrane permselectivity and energy extraction efficiency 181 6 4 flow rate residence time the residence time is an influencing parameter of power density the gross power density is maximum at high flow rates low residence time because of the high salinity gradient across the membrane theoretically when the residence time is zero the gross power is at its maximum this phenomenon is caused by the concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane i e dilute and saltwater compartments and it is nearly unaffected by salt transport through the membrane therefore a more uniform concentration gradient is created throughout the red stack consequently rδc 1 1 rδc is the contribution to the resistance due to the concentration change in the bulk solution and rbl 2 2 rbl is the boundary layer resistance resistances are smaller but hydrodynamic power losses should be considered because they are increased by enhancing the flow rate therefore an optimal flow rate value is required to achieve a high power density the net power density is also reduced because of the high power consumption of pumping the feedwater and the pressure drops in the compartments these pressure drops along were not considered in the gross power calculations 6 36 67 the residence time and reynolds number are generally considered for comparison purposes at different scales of red because they are less sensitive to the scale of the experiment an increase in the reynolds number leads to a lower residence time 6 67 a longer residence time i e low flow rate allows a faster transfer of ions from the salt compartments to the fresh compartments therefore the energy efficiency is maximal owing to the equilibrium achievement and low hydrodynamic power losses co ion transport and osmosis play significant roles at low flow rates therefore there exists an optimal flow for maximal net energy efficiency 36 67 zhu et al investigated different flow rates for concentrated and diluted solutions to reduce the pumping energy consumption power was not reduced at lower flow rates because of the trade offs between decreases in the solution resistance of the diluted solution channels and increases in the diffusion boundary layer resistance zhu et al concluded that varying the flow rates of both solutions indicated that the optimum flow rate was 10 ml min for the concentrated solution and 20 ml min for the diluted solution the use of these optimized flow rates minimized the pumping energy compared with higher flow rates 182 6 5 temperature the temperature of the feed streams strongly affected red performance an increase in temperature results in an increase in the obtained gross power density current and reduction of stack resistance it also leads to an increase in conductivity by enhancing the ionic diffusion according to the nernst haskell equation with a reduced solution viscosity by reducing the viscosity the ions can move more easily and the conductivity is increased however the spacer shadow effect and concentration polarization increased with increasing temperature the influence of temperature on the spacer shadow effect is greater than that of the concentration polarization the reason for this behavior is that the non conductive spacers block part of the ionic transport 10 183 184 7 hybrid process the concept of hybrid process and co location is relatively novel concept in reverse electrodialysis the hybrid process minimizes environmental impacts and capital cost of the process the electricity produced by the red process can be converted to other types of energy such as hydrogen energy and can be stored in a battery the red process can be integrated with desalination technologies used for water treatment and for the production of potable water by reducing the influence of brine discharge and while increasing the power density 7 1 reverse osmosis ro and red various combinations of ro and red units are used there are two types of ro red assemblies that can be utilized a single stage operation red can be conducted as a pre or post treatment stage for ro complex arrangements for hybrid red ro units can be developed but they may require a high capital cost according to the schematic shown in fig 11 in ro red mode the effluent of the ro process plays a role of concentrated supply for the red process this unit reduces the environmental impact of the ro brine due to decreasing the salinity of the discharged effluent by the red system it can also reduce energy consumption and the concentrated discharge of ro is a better high salinity source for energy recovery comparing seawater in the red system 185 187 yasukawa et al 187 evaluated the power generation performance of a red stack 200 cell pair and effective membrane area of 40m2 they used the actual reverse osmosis brine and sewage treated water as the feed solutions after adequate pretreatments based on the presented energy analysis by yasukawa et al the conversion efficiency of the red process depends on the operating condition the power output increased with increasing the flow rate the maximum net power was obtained 0 46 w m2 at 1 5 a at a flow rate of 4 3 l min 7 2 red and ro in this mode the seawater feed with high salinity passes from the red unit reducing salinity and producing energy fig 12 then seawater with reduced salinity is pumped into the ro unit owing to the red pre treatment the pump work and concentration of the discharged brine are reduced in the ro unit the feed solution has a relatively low osmotic pressure 185 186 kwon et al modeled two red desalination systems ro and forward osmosis fo their results showed that the energy costs could be lowered by 7 8 from the typical value for ro and 13 5 for fo the power generation by red using fo and ro brines increased 2 and 1 5 times compared to that using seawater 188 li et al 185 developed a mathematical method for variety of red ro configurations for analyzing the effecting factors li et al also discussed the implications for developing the red ro processes based on the modeling results the modeling results indicated that the red ro process reduced the specific energy consumption 7 3 solar energy red a combination of seawater desalination red and solar power utilization can simultaneously produce potable water and energy a large portion of the energy consumed during the ro process is saved as osmotic energy in the brine output owing to the discharge and wasting of the brine output significant amount of energy is wasted the use of the red process as a post treatment method leads to avoiding such energy wastage because of the recovery of osmotic power by using solar energy between the ro and red processes a much higher salt concentration can be obtained by evaporating the brine using solar energy therefore energy harvesting is continuously possible from the concentrated salt solution over day and night allowing the production of large amounts of potable water at the same time in addition to an increase in the temperature of the salty stream the red unit performance and power output can be enhanced seawater can be used as dilute water and can be preheated by solar energy utilization 189 190 fig 13 shows a schematic of the hybrid combination of seawater desalination red and solar power unit the red system combined with a desalination unit and the use of solar energy at the coastal site is an appropriate source for response to the requirement of energy and potable water due to numerous coastal locations all over the world this combination can continuously produce electrical energy by efficient storage as a battery it also leads to reducing the consumption of fossil fuels such as oil 7 4 microbial reverse electrodialysis cell mrc red the use of microbial reverse electrodialysis cells is a novel bio electrochemical approach for producing electrical power that combines an mfc and an red stack recently the use of mrcs has been identified as a sustainable water treatment technology that can harvest electrical energy from salinity gradients while extracting chemical energy from organic matter this technology has been developed to increase the power density and voltage compared with that generated through mfcs or red systems the same electrodes used in the mfc were placed on each side of the red stack then desirable reactions occur at the electrodes because of the extraction of energy by a small number of membrane pairs mfcs spontaneously produce electrical current by pairing bio anodes and cathodes exoelectrogenic microbes release electrons by oxidizing soluble wastewater organics in the anode and oxygen reduction is performed in the cathodes mixing solutions with different ionic strengths releases entropic energy that is converted into electrical energy in the red stack by high and low concentration chambers 105 191 192 the results of kim et al 191 with five pairs of red cells showed that the combination of an mfc red stacks increased the performance compared to the individual systems decreasing the internal resistance of the mrc stack improves the efficiency of energy extraction and mrc performance the internal resistance can be reduced by minimizing the intermembrane distance space spacer thickness increasing hydrodynamic turbulency at the interfaces of the membrane and enhancing membrane area liu et al 105 increased the power density and reduced the internal resistance by applying the patterned ion exchange membranes and integrated spacers for the first time in an mrc system they achieved high energy recovery and energy efficiency compared to smooth membranes the utilize of profiled membrane reduced membrane space but led to increased pumping energy consumption which is negligible 1 thus the patterned membrane can be a good candidate for more effective mrcs 7 5 membrane distillation md red using hot and highly saline discharged streams from md improves the red efficiency by increasing the salinity gradient as a driving force and reducing electrical resistance the power produced by the red can be utilized as input energy in the ro or ed stages md absorbs thermal energy from the heat source and produces a highly salty discharged stream thus red converts the gibbs free energy of the mixing streams into electricity 193 194 tufa et al used an integrated ro md red system at the laboratory scale they evaluated the exergy efficiency and exergy losses in the presence and absence of the red unit the presence of the red unit leads to the recovery and conversion of the electrochemical and thermal potentials of hot and hypersaline brine of md to electricity up to 17 reduction of the electrical energy consumption results from the incorporation of red the highly concentrated brine of md generates more electrical power via red 193 mercer et al investigated the synergistic potential of md red configuration using urine on a small scale to enable electrical energy recovery 195 long et al investigated a hybrid md red system as a heat engine for the conversion of waste heat into electricity their results showed that there is an optimal relative permeate feed solution flow rate for obtaining the maximum electrical efficiency of the md red system under given operating temperatures for different feed nacl concentrations 194 7 6 capacitive deionization cdi red cdi an emerging desalination technology is an electrosorption process comprising a pair of porous charged electrodes and a direct current dc power supply this technology is generally used to purify saline water the electrodes are polarized upon dc current brackish water passes through these electrodes and deionized water is produced by the adsorption of charged ions from the saltwater by the electrodes one of the electrodes has a positive charge and the other has a negative charge negative ions move toward the positive electrode and positive ions move toward the negative electrode i e the adsorption cycle in the desorption cycle that begins after the adsorption cycle the adsorbed ions are removed from the porous electrodes by reversing the polarity or eliminating the external power source a cdi system generates three different streams a freshwater stream during charging a high salt concentrated stream during discharging and a low salt concentrated stream brine disposal of cdi can be passed through the red stack to produce energy using the integrated cdi red system freshwater and electric power can be generated simultaneously 196 198 choi et al proposed the ro mcdi red hybrid system for the treatment of high salinity seawater and increased energy efficiency in this hybrid system fig 14 red recovers 33 of the energy from the discharge and the energy consumption of this hybrid system is reduced by 39 additionally a large amount of energy is harvested using the red process 199 7 7 microbial electrolysis cell mec red another method for the removal of multivalent ions from wastewater include the use of an mec harvesting sustainable energy in the form of electricity and hydrogen is facilitated using an mec red hybrid system seawater effluent from an mec as a high concentration solution is supplied to the red stack eliminating ca2 mg2 and another multivalent from seawater by mec is beneficial for power generation in red jwa et al 200 investigated a hybrid process that combines microbial electrolysis and the red system a microbial electrolysis cell was used before red to remove multivalent ions due to reducing electric membrane resistance ca2 and mg 2 were effectively removed and hydrogen was simultaneously produced the power density was achieved 26 higher when treated seawater was induced to the red stack as a concentrated solution compared to untreated seawater 7 8 hydrogen generation hydrogen is the simplest most abundant and lightest element in the world unlike fossil fuels it is not a primary source of energy and is not readily available in nature hydrogen appears in combination with different elements such as oxygen in water carbon and oxygen fossil fuels hydrogen is a clean energy source that can be generated from a primary energy source without co2 generation 201 203 the hydrogen generation rates and costs of the different electrolysis methods are listed in table 7 salinity power can be used for hydrogen generation by integrating electrolysis and red processes hydrogen gas is electrochemically generated in microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cells mrecs a current is produced by microorganisms i e exoelectrogenic bacteria in the anode where the organic matter is oxidized electrons transfer to the anode is facilitated and hydrogen gas is generated at the cathode fig 15 shows a diagram of the mrec process the red stacks are placed between the cathode and anode compartments of the mrec one of the limitations of this process is the use of seawater which leads to membrane biofouling therefore it is necessary to treat seawater another limitation of this process is the requirement of organic matter sources that are not useful for inland regions 204 207 the two driving forces of mrec include the thermodynamic oxidation of organic matter on the anode by exoelectrogens and energy harvesting from the salinity gradient between river water and seawater 208 by increasing the number of cell pairs the influence of the voltage loss caused by the resistance of the electrode on the generated power becomes negligible and the produced current increases therefore for pilot scale red systems water electrolysis can facilitate an available redox reaction that generates hydrogen energy and electric power 209 210 the results of hidayat et al 211 also showed that the presence of multivalent ions has an unfavorable effect on the performance of microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cells another method for hydrogen production is heat driven red technology with thermolytic solutions such as ammonium bicarbonate amb in closed loop systems the amb based red system includes an red stack and a regeneration system similar to a typical red system bicarbonate ions flow from the high concentration hc to a low concentration lc across the aems hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction are the two electrodes required for these methods as shown in fig 16 the lc effluent flows into the regeneration system the regeneration system consists of an absorption column and a stripping column in the stripping column the low grade waste heat warms the low concentrated effluent at 313 k and 1 atm low grade waste heat is an unused energy resource that is produced in industrial plants owing to the lack of cost effective and efficient recovery methods this heat leads to the stripping of the solution into nh4 and co2 gases these gases are absorbed into the highly concentrated effluent in the absorption column at 298 k the outlets of the stripping and absorption columns are transferred into the red cell and mixed with the lc and hc inlets 212 214 to determine the optimal stack configuration for hydrogen production using mrec with amb solutions luo et al tested different stack arrangements and different numbers of cell pairs five cell pairs were found to be the optimum number based on the mrec performance and minimized capital costs the additional chamber leads to decreasing losses of ammonia nitrogen in the anolyte and increases the hydrogen yield 200 hatzell et al demonstrated the simultaneous production of hydrogen and waste acid neutralization the use of a waste acid stream synthetic as a catholyte increased the hydrogen production rate compared with the amb electrolyte 215 7 9 ed red the hybrid ed red system has advantages for the high salinity wastewater treatment process the use of salinity energy high value resource reclamation and le consumption for desalination it was expected that red would play dual roles power generation and pretreatment for desalination 40 luo et al designed in situ hybrid system comprising ed and red units the ed unit was used as the energy acceptor and the red served as the energy donor both ed and red units were operated in continuous and batch wise modes their results confirmed that hybrid ed reds are technically feasible and economically attractive this technology is a good candidate for water desalination without the consumption of external energy 216 wang et al 40 proposed a hybrid red ed systems for the simultaneous recovery of osmotic energy and the desalination of phenol containing wastewater limiting wastewater treatment capacity and power generation are two important parameters for the design and improvement of hybrid systems compared to the ed process a hybrid red ed system could recover more salinity gradient power and consume less electric energy with pre desalination in the red stage 8 large scale iem preparation pilot plant and limitations for red commercialization the commercialization and up scaling of red are limited because of several challenges iems encounter problems such as low power density fouling low energy efficiency high cost and short lifetime additionally the hydrodynamic aspects and pre treatment of the seawater river water to prevent performance reduction water must be considered the general applied pre treatments are certainly too capital intensive for red iems as the key component play an influential role in red commercialization they must exhibit high permselectivity mechanical stability durability and low ionic resistance and should not be susceptible to fouling the generation of high power density at low investment and operational costs is necessary for developing the red technology power density net power and energy efficiency are significant economic parameters the investments of stacks and membranes can be reduced at higher power densities hydrodynamic losses arising from the pumping of streams should be minimized to enhance net power the hydrodynamic design of the stack is necessary to achieve high power density the residence time in stacks of different sizes is an important parameter and has a negative effect on large stacks owing to hydrodynamic losses in the long flow path 15 21 36 39 110 217 the quality and cost aspects e g stack capital and pretreatment energy consumption and use of chemicals are crucial factors for the pre treatment requirements in red 76 110 post et al 110 discussed economic and technological challenges in the development of red by focusing on the development of low cost membranes pre treatment methods and associated economics the membrane area required for installation is determined by the required power density required capacity as well as the available amount of water streams capital costs consist of the construction cost pumping and hydraulic equipment and the filtration installation for the feed streams the available water streams and fuel efficiency of the process determine the technical limitations of the installed red capacity an economic and technical model was presented by daniilidis et al 218 to analyze financial aspects and upscale the potential of an red plant the mentioned model is presented based on three different feed solutions and representative experimental data for upscale potential sensitivity analysis revealed that pricing performance and other parameters related to the membrane are the most crucial factors for upscaling of red veerman et al 36 investigated the operation parameters on the performance of a scaled up red stack with 50 cells in a membrane dimension of 25 75 cm2 the first pilot scale in the netherlands was installed in 2014 and fed with seawater 28 g l and freshwater from the lake 0 2 0 5 g l 119 a pilot plant using artificial brine and brackish water was operated in italy achieving a power output of 700 w a 50 decrease in the power output observed when real solutions were used because of the absence of large concentrations of nacl ions in the real feed 219 an red stack located at the japan okinawa seawater desalination plant consisted of 299 cell pairs with a total of 179 4 m2 of effective membrane area a maximum gross power output of 263 and 171 6 w was generated using the model ro brine rw and natural feed solutions respectively the enhanced power generation from the model feed solutions was caused by concentration polarization arising from multivalent ions 220 increasing the feed temperature during red in pilot scale red stacks shows a positive effect on the ocv maximum gross power pumping energy and net power output of the system 10 an red stack with 1000 cells located in korea produced 95 8 w power by using municipal wastewater and seawater 221 the effect of operating parameters was investigated by d angelo et al at a pilot scale of 500 cell pairs these experiments were conducted using real and artificial solutions and two different electrode rinse solutions their results showed that the use of fe2 fe3 redox couple in the electrode rinse solution leads to an increase in power density compared to with that obtained using nacl solutions the performance of the process improved with increasing flow rate of the electrode rinse solution and feed solution in a real environment this system can operate for several months 222 9 stack design 9 1 electrodes the ionic current is converted into an electron current through a redox reaction at the electrodes the four essential parts of the electrode system include catholytes anolytes electrodes equipment for recirculating the electrode rinse solution and outer membranes electrochemical reactions transport through the membranes of the electrode system energy consumption and reversibility are important considerations when operating an electrode system to avoid contamination of the dilute and concentrated solutions by the electrolyte solution appropriate external membranes should be selected for each redox process the nature of the redox reaction in during the red process plays an important role in the external output and performance of a stack especially when a low number of cell pairs are used the power density depends on the number of cell pairs and the concentration of redox species because of the reduction in the power loss of the electrode system red stacks must have a large number of cells 9 223 225 it has been reported that increasing the concentration of electro active species results in higher current and higher power output 226 the electrode systems can be classified based on the presence or absence of opposite electrode reactions in a system with opposite electrode reactions there is no net chemical reaction or net modification of the chemical composition additionally the reactions direct and reverse occur at the anode and cathode and the equilibrium voltage is zero in these systems because there is no net chemical reaction and consequently no energy consumption an red system with this type of electrode system can generate electrical energy with only a few cells the opposite electrode reactions can involve homogeneous redox couples with inert electrodes or reactive electrodes such as zn znso4 ag agcl and cu cuso4 all reactants are present in the same phase in homogeneous redox couples with inert electrodes homogeneous redox couples having inert electrodes have a lower cost of electrodes higher energy efficiency of the device and easier stack design for example the potential difference required for the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at the anode is counterbalanced by the reduction of fe3 to fe2 on the cathode in an electrode system with inert electrodes and a reversible redox couple in reactive electrode systems the electrodes are not dimensionally stable because of alternative growth and dissolution which requires periodic interchange of the cathode and anode this phenomenon is a major drawback for designing and engineering red stacks 9 192 223 225 227 the electrode resistance can be significant for a small number of cell units but it becomes negligible when hundreds or thousands of cell units are envisioned 67 9 2 spacer design spacers are essential components that generally provide an appropriate distance between the membranes in a typical ed or red stack and improve ion distribution in feedwater compartments owing to their structure with open and netting structures spacers are made of woven or extruded polymeric materials such as polyamide and polypropylene the presence of spacers leads to a decrease in concentration polarization owing to the promotion of the mixing process in the compartments spacers also lead to a negative effect on the red stack the compartment pressure drops the stack electrical resistance increases and a location for the deposition and growth of microorganisms is made available i e fouling 67 112 137 as mentioned the part of the effective membrane area is covered with spacers that lead to an increase in the resistance of the membrane and solution compartment it also decreases the contact between the iem and solutions shadow effect this phenomenon has a significant impact on red performance the effect of the spacer on the red performance depends on mass transfer pressure drop and resistance the shadow effect depends on the spacer geometry such as the area fraction thickness distance angles and diameter of the spacer filaments the structure of spacers can increase the pressure drop over the compartments owing to lower porosity smaller hydraulic radius and existence of a tortuous flow path the shadow effect also leads to the reduction of the output power caused by the blocking of ionic transport from the solutions to the membrane and vice versa therefore it is essential to select a spacer having a large open area and small thickness 67 112 137 228 there are two types of spacers for this purpose based on their conductivities the effect of the spacer shadow is more visible in the non conductive spacers this type increases the stack resistance by reducing the available area and blocking ion transport the ion conductive spacers eliminate the spacer shadow effect by allowing the transport of ions through the spacer material itself large improvements in stack ocv values and net power output in the red system can be obtained for conductive spacers compared with those for non conductive spacers 67 228 as mentioned the spacers in the red stack shadow effects increase both the solution compartment and membrane resistance therefore it is expected that the potential ratio section 2 4 will be reduced by the parameters that lead to an increase in the shadow effect such as low porosity or high thickness of spacers mehdizadeh et al investigated the shadow effect of 16 types of spacers having different thicknesses and porosities to identify the shadow effects on the membrane and solution compartment separately to estimate the spacer shadow effects they also proposed a suitable spacer geometric parameter mehdizadeh et al reduced the thickness of the spacer compared with a gasket leading to a decrease in the shadow effect 112 dlugolecki et al showed that the use of ion conductive spacers in red leads to an increase in the power density of factors of three and four and a decrease in stack resistance by a factor of two compared with the use of non conductive spacers with the same open area and shape they improved the process performance for red by applying ion conductive spacers and eliminating the spacer shadow effect 228 9 3 pressure drop the pressure drop in the red stacks affects the net power density and flow distribution the non uniform distribution of fluid known as preferential channeling can increase the non ohmic resistance 229 the pressure drops in the red stack occur in different parts such as the inlet and outlet distribution ducts branches and connecting beams between the distribution ducts and compartment channel cell pair numbers red stack channel use of a spacer and flowrate are effective parameters for pressure drop one of the essential factors that affect on the pressure drop in the compartments is the thickness of the red stack channel although a reduction in the thickness of the stack channel improves the fluid distribution and gross power output it increases the pressure drop in practical applications the thickness of the channel cannot be too high because of it would impart high electrical resistance the power density balance becomes more negative for thinner compartments compared with thicker ones the use of more inlets and outlets in the red stack reduces the pressure drops in the beams owing to the sudden expansion the progressive extension of the beam width and branches in each new compartment decreases the pressure drop the pressure drop is increased by increasing the cell pair number consequently the net power decreases decreasing the flow rates of the two feed streams leads to a more uniform fluid flow distribution and a lower pressure drop however it also reduces the gross power density the impact of the cell pair number and partial pressure drop in the branches is reduced at low flow rates the intermembrane distance is also affected by the pressure drop the pressure drop increases with decreasing intermembrane distance 12 67 229 the presence of spacers caused by the application of a tortuous flow and funneling the water between the spacer and the membrane creates pressure drops in the compartments and increases the stack resistance to reduce the pressure drop a more open spacer structure is recommended 67 229 fig 17 shows a schematic of the red stack geometry 9 4 intermembrane distance achieving a low intermembrane distance is challenging which restricts commercial applications when real feedwater is used low intermembrane distance and high salinity feedwaters lead to an increase in the pumping power consumed compared with the power obtained through the system shown in fig 17 230 a low intermembrane distance reduces the electrical resistance in the feed compartments and consequently increases the power density a drawback of low intermembrane distances is the additional pretreatment needed to avoid fouling and the large hydraulic losses of the feedwater in the compartments hence to maintain low hydrodynamic losses this distance should not be too small the dilute water compartment thickness has a large portion of the stack resistance owing to its low conductivity therefore a higher performance is expected with a longer concentrated compartment intermembrane distance 12 41 67 230 moreno et al 230 proposed a new concept design i e a breathing cell with the physical movement of membranes that operate an red stack by changing the intermembrane distance over time this technique is a suitable option for systems compatible with real feedwaters that operate at a wide range of flow rates in this design the thickness of the compartment is the tunable frequency by compressing the river water compartments and expanding the seawater compartments reducing the thickness of the river water compartment decreases the stack resistance the advantages of breathing stacks include the low pumping power required low resistance and high net power densities 9 5 effect of flow direction co current or counter current operations seawater and river water streams exist in the same direction as the co current mode but the direction of the river or seawater flow is inverted as shown in fig 18 counter current and co current operations were investigated by veerman et al 36 on a large scale using 25 cells they yielded a slightly higher power density for co currency compared to that for a counter current flow owing to the existence of two counteracting effects on the power density in the co current operation mode the conductivity of the river water was low near the inlet however the nernst potential difference is maximal at this point resulting in a rather small current on the outlet side the conductivity of the river water compartment was higher but the nernst potential difference was lower which led to a relatively constant power density at each position in the cell furthermore internal deformation in the stack is crucial the pressures between the river and seawater compartments were very different in the counter current operation however the pressure between the river and seawater compartments is small in the co current mode therefore leakage through pinholes in the membranes and leakage around the membranes in the surroundings of the manifolds inside the stack is minimal very thin membranes and very open spacers with low hydrodynamic losses can be used in co current operation owing to the low pressure differences the hydrodynamic loss is also increased in the counter current operation owing to the high pressures difference between the river and seawater compartments consequently the co current mode is favorable for the design of large economical red stacks because of the higher power density minimum internal leakages and avoidance of local pressure differences easy modeling fast calculations 20 33 36 41 67 10 future perspectives and conclusions a new perspective of red and the advancement of the red technology involve

effective fouling management evidently a broad configurational variety of commercially available and newly developed products can be tested and optimized using the red fouling monitor to find solutions that are less susceptible to fouling 67 156 the increasing energy demand has led to increased attention to renewable energy sources sgp is a renewable resource extracted from mixing water streams with different salinities red is a common technique used to extract power based on salinity gradient in red systems iems are essential components that are required to have high permselectivity and low ionic resistance certain modification methods have been used to improve the properties of iems to obtain favorable properties these modification methods include the use of different nps carbon nanotubes and polymer blends and surface modification strategies several studies have investigated commercial cems and aems in the red process however typical commercially available iems are generally inappropriate for red nanoporous membranes pore filling iems and profiled membranes are different types of membranes used in the red process but they are currently in the early stages of development and far from commercialization in practical applications the use of natural water as an red source leads to fouling aems are more susceptible to fouling by natural organic matter and scaling occurs more frequently on cems fouling can be prevented by chemical and physical methods such as mechanical removal air sparging pretreatment of solutions periodic feedwater switching use of cleaning agents and membrane modification the operating parameters should be optimized to obtain high performance the hybrid process of red can improve the power density for red and lead to reduced capital costs for other technologies red can be combined with other technologies for water treatment production of potable water and weakening of brine discharge influence low power density lack of cost effective iems

electrodialysis salinity gradient power blue energy abbreviations red reverse electro dialysis iem ion exchang membrane aem anion exchange membrane cem cation exchange membrane 1 introduction the generation and utilization of energy is a direct indicator of societal advancement the environmental impact of fossil fuels primarily leading to greenhouse gas emissions and pollution and increasing demands for energy for industrialization population growth and urban expansion have led to the need for the advanced development of renewable energy for the sustainable development of human civilization the extraction of clean energy from the environment is essential because of safety considerations nuclear energy cannot replace fossil fuels 1 4 therefore other efficient renewable energy sources are urgently required several types of renewable energy e g tidal wind geothermal and solar have been developed but they are available only at limited times 3 5 according to the international renewable energy agency energy consumption and demand will increase by 80 by 2050 6 salinity power is renewable and has no significant operational hazards and does not cause co2 emissions 7 8 salinity gradient power sgp is extracted by mixing water streams of different salinities the spontaneous and irreversible mixing of seawater and river water leads to an increase in system entropy this change in potential can be utilized to produce electrical energy salinity gradient energy is the second largest energy source in the world theoretically a magnificent amount of 1 4 2 6 tw year power could be produced by utilizing the worldwide salinity gradient the estimated total global salinity power would be sufficient to meet the global electricity demand 2 tw or 16 of the total present energy consumption 9 10 membrane techniques for capturing sgp include reverse electrodialysis red and pressure retarded osmosis pro in red the transport of positive and negative ions through selective ion exchange membranes iems occurs whereas semipermeable membranes transfer water molecules using pro based on the literature red has a higher power generation potential than pro for seawater and river water and it is less sensitive to membrane fouling 3 7 11 14 the mechanical reliability owing to the absence of moving parts energy source sustainability e g seawater river water and wastewater and high energy efficiencies achieved by the direct conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy are advantages of red 15 16 up to now some articles have reviewed the red process 11 16 19 but they have provided limited aspects of red also in recent years many studies have investigated different points of the red process that have not been reviewed in previous review articles this article thoroughly studies reverse electrodialysis and its considerations a stack of red is similar to regular electrodialysis ed the same devices can be used in both systems however cell specifications should be optimized for each process the thickness of spacers is typically between 0 3 and 1 mm in commercial electrodialysis whereas it is 0 1 0 3 mm for the red process owing to the reduction in electrical resistance and the enhancement of power density 20 fig 1 shows a schematic of the red system which consists of cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems cations and anions in the concentrated stream move toward the dilute stream owing to salt concentration difference through the cems and aems the salinity difference on either side of the membrane facilitates ion transport via the iems which can be converted to electricity using electrodes i e anode and cathode ion transport via the electrodes is converted to electrical energy by a reversible redox reaction in large scale applications there are multiple cems and aems between the two electrodes 11 12 20 21 spacers are used to maintain an appropriate distance between the membranes and to create compartments for feed solutions 22 owing to their different aims the optimal designs of red and ed are not identical ed requires a large feedwater compartment and high flow velocity due to reduced salt depletion in the boundary layers near the membrane 12 moreover the co ion and counter ion fluxes have the same direction in red whereas they are different in ed it is due to the driving force of red is the salt concentration difference between the dilute and concentrate compartments whereas externally applied voltage is the driving force in ed 20 low thickness for iems is desirable in both processes to minimize electrical resistance however membranes are thicker in ed because of their mechanical stability in different feed conditions different ph temperature etc membranes having high thicknesses are not preferred due to the high electrical resistance in red that leads to a reduction of power density in red 23 some studies have modeled and simulated different aspects of the red process 24 32 2 red performance 2 1 power density in red systems the net power density as a representative of their performance is expressed in watts per square meter of membrane area eq 1 the net power density is the difference between the gross power density and the power loss by pumping 33 35 1 p net p gross p pumping e ocv 2 4 n m r i where pgross is gross power density ppump is pumping power nm is the number of membranes ri is the total internal area resistance and eocv is the open circuit voltage ocv 2 2 energy efficiency the actual processes are not completely reversible owing to the unavoidable production of entropy based on the second law of thermodynamics entropy production leads to reduction in the amount of energy available for conversion to useful work energy efficiency η is the percentage of the gibbs free energy of feedwater mixing δg mix which is converted to useful work w it quantifies the amount of available energy for the process eq 2 36 39 2 η w δg mix 100 2 3 ocv the ocv is the maximum voltage that can be achieved in the red system it can be measured under zero current conditions i e at the initial time when no current is applied the voltage can be estimated using eq 3 this voltage is eocv 40 42 3 e ocv 2 n r t f i n α i z i ln a i hcc a i lcc where α is the permselectivity of ionic species i th n is the number of membrane pairs r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the absolute temperature k f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol n is the number of the ion species ai is the activity of the ionic species i th in the solution and zi is the valance of the diffusion ion eq mol 1 subscripts hcc and lcc indicate high and low concentrated solution respectively 2 4 potential ratio the potential ratio is another parameter used to express red performance it is calculated as the value of permselectivity α over area resistance α2 r permselectivity and area resistance are the main factors that affect the maximum power density in red systems therefore the potential ratio can be an indication of the performance of iems in red 43 3 red membranes 3 1 iems the concept of ion transport by selective membranes for energy generation in red has attracted considerable attention in recent years the principle of red is based on the selective transport of cations or anions through iems under the influence of concentration difference 20 44 45 iems are polymeric films with anionic or cationic exchange groups that transport counter ions 46 47 in an ideal case only counter ions can pass through the iem whereas the co ions and water are rejected in practical situations iems are not 100 selective and they allow the transportation of ions having the same charge i e co ions 48 49 iems are the primary components of red especially on a large scale currently available commercial iems do not satisfy red requirements because they have not been designed for this purpose 43 50 51 to scale up the iems for red efficiency and durability are the key factors 52 in practical red applications the most desirable properties of iems are high selectivity low electrical resistance good mechanical strength and high chemical stability 47 the properties of iems are related to the presence of charged groups the type distribution and amount of ion exchange groups determine the iem properties based on the type of the fixed charge group iems can be classified as weak and strong acid membranes i e cems or weak and strong base membranes i e aems strong cems contain sulfonic groups whereas weak cems have carboxylic groups as fixed charged groups aems contain quaternary and tertiary amine groups as fixed positively charged groups amphoteric bipolar and charge mosaic membranes are other types of iems 46 48 53 based on the distribution of ion exchange groups iems can be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous both have advantages and limitations heterogeneous iems have easier preparation procedures higher mechanical strength and lower production costs however they exhibit inadequate electrochemical properties homogeneous membranes exhibit better electrochemical properties but low mechanical strength 54 55 the development of approaches for iem preparation using inexpensive materials is a major factor most iem preparation processes are complicated and require toxicity risk management they also involve several manufacturing steps and long process times moreover they typically are not energy efficient 45 52 56 homogeneous membranes have been prepared using different techniques such as homogeneous polymerization or polycondensation of monomers and the introduction of an anionic or cationic group into a polymer followed by the dissolution of the polymer and casting 43 at the lab scale iems are generally fabricated using the following processes dissolution of polymeric materials for preparing iems in solvents casting of solutions onto a flat plate evaporation of solvents and selective post modifications 56 the bilayer iems are another kind of ion exchange membranes that are permeable for both co ions and counter ions in solution with different diffusivities and they have increased the selective properties compared to homogeneous membranes with the same value of the fixed charge density these membranes consist of two homogeneous charged layers from the same or different material or modifying one side of the membrane by highly charged layers 57 moya 57 studied the behavior of bilayer iems in a red stack based on the nernst planck donnan equations the ocv and the maximum power output in a bilayer iems were higher than a homogeneous membrane with an identical value of the fixed charge concentration in the equivalent system the ocv and the maximum power enhanced when the degree of inhomogeneity in the fixed charge distribution of the membrane increased an increase in the thickness of the diffusion boundary layers or decrease in leads to a slight increase in ocv and power output between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems another fabrication method is radiation grafting this technique is used in electrochemical technologies for fuel cells red systems and redox flow batteries it uses γ rays or electron beams to irradiate the polymer films the films are activated to create active centers via exposure to high energy radiation and the introduction of chemical groups such as radicals and peroxides the preparation of graft copolymer membranes can be initiated by the copolymerization of a range of vinyl monomers radiation exposure generates active centers on the surface and film bulk even at high thicknesses based on their requirements these grafts can be further modified for post effect 45 58 it has been reported that the stability of iems can be improved through radiation chemical grafting polymerization in hydrocarbon polymers it can also be improved by crosslinking divinylbenzene or other agents modification can be achieved by incorporating functional groups into the polymers which is a commonly used method for synthesizing polymeric iems 45 the selection of different polymeric matrices variation of functional groups use of various additives alteration of crosslinking density surface modification polymer blending and more uniform distribution of functional groups are interesting approaches for iem fabrication 55 an important advantage of grafting polymerization utilizing the post effect is that the stages of irradiation and grafting polymerization are temporally separated this approach opens broad prospects for the preparation of materials with the required thickness from the commercially available films 3 1 1 material for iems preparation the selection of appropriate membrane materials is a major challenge to the red development of effective iems several polymers have been used as inert matrices generally materials for the preparation of homogeneous membranes can be classified based on hydrocarbon and perfluorocarbon bases perfluorocarbon membranes are typically used in applications having high chemical and thermal stabilities such as chloro alkali processes and fuel cells 43 45 47 polyethylene polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride are examples of hydrocarbon based analogs and poly vinyl fluoride poly vinylidene fluoride and poly tetrafluoroethylene are examples of fluorinated analogs alongside the base polymers the membrane transport properties are related to the nature and concentration of the charged groups sulfonic acid groups having fixed negative charges and quaternary ammonium groups with fixed positive charge are common in most commercially available iems these charge groups maintain high conductivity of membranes by their dissociation over the ph range so3 coo po3 2 pho2 aso3 2 and seo3 are negatively charged moieties n h2r n hr2 n r3 p r3 and s r3 are positively charged moieties 45 47 59 poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide ppo is commonly used for red membrane preparation 21 43 50 60 ppo is a polymer that has excellent membrane forming properties low cost high glass transition temperature tg 210 c and exhibits high thermal chemical and hydrolytic stabilities owing to the hydrophobicity of ppo and its dissolution in conventional dipolar solvents charged groups have been introduced this process causes ppos to become highly hydrophilic and more ion exchangeable 52 60 63 a sulfonated ppo sppo is the desired polymer for cem the basic molecular structure of sppo is shown in fig 2 52 64 generally sulfonic groups are functional groups in fuel cells and red membranes the sulfonation reaction is performed using chlorosulfonic sulfuric acid in dichloroethane and silver sulfate is used as a catalyst 45 47 50 65 additionally membranes containing sulfonic groups can be obtained via grafting copolymerization 45 sulfonation reactions are carried out to enhance the hydrophilicity and ion exchange capacity iec and supply better conditions for chemical modification 50 66 3 1 2 electrochemical and physical properties the electrochemical properties of iems have a significant effect on their red performance the optimization of these properties is challenging because of their counteracting effects thus it is worthwhile to study the membrane properties of red if performance optimization is desired the important membrane properties in the red process are permselectivity area resistance swelling degree sd ion exchange capacity iec and fixed charge density cd 43 50 67 the main iem properties for effective and practical red systems are membrane resistance and permselectivity these parameters are affected by sd and iec additionally desirable chemical and mechanical stabilities and low cost membranes are required in electrochemical systems 20 67 68 3 1 2 1 iec the iec is the milli equivalent of ion exchange groups per unit of dry membrane mass 1 g dry membrane iec presents information about the density of ionizable functional groups in the membrane which are responsible for conductivity and charged nature of the membrane iec measurements are carried out via the exchange of ionic species first the membranes are immersed in a solution containing the first ionic species after equilibrium it is rinsed with demineralized water and equilibrated with another salt solution the ions exchanged and extracted from the membrane are measured using titration ion chromatography or inductively coupled plasma 67 69 71 3 1 2 2 sd by immersing dry membranes in water they absorb a certain amount of water the indication for water absorption by the membrane due to hydration is degree of swelling in the red systems which can be measured based on the membrane weight the membranes are immersed in water for at least 24 h after removing the membranes the surface water is removed the membranes are then weighed the wet membrane is then dried in a vacuum oven until a constant dry weight is achieved using eq 4 the sd is calculated where mwet and mdry are the masses of the wet and dry membranes respectively 18 67 72 4 sd m wet m dry m dry 100 the sd depends on the structure and material of the membrane as well as the outer solution conditions and it is limited by cross linking a high sd leads to a decrease in the cd thus a low sd is favorable and a high sd is considered to have a negative effect polymers containing charged groups i e active polymers often lead to a high degree of swelling hence to obtain a high cd the ratio between reinforcing and active polymers is usually optimized a high sd can have a positive effect when the area resistance of the membrane decreases especially for aems the increase in hydrophilicity is mainly related to the low degree of crosslinking the hydrophilic nature of the membrane has a desired effect on the sd and area resistance controlling the swelling behavior of the iems is crucial for achieving high permselectivity and ion conductivity the sd is also affected by the mechanical properties ion selectivity dimensional stability and electrical resistance of the membranes 18 43 67 70 3 1 2 3 fixed cd the fixed cd is the milli equivalent of fixed groups attached to the polymer backbone in iems per unit volume of absorbed water in the membrane i e meq l 1 which can be obtained by the iec over the membrane sd see eq 5 a higher cd indicates stronger exclusion of co ions therefore a decrease in co ion permeation increases the selective transport of counter ions and cd resulting in high permselectivity 60 67 73 5 cd fix iec sd 3 1 2 4 resistance electrical resistance is an essential property of iems because it directly affects the maximum power output of red the feedwater compartments salt concentrations and temperatures have a significant influence on the electrical resistance of the red stack 12 43 46 the electrical resistance comprises the ohmic and non ohmic resistances the ohmic resistance is related to the conductivity of the iems and feed streams i e aem cem river and seawater compartments non ohmic resistance refers to the change in the concentration of the bulk solution and the diffusive boundary layer near the membrane surface i e concentration polarization 12 34 74 via the transfer of ions from the seawater toward the river water side and the onset of an electrical current the non ohmic resistance develops slowly the migration of ions leads to a reduction in the salinity gradient and consequently reduces the driving electromotive force which can be introduced as a non ohmic resistance when it is divided by the electrical current the unit of membrane resistance is generally ω cm2 34 46 the total electrical resistance of a red stack is the sum of its ohmic and non ohmic resistances as shown in eq 6 theoretically the resistances can be estimated based on water conductivity membrane specification flow rate cell dimensions and water temperature 34 42 6 r total r ohmic r non ohmic the applied electrical current is suddenly interrupted to determine the ohmic and non ohmic resistances a sudden jump in voltage reveals ohmic resistance the time dependent voltage change is related to the non ohmic resistance because the transfer of ions leads to the reduction of the concentration gradient between the concentrated and diluted solutions over time resulting in a decrease in the potential difference 12 67 fig 3 shows the measurements of the ohmic and non ohmic resistances the pure membrane resistance can be determined via two experiments with and without the membrane blank run the slope of the curve of the current density versus the potential difference is the resistance the pure membrane area resistance is obtained by subtracting the measured resistance in the blank run from the resistance in the run with the membrane 46 72 in ideal system the power density is in maximum value when the load resistance is equal to the stack resistance but moya 75 and weiner et al 76 exhibited the load resistance that maximizes the gross power density is smaller than the stack resistance due to variations of salinity along with the stack and concentration polarization moya investigated the effect of the concentration polarization on the maximum power density for the red system it was done based on the comparison of the internal and optimal load resistances for non ideal selective membranes with different fixed charge densities the concentration polarization leads to a reduction of power in the red stack it is more evident when the electric current increases they also exhibited a decrease in the membrane fixed charge concentration reduces the power harvesting and the behavior of the system is similar to the ideally selective membrane at the high values of the membrane fixed charge concentration 3 1 2 5 permselectivity based on the donnan exclusion the fixed charged groups in the iems reject the ions having the same charge permselectivity is the ability of the membrane to transfer selective specific ions and is a practical parameter related to donnan exclusion in iems arising from the nature of the membrane for discriminating co and counter ions this type of distinction is caused by the magnitude and nature of the membrane fixed charge 67 70 71 77 78 a higher permselectivity results in an increase in voltage output ideally the permselectivity of iems is one indicating that the membrane transfers counter ions through the membrane and completely rejects co ions the co ions also pass through the membrane in practical systems consequently membrane permselectivity is less than one 11 permselectivity is related to the electrochemical potential difference between river water and seawater in the red system the increase in electrochemical potential leads to the achievement of high power density per unit membrane area factors such as cd counter ion binding affinity and dilute solution mobility are influenced by membrane permselectivity high counter ion binding affinities to the fixed charge group in the membrane and the polarizability of the co ion show lower permselectivity because of counter ion condensation for example ammonium ions have a high binding affinity to cation exchange resins than do sodium ions consequently the permselectivity is lower highly concentrated brine reduces permselectivity 22 70 79 80 permselectivity ps or α is measured based on the number of counter ions as expressed in eq 7 7 p s t m t 1 t where t is the number of counter ions transported in the solution phase and t m is the counter ion transport number in the membrane phase to determine the permselectivity of the ion conductivity and to distinguish between the preferred cation and anion transport properties the membrane remains in contact with the electrolyte on both sides and the transfer of electrons is completely blocked therefore the ionic conductivity can be determined by measuring the ionic current through the membrane as a function of the potential drop across the membrane it is well known that both the volumetric and gravimetric sds of iems are caused by the presence of active functional groups i e fixed charges as expected membranes having a high degree of swelling exhibit low area resistances a high iec does not simultaneously occur with a low area resistance but the cd plays a more important role than the iec other factors must also be considered such as the density of the polymer network the cd the morphology of the membrane and the hydrophilic property of the matrix polymer permselectivity depends on the fixed cd which is a function of the sd and iec iems having a high iec can possess low permselectivity owing to their high degree of swelling however by controlling the sd of membranes improvements to the iec can yield a higher permselectivity 70 73 81 strong interactions between fixed charge groups in iems and counter ions in solutions i e binding affinity may lead to counter ion condensation fig 4 resulting in lower membrane permselectivity counter ion condensation increases the transport of co ions through the iems the effects of polarizability and counter ion sizes should be considered permselectivity increases with increased counter ion polarizability and the size of the counter ion 79 3 1 2 6 mechanical strength the mechanical strength of the membrane is a crucial parameter for maintaining high durability under hydraulic pressure over the membrane and the osmotic pressure arises from the concentration gradient it is neither serious nor critical for red unlike the ed and pro a high salinity gradient in some ed systems e g deionization leads to the exertion of osmotic pressure on the membrane whereas the concentration difference is in the range of 0 01 0 5 m in typical river water seawater cases a bit above order of range 18 3 1 3 modification several modification methods have been used to improve the properties of iems and obtain specific properties these methods include surface modification 69 82 85 variations of functional groups 70 use of different polymers and additives 52 61 86 91 polymer blending 43 54 and special treatment of the base membrane after fabrication 54 92 93 membrane modification generally imparts promising advantages such as fouling prevention lower power consumption lower pretreatment cost and high membrane hydrophilicity 94 95 table 1 provides information about the tailor made iems for red the membrane made by safronova et al shows the highest power density between the tailored membrane under the optimal condition pe grafted by polysulfone with ps grafting degree 32 wt and crosslinking agent vol 3 5 3 1 3 1 blending with additives adding additives e g dope solutions is a simple method of improving iem properties additive properties such as hydrophilicity electrical conductivity and adsorption capacity lead to the production of a membrane having favorable electrochemical properties several studies have reported improvements in membrane performance by incorporating nanoparticles nps and inorganic additives into the cast solutions in this method additives polymers and solvents are mixed finally the membrane is prepared by casting the preparation solution and evaporating the solvent 54 60 96 98 it has been demonstrated that the incorporation of nps into the membrane matrix improves and modifies membrane properties according to different aspects including the structure physicochemical properties hydrophilicity and thermal chemical and mechanical stabilities of the membranes the presence of nps facilitates ion migration and consequently increases the conductivity of the membrane by providing extra ion exchange functional groups in the membrane thus it has been widely used by many researchers in recent decades 61 71 95 99 it has been noted that the membrane performance and properties change at different np concentrations the oxide nanomaterials show a high adsorption capacity owing to the high proportion of active sites at the corners or edges nps can also be covered by other chemicals or polymeric layers to modify their properties and create novel features the modifier layer can comprise monomers with different functional groups incorporated on the surface of the nps in iems the flux of ions and ionic permeability depend on the electrochemical properties and structure of the membranes 66 99 fe2o3 is an inorganic additive employed in membrane solutions to improve membrane properties 52 100 the surface sulfonation of iron oxide has led to extensive modifications in the chemical and morphological i e physical behaviors 101 sulfonated fe2o3 improves the conductivity and hydrophilicity and creates a large specific surface area owing to the decreased crystallite size caused by the functionalization of the so4 2 group compared with the fe2o3 surface this property leads to easy incorporation into the membrane matrix and easy coating ability on different surfaces 50 60 102 hong et al prepared a new type of organic inorganic nanocomposite cem using an optimal amount of fe2o3 so4 2 0 5 0 7 wt which caused enhanced selectivity up to 87 65 and a decreased area resistance 0 87 ω cm2 their results showed that the nanocomposite iems are suitable candidates for energy generation by red 60 in another study hong et al prepared a porous nanocomposite cem in the presence of functionalized iron iii oxide fe2o3 so4 2 this led to significantly improved electrochemical properties a cem containing an optimal amount of fe2o3 so4 2 0 7 wt achieved a gross power density of 1 4 w m 2 in an red system that was higher than commercial combined sewer overflow cso selemiontm japan membranes 50 a negative thin layer in commercial aems comprising sppo and two types of nanomaterials i e oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes or fe2o3 so4 2 nps showed improvements to fouling resistance owing to the modification of the physicochemical characteristics of the membrane surface e g roughness charge and hydrophilicity 95 the results of heidary et al revealed a positive effect on the transport properties and hydrophilicity of iems using fe2o3 nps 52 silica nanoparticles have favorable properties such as superior hydrophilic characteristics high surface energy nontoxicity low cost and thermal resistance 92 the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of the membranes depend on the sio2 np content membranes having an optimal value of sio2 nps show good selectivity iec water content and membrane conductivity thus they can be used in electro membrane applications 71 surface modification of sio2 nps by a sulfonation reaction results in increased conductivity hydrophilicity and mechanical stability of the membranes the size of the inorganic particle fillers affects the pore formation and membrane structure at the interfacial region of the filler and polymer it has been reported that membranes containing larger particle fillers have higher porosities and larger pore sizes than membranes containing smaller particle fillers it is also expected that inorganic fillers with smaller sizes will have a better interaction between the polymer and particles owing to the smaller interfacial gaps 61 researchers have investigated the effects of concentrations and particle sizes 15 and 70 nm silica nps and their electrochemical properties and cem structures in the red process the membranes contain larger particles 70 nm at 0 5 wt sio2 so3h exhibits desirable electrochemical properties and power performance the pore size and porosity increases due to the presence of nps and large pores may lead to a reduction in the selectivity of the membrane caused by the disruption of the functional groups of the polymer matrix however the area resistance of the membrane may decrease 50 multiwall carbon nanotubes mwcnts are a new class of advanced additives utilized in membrane fabrication to improve the physicochemical and electrochemical properties these additives possess attractive features and capacities such as superior electrical and mechanical characteristics 93 tong et al prepared a new type of nanocomposite cem that uses oxidized mwcnts o mwcnts an improvement in the anti fouling properties and power density was observed the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of these cems in optimal inorganic loadings were improved compared with those of membranes without o mwcnts 21 3 1 3 2 blending of two polymers the blending of polymers offers a novel structure with specific characteristics for iem preparation the membranes are expected to be dimensionally and mechanically stable and ion exchangeable 52 55 103 zhang et al prepared a cem by incorporating two organic polymers for red applications including a functionalized sppo polymer and sulfated polyvinyl alcohol spva the prepared membranes in the optimal range of spva 2 10 wt improved the area resistance down to 1 31 ω cm2 and the permselectivity up to 87 which is comparable to commercially available fks fuel cell core fumasep1 germany membranes the highest gross power density was achieved in the membranes containing 5 wt pva which is 14 more than that of fks fuel cell power generation 43 ariono et al prepared a heterogeneous cem by blending polysulfone and polyethylene glycol peg400 the enhancement of water uptake conductivity and iec of the membrane resulted from the hydrophilicity of peg400 the iec and conductivity decreased at high concentrations of peg400 this may have been caused by some ion exchange particles being washed out during membrane immersion 54 3 1 3 3 surface modification modification of the membrane surface can improve its properties the surface properties of membranes play a crucial role in membrane separation their surfaces change during formation or during other enhancement step to provide desired performance thresholds or reduce drawbacks of membrane processes 47 different methods such as plasma modification flame treatment graft polymerization and corona discharge have been utilized in membrane surface modification to obtain appropriate physicochemical properties without affecting bulk properties 69 modification of the membrane surface was performed by guler et al by coating a commercial membrane for the design of monovalent selective aems the coating layer consisted of 2 acryloylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid as the active polymer and n n methylene bis acrylamide as the cross linker an increase in hydrophilicity monovalent ion selectivity and sufficient antifouling properties were observed by the modified membranes but they were not very effective for obtaining higher power densities in red 85 the chemical polymerization of pyrrole on the surfaces of commercial cems leads to the creation of a rigid and tight structure that increases the monovalent selectivity in multi ion solutions for red testing this membrane was designed using polypyrrole ppy chitosan cs composites under polymerization time and a controlled molar concentration of ppy in the composite solution ppy and cs with a focus on red applications under high salinity feed conditions the presence of cs reduces the channel size owing to membrane crosslinking chitosan also contains amino groups that supply a cationic moiety to the membrane structure improvement of the monovalent selectivity na vs mg2 power density and ocv was observed when modified membranes were used 23 amino modification of the cem surface improved the electrochemical properties by increasing the reactivity of the iem surface enhancement of the water affinity and donnan potential has been reported by amino functionalization swaminathan et al found that the ion selectivity of cem was increased by the amine modification surface they used butylamine and two forms of diamine the diamines exhibited better performance owing to the incorporation of crosslinks 107 it has been reported that using nano metal oxides can also modify the membrane surface by incorporating them into the coating solution 66 3 1 4 membrane structure thickness and porosity the morphology of iems is generally dense owing to the efficient donnan exclusion however iems with more open structures can facilitate co ion exclusion and enhance the ion conductivity because of their larger interstitial volume 51 108 the change in the iem structure affects the area resistance and permselectivity membranes with large pores are generally more conductive which leads to a decrease in membrane resistance the results of theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated that thin iems with nano sized pores exhibit ultra permeability and high selectivity therefore these iems are promising candidates for reds 50 109 the thickness of an iem affects its electrochemical properties such as permselectivity and area resistance thin membranes have a relatively lower area resistance than what is desired for red but they may also have low permselectivity which is not favorable however the use of relatively thin membranes is advantageous for the red process because they allow faster ion transfer 73 110 the distribution of particles in the membrane bulk or surface is crucial when fillers such as nps are used a uniform distribution of particles generates more conducting regions in the membranes and provides simple flow channels for the transportation of counter ions the concentration polarization phenomenon can be reduced by strengthening the intensity of the electrical field around the membrane owing to the large conducting regions 86 the membrane structure affects the mobility of ions and their electrochemical properties for example the control of membrane porosity in organic inorganic composite iems has improved conductivity permselectivity water uptake and iec thereby imparting high mechanical and thermal properties generally the porosity and pore size of the membrane are increased in the presence of inorganic particle fillers the use of high concentrations of inorganic fillers leads to agglomeration and forms large voids and pores in the membrane large pores may reduce the membrane selectivity and area resistance they also disrupt the functional groups in the membrane hence controlling the porosity and structure of the membrane is a crucial parameter in red in addition to the filler concentration the size of inorganic fillers affects the porosity and structure of the membranes 61 3 1 5 commercial membrane several studies have investigated commercial cems and aems in the red process as presented in tables 2 and 3 the properties of commercial membranes are different from each other owing to differences in the composition and molecular structure of iems the properties of the iems that are important in the red process are presented in table 2 the manufacturers of commercial iems include nafion dow astom asahi glass selemion fumatech the high cost of some commercial iems limits their wide scale applications 51 106 generally commercial iems possess high permselectivity 0 9 the power densities based on membrane properties stack design and operational conditions is summarized in table 3 based on table 3 cmx manufactured by astom corp ltd japan is a general commercial cation exchange membrane that was investigated under red conditions cmx membranes owing to their good properties such as high charge density mechanical stability ion conductivity and permselectivity are appropriate candidates for the red process unfortunately common commercial iems not been designed for red they are not generally appropriate for red operations especially for hyper concentrated brines 45 51 based on table 3 daniilidis et al achieved 6 7 and 5 8 w m2 power density which is the highest value reported thus far 3 2 nanoporous membrane maximizing the ionic selectivity of two dimensional 2d nanopores is a design technique used in power generators and is achieved by increasing the surface charge and decreasing the pore size generally ion selectivity increases with an increase in channel length smaller pore size and higher density of surface charges on the pore walls the power density is influenced by selectivity power is generated using ion selective pores or channels of nano dimensions in combinatorial membrane materials practically nanopores can be introduced into 2d materials by physical methods such as plasma etching ion bombardment and electron beam irradiation however the process scalability is difficult and the production of high quality large scale 2d membranes is technically challenging additionally the chemical functionality of the pores is poorly controlled it has been reported that the bottom up fabrication of 2d nanoporous membranes can solve these problems 39 109 liu et al 109 presented the bottom up synthesis of thin nanoporous carbon membranes with the distribution of nanopores from core rim structured monomers through a two step approach the thermally stable core forms the frame of the membrane and the thermally unstable rim decomposes and crosslinks the cores the membrane is ultra permeable to cations and exhibits excellent ionic conductivity and high power density consequently it is a suitable candidate for red 3 3 nanofluidic red nfred system recently solid state nanofluidic channels or nanopores having high selectivity and ultra permeability have been proposed for the red process 120 nanopores are filled with an aqueous solution that causes surface charging these charge surfaces absorb counter ions and repel the co ions cations or anions can preferentially pass more preferentially than other types of charged nanopores for example alumina preferentially transfers cations whereas silica nanopores transfer anions the surface of the nanochannels is charged because of ion adsorption surface ionization and ion dissolution under a concentration gradient and because of the ion selectivity of nanopores the diffusion and flow rates of anions and cations are different and not equal consequently an electric current flows in the nanopores this electrical current can provide electrical power by placing electrodes in solutions i e electrochemical redox reactions on electrode surfaces 15 109 120 122 these functional nanofluidic channels or nanopores can be easily modified to obtain high ion selectivity the red system with nanoporous membranes is a desirable candidate for power generation because it contains a parallel structure of nanofluidic channels among various materials for this type of membrane such as polymers silicon and alumina polymeric materials have been applied in different fields owing to their simple fabrication process relatively low cost and excellent biocompatibility fig 5 shows a schematic of the nfred in negatively charged nanopores connecting two reservoirs with different concentrations 15 power generation is affected by the pore number pore geometry dimensions of the nanofluidic channels pores surface chemistry of the nanopore and ph variation of the working solutions it increases by reducing the channel length owing to the low resistance 123 125 temperature is a significant operational factor that affects the performance of nanofluidic reverse electrodialysis nred almost all physicochemical properties such as viscosity permselectivity ion diffusivity electrical conductance of a nanochannel and ionic mobility depend on the temperature an increase in temperature can have positive or negative effects on nred performance the electrical conductivity increased with an increasing temperature in aqueous solutions owing to the decrease in water viscosity which leads to easier ions migration the sensitivity of ion mobility to temperature changes is different temperature changes affect the equilibrium constants of the dissociation the protonation reactions of sialons groups the dissociation constant of water liquid viscosity and ion diffusivity in silica aqueous solution systems all parameters affect the conductance of nanofluidic channels pores moreover an additional increase in temperature may induce bubble nucleation especially in highly concentrated salt solutions in this type of solution hydrophobic pieces are created on the pore surfaces via the salting out effect that covers charged surfaces the weakened polarity in mesopores leads to the entry of more co ions reducing the potential difference across the film and causing a considerable degradation of nred performance 125 127 table 4 provides a summary of nfred studies 3 4 pore filling membrane the pore filling iem consists of a thin polymeric porous substrate and a gel type electrolyte monomer or polymer that fills the substrate pores fig 6 the substrate provides mechanical strength and chemical stability and restricts swelling of the filling polymer electrolyte polymers in pore filling iems allow ion conductivity electrolyte polymer filled pores must have sufficiently high iecs to increase the ion conductivity 56 137 138 pore filling iems exhibit high selectivity and low swelling and porous substrates exhibit lower hydrophilicity compared to electrolyte polymers 56 the desired characteristics can be obtained using a substrate and filling polymer 138 immersing the substrate in an electrolyte or pouring the electrolyte onto the substrate surface leads to impregnation the substrate pores are filled with electrolytes using these two methods solvent evaporation of polymeric electrolytes is used to complete the pore filling of the iem fabrication post modifications can be performed depending on the type of electrolyte used the impregnation process can be repeated to achieve high quality pore filling iems 56 kim et al 137 fabricated pore filling membranes one aem kier aem1 and two types of cems to achieve high gross power density red applications kier aem1 consists of a polymer cross linked using n n bis acryloyl piperazine and vinyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride in a porous polyolefin substrate kier cem1 consists of a polymer cross linked using n n0 ethylene bis acrylamide and vinyl sulfonic acid yang et al proposed a pore filling cem with a porous polyethylene substrate and two types of anionic monomeric electrolytes for use in red they obtained a power density of 1 95 w m2 56 in the next section the profiled membranes show that their fabrication strategy physical is similar to that of pore filling membranes 3 5 profiled membrane spacers are used to separate the iems from each other and the flowing water between them in common ed and red systems however these spacers are generally non conductive hence a large portion of the conductive membrane area was covered with these spacers consequently the available membrane area will be smaller ion transport is reduced and area resistance increases this phenomenon is known as the spacer shadow effect 104 profiled membranes have been proposed as alternatives to traditional net spacers because they possess relief on the surface to separate the iems and supply channels for solution flow profiled iems have improved the performance of red and ed systems by removing the spacer shadow effect and reducing hydraulic losses 31 104 139 the other advantages of profiled membranes are their economic feasibility and cost effectiveness they increase the active membrane area and reduce the ohmic resistance of the stack resulting in lower sensitivity to fouling than that stacks with net spacers the use of profiled membranes also they reduces pumping costs and eliminates the requirement of expensive materials and non conductive spacers 31 140 red stacks with net spacers face high electrical resistance low active membrane area and increased pressure drop corrugations and patterns of profiled iems are essential for exploiting the beneficial effects of these membranes 140 appropriate profiled membrane geometries and reynolds numbers can lead to a reduction of polarization phenomena 31 pawlowski et al simulated fluid behaviors in channels created using different profiled membranes the highest net power density values were obtained in the chevron form because of the increase in the available membrane area and the balance between the enhancement of mass transfer and the pressure drop in the channel 139 the creation of corrugated structures on one or both sides of the membrane were performed using different methods such as casting a membrane solution into a mold followed by solvent evaporation fig 7 hot pressing of a thermoplastic polymer including suitable functional groups and roll pressing i e calendaring of a thermoplastic ion exchange film between corrugated rollers at a high temperature one of the problems of the hot pressing technique is the deformation of the microstructures when the membrane film is released from the mold this problem can be resolved by slightly inclining the sidewalls of the mold or by using anti adhesive coatings 104 using profiled membranes in ed applications has been reported 141 144 but vermaas et al 35 investigated the first successful red operation they investigated heterogeneous iems made by the hot pressing method with ridges and compared their performance with a red stack having flat membranes and non conductive spacers some characteristics of the profiled membranes for red are presented in table 5 4 other concept of red 4 1 red as a flow battery by bipolar membrane generally bipolar membranes are used for the production of acids and bases in the electrodialysis process the neutralization reaction of the acid and base by the bipolar membrane leads to the production of electricity in a red system these membranes are specific types of iems that consist of polymeric films with fixed charges of opposite polarity 5 47 the driving force of red with bipolar membranes is the neutralization reaction of oh with h under ambient conditions acids and bases are the fuels in this system the potential advantages of a neutralization flow battery with bipolar membranes include low environmental impact inexpensive electrolytes and high energy density at high electrolyte concentrations this helps overcome common self discharging problems 4 148 the red bipolar membrane stacks consist of many repeating cell units between electrode compartments in each cell unit there are acid and base compartments on the sides of the bipolar membrane a salt chamber was separated from the base or acid chamber using a cem or aem fig 8 shows a schematic of the stack undercharge lower half and discharge conditions upper half 5 148 the red bp unit can be utilized as a battery by connecting it to an external load electricity is produced by moving h from hcl and oh from naoh toward the water inside each bipolar membrane the role of electrode reactions is converting the ion current to the electronic current that flows by the load of the external circuit 5 by increasing the number of charging discharging cycles the battery performance decreased and the compartments are polluted an increase in the concentration of acid base salt compartments or even their volumes enhances the capacity of the battery it also increases the power density and charge discharge efficiency and reduces the ionic resistivity however these methods are harmful to the process 4 148 4 2 red heat engine closed loop salinity gradient power in recent years new and different applications of sgp technologies have gained attention the sgp unit pro or red operates in a closed loop with artificial saline solutions as feed fluids this closed loop system can be considered a coupled system in which a thermal regeneration process is integrated with sgp processes the advantage of this system is the choice of a saline solution to increase the overall performance the attentive selective of the artificial feed solution leads to the availability of a large volume of gibbs free energy arising mixing low energy consumption in the regeneration unit to restore the original concentration levels of feed solutions and use of waste heat at low temperature as an available and cheap source i e waste heat from industrial processes the existing solutions can be regenerated by a suitable regeneration stage and sent back to the sgp step this makes it an economic system based on waste heat from different industrial processes it can also be considered an sgp heat engine in which low grade heat is transformed to electricity through the sgp technology the use of thermolytic salts such as nh4hco3 can be an appropriate option for converting low grade waste heat into electric current in a red closed loop 149 151 the thermolytic red heat engine consists of two units a red unit and a thermal regeneration unit power is produced in the red unit by extracting the salinity gradient between the nh4hco3 solutions in the second unit low grade waste heat is employed to restitute the initial conditions of the outlet currents of the red unit as the regeneration unit based on fig 9 the concentrate and dilute nh4hco3 are pumped to the red unit to transform their sg to electricity because of the osmotic flux water is transmitted from dilute to concentrated during this process and a part of the salt content in the concentrate solution is transmitted to the dilute solution both salt and water transport must be promoted in the opposite direction to restore the initial conditions of the two currents in the regeneration unit 149 recently researchers have investigated the performance of red units fed with nh4hco3 water solutions bevacqua et al 150 investigated an red system by feeding nh4hco3 solutions to maximize the process performance based on finding operating parameters based on their results feed flow rates higher than one cm s have a negative effect on the power output owing to the pressure drop their findings also revealed that ammonium bicarbonate is an appropriate salt for the red process kim et al 152 developed a model to predict the performance of a red system using nh4hco3 solutions their model substitutes all properties of the solution and membrane for nh4hco3 instead of nacl 5 obstacles of red performance 5 1 fouling in practical applications the use of natural water sources introduces challenges such as fouling fouling is the accumulation of undesired materials at the phase interfaces of the iem membranes this phenomenon is one of the most common drawbacks of all membrane processes this is preventable for large scale red systems iems face several types of fouling such as the adhesion of organic substances biofouling scaling and colloidal fouling the deposition of substances at the interface or inside iems reduces the ion flux and power density and increases the stack and membrane resistance in the red process therefore it is necessary to minimize membrane fouling 21 95 116 145 153 155 fouling affects the major operational parameters it decreases the ocv retards ion migration and increases the feed channel pressure drop and electrical resistance ohmic and non ohmic changes in these parameters affect red performance and may limit the applicability of red for sustainable power generation 111 156 157 fouling is classified into different types based on the nature of the foulants organic fouling is caused by the dissolved organic substances in the membrane matrix colloids or non dissolved suspended solids cause colloidal fouling pore blocking occurs via the deposition of particles having sizes identical to those of membrane pores additionally pore narrowing is created by micro colloidal and soluble organics having a smaller size than the membrane pores the deposition of large particles on the membrane surface and dissolved salts leads to the formation of a cake layer and scaling respectively typical scaling consists of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 and co3 2 95 158 160 biofouling wherein a biofilm is formed on the membrane surface is caused by live microorganisms and bacteria followed by the growth and increase of sessile cells eventually generating a complex structure 161 fouling causes an increase in electrical resistance through two mechanisms first dissolved charged foulants i e organic fouling can counterbalance charged groups in the membrane and increase ohmic resistance which is common in aems second the adherence of colloids on the membrane surface enhances the thickness of the concentration boundary layer and consequently increases the non ohmic resistance 34 mikhaylin et al reviewed the main types of iem fouling by considering the primary factors affecting fouling formation and development they also investigated modern and conventional strategies for controlling and preventing of fouling 162 pawlowski et al utilized 2d fluorescence spectroscopy as to monitor fouling in a red system including fluorescence excitation emission matrices of iem surfaces and natural streams accumulated during one month of red operation they also investigated the efficiency of cleaning strategies their results showed that 2d fluorescence spectroscopy and principal component analysis have high potential for antifouling analysis 163 one fouling problem is preferential channeling which blocks a portion of the feedwater compartments through scaling or colloidal fouling in red this phenomenon causes a significant reduction of power density 74 additionally fouling leads to a pressure drop in the feedwater compartment 109 5 1 1 fouling in aems aems generally undergo with fouling due to the presence of natural organic compounds arising from the negative nature of organic foulants and they are more susceptible to this type of fouling than cems studies have shown that in the absence of antifouling strategies the thickness of the boundary layer increases with the adherence of colloids leading to an increase in the non ohmic resistance and a decrease in red performance 34 95 164 generally fouling in aems is controlled by an increase in hydrophilicity and or negative cd on the membrane surface 21 vaselbehagh improved the anti biofouling properties of aems through surface modification by a polydopamine pda coating the pda coating improved the anti biofouling properties of aems during red operation 165 rijnaarts et al investigated the red performance and fouling of six different aems using natural sea and river water in the netherlands aems are divided into three groups based on their chemistry polymer backbone aromatic and aliphatic acrylamide iec high and medium support thickness and porosity low medium high all aems are homogeneous membranes rijnaarts et al reported that natural fouling is highly dependent on the associated membrane properties and their corresponding chemistries for each aem aromatic aems showed a decrease in permselectivity and enhanced resistance aliphatic aems with a medium sd showed only an increase in membrane resistance whereas aliphatic aems with high sds presented only a decrease in permselectivity rijnaarts et al observed that the negative effect of spacer fouling on the power density was stronger than that of aem fouling 116 additionally vaselbehagh et al showed that a polydopamine coating improved the anti biofouling properties of aems the generated electric field and current prevented bacterial attachment to the aem surface the anti biofouling properties were improved by pda modification 164 5 1 2 fouling in cems generally cems undergo inorganic fouling or scaling which causes problems during red operation the precipitation of salts e g calcium carbonate calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide on the cem surface leads to fouling fouling studies are very scarce in cems because ofthe lack of efficient and clear techniques 17 21 157 regular antifouling treatments such as pretreatment with ultrafiltration are expensive or environmentally undesirable e g disinfectants or coagulants therefore cheap and environmentally friendly antifouling strategies are required disturbances in flow conditions lead to reduced fouling 145 5 1 3 strategies for fouling prevention to maintain high power density and low pressure drop antifouling strategies are required without antifouling strategies the power density decreases by more than 60 during the first hours of red operation 21 145 fouling prevention or control is performed by chemical and physical methods such as mechanical removal air sparging 145 pretreatment of solutions periodic feedwater switching i e reversal polarity 145 cleaning agents 163 166 and membrane modification 17 95 162 table 6 summarizes the fouling studies of red 5 1 3 1 periodic feedwater switching the reversal of periodic feedwater switching is an example of an antifouling strategy the reversal of the electrical field induces osmotic shock and the feedwater pressure increases this method decreases the fouling of charged colloids and organic acids capacitive electrodes are used in the periodic switching of the feedwater vermaas et al used this method as an antifouling method in the red process 145 5 1 3 2 cleaning agents or chemical cleaning the use of chemical cleaning agents is a simple and appropriate method for preventing fouling on the surface of iems during the red process however this method may have a negative effect on membrane performance for example cleaning with alkali solutions may cause the degradation of ion exchange groups or the use of oxidants may lead to the degradation of ion exchange groups 162 166 5 1 3 3 two phase flow cleaning a two phase flow of gas liquid in the membrane process can be utilized to create hydrodynamic instabilities in order to reduce concentration polarization remove cake layers and eliminate biofouling from membrane surfaces or net spacers air is a common gas used in the two phase flow because of its availability ease of storage and handling air sparging is performed by injecting air bubbles into feedwater compartments moreno et al conducted t water co2 sparging they dissolved co2 in the water at a pressure higher than the working pressure of the membrane process and observed that water was supersaturated in co2 upon entrance to the membrane module causing the co2 bubbles to nucleate via to depressurization the co2 nucleation effect such as the spontaneous creation of bubbles occurs at the spacer filaments owing to local pressure differences a phenomenon similar to such as that when opening of a bottle of carbonated drink when the co2 saturated water exits the spacer filled channel co2 dissolution in water is stopped and co2 is released into the atmosphere thus permanent changes do not occur in the nature of the system additionally the induction of co2 in water leads to a decrease in system ph which is a type of chemical cleaning in place two main reasons have been reported about the need for more effective control of fouling in water co2 saturated injection compared with that of water air saturation the stack resistance is increased in the air sparging method owing to the presence of stagnant bubbles in the stack after each air sparging cycle additionally because of the nucleation effect and the decrease in the feedwater ph fouling is reduced with the injection of co2 117 145 5 1 3 4 modification of the membrane surface another method of fouling reduction or prevention includes modifying the membrane surface the use of sulfonating agents or nanomaterials and layer by layer deposition are some approaches to membrane surface modification for fouling prevention and mitigation such techniques improve the physicochemical characteristics of membrane surfaces because the membrane hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and surface charge can be changed using these methods the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and charged foulants can be improved via surface modification and by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface membranes having smooth surfaces have been reported to help decrease fouling by reducing the contact area to avoid the binding of foulants to the membrane surface 17 95 5 2 negative flows iems having fixed charge groups allow counter ions to pass whereas water and co ions are completely rejected in an ideal case in real cases membranes are not ideal selective barriers co ions and water also pass through leading to the reduction of process performance 20 49 to obtain efficient power generation using iems three parameters must be optimized the membrane resistance must be reduced the membrane selectivity must be maximized and molar water permeation should be minimized 39 water transport is affected by hydrostatic pressure electric potential differences in salt concentration friction with ions and pore walls 49 167 5 2 1 effect of water transport in iems to enhance the performance of iems in the red process the molar water permeation across the membrane must be low and the water transference coefficients must be as close to zero as possible water transport is typically induced by hydrostatic pressure differences across the membrane osmosis electro osmosis and water transport in the hydration shell around the ions 39 49 168 tedesco et al investigated the mechanisms of water transport across membranes in red 49 5 2 2 osmosis and electro osmosis osmosis is the non ideal transport of water from the diluted i e river water compartment toward the concentrated i e seawater compartment owing to the difference in water concentration e g osmotic pressure difference across the membrane it is assumed that this effect causes dilution of salt concentrations in the membrane consequently a concave internal concentration profile would yield under ocv conditions osmosis most likely has a negative effect on the thermodynamic efficiency and power density in red because of counter ion diffusion through the membranes and dilution of the boundary layer on the seawater side the effects of co ion and osmosis transport are analogous to self discharge in normal batteries electro osmosis in red is the transport of water molecules with salt ions caused by solvation phenomena in a direction opposite to the direction of the normal osmotic flow this counterbalances the negative effects of normal osmosis 49 67 168 172 5 2 3 co ion transport for ideal iems counter ions only pass through the membrane however in the case of non ideal iems the transport of co ions i e those having the same charge as the fixed ion exchange groups has a negative impact on the power density and consequently leads to a decrease in performance the transport of the co ions occurs in the same direction as that of the counter ions the performance of the red process depends on the membrane properties i e diffusion coefficients and fixed cd and the operating conditions i e residence time inlet concentration and cell pair voltage the fixed cd of the membrane influences the concentration of co ions inside the membrane the transport of co ions under zero current conditions causes the diffusion of nacl through the iem and can be compared to the self discharge phenomenon of batteries 2 20 49 169 173 6 operating parameters 6 1 feed concentration the stack resistance and ocv are increased by lowering the dilute concentration at a constant concentration of the concentrated compartment to counteract the power output high ocv and low stack resistance are desirable for the red process the optimal concentration range depends on factors such as membrane properties stack geometry and flow velocity 18 tedesco et al observed a slight increase in power density when the dilute concentration was less than 0 1 m the increase in chigh leads to an increase in power density at a constant concentration in the diluted compartment owing to the beneficial effect of reducing the stack resistance and enhancing the process driving force e g ocv additionally an increase in chigh leads to a permselectivity reduction because of the presence of a highly concentrated solution in the system 22 generally the permselectivity of iems is reduced when highly concentrated brines are used because of presence of co ions 18 158 zhu et al investigated the effect of two different types of salts in the feed solution on red performance the power density of the red stack with nh4hco3 was lower than that of the stack containing nacl at similar concentrations owing to lower ion activity 174 6 2 divalent and multivalent ions the power density strongly depends on the composition of dilute and concentrated solutions the presence of divalent and multivalent ions i e mg2 ca2 so4 2 is a significant challenge to red it leads to a decrease in the power density ocv permselectivity and an increase in the stack resistance because of the transport of multivalent ions against the concentration gradient i e the uphill transport phenomenon hence the exchange of divalent cations in the dilute chamber with monovalent cations in the concentrated chamber acts against their concentration gradient fig 10 shows different membrane strategies to reduce the influence of multivalent ions in the red process 2 13 48 158 the presence of magnesium ions in natural water significantly affects the performance of the red system ocv and power density even at low concentration 23 115 in uphill transport the resistance increases and the obtainable voltage is reduced in this phenomenon the transport of counter ions in both directions creates equilibrium and removes the net flux of electrical charges removing divalent and multivalent ions can improve the power density of the red process 48 158 post et al investigated the effect of multivalent ions on red performance showing that the presence of multivalent ions leads to high stack resistance and a lowering effect on the stack voltage post et al suggested using monovalent selective membranes in the case of high multivalent ion content in the dilute compartment 13 moreno et al reported that the negative effect of uphill transport was significantly minimized when monovalent selective membranes were used for red e g aem coated selemion cso membrane or highly cross linked neosepta cms membrane 48 river water and seawater primarily constitute na and cl species a complex situation is created because of the presence of both monovalent and multivalent ions hence two monovalent ions are exchanged with one divalent ion the producing voltage is reduced by 7 in the presence of multivalent ions the voltage produced by monovalent ions is twice the creating voltage of multivalent ions eq 1 34 the results of hong et al showed 20 decrease with sodium sulfate 15 with magnesium chloride and 9 with magnesium sulfate compared to the maximum power density with nacl because of the high internal stack resistance 41 several effects of divalent and multivalent ions on the red performance have been reported 115 175 178 there are many divalent cations such as mg2 and ca2 in natural water that are not conducive to power production through red donnan dialysis dd has been proposed as a pretreatment for removing divalent cations 179 it is an attractive process to reduce resistance by exchanging divalent cations with monovalent cations this exchange in the draw solution causes an increase in the concentrations of monovalent cations and a decrease in the concentrations of divalent cations in the feed solution of an red system 19 158 rijnaart et al investigated the effect of dd pretreatment on red power extraction using natural rivers and seawater and compared it with theoretical models their results showed improved gross and net power densities through low resistance due to the exchange between divalent and monovalent cations 158 6 3 natural feed the obtained power density rapidly decreased by 80 from the theoretical expectation by feeding red stacks with natural river water and seawater owing to the presence of natural organic matter nom and membrane fouling nom type and salt concentration are critical parameters for determining the effect of noms on the generated power density nom such as polysaccharides from the decomposition of organic substances humic substances from water through peatland and proteins from organic waste can be found in estuaries nom serves as organic foulants that can form films on the membrane surface 180 181 susanto et al observed different power density behaviors for different types of nom added to diluted saltwater168 kingsbury et al measured power generation from five real water pairs containing mixtures of nom and ions in laboratory scale red stacks they reported that the effect of nom on the power density was stronger than that of inorganic solutes the presence of nom led to increased membrane resistance and reduction of ocv membrane permselectivity and energy extraction efficiency 181 6 4 flow rate residence time the residence time is an influencing parameter of power density the gross power density is maximum at high flow rates low residence time because of the high salinity gradient across the membrane theoretically when the residence time is zero the gross power is at its maximum this phenomenon is caused by the concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane i e dilute and saltwater compartments and it is nearly unaffected by salt transport through the membrane therefore a more uniform concentration gradient is created throughout the red stack consequently rδc 1 1 rδc is the contribution to the resistance due to the concentration change in the bulk solution and rbl 2 2 rbl is the boundary layer resistance resistances are smaller but hydrodynamic power losses should be considered because they are increased by enhancing the flow rate therefore an optimal flow rate value is required to achieve a high power density the net power density is also reduced because of the high power consumption of pumping the feedwater and the pressure drops in the compartments these pressure drops along were not considered in the gross power calculations 6 36 67 the residence time and reynolds number are generally considered for comparison purposes at different scales of red because they are less sensitive to the scale of the experiment an increase in the reynolds number leads to a lower residence time 6 67 a longer residence time i e low flow rate allows a faster transfer of ions from the salt compartments to the fresh compartments therefore the energy efficiency is maximal owing to the equilibrium achievement and low hydrodynamic power losses co ion transport and osmosis play significant roles at low flow rates therefore there exists an optimal flow for maximal net energy efficiency 36 67 zhu et al investigated different flow rates for concentrated and diluted solutions to reduce the pumping energy consumption power was not reduced at lower flow rates because of the trade offs between decreases in the solution resistance of the diluted solution channels and increases in the diffusion boundary layer resistance zhu et al concluded that varying the flow rates of both solutions indicated that the optimum flow rate was 10 ml min for the concentrated solution and 20 ml min for the diluted solution the use of these optimized flow rates minimized the pumping energy compared with higher flow rates 182 6 5 temperature the temperature of the feed streams strongly affected red performance an increase in temperature results in an increase in the obtained gross power density current and reduction of stack resistance it also leads to an increase in conductivity by enhancing the ionic diffusion according to the nernst haskell equation with a reduced solution viscosity by reducing the viscosity the ions can move more easily and the conductivity is increased however the spacer shadow effect and concentration polarization increased with increasing temperature the influence of temperature on the spacer shadow effect is greater than that of the concentration polarization the reason for this behavior is that the non conductive spacers block part of the ionic transport 10 183 184 7 hybrid process the concept of hybrid process and co location is relatively novel concept in reverse electrodialysis the hybrid process minimizes environmental impacts and capital cost of the process the electricity produced by the red process can be converted to other types of energy such as hydrogen energy and can be stored in a battery the red process can be integrated with desalination technologies used for water treatment and for the production of potable water by reducing the influence of brine discharge and while increasing the power density 7 1 reverse osmosis ro and red various combinations of ro and red units are used there are two types of ro red assemblies that can be utilized a single stage operation red can be conducted as a pre or post treatment stage for ro complex arrangements for hybrid red ro units can be developed but they may require a high capital cost according to the schematic shown in fig 11 in ro red mode the effluent of the ro process plays a role of concentrated supply for the red process this unit reduces the environmental impact of the ro brine due to decreasing the salinity of the discharged effluent by the red system it can also reduce energy consumption and the concentrated discharge of ro is a better high salinity source for energy recovery comparing seawater in the red system 185 187 yasukawa et al 187 evaluated the power generation performance of a red stack 200 cell pair and effective membrane area of 40m2 they used the actual reverse osmosis brine and sewage treated water as the feed solutions after adequate pretreatments based on the presented energy analysis by yasukawa et al the conversion efficiency of the red process depends on the operating condition the power output increased with increasing the flow rate the maximum net power was obtained 0 46 w m2 at 1 5 a at a flow rate of 4 3 l min 7 2 red and ro in this mode the seawater feed with high salinity passes from the red unit reducing salinity and producing energy fig 12 then seawater with reduced salinity is pumped into the ro unit owing to the red pre treatment the pump work and concentration of the discharged brine are reduced in the ro unit the feed solution has a relatively low osmotic pressure 185 186 kwon et al modeled two red desalination systems ro and forward osmosis fo their results showed that the energy costs could be lowered by 7 8 from the typical value for ro and 13 5 for fo the power generation by red using fo and ro brines increased 2 and 1 5 times compared to that using seawater 188 li et al 185 developed a mathematical method for variety of red ro configurations for analyzing the effecting factors li et al also discussed the implications for developing the red ro processes based on the modeling results the modeling results indicated that the red ro process reduced the specific energy consumption 7 3 solar energy red a combination of seawater desalination red and solar power utilization can simultaneously produce potable water and energy a large portion of the energy consumed during the ro process is saved as osmotic energy in the brine output owing to the discharge and wasting of the brine output significant amount of energy is wasted the use of the red process as a post treatment method leads to avoiding such energy wastage because of the recovery of osmotic power by using solar energy between the ro and red processes a much higher salt concentration can be obtained by evaporating the brine using solar energy therefore energy harvesting is continuously possible from the concentrated salt solution over day and night allowing the production of large amounts of potable water at the same time in addition to an increase in the temperature of the salty stream the red unit performance and power output can be enhanced seawater can be used as dilute water and can be preheated by solar energy utilization 189 190 fig 13 shows a schematic of the hybrid combination of seawater desalination red and solar power unit the red system combined with a desalination unit and the use of solar energy at the coastal site is an appropriate source for response to the requirement of energy and potable water due to numerous coastal locations all over the world this combination can continuously produce electrical energy by efficient storage as a battery it also leads to reducing the consumption of fossil fuels such as oil 7 4 microbial reverse electrodialysis cell mrc red the use of microbial reverse electrodialysis cells is a novel bio electrochemical approach for producing electrical power that combines an mfc and an red stack recently the use of mrcs has been identified as a sustainable water treatment technology that can harvest electrical energy from salinity gradients while extracting chemical energy from organic matter this technology has been developed to increase the power density and voltage compared with that generated through mfcs or red systems the same electrodes used in the mfc were placed on each side of the red stack then desirable reactions occur at the electrodes because of the extraction of energy by a small number of membrane pairs mfcs spontaneously produce electrical current by pairing bio anodes and cathodes exoelectrogenic microbes release electrons by oxidizing soluble wastewater organics in the anode and oxygen reduction is performed in the cathodes mixing solutions with different ionic strengths releases entropic energy that is converted into electrical energy in the red stack by high and low concentration chambers 105 191 192 the results of kim et al 191 with five pairs of red cells showed that the combination of an mfc red stacks increased the performance compared to the individual systems decreasing the internal resistance of the mrc stack improves the efficiency of energy extraction and mrc performance the internal resistance can be reduced by minimizing the intermembrane distance space spacer thickness increasing hydrodynamic turbulency at the interfaces of the membrane and enhancing membrane area liu et al 105 increased the power density and reduced the internal resistance by applying the patterned ion exchange membranes and integrated spacers for the first time in an mrc system they achieved high energy recovery and energy efficiency compared to smooth membranes the utilize of profiled membrane reduced membrane space but led to increased pumping energy consumption which is negligible 1 thus the patterned membrane can be a good candidate for more effective mrcs 7 5 membrane distillation md red using hot and highly saline discharged streams from md improves the red efficiency by increasing the salinity gradient as a driving force and reducing electrical resistance the power produced by the red can be utilized as input energy in the ro or ed stages md absorbs thermal energy from the heat source and produces a highly salty discharged stream thus red converts the gibbs free energy of the mixing streams into electricity 193 194 tufa et al used an integrated ro md red system at the laboratory scale they evaluated the exergy efficiency and exergy losses in the presence and absence of the red unit the presence of the red unit leads to the recovery and conversion of the electrochemical and thermal potentials of hot and hypersaline brine of md to electricity up to 17 reduction of the electrical energy consumption results from the incorporation of red the highly concentrated brine of md generates more electrical power via red 193 mercer et al investigated the synergistic potential of md red configuration using urine on a small scale to enable electrical energy recovery 195 long et al investigated a hybrid md red system as a heat engine for the conversion of waste heat into electricity their results showed that there is an optimal relative permeate feed solution flow rate for obtaining the maximum electrical efficiency of the md red system under given operating temperatures for different feed nacl concentrations 194 7 6 capacitive deionization cdi red cdi an emerging desalination technology is an electrosorption process comprising a pair of porous charged electrodes and a direct current dc power supply this technology is generally used to purify saline water the electrodes are polarized upon dc current brackish water passes through these electrodes and deionized water is produced by the adsorption of charged ions from the saltwater by the electrodes one of the electrodes has a positive charge and the other has a negative charge negative ions move toward the positive electrode and positive ions move toward the negative electrode i e the adsorption cycle in the desorption cycle that begins after the adsorption cycle the adsorbed ions are removed from the porous electrodes by reversing the polarity or eliminating the external power source a cdi system generates three different streams a freshwater stream during charging a high salt concentrated stream during discharging and a low salt concentrated stream brine disposal of cdi can be passed through the red stack to produce energy using the integrated cdi red system freshwater and electric power can be generated simultaneously 196 198 choi et al proposed the ro mcdi red hybrid system for the treatment of high salinity seawater and increased energy efficiency in this hybrid system fig 14 red recovers 33 of the energy from the discharge and the energy consumption of this hybrid system is reduced by 39 additionally a large amount of energy is harvested using the red process 199 7 7 microbial electrolysis cell mec red another method for the removal of multivalent ions from wastewater include the use of an mec harvesting sustainable energy in the form of electricity and hydrogen is facilitated using an mec red hybrid system seawater effluent from an mec as a high concentration solution is supplied to the red stack eliminating ca2 mg2 and another multivalent from seawater by mec is beneficial for power generation in red jwa et al 200 investigated a hybrid process that combines microbial electrolysis and the red system a microbial electrolysis cell was used before red to remove multivalent ions due to reducing electric membrane resistance ca2 and mg 2 were effectively removed and hydrogen was simultaneously produced the power density was achieved 26 higher when treated seawater was induced to the red stack as a concentrated solution compared to untreated seawater 7 8 hydrogen generation hydrogen is the simplest most abundant and lightest element in the world unlike fossil fuels it is not a primary source of energy and is not readily available in nature hydrogen appears in combination with different elements such as oxygen in water carbon and oxygen fossil fuels hydrogen is a clean energy source that can be generated from a primary energy source without co2 generation 201 203 the hydrogen generation rates and costs of the different electrolysis methods are listed in table 7 salinity power can be used for hydrogen generation by integrating electrolysis and red processes hydrogen gas is electrochemically generated in microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cells mrecs a current is produced by microorganisms i e exoelectrogenic bacteria in the anode where the organic matter is oxidized electrons transfer to the anode is facilitated and hydrogen gas is generated at the cathode fig 15 shows a diagram of the mrec process the red stacks are placed between the cathode and anode compartments of the mrec one of the limitations of this process is the use of seawater which leads to membrane biofouling therefore it is necessary to treat seawater another limitation of this process is the requirement of organic matter sources that are not useful for inland regions 204 207 the two driving forces of mrec include the thermodynamic oxidation of organic matter on the anode by exoelectrogens and energy harvesting from the salinity gradient between river water and seawater 208 by increasing the number of cell pairs the influence of the voltage loss caused by the resistance of the electrode on the generated power becomes negligible and the produced current increases therefore for pilot scale red systems water electrolysis can facilitate an available redox reaction that generates hydrogen energy and electric power 209 210 the results of hidayat et al 211 also showed that the presence of multivalent ions has an unfavorable effect on the performance of microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cells another method for hydrogen production is heat driven red technology with thermolytic solutions such as ammonium bicarbonate amb in closed loop systems the amb based red system includes an red stack and a regeneration system similar to a typical red system bicarbonate ions flow from the high concentration hc to a low concentration lc across the aems hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction are the two electrodes required for these methods as shown in fig 16 the lc effluent flows into the regeneration system the regeneration system consists of an absorption column and a stripping column in the stripping column the low grade waste heat warms the low concentrated effluent at 313 k and 1 atm low grade waste heat is an unused energy resource that is produced in industrial plants owing to the lack of cost effective and efficient recovery methods this heat leads to the stripping of the solution into nh4 and co2 gases these gases are absorbed into the highly concentrated effluent in the absorption column at 298 k the outlets of the stripping and absorption columns are transferred into the red cell and mixed with the lc and hc inlets 212 214 to determine the optimal stack configuration for hydrogen production using mrec with amb solutions luo et al tested different stack arrangements and different numbers of cell pairs five cell pairs were found to be the optimum number based on the mrec performance and minimized capital costs the additional chamber leads to decreasing losses of ammonia nitrogen in the anolyte and increases the hydrogen yield 200 hatzell et al demonstrated the simultaneous production of hydrogen and waste acid neutralization the use of a waste acid stream synthetic as a catholyte increased the hydrogen production rate compared with the amb electrolyte 215 7 9 ed red the hybrid ed red system has advantages for the high salinity wastewater treatment process the use of salinity energy high value resource reclamation and le consumption for desalination it was expected that red would play dual roles power generation and pretreatment for desalination 40 luo et al designed in situ hybrid system comprising ed and red units the ed unit was used as the energy acceptor and the red served as the energy donor both ed and red units were operated in continuous and batch wise modes their results confirmed that hybrid ed reds are technically feasible and economically attractive this technology is a good candidate for water desalination without the consumption of external energy 216 wang et al 40 proposed a hybrid red ed systems for the simultaneous recovery of osmotic energy and the desalination of phenol containing wastewater limiting wastewater treatment capacity and power generation are two important parameters for the design and improvement of hybrid systems compared to the ed process a hybrid red ed system could recover more salinity gradient power and consume less electric energy with pre desalination in the red stage 8 large scale iem preparation pilot plant and limitations for red commercialization the commercialization and up scaling of red are limited because of several challenges iems encounter problems such as low power density fouling low energy efficiency high cost and short lifetime additionally the hydrodynamic aspects and pre treatment of the seawater river water to prevent performance reduction water must be considered the general applied pre treatments are certainly too capital intensive for red iems as the key component play an influential role in red commercialization they must exhibit high permselectivity mechanical stability durability and low ionic resistance and should not be susceptible to fouling the generation of high power density at low investment and operational costs is necessary for developing the red technology power density net power and energy efficiency are significant economic parameters the investments of stacks and membranes can be reduced at higher power densities hydrodynamic losses arising from the pumping of streams should be minimized to enhance net power the hydrodynamic design of the stack is necessary to achieve high power density the residence time in stacks of different sizes is an important parameter and has a negative effect on large stacks owing to hydrodynamic losses in the long flow path 15 21 36 39 110 217 the quality and cost aspects e g stack capital and pretreatment energy consumption and use of chemicals are crucial factors for the pre treatment requirements in red 76 110 post et al 110 discussed economic and technological challenges in the development of red by focusing on the development of low cost membranes pre treatment methods and associated economics the membrane area required for installation is determined by the required power density required capacity as well as the available amount of water streams capital costs consist of the construction cost pumping and hydraulic equipment and the filtration installation for the feed streams the available water streams and fuel efficiency of the process determine the technical limitations of the installed red capacity an economic and technical model was presented by daniilidis et al 218 to analyze financial aspects and upscale the potential of an red plant the mentioned model is presented based on three different feed solutions and representative experimental data for upscale potential sensitivity analysis revealed that pricing performance and other parameters related to the membrane are the most crucial factors for upscaling of red veerman et al 36 investigated the operation parameters on the performance of a scaled up red stack with 50 cells in a membrane dimension of 25 75 cm2 the first pilot scale in the netherlands was installed in 2014 and fed with seawater 28 g l and freshwater from the lake 0 2 0 5 g l 119 a pilot plant using artificial brine and brackish water was operated in italy achieving a power output of 700 w a 50 decrease in the power output observed when real solutions were used because of the absence of large concentrations of nacl ions in the real feed 219 an red stack located at the japan okinawa seawater desalination plant consisted of 299 cell pairs with a total of 179 4 m2 of effective membrane area a maximum gross power output of 263 and 171 6 w was generated using the model ro brine rw and natural feed solutions respectively the enhanced power generation from the model feed solutions was caused by concentration polarization arising from multivalent ions 220 increasing the feed temperature during red in pilot scale red stacks shows a positive effect on the ocv maximum gross power pumping energy and net power output of the system 10 an red stack with 1000 cells located in korea produced 95 8 w power by using municipal wastewater and seawater 221 the effect of operating parameters was investigated by d angelo et al at a pilot scale of 500 cell pairs these experiments were conducted using real and artificial solutions and two different electrode rinse solutions their results showed that the use of fe2 fe3 redox couple in the electrode rinse solution leads to an increase in power density compared to with that obtained using nacl solutions the performance of the process improved with increasing flow rate of the electrode rinse solution and feed solution in a real environment this system can operate for several months 222 9 stack design 9 1 electrodes the ionic current is converted into an electron current through a redox reaction at the electrodes the four essential parts of the electrode system include catholytes anolytes electrodes equipment for recirculating the electrode rinse solution and outer membranes electrochemical reactions transport through the membranes of the electrode system energy consumption and reversibility are important considerations when operating an electrode system to avoid contamination of the dilute and concentrated solutions by the electrolyte solution appropriate external membranes should be selected for each redox process the nature of the redox reaction in during the red process plays an important role in the external output and performance of a stack especially when a low number of cell pairs are used the power density depends on the number of cell pairs and the concentration of redox species because of the reduction in the power loss of the electrode system red stacks must have a large number of cells 9 223 225 it has been reported that increasing the concentration of electro active species results in higher current and higher power output 226 the electrode systems can be classified based on the presence or absence of opposite electrode reactions in a system with opposite electrode reactions there is no net chemical reaction or net modification of the chemical composition additionally the reactions direct and reverse occur at the anode and cathode and the equilibrium voltage is zero in these systems because there is no net chemical reaction and consequently no energy consumption an red system with this type of electrode system can generate electrical energy with only a few cells the opposite electrode reactions can involve homogeneous redox couples with inert electrodes or reactive electrodes such as zn znso4 ag agcl and cu cuso4 all reactants are present in the same phase in homogeneous redox couples with inert electrodes homogeneous redox couples having inert electrodes have a lower cost of electrodes higher energy efficiency of the device and easier stack design for example the potential difference required for the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at the anode is counterbalanced by the reduction of fe3 to fe2 on the cathode in an electrode system with inert electrodes and a reversible redox couple in reactive electrode systems the electrodes are not dimensionally stable because of alternative growth and dissolution which requires periodic interchange of the cathode and anode this phenomenon is a major drawback for designing and engineering red stacks 9 192 223 225 227 the electrode resistance can be significant for a small number of cell units but it becomes negligible when hundreds or thousands of cell units are envisioned 67 9 2 spacer design spacers are essential components that generally provide an appropriate distance between the membranes in a typical ed or red stack and improve ion distribution in feedwater compartments owing to their structure with open and netting structures spacers are made of woven or extruded polymeric materials such as polyamide and polypropylene the presence of spacers leads to a decrease in concentration polarization owing to the promotion of the mixing process in the compartments spacers also lead to a negative effect on the red stack the compartment pressure drops the stack electrical resistance increases and a location for the deposition and growth of microorganisms is made available i e fouling 67 112 137 as mentioned the part of the effective membrane area is covered with spacers that lead to an increase in the resistance of the membrane and solution compartment it also decreases the contact between the iem and solutions shadow effect this phenomenon has a significant impact on red performance the effect of the spacer on the red performance depends on mass transfer pressure drop and resistance the shadow effect depends on the spacer geometry such as the area fraction thickness distance angles and diameter of the spacer filaments the structure of spacers can increase the pressure drop over the compartments owing to lower porosity smaller hydraulic radius and existence of a tortuous flow path the shadow effect also leads to the reduction of the output power caused by the blocking of ionic transport from the solutions to the membrane and vice versa therefore it is essential to select a spacer having a large open area and small thickness 67 112 137 228 there are two types of spacers for this purpose based on their conductivities the effect of the spacer shadow is more visible in the non conductive spacers this type increases the stack resistance by reducing the available area and blocking ion transport the ion conductive spacers eliminate the spacer shadow effect by allowing the transport of ions through the spacer material itself large improvements in stack ocv values and net power output in the red system can be obtained for conductive spacers compared with those for non conductive spacers 67 228 as mentioned the spacers in the red stack shadow effects increase both the solution compartment and membrane resistance therefore it is expected that the potential ratio section 2 4 will be reduced by the parameters that lead to an increase in the shadow effect such as low porosity or high thickness of spacers mehdizadeh et al investigated the shadow effect of 16 types of spacers having different thicknesses and porosities to identify the shadow effects on the membrane and solution compartment separately to estimate the spacer shadow effects they also proposed a suitable spacer geometric parameter mehdizadeh et al reduced the thickness of the spacer compared with a gasket leading to a decrease in the shadow effect 112 dlugolecki et al showed that the use of ion conductive spacers in red leads to an increase in the power density of factors of three and four and a decrease in stack resistance by a factor of two compared with the use of non conductive spacers with the same open area and shape they improved the process performance for red by applying ion conductive spacers and eliminating the spacer shadow effect 228 9 3 pressure drop the pressure drop in the red stacks affects the net power density and flow distribution the non uniform distribution of fluid known as preferential channeling can increase the non ohmic resistance 229 the pressure drops in the red stack occur in different parts such as the inlet and outlet distribution ducts branches and connecting beams between the distribution ducts and compartment channel cell pair numbers red stack channel use of a spacer and flowrate are effective parameters for pressure drop one of the essential factors that affect on the pressure drop in the compartments is the thickness of the red stack channel although a reduction in the thickness of the stack channel improves the fluid distribution and gross power output it increases the pressure drop in practical applications the thickness of the channel cannot be too high because of it would impart high electrical resistance the power density balance becomes more negative for thinner compartments compared with thicker ones the use of more inlets and outlets in the red stack reduces the pressure drops in the beams owing to the sudden expansion the progressive extension of the beam width and branches in each new compartment decreases the pressure drop the pressure drop is increased by increasing the cell pair number consequently the net power decreases decreasing the flow rates of the two feed streams leads to a more uniform fluid flow distribution and a lower pressure drop however it also reduces the gross power density the impact of the cell pair number and partial pressure drop in the branches is reduced at low flow rates the intermembrane distance is also affected by the pressure drop the pressure drop increases with decreasing intermembrane distance 12 67 229 the presence of spacers caused by the application of a tortuous flow and funneling the water between the spacer and the membrane creates pressure drops in the compartments and increases the stack resistance to reduce the pressure drop a more open spacer structure is recommended 67 229 fig 17 shows a schematic of the red stack geometry 9 4 intermembrane distance achieving a low intermembrane distance is challenging which restricts commercial applications when real feedwater is used low intermembrane distance and high salinity feedwaters lead to an increase in the pumping power consumed compared with the power obtained through the system shown in fig 17 230 a low intermembrane distance reduces the electrical resistance in the feed compartments and consequently increases the power density a drawback of low intermembrane distances is the additional pretreatment needed to avoid fouling and the large hydraulic losses of the feedwater in the compartments hence to maintain low hydrodynamic losses this distance should not be too small the dilute water compartment thickness has a large portion of the stack resistance owing to its low conductivity therefore a higher performance is expected with a longer concentrated compartment intermembrane distance 12 41 67 230 moreno et al 230 proposed a new concept design i e a breathing cell with the physical movement of membranes that operate an red stack by changing the intermembrane distance over time this technique is a suitable option for systems compatible with real feedwaters that operate at a wide range of flow rates in this design the thickness of the compartment is the tunable frequency by compressing the river water compartments and expanding the seawater compartments reducing the thickness of the river water compartment decreases the stack resistance the advantages of breathing stacks include the low pumping power required low resistance and high net power densities 9 5 effect of flow direction co current or counter current operations seawater and river water streams exist in the same direction as the co current mode but the direction of the river or seawater flow is inverted as shown in fig 18 counter current and co current operations were investigated by veerman et al 36 on a large scale using 25 cells they yielded a slightly higher power density for co currency compared to that for a counter current flow owing to the existence of two counteracting effects on the power density in the co current operation mode the conductivity of the river water was low near the inlet however the nernst potential difference is maximal at this point resulting in a rather small current on the outlet side the conductivity of the river water compartment was higher but the nernst potential difference was lower which led to a relatively constant power density at each position in the cell furthermore internal deformation in the stack is crucial the pressures between the river and seawater compartments were very different in the counter current operation however the pressure between the river and seawater compartments is small in the co current mode therefore leakage through pinholes in the membranes and leakage around the membranes in the surroundings of the manifolds inside the stack is minimal very thin membranes and very open spacers with low hydrodynamic losses can be used in co current operation owing to the low pressure differences the hydrodynamic loss is also increased in the counter current operation owing to the high pressures difference between the river and seawater compartments consequently the co current mode is favorable for the design of large economical red stacks because of the higher power density minimum internal leakages and avoidance of local pressure differences easy modeling fast calculations 20 33 36 41 67 10 future perspectives and conclusions a new perspective of red and the advancement of the red technology involve extensive research on different aspects and categories such as new applications efficient membrane development novel hybrid applications economic feasibility of using river water and seawater and effective fouling management evidently a broad configurational variety of commercially available and newly developed products can be tested and optimized using the red fouling monitor to find solutions that are less susceptible to fouling 67 156 the increasing energy demand has led to increased attention to renewable energy sources sgp is a renewable resource extracted from mixing water streams with different salinities red is a common technique used to extract power based on salinity gradient in red systems iems are essential components that are required to have high permselectivity and low ionic resistance certain modification methods have been used to improve the properties of iems to obtain favorable properties these modification methods include the use of different nps carbon nanotubes and polymer blends and surface modification strategies several studies have investigated commercial cems and aems in the red process however typical commercially available iems are generally inappropriate for red nanoporous membranes pore filling iems and profiled membranes are different types of membranes used in the red process but they are currently in the early stages of development and far from commercialization in practical applications the use of natural water as an red source leads to fouling aems are more susceptible to fouling by natural organic matter and scaling occurs more frequently on cems fouling can be prevented by chemical and physical methods such as mechanical removal air sparging pretreatment of solutions periodic feedwater switching use of cleaning agents and membrane modification the operating parameters should be optimized to obtain high performance the hybrid process of red can improve the power density for red and lead to reduced capital costs for other technologies red can be combined with other technologies for water treatment production of potable water and weakening of brine discharge influence low power density lack of cost effective iems and membrane fouling are major problems that limit the commercialization of red declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this

filter paper coordination polymer grafting adsorption congo red 1 introduction coordination polymers cps are an important type of crystalline compound fabricated by connecting metal ion nodes and organic linkers 1 3 these porous compounds with well defined pores and structures have attained enormous interest because of their several utilizations e g separation 4 gas storage 5 6 catalysis 7 8 and sensing 9 recently remarkable concern in cps was directed to prominent efficiency as porous adsorbents for the effective removal of heavy metal ions and organic pollutants in the treatment of wastewater 10 13 the enormous ability of cps for such applications arises from the great number of various sorption sites suitable for interacting with adsorbate molecules 14 15 color wastewaters containing organic dyes has remarkably been produced by leather textile plastic printing and pharmaceutical industries the purification of industrial wastewaters containing organic dyes is a serious issue owing to their detrimental effects on the environment 16 18 various removal methods such as bio photodegradation photochemical and electrochemical procedures have been utilized for dye removal 19 22 nevertheless the adsorption technique for wastewater treatment is preferable due to its simple operation and high efficiency 23 25 in this regard cps with crystalline and porous structures are very good candidates for dye adsorption among various well known cps h2 bdc benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid based cps have special attraction because of their stability in water which is essential for water treatment 26 27 the combination of cps with other materials to produce improved hybrid compositions of cps with innovative properties is a hopeful strategy 28 31 the cps growth on the surface of various solids produces cp thin film which is particularly efficient in heterogeneous catalysis and separation technology 32 34 various inorganic materials such as silica magnetite metals and metal oxides have been used as solid substrates for growing cps 26 35 38 in addition flexible cp composites could be prepared on the surface of fabrics or combined with organic polymers 39 40 grafting cps to commercially inexpensive eco friendly and available solids furnishes an impressive procedure to improve their possible usages cellulose as the excellent solid support is a renewable broadly used and natural polymer that has a wide range of utilizations in biomedicine textile and filtration 41 43 however utilizing filter paper as a support for grafting cp to form flexible cp paper was reported in a few literature 34 44 47 hashem and his co workers reported immobilization of uio 66 nh2 on the filter paper as a substrate for cr vi and methyl orange removal from water 44 functionalization of filter paper by grafting the zif type metal organic framework mof reported by park was helpful in the organic dye elimination from water but without system optimization 45 furthermore some efforts have been made to immobilize cps on the cellulose aerogel as support 48 49 hence the combination of water stable bdc based cp onto flexible cellulose paper would prepare a facile fast and suitable approach to provide flexible coordination polymer for separating organic dyes from wastewater 50 51 herein we report a facile method for immobilizing the co cp nanoparticles through the strong chemical interactions with cellulose fibers of filter paper a uniform and compact co cp on the cellulose surface led to the preparation of a flexible and easily recoverable cfp co cp which can be recovered by simple decantation because of the compact coating the obtained cfp co cp indicates an effective congo red cr removal ability by rapid and simple filtration moreover all adsorption parameters such as ph adsorption doses and dye concentration have been investigated completely the prepared functionalized filter paper can be simply recovered and washed for further cycles 2 experimental the details of used materials and instrumentations have been included in the supplementary information 2 1 preparation of carboxylated filter paper cfp to functionalize filter paper with

discussion 3 1 characterization of carboxylated filter paper with co coordination polymer cfp co cp the commercially available cellulose based material filter paper fp was used as substrate and treated with chloroacetic acid to modify its hydroxyl functional groups oh to carboxylate groups coo the coo groups facilitate the initial connection of co2 ions to the filter paper surface thus the obtained carboxylated filter paper cfp is a very good precursor for the growth of coordination polymer resulting in the generation of co cp on the surface of filter paper filter paper coordination polymer cfp co cp composite was prepared by a layer by layer method and ten layers of coordination polymer were placed on the functionalized filter paper scheme 1 represents the carboxylation of fp using chloroacetate anions and a step by step functionalization by co2 and nh2 bdc several analyses were conducted to characterize how tightly the co cp was connected to the filter paper the growth of co cp on the surface of functionalized fp is elucidated by comparing the ft ir spectra fig 1 the ft ir spectra of the fp and cfp are completely similar so cfp was acidified by stirring for 1 h in 1 m hcl solution the acidified cfp h cfp shows a new band at 1732 cm 1 characteristic of the cooh group and confirming the successful functionalization of filter paper with ch2cooh groups the ft ir spectrum of cfp co cp indicated the co bound carboxylate group at 1565 and 1382 cm 1 related to asymmetric and symmetric stretching bonds of coo group thoroughly in accordance with co cp 52 54 two sharp peaks at 770 and 840 cm 1 related to c coo and car h bending vibrations of the nh2 bdc ligand are clearly seen in co cp and cfp co cp spectra 55 also all characteristic peaks of the fp were seen in the cfp co cp xrd patterns exhibited a clear proof for the generation of the co cp on the surface of the fp fig 2 obviously shows distinguished peaks at 9 47 11 52 16 92 18 52 29 52 and 41 62 in accordance with characteristic diffraction peaks of the co cp 56 as can be seen the characteristic peaks of fp are present in the xrd pattern of cfp co cp in fact the xrd pattern of the cfp co cp shows good agreement with the xrd patterns of the co cp and fp the chemical composition of cfp co cp was explored by energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy as shown in fig 3 cfp co cp is composed of c o n co and na which confirmed the elemental composition of co cp on the fp the presence of a small amount of na is a result of incomplete coordination of coo to co2 ion cfp co cp elemental mapping images also exhibit uniform dispersion of co cp nanoparticles on the surface of filter paper as demonstrated by the monotone observation of the cobalt and nitrogen atoms in the cfp co cp the icp oes analysis also approved the existence of 2 6 co in the cfp co cp as can be seen in the scanning electron microscopy sem image fig 4a filter paper consists of microfibers with a nearly smooth surface compared to the smooth surface of fp the surface of cfp co cp fig 4b is rougher because co cp nanoparticles are compactly and uniformly immobilized on the fp due to the presence of the carboxyl groups so the perfect decoration of the co cp nanoparticles is seen on the surface of fp microfibers x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was carried out to study the valence states and surface chemical composition of the cfp co cp fig 5 xps survey spectrum indicates the existence of c o n and co in the cfp co cp the high resolution xps spectrum of c 1s is deconvoluted to three sub peaks centered at 284 5 285 8 and 288 1 ev the band at 284 5 ev correlates to cc in the cellulose unites of the filter paper the band at 285 8 ev related to cc resulted from the nh2 bdc aromatic ring 57 58 the co carbons of the nh2 bdc linker are seen at the binding energy of 288 1 ev 59 the deconvoluted xps spectrum of o 1s indicated two peaks at binding energies of 531 5 and 533 5 ev the former corresponds to the co bond present in the filter paper while the latter at 533 5 ev is due to the coo bond in co cp 59 60 deconvolution of the n 1s high resolution profile reveals three peaks existing at 398 5 400 and 401 7 ev owing to the presence of different environments such as surface located amine groups bulk amine groups and probably protonated amine groups 61 the presence of two distinct cobalt signals in the xps spectrum of the cfp co cp at 780 4 co 2p3 2 and 795 7 ev co 2p1 2 verified the successful functionalization of filter paper with co cp the appearance of two distinct satellite peaks at 784 8 ev for co 2p3 2 and 800 6 ev for co 2p1 2 confirm that the co species are essentially in the co2 state 62 the thermal stability and loading percentage of the co cp on the surface of filter paper were estimated from the thermogravimetric analysis tga fig 6 the fp and cfp co cp are stable up to 270 280 c and thermal degradation is started after that until burning all organic species the relative percentage of chemisorbed co cp on the cfp surface was evaluated from tga curves as the tga curve of fp depicted at the final stage of thermal treatment only 0 44 of residue remained in return the tga curve of cfp co cp represents a larger amount 6 49 of residue at the final stage of thermal treatment due to the production of cobalt oxide 63 64 metal oxide formation after calcination of the coordination polymer is exactly well known according to the tga curves the loading percentage of the co cp on the surface of filter paper is calculated 19 for cfp co cp 45 3 2 dye adsorption after successful functionalization of filter paper to prepare cfp co cp the obtained composite was utilized as an adsorbent to evaluate its performance in the uptake of organic dyes cr and mb from aqueous solutions cfp co cp was tested for cr and mb uptake by soaking the defined amount of crushed cfp co cp in the aqueous solutions of the dyes at room temperature and the concentration of solution was monitored by uv vis spectroscopy at the specified times fig 7a illustrates that the unmodified filter paper cannot uptake a large amount of cr even after 60 min on the other hand the concentration of mb decreases slowly during the contact time and removal efficiency reaches 59 after 24 h unlike mb the adsorption experiment for cr uptake by cfp co cp is more efficient and removal efficiency reaches 92 after 24 h fading the color of cr solution during the time is easily observable and the final solution is nearly colorless inset of fig 7 the zeta potential of cfp co cp in neutral ph is positive ζ 3 7 mv so it is a better adsorbent for cr uptake through electrostatic attraction a control test was sketched utilizing cfp without co cp coating for adsorbing mb and cr the obtained results fig s1 demonstrated the remarkable ability of cfp to adsorb mb whereas cr could not be completely adsorbed by cfp even after 24 h the cfp with a negative charge ζ 16 3 mv in neutral ph has no appropriate interaction with negatively charged cr and could efficiently uptake positively charged mb hence it can be concluded that the cr is a better target for considering its adsorption by cfp co cp as demonstrated above the prepared composite adsorbed both cationic and anionic dyes with more efficiency for anionic congo red some factors are responsible for the removal of dyes electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding and π π interaction 65 66 the obtained results show the importance of electrostatic interaction for the full removal of anionic congo red by the cationic adsorbent in the subsequent study cr was chosen to investigate the effect of ph dye concentration and the dose of cfp co cp based on the prior studies the uptake mechanism of anionic dyes utilizing cp is extremely controlled by electrostatic attractions 67 68 therefore the ph of solution can remarkably affect the removal efficiency evident color change at various ph values has been observed due to the resonance structures of cr molecule 69 at ph 5 12 the color of cr solution is red with a maximum absorption peak at 500 nm which shifts to 573 nm in blue cr solution at ph 2 5 the removal efficiency of cfp co cp under various ph values 2 12 is seen in fig 8a as can be seen in acidic ph range ph 2 4 the cr removal performance enhances with increasing the ph value where a negligible change in removal efficiency of cr occurs at the alkaline range and the ph has not an essential role in the cr uptake in this range therefore the neutral ph is the best for cr uptake by cfp co cp the anionic cr gains a negative charge above its pka 4 1 and remains in the neutral form below pka so at ph pka the electrostatic attraction between the anionic cr and the positive surface charge of the cfp co cp is responsible fig 8b illustrates the cr uptake as a function of cfp co cp dosage the removal efficiency enhanced continuously by increasing the cfp co cp dosage at the early time because of more available sites at the surface of adsorbent however with increasing time contact the r seems nearly equal for various cfp co cp dosages 70 according to fig 8c the equilibrium amount qe of the captured cr increased from 18 57 to 56 64 mg g 1 as the initial concentration of the cr increased from 20 to 60 mg l 1 with increasing cr concentration the dye diffusion speeds up from solution into cfp co cp due to the enhanced driving force of the concentration gradient 70 the kinetics of the cr uptake by cfp co cp was considered via pseudo first order fig s2 and pseudo second order fig 8d models based on the below equations 71 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and qe are the amounts of adsorbed dye mg g at equilibrium and at t time min respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the pseudo first and second order equilibrium rate constants respectively both models were exerted to compare with attained experimental data of 20 40 and 60 ppm cr tests table 1 demonstrates the experimental and calculated kinetic parameters and obtained error functions as can be seen the calculated q values from the pseudo second order matched obviously with the experimental results and more favorably represented the kinetic of the cr uptake on the cfp co cp 70 72 moreover the error functions indicate that pseudo first order model is not fit in the adsorption data it can be seen that the pseudo second order fits the data better than pseudo first order model to evaluate the cr uptake mechanism by cfp co cp freundlich and langmuir models were applied it is assumed that in the freundlich model the heterogeneous sites with non uniform distribution are responsible for adsorption while in the langmuir model homogeneous sites are responsible 73 the linear form of freundlich 7 and langmuir 8 models are given by the following equations 73 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 8 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max where ce mg l qe mg g and qmax mg g are the dye concentration at equilibrium adsorption capacity at equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity respectively kf mg g and kl l mg are freundlich and langmuir constants respectively 1 n l g is correlated to adsorption intensity based on regression coefficient r2 sum square error sse and average relative error are values of the linear plots of freundlich fig 8e and langmuir fig s3 isotherms the uptake of cr on the cfp co cp adsorbent followed the freundlich isotherm model table 2 the obtained results offer a heterogeneous and multilayer adsorption process covering the cr on the surface of cfp co cp the ft ir spectra of cfp co cp after uptake of cr are indicated in fig s4 no obvious change is seen in these spectra unless the appearance of the n n and so3 peaks as characteristic groups of the cr suggesting the involvement of physisorption in cr adsorption by cfp co cp as approved with acquired results of freundlich isotherm molavi et al reported a similar trend for methyl orange uptake on uio 66 74 finally cfp co cp was easily recovered after the uptake process through simple decanting and soxhlet washing with distilled water for 24 h the xrd pattern fig s5 and ft ir spectrum fig 9 of the recovered cfp co cp are in well accordance with fresh cfp co cp approving high stability and good recoverability the reusability study of cfp co cp was carried out by comparing the removal efficiency of fresh cfp co cp with reused cfp co cp after four successive adsorption desorption cycles it was observed that the removal performance of cfp co cp after the fourth cycle lost lower than 15 demonstrating the good recyclability of cfp co cp 3 3 congo red uptake by simple filtration utilizing cfp co cp for simple filtration complete not crushed cfp co cp was located in a conical funnel and 10 ml of the 10 ppm cr solution was poured into the funnel the red color of the congo red solution immediately changes to colorless during filtration fig 10 therefore it is clearly observed that congo red is fruitfully uptaken by simple filtration more than 90 fig 9 clearly approves the complete disappearance of the red color of the cr solution after filtration shi and co workers reported cmp uio 66 as a kind of cp paper to uptake various concentrations of mb for 10 mg l mb solution 92 removal efficiency was seen in the presence of cmp uio 66 46 in another report the preparation of cu mofs cmfp was reported with 10 20 30 and 40 layers cu mofs for removal of 10 mg ml mb rhb and mg the results showed that the dye removal reaches above 45 using cu mofs cmfp with only 10 layers of cu mof assembly 47 so the prepared cfp co cp in this work showed high and comparable removal efficiency which introduced it as a promising adsorbent for removal of cr from aqueous solution 4 conclusion modification of fp surface by free carboxylate groups conducted the seeding and subsequent growing of the co nh2 bdc coordination polymer to prepare cp coated filter paper cfp co cp the obtained flexible cfp co cp composite was positively charged and efficiently uptake more than 92 of negatively charged congo red grafting of co nh2 bdc onto commercially in expensive eco

filter paper coordination polymer grafting adsorption congo red 1 introduction coordination polymers cps are an important type of crystalline compound fabricated by connecting metal ion nodes and organic linkers 1 3 these porous compounds with well defined pores and structures have attained enormous interest because of their several utilizations e g separation 4 gas storage 5 6 catalysis 7 8 and sensing 9 recently remarkable concern in cps was directed to prominent efficiency as porous adsorbents for the effective removal of heavy metal ions and organic pollutants in the treatment of wastewater 10 13 the enormous ability of cps for such applications arises from the great number of various sorption sites suitable for interacting with adsorbate molecules 14 15 color wastewaters containing organic dyes has remarkably been produced by leather textile plastic printing and pharmaceutical industries the purification of industrial wastewaters containing organic dyes is a serious issue owing to their detrimental effects on the environment 16 18 various removal methods such as bio photodegradation photochemical and electrochemical procedures have been utilized for dye removal 19 22 nevertheless the adsorption technique for wastewater treatment is preferable due to its simple operation and high efficiency 23 25 in this regard cps with crystalline and porous structures are very good candidates for dye adsorption among various well known cps h2 bdc benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid based cps have special attraction because of their stability in water which is essential for water treatment 26 27 the combination of cps with other materials to produce improved hybrid compositions of cps with innovative properties is a hopeful strategy 28 31 the cps growth on the surface of various solids produces cp thin film which is particularly efficient in heterogeneous catalysis and separation technology 32 34 various inorganic materials such as silica magnetite metals and metal oxides have been used as solid substrates for growing cps 26 35 38 in addition flexible cp composites could be prepared on the surface of fabrics or combined with organic polymers 39 40 grafting cps to commercially inexpensive eco friendly and available solids furnishes an impressive procedure to improve their possible usages cellulose as the excellent solid support is a renewable broadly used and natural polymer that has a wide range of utilizations in biomedicine textile and filtration 41 43 however utilizing filter paper as a support for grafting cp to form flexible cp paper was reported in a few literature 34 44 47 hashem and his co workers reported immobilization of uio 66 nh2 on the filter paper as a substrate for cr vi and methyl orange removal from water 44 functionalization of filter paper by grafting the zif type metal organic framework mof reported by park was helpful in the organic dye elimination from water but without system optimization 45 furthermore some efforts have been made to immobilize cps on the cellulose aerogel as support 48 49 hence the combination of water stable bdc based cp onto flexible cellulose paper would prepare a facile fast and suitable approach to provide flexible coordination polymer for separating organic dyes from wastewater 50 51 herein we report a facile method for immobilizing the co cp nanoparticles through the strong chemical interactions with cellulose fibers of filter paper a uniform and compact co cp on the cellulose surface led to the preparation of a flexible and easily recoverable cfp co cp which can be recovered by simple decantation because of the compact coating the obtained cfp co cp indicates an effective congo red cr removal ability by rapid and simple filtration moreover all adsorption parameters such as ph adsorption doses and dye concentration have been investigated completely the prepared functionalized filter paper can be simply recovered and washed for further cycles 2 experimental the details of used materials and instrumentations have been included in the supplementary information 2 1 preparation of carboxylated filter paper cfp to functionalize filter paper with

methanol and dried under vacuum 2 3 dye adsorption and reusability adsorption measurements were accomplished to explore the removal performance of cfp and cfp co cp toward the congo red cr and methylene blue mb for each test the crushed cfp or cfp co cp was added to the dye solution in a 100 ml round bottomed flask the uptake experiments for cr were carried out at various ph 6 12 cfp co cp

the uptake of cr on the cfp co cp adsorbent followed the freundlich isotherm model table 2 the obtained results offer a heterogeneous and multilayer adsorption process covering the cr on the surface of cfp co cp the ft ir spectra of cfp co cp after uptake of cr are indicated in fig s4 no obvious change is seen in these spectra unless the appearance of the n n and so3 peaks as characteristic groups of the cr suggesting the involvement of physisorption in cr adsorption by cfp co cp as approved with acquired results of freundlich isotherm molavi et al reported a similar trend for methyl orange uptake on uio 66 74 finally cfp co cp was easily recovered after the uptake process through simple decanting and soxhlet washing with distilled water for 24 h the xrd pattern fig s5 and ft ir spectrum fig 9 of the recovered cfp co cp are in well accordance with fresh cfp co cp approving high stability and good recoverability the reusability study of cfp co cp was carried out by comparing the removal efficiency of fresh cfp co cp with reused cfp co cp after four successive adsorption desorption cycles it was observed that the removal performance of cfp co cp after the fourth cycle lost lower than 15 demonstrating the good recyclability of cfp co cp 3 3 congo red uptake by simple filtration utilizing cfp co cp for simple filtration complete not crushed cfp co cp was located in a conical funnel and 10 ml of the 10 ppm cr solution was poured into the funnel the red color of the congo red solution immediately changes to colorless during filtration fig 10 therefore it is clearly observed that congo red is fruitfully uptaken by simple filtration more than 90 fig 9 clearly approves the complete disappearance of the red color of the cr solution after filtration shi and co workers reported cmp uio 66 as a kind of cp paper to uptake various concentrations of mb for 10 mg l mb solution 92 removal efficiency was seen in the presence of cmp uio 66 46 in another report the preparation of cu mofs cmfp was reported with 10 20 30 and 40 layers cu mofs for removal of 10 mg ml mb rhb and mg the results showed that the dye removal reaches above 45 using cu mofs cmfp with only 10 layers of cu mof assembly 47 so the prepared cfp co cp in this work showed high and comparable removal efficiency which introduced it as a promising adsorbent for removal of cr from aqueous solution 4 conclusion modification of fp surface by free carboxylate groups conducted the seeding and subsequent growing of the co nh2 bdc coordination polymer to prepare cp coated filter paper cfp co cp the obtained flexible cfp co cp composite was positively charged and efficiently uptake more than 92 of negatively charged congo red grafting of co nh2 bdc onto commercially in expensive eco friendly and available support led to rapid effective and simple water treatment with anticipated applicability and efficiency in other fields such as sensing drug delivery and catalysis which profit
