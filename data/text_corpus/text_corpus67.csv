335,virtual water flow can alleviate the pressure of regional water resources differences in water resources endowment and industrial structure among regions cause regional differences in water use in china water use in agriculture especially irrigation heavily relies on both surface water and groundwater virtual water flow may have different influence on the utilization and exploitation of regional surface water and groundwater however few studies have separately investigated the impacts of virtual water transfer on them according to virtual water theory contribution rate and regional differences this study evaluates the effects of virtual water flow on water resources among provinces in china the results indicate most regions mainly rely on surface water that accounts for less than 50 of surface water supply in only four provinces namely hebei henan beijing and shanxi in the northern region and mainly in north china the dependence on groundwater is very high the total virtual water flow in china increased from 75 8 gm³ in 1998 to 124 6 gm³ in 2014 and showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions given the decrease in the scale of virtual water export the decline of groundwater level in north china is not further aggravated water saving irrigation is the main method to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use the results of the study can aid in improving the sustainability of surface water and groundwater management in the grain production process via identifying dominant areas keywords virtual water flow groundwater resources surface water resources china 1 introduction water is one of the world s most important fundamental natural resources in terms of quantity and quality that is critical for human and environmental development mattos et al 2018 although water use and consumption is facing unsustainable levels for example steffen et al 2015 proposed the planetary boundary to assess global freshwater use and thought it to be well below a corresponding planetary boundary and jaramillo and destouni 2015a found global consumptive use of freshwater has overpassed the corresponding planetary boundary global freshwater also would increasingly be a fundamental limiting factor in feeding the world rockström and karlberg 2010 furthermore water is a basic resource in grain production which accounts for more than 70 of the global water withdrawal jiang et al 2017 as the world s most populous country water scarcity and grain security in china has attracted significant attention due to its rapid economic development and population growth zhang et al 2013 dong et al 2014 wang et al 2014 sun et al 2019a agricultural production which is both resource provider and consumer consumes a significant amount of water and cultivated land resources while providing production and living materials campbell et al 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2015b highlighted the global impact of local water use activities such as human controlled flow regulation and irrigation therefore in some regions water use is exceeding sustainable levels rosa et al 2018 due to the difference in the geographical distribution of water resources those in south china are obviously higher than those in north china and water availability varies considerably across provinces and regions in china dong et al 2014 for example northern china accounts for 57 of land resources and uses 19 1 of total water resources to satisfy water demand for 45 2 of country s population zhang and anadon 2014 cai et al 2017 currently 14 9 of the total rivers and 26 1 of all lakes present water quality that cannot be used for any purpose cmwr 2014 this geographic mismatch between cultivated land and water has led to unsustainable agricultural expansion in arid regions further supported by the objective of grain self sufficiency zhuo et al 2016 mattos et al 2018 local water problems cannot be only treated locally as virtual water flows between regions can redistribute water resources and discharge cai et al 2017 therefore the mismatch between supply and demand caused by the difference between grain production and consumption among regions results in the flow of grain which will have different effects on water resources previous studies have shown that more than half the country s population are supported with only 20 of the country s water resources guan and hubacek 2007 dong et al 2014 following the economic reform and opening up that commenced in 1978 the southeast region experienced rapid increase in its urban population and acceleration of industrialization process the demand for industrial and other types of land increased zhang et al 2016 the increase in the total population and decrease in the scale of agricultural production in southern regions increased the scale of grain production and consumption of agricultural water in northern regions overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation is an important challenge that affects the sustainable socioeconomic development in the water scarce northern region with significant adverse effects on the environment and ecosystems through the drying of rivers and land subsidence among other reasons foster et al 2004 zheng et al 2010 zhang and anadon 2014 porkka et al 2017 the optimal allocation of water resources is the basis for rational development and utilization of water resources and the fundamental guarantee for the sustainable utilization of water resources however the natural temporal and spatial distribution of regional water resources is not suitable for distribution of productivity and a significant competition in water use exists between regions and various water use departments finally there are many ecological and environmental problems due to improper development and utilization of water resources and thus it is more urgent to implement the rational allocation of water resources most of the traditional water resources allocation is through the construction of water transfer projects to alleviate the pressure of water resources in water shortage areas if combined with the virtual water allocation of the region will achieve more obvious results therefore from the perspective of commodity trade to solve the shortage of water resources allan 2003 it is helpful to understand the impact of virtual water flow on groundwater versus surface water in different regions virtual water was first defined by allan 1993 and corresponds to the volume of water necessary for the production of a commodity virtual water strategy is mainly used to set policies to improve water use efficiency on different scales over the past decade there are a lot of studies focusing on virtual water to explore the trade development on water resources at different scales hoekstra and hung 2002 ma et al 2006 d odorico et al 2012 tamea et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 duarte et al 2016 brindha and k 2017 sun et al 2019b referring to international trade dalin et al 2017 showed that approximately 11 of non renewable groundwater use for irrigation is embedded in international food trade and while 18 of global crop production is traded internationally kumar and singh 2005 compared the virtual water trade in 146 countries and explained that some water shortage regions are net exporters at the national level zhao et al 2019 noted that virtual water trade runs from china s water scarce north to its south from less developed to more developed areas and runs against water availability which is unsustainable to water resources system sun et al 2013 evaluated the virtual water content of grain in china in 2009 feng et al 2014 have considered how changes in the balance of virtual water flow affects provincial water use given provincial water scarcity given the imbalance of grain supply and demand among different regions of china virtual water accompanying the transfer of grain in the region formed a pattern that flows from the water scarce northern region to the water abundant southern region and produced many accompanying effects sun et al 2019a 2019b virtual water usually flows from water poor regions to water rich regions and from regions with high water use efficiency for grain production to regions with low water use efficiency in china wang et al 2014 there were also studies on regional and special districts and river basins such as hetao irrigation district and yellow river basin more than 90 of the virtual water flows in the hetao irrigation district originated from counties with lower water stress and was transferred to those with higher water stress the export of virtual water fluctuated but tended to increase in the hetao irrigation district liu et al 2015 some studies indicated that the interaction between the hydrological process of production and the socio economic system should be simultaneously considered in water scarce areas to solve the problem of local water shortage cai and rosegrant et al 2002 cui et al 2018 thus it is of significant value to evaluate the suitability of virtual water strategy for the sustainable management of water resources in water shortage regions and especially in drought prone areas d odorico et al 2010 marston and konar 2017 extant studies on the impact of virtual water flow on water resources tend to focus only on the static state of a single year as opposed to dynamic characteristics and trends of long time series additionally most previous studies were performed only at the overall level of water resources without considering the differences in water resources utilization between regions for example schyns and hoekstra 2014 and marston et al 2018 represent two studies that evaluate spatial differences in surface water and groundwater consumption within a country morocco and usa respectively which provide us a new perspective to analyze the virtual flow of china for china a country with uneven distribution of water resources and significant regional differences the study only on the overall level of water resources undoubtedly ignores the effect of regional differences in water resources endowment and water use efficiency therefore an examination of surface water and groundwater utilization between provinces and regions more realistically reflects water resource problems faced by various regions in china according to the difference of water resources endowment in different regions based on the regional grain virtual water flow in china this study analyzes the influence of virtual water flow on regional surface water and groundwater which previous studies have rarely involved to fill this observation gap we analyzed national agricultural surface water and groundwater use from 1998 to 2014 then we quantified long time series of virtual water flow embedded in grain from the results we further explored the impact of grain virtual water on regional surface water and groundwater which provides a certain reference for regional water resources evaluation and management and establishing sustainable virtual water flows pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area of this study is mainland china taiwan hong kong and macao are excluded because of a lack of data the area consists of 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipal cities these provinces are classified into eight regions according to their geographic location and their conditions of weather water resources and grain production fig 1 2 2 data the data required for the study include social statistics agricultural production statistics meteorological data and water resources data from 31 provincial administrative regions in mainland china from 1997 to 2014 social statistics data is mainly related to the population agricultural statistics data is mainly related to grain wheat corn and rice production such as the sown area of grain grain production and per capita grain production fertilizer use and irrigation water the social statistics data and agricultural data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook csy 1997 2015 the meteorological data used in the study including temperature precipitation and wind speed were obtained from the cmdc china meteorological data service center 2020 total water resources surface water and groundwater and water use data surface water and groundwater were obtained from the china water resources bulletin 1997 2014 chinese ministry of water resources cmwr 1997 2014 2 3 method 2 3 1 calculation of water use for grain production the mismatch of grain supply and demand among regions is the main driving force of grain trade and consequently virtual water flow food security in china indicated the grain self sufficiency rate exceeds 95 in china and realizes the basic self sufficiency of grain fsy 2019 yang 2019 therefore the study does not consider the impact of international grain trade this research is also based on the following assumptions firstly the social equity law that is the differences in consumption among the regions were not taken into account assuming that there is no difference in consumption so that consumption can be approximately assessed with the per capita grain share secondly it is assumed that the annual grain reserves remain unchanged that is the consumption of grain produced in that year not considering the replenishment of grain reserves and the conversion of grain into feed and so on the virtual water flow related to grain for each region is calculated annually as follows sun et al 2016 1 f t i p o p i p i p o p i p n p o p n where fti denotes the net transfer volume of grain in region i if fti 0 it denotes grain export kg while fti 0

groundwater use data this study assumes that agricultural water use surface water versus groundwater ratio is the same as overall all sectors combined surface water versus groundwater ratio which can be derived from real statistic data at province level and this ratio is uniform throughout the irrigation district for all grains the surface water and groundwater withdrawl in agriculture are calculated as follow 15 s a w u a w u s w u w u where sawu represents surface water withdrawl in agriculture gm³ awu denotes agricultural water use gm³ swu represents total surface water withdrawal

between 343 6 gm³ 2002 and 392 2 gm³ 2013 the proportion of national agricultural water use over the national total water use generally showed a slight downward trend from about 69 1998 to about 63 2014 due to the differences in industrial structure and water resource endowments among regions the changes both in agricultural water use and in its proportion over regional total water use showed great spatial differences among the studied provincial administrative areas for instance the amount of agricultural water use in most export areas showed an increasing trend from 1998 to 2014 while the agricultural water use in import areas showed a decreasing trend in terms of the proportion of regional agricultural water use over the regional total water use it was generally low in the east and central china yet high in the west meanwhile it showed a decreasing trend in most provincial administrative regions with the exception of liaoning heilongjiang gansu qinghai and tibet taking heilongjiang one of china s main grain producing area as an example both agricultural water use and its proportion in this region showed a clear upward trend from 21 1 gm³ 1998 to 31 6 gm³ 2014 and from 72 6 1998 to 86 8 2014 respectively the agricultural water use in the south and the north accounted for 45 and 55 of the total agricultural water use respectively this study used water footprint of grain to characterize the temporal and spatial evolution of water use in grain production in china from 1998 to 2014 the results found that the total water footprint sum of green and blue water footprints of grain in china generally showed a decreasing trend from 752 6 gm³ in 1998 to 680 0 gm³ in 2014 in specific the national blue water footprint of grain showed a decreasing trend while the green water footprint showed a fluctuating trend however changes of grain water footprint at regional scale showed great spatial difference for instance contrary trends were observed in heilongjiang increasing and hebei decreasing heilongjiang s blue and green water footprints both showed an increasing trend mainly due to the increasing in the use of blue water fig 2 while increasing the use of surface water the dependence on groundwater of heilongjiang has also showed a significant increase consequently the blue water footprint in heilongjiang increased from 7 6 gm³ in 1998 to 15 9 gm³ in 2014 by contrast water footprint of grain in hebei showed a decreasing trend declining from 13 3 gm³ 1998 to 8 3 gm³ 2014 groundwater is the main water source in agricultural production in hebei the decrease of groundwater footprint in this region implied that the agricultural water pressure in the region has been eased to a certain extent to our surprise the northern region relied more on the green water than the southern region did although there was more green water available precipitation in the south the sources of agricultural blue water supply in different regions are closely related to the distribution of surface water and groundwater in other words agricultural production in the southern region mainly depends on surface water whereas it heavily depends on groundwater in the northern region for example agricultural groundwater use in hebei and tianjin significantly exceeded the use of surface water specifically their agricultural groundwater use is 1 1 times and 2 2 times of the agricultural surface water use respectively the proportion of groundwater supply in xinjiang inner mongolia jilin henan and other provinces exhibited an increasing trend during the study period the amount of agricultural blue water in ningxia and tianjin is 8 4 times and 1 2 times of its water resources respectively which is largely caused by the external water resources supplied by yellow river and the south to north water transfer project 3 2 grain transfer in export and import region as a result of the intensification of the imbalance between grain supply and demand among regions the total amount of grain transportation showed a continuous increasing trend in china during the study period the amount of grain transportation increased from 51 24 mt in 1998 to 116 55 mt in 2014 fig 3 shows the proportion of grain exported in the export areas to their own grain production in 1998 and 2014 and also the proportion of grain imported in import areas to their own grain consumption it was found that the direction of grain transportation basically showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions the grain production of the most grain export regions showed an obvious upward trend during the study period similarly the proportion of grain exported also showed an increasing trend in these regions in addition the role of a certain region in being an export area or an import area showed a dynamic transition for instance gansu and jiangxi were import areas in 1998 but become export areas in 2014 whereas jiangsu hubei and liaoning switched from export areas in 1998 to import areas in 2014 as shown in fig 3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain exported meanwhile it is also one of the provinces with the largest increasing rate of grain production grain production in heilongjiang increased from 30 09 mt in 1998 to 62 42 mt in 2014 along with the increase of its grain production the proportion of grain exported accounting for the grain production in heilongjiang also showed a significant increase from 47 89 to 72 64 contrary to heilongjiang guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain imported meanwhile its grain production decreased from 19 48 mt in 1998 to 13 57 mt in 2014 therefore guangdong is increasingly dependent on grain imported from other regions in fact the proportion of grain imported accounting for the total grain consumption in this region increased from 34 39 1998 to 71 60 2014 in 2014 the annual amount of grain transferred to beijing shanghai and tianjin accounted for the largest proportion of their consumption and corresponded to 93 3 89 6 and 74 respectively with respect to the export area the proportion of grain transferred from heilongjiang to its grain yield increased from 57 2 in 1997 to 72 6 in 2014 the proportion of grain exported from inner mongolia and jilin is also very high and reached 59 5 and 65 3 of the grain yield in 2014 fig 3 3 3 influence of virtual water flow on water resources based on the regional grain transfer 1998 2014 the study also analyzed the embedded grain virtual water flow in china although the role of some regions in being the export or import areas transformed in the research period 1998 2014 the total virtual water flow in china increased from 75 8 gm³ in 1998 to 124 6 gm³ in 2014 in specific the total green virtual water flow increased from 45 7 gm³ 1998 to 74 2 gm³ 2014 while the blue virtual water flow increased from 30 1 gm³ 1998 to 50 4 gm³ 2014 meanwhile this study furtherly divided the blue water into surface water and groundwater to investigate water utilization and exploitation similar to the change of blue virtual water flow both the virtual surface water flow and the virtual groundwater flow increased during 1998 to 2014 from 20 1 gm³ to 29 9 gm³ and from 10 0 gm³ to 20 5 gm³ respectively fig 4 showed the temporal and spatial variation patterns of virtual water flow among provinces in 1998 and 2014 as an explanation we took changes of virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong as examples as one of the most typical and largest virtual water export area heilongjiang exported more virtual water in 2014 58 8 gm³ than in 1998 25 0 gm³ showing an obvious increasing trend in virtual water export along with the increase in virtual water export the proportion of virtual water export in heilongjiang also increased from 33 0 to 47 2 specifically the export of virtual surface water increased from 4 1 gm³ to 13 5 gm³ accounting for 20 5 and 45 3 and the export of virtual groundwater increased from 3 7 gm³ to 11 6 gm³ accounting for 36 6 and 56 4 contrary to heilongjiang guangdong is one of the largest virtual water import provinces the imported virtual water increased from 15 1 gm³ in 1998 accounting for 19 9 of the total virtual water flow to 36 6 gm³ in 2014 accounting for 29 3 of the total virtual water the virtual surface water transferred from jilin heilongjiang and inner mongolia accounts for a large proportion of agricultural surface water and shows an increasing trend virtual water transfer into beijing tianjin and shanghai has played an evident role in alleviating the pressure of local water resources the virtual water transferred into beijing tianjin and shanghai is significantly larger than the total amount of local water resources which is approximately 3 times 4 5 times and 2 4 times of the local water resources respectively this phenomenon is associated with a larger population and a smaller amount of water resources because of its small administrative area without the flows of virtual water the pressure on water resources in the northern groundwater areas will be relatively alleviated mainly due to changes in the surface and groundwater including the extent of exploitation of water resources in 2014 the national per capita share of grain was 445 54 kg the population of the northern region was 573 16 million and the grain production of the northern region was 338 35 mt if there is no grain virtual water flow the northern region will meet its own real grain demand by 255 36 mt the northern region would reduce 82 99 mt grain production and that would reduce the export of grain virtual water by 87 0 gm³ however the amount of water resources used in agricultural production in the southern region will increase which will have a certain impact on the local production pattern and economic income and even further affect the national economic income pattern 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic variation in surface water and groundwater in typical areas based on the study grain production and water resources distribution in china are seriously mismatched the southern region possesses more than 80 of the country s water resources while the northern region possesses less than 20 surface water and groundwater accounted for 76 5 and 23 5 of total available water resources in china respectively the proportion of surface water in the south is generally higher than that in the north southwest china has the highest total amount of water resources mainly tibet and the surface water and groundwater contents are also the highest fig 5 the total amount of water resources in north china corresponds to the smallest and the only area with a surface water ratio of less than 50 45 the total amount of water resources in the northwest is slightly higher than that in the rest of the north ningxia possesses the lowest proportion of surface water 25 and chongqing the highest 85 north china plain and the huang huai hai region are important grain production bases and grain export areas in china the amount of water resources per capita in the north china plain is only 456 m³ year which is less than 1 6 of that of the whole country the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water is uneven and groundwater is an important support for the sustainable development of economy and society in north china plain the groundwater exploitation in shijiazhuang beijing xingtai handan baoding hengshui langfang tangshan and other cities has accounted for more than 70 of the total water supply due to the overexploitation of groundwater for many years the north china plain has become the largest cone region in the world the results of a study indicated that the composite groundwater cones in the north china plain including shallow and deep cone covers an area of 73 288 km2 and accounted for 52 6 of the total area zhang et al 2009 for the recovery of funnel area many researchers have thought of sealing wells that is the exploitation of groundwater is prohibited however it is almost impossible to abandon the use of groundwater in the north china plain where the water resources per capita are only 15 of the national average and less than 4 of the world s level in the study the variation in groundwater storage in the plain of 16 provincial administrative regions in the north of china in 2014 was showed comparison of data at the end of 2013 and 2014 fig 6 with the exception of henan and anhui the groundwater storage in the vast majority of virtual water export areas is decreased wherein hebei liaoning and shandong decreased their groundwater reserves by 5 31 gm³ 1 66 gm³ and 1 25 gm³ respectively this study took hebei province located in the north of north china plain as an example the average annual precipitation is 529 1 mm the water resources per capita and water resources per unit area only account for 11 18 and 9 13 of the national average hebei is a typical irrigated grain producing province because of the lack of surface water resources irrigation mainly depends on the extraction of groundwater statistical data at the end of 2016 indicated that the area of irrigated cultivated land in hebei province was 4129 12 kha including 601 92 kha of cultivated land with sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and seepage irrigation facilities cmwr chinese ministry of water resources 2017 among the main sources of irrigation water the use of groundwater accounts for 88 32 and the surface water accounts for only 11 68 therefore hebei is one of the most significant contradictions between supply and demand of water resources in china from 1997 to 2014 the amount of groundwater used in hebei province was larger than that of local groundwater resources and the amount of groundwater used was 1 42 times of that of water supply cmwr 1998 2014 unreasonable exploitation and overuse of groundwater significantly affect water resources and ecological environment in hebei province such as insufficient groundwater recharge cone and deterioration of the ecological environment during the study period the virtual water export of hebei exhibited a downward trend although it has always been the export province of grain virtual water and accounts for 2 27 of the agricultural water consumption along with the decrease of the export of grain virtual water the use of groundwater for agriculture in hebei decreased from 13 3 gm³ to 8 3 gm³ assuming that if there was no grain export from hebei in 2014 hebei would reduce 0 70 mt of grain production correspondingly reducing the use of groundwater by 0 17 gm³ at the same time if hebei reduced grain production and chose to import grain from other regions to satisfy local grain demand it would further alleviate groundwater pressure however heilongjiang liaoning and jilin are also in the northern region and their groundwater storage variables also exhibit a downward trend therefore the unsustainable virtual water flow increases the threat to water resources and environment of the export area 4 2 analysis of the influence of virtual water flow virtual water flow corresponds to the redistribution of virtual water in geographical space which significantly affects regional water resources and environment from 1997 to 2014 the total amount of water resources did not significantly change and the change in water resources between the north and the south evidently varied with time during the study period the amount of virtual water flow in china exhibited an evident increasing trend and displayed the trend of transferring from the central and northern water shortage areas to the southern water rich area ma et al 2006 and zhao et al 2015 got similar results and indicated that the current grain virtual water flow is unsustainable moreover some study found virtual water flow only alleviates water scarcity in importing wealthy countries while it has limited effects on water scarcity alleviation in poorer countries distefano and kelly 2017 for the grain export area and import area the virtual water flow significantly affected the exploitation distribution and use of its water resources especially on the virtual water export area since 1990 grain production in the north region exceeded that in the south region forming a grain transportation from the north to the south grain production necessitates the consumption of a considerable amount of water and thus grain transportation from the north to the south acts as a conduit of virtual water resources from the water scarce north to the water rich south in 2010 the amount of water transferred to the south with the transportation of grain from the north to the south reached 77 49 gm³ and this was 2 8 times of the total amount of water transferred from the south to north water transferred project to the east and middle lines currently based on the national conditions of china the region significantly focused on the development of irrigated agriculture and especially crops with high water consumption the aforementioned factors further aggravate pressure on water resources in the northern region making it even scarcer simultaneously in a manner different from the water rich southern region most of the irrigation in the north mainly depends on groundwater fig 7 such as north china and huang huai hai region the reason why virtual water flow presents the current situation of north to south is mainly because the southern region and especially the south east regions was the earliest place to implement the policy of reform and open up and was the most populous and the richest region in china first a significant amount of investment has led to the prosperity of the industry and the construction of various facilities has occupied a large amount of fertile land as a result many of the resources for grain production are converted to the secondary or tertiary industries it reversed the traditional situation of the south as the main grain producing area in the past the pattern of unsustainable grain transportation from the northern region with shortage of water resources to the south with rich water resources has been formed second the improvement in living conditions led to changes in the diet structure and this has led to the increased consumption of agricultural products the ensuing increase in food demand stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers in some areas such as the northeast and huang huai hai regions in addition to neglecting the lack of local water resources fertile land light and heat in the areas provided good conditions for improving grain production simultaneously the country s grain policy maintains the grain self sufficiency rate at a relatively high level and determines that a new grain producing region should be identified to replace the old and thereby as to feed the large population in china the changes have led to the current situation in which virtual water and physical water resources flow in the opposite direction in northern and southern china agricultural production is a complex and integrated system and virtual water flow caused by the change in agricultural production distribution will affect regional water resources and the environment china s cultivated land is mainly concentrated in heilongjiang inner mongolia hebei henan shandong and other northern regions and exhibited a trend of concentration to the north region from 1998 to 2014 however water resources are mainly concentrated in hainan guangdong guangxi yunnan and other southern regions except qinghai and tibet the use of water resources is relatively high in guangdong guangxi hubei and hunan however the regions with a high proportion of total water occupied by agricultural water include inner mongolia heilongjiang xinjiang and gansu virtual water transfer alleviates agricultural water consumption in the import region and also increases agricultural water use pressure in the export region to a considerable extent fig 8 this study takes heilongjiang a typical export region and guangdong a typical import region as examples to illustrate it in 1998 the grain sown area in heilongjiang was 8088 9 kha accounting for 7 11 of the gross grain sown area in china known as an important part of northeast granary the grain sown area in heilongjiang increased to 11 696 4 kha in 2014 accounting for 10 38 of the national gross grain sown area the total amount of water use in heilongjiang increased from 31 6 gm³ in 1998 to 36 4 gm³ in 2014 accounting for 5 82 and 5 97 of the national total water use respectively the proportion of agricultural water use also showed a clear increasing trend from 72 61 in 1998 to 86 82 in 2014 in contrast to the grain production and agricultural water use in heilongjiang the grain sown area in guangdong has declined from 3529 0 kha to 2507 0 kha and the proportion of grain sown area has decreased from 3 10 to 2 22 the proportion of guangdong s total water use has also decreased from 8 16 to 7 26 mainly due to the reduction in agricultural water use the proportion of agricultural water use has shown an obvious downward trend from 58 75 in 1998 to 50 69 in 2014 meanwhile most of the provinces whose proportion of agricultural water use has declined are grain import areas or export areas where the scale of grain export is gradually shrinking such as hebei 4 3 analysis of water use types and regional water resources pressure relief types in different regions the uneven distribution of water resources in time and space and the geographical mismatch of the primary resources of grain production are the main reasons for the current situation of grain production and consumption in china for example the population of beijing and shanghai is much larger than the one that can be sustained by their own grain production and the per capita water resources exhibits an evident downward trend during the study period the per capita water resources in most provinces exhibited a downward trend previous studies indicated global water withdrawal is projected to increase significantly flörke et al 2018 bijl et al 2018 bijl et al 2018 showed an increasing water withdrawal in the municipal sector 311 366 additional km³ yr flörke et al 2018 found urban water demand would increase by 80 by 2050 while climate change will alter the timing and distribution of water there would have an urban surface water deficit of 1386 to 6764 million m³ and 233 million people would have water demands that exceed surface water availability urban and agricultural sectors would be highly conflict since both sectors cannot obtain their estimated future water demands agriculture is the main user of water resources consumption to a certain extent and improvements in agricultural water use efficiency could free up enough water for urban use investments in improving agricultural water use could thus serve as an important global change adaptation strategy flörke et al 2018 therefore the development of water saving irrigation technology played a significant role in promoting agricultural water saving irrigation is the main measure to ensure agricultural production in china and water saving irrigation is the main measure to save agricultural water the popularization of water saving irrigation technology evidently improved the utilization efficiency of irrigation water for example micro irrigation and low pressure pipe irrigation are significantly more efficient than traditional flood irrigation and traditional channel irrigation therefore the agricultural irrigation water use coefficient which refers to the ratio of the net water used by grains to the total diverted water at the head of the water source during one irrigation period exhibited an increasing trend during the research period in china wang z n 2000 cmwr 1997 2014 it is an important indicator to measure the water use efficiency in the process of water diversion from the water source to the field fig 9 from 2003 to 2014 china s grain sown area and the amount of grain export increased continuously for 11 years although the total amount of water used in agricultural production has not significantly changed and the improvement in irrigation water use efficiency plays an important role water saving irrigation corresponds to the main method to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use the main water saving irrigation methods include canal seepage control low pressure pipe irrigation sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation from 2005 to 2015 the area of water saving irrigation which refers to the grain sown area that uses water saving irrigation measures increased from 21 34 mha to 29 02 mha in china fig 10 the promotion area of micro irrigation increased rapidly from 0 62 mha in 2015 to 5 26 mha in 2015 simultaneously the canal seepage control area increased from 9 13 mha to 14 05 mha the development of irrigation and drainage in china didc 2015 showed that by the end of 2015 the average water use coefficient of main canal systems in large scale irrigation district has increased from 0 481 to 0 597 after the reconstruction meanwhile the average irrigation water effective use coefficient has increased from 0 397 to 0 486 after the reconstruction the water saving capacity increased by 21 18 gm³ the water saving capacity per unit area increased by 1007 25 m³ ha and the actual irrigation volume per unit area decreased from 9480 m³ ha in 1998 to 7695 m³ ha in 2014 the comprehensive agricultural production capacity of irrigation districts has been improved and the operation and maintenance costs of large scale irrigation districts have also been reduced the grain production capacity has increased by 19 07 mt the proportion of grain produced in large scale irrigation districts over the country s total grain production increased from 22 in 1998 to 26 in 2014 which strongly supported national grain security and promoted grain production increasing assuming the same water use scale in 1998 and 2014 we took the difference of irrigation water utilization coefficient between 1998 and 2014 as an example and the water saving effect brought by water saving irrigation was shown compared with 1998 water saving irrigation measures have resulted in a water saving effect for both the whole nation and 31 provinces in 2014 thus the whole country could save 21 89 and five provinces water saving rate exceeded 25 among which tibet and shanghai s water saving effect was the largest 27 80 and 26 98 respectively the water saving rate in most provinces was between 20 and 25 and other provinces water saving rates were between 10 and 20 the variation of water productivity could lead to changes in virtual water flow pattern namely when virtual water flows from the region with high water productivity to the one with low water productivity it would bring water saving benefits at the national level with the improvement of water saving irrigation technology and the expansion of water saving irrigation area the water saving amount of virtual water flow increased to 61 08 gm³ in 2014 four times that of 1998 the main grain export areas were converted from increasing more agricultural water in 1998 to saving water in 2014 by the virtual water flow for example heilongjiang would increase agricultural water use by 0 32 gm³ due to virtual water export in 1998 while in 2014 it would save 12 25 gm³ of water due to virtual water export the phenomena indicated that the grain water productivity in most provinces exporting grain virtual water was higher than that in importing provinces which contributed to reducing agricultural water use at the national level given the distribution and geographical location of water resources the surface water in the southern region essentially satisfies demand while the northern region mainly depends on groundwater although the rapid development of economy and the increase in population lead to a considerable demand for grain the economic benefits of agriculture are still not dominant and the agricultural gdp only accounted for 9 2 of the national gdp in 2014 the economic value of agriculture is significantly less than that of industry and tertiary industry and it is one of the main factors that affects the main grain producing areas and main marketing areas additionally there are also considerable differences in the types and recharge modes of water resources in different regions the recharge of groundwater occurs mainly in north china and huang huai hai area and the exploitation mode and allocation of groundwater are more difficult than those of surface water therefore the exploitation mode and main utilization of water resources in the areas correspond to groundwater with increases in regional population and economic development the competition between agriculture and industry for water resources is becoming increasingly evident in these regions and the demand for water resources is also increasing simultaneously huang huai hai is an important grain production and export region in china the excessive dependence of agricultural production on groundwater poses a significant threat to the local environment and ecological sustainability from the cumulative variation in groundwater storage variables in the northern plain area from 1997 to 2014 it is observed that the groundwater storage variables in the northern plain groundwater exploitation area exhibited a continuous downward trend since 2003 among which huang huai hai is the most evident cmwr 1998 2014 when compared with 1980 the accumulation of groundwater storage variables in hebei beijing henan and shandong provinces decreased by 75 2 gm³ 9 4 gm³ 8 9 gm³ and 5 5 gm³ respectively beijing is one of the cities with the largest population density and large water consumption in china while hebei henan and shandong are the main grain production areas and virtual water transfer areas in china 5 conclusion in the current study the impact of grain virtual water flow on surface water and groundwater was analyzed for provinces in china the results indicate most regions mainly rely on surface water that accounts for less than 50 of surface water supply in only four provinces namely hebei henan beijing and shanxi in the northern region and mainly in north china the dependence on groundwater is very high the total virtual water flow in china increased from 75 8 gm³ in 1998 to 124 6 gm³ in 2014 and showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions the pressure of surface water and groundwater in the export area increased with the increasing virtual water export given the decrease in the scale of virtual water export the decline of groundwater level in north china is not further aggravated irrigation corresponds to the main measure to ensure agricultural production in china and water saving irrigation corresponds to the main measure to save agricultural water by improving the efficiency of irrigation water use and another important method to save water at present is to control the unsustainable scale of the current virtual water transfer the results of the study can aid in improving the sustainability of surface water and groundwater management in the grain production process via identifying dominant areas credit authorship contribution statement y l yin conceptualization writing

335,virtual water flow can alleviate the pressure of regional water resources differences in water resources endowment and industrial structure among regions cause regional differences in water use in china water use in agriculture especially irrigation heavily relies on both surface water and groundwater virtual water flow may have different influence on the utilization and exploitation of regional surface water and groundwater however few studies have separately investigated the impacts of virtual water transfer on them according to virtual water theory contribution rate and regional differences this study evaluates the effects of virtual water flow on water resources among provinces in china the results indicate most regions mainly rely on surface water that accounts for less than 50 of surface water supply in only four provinces namely hebei henan beijing and shanxi in the northern region and mainly in north china the dependence on groundwater is very high the total virtual water flow in china increased from 75 8 gm³ in 1998 to 124 6 gm³ in 2014 and showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions given the decrease in the scale of virtual water export the decline of groundwater level in north china is not further aggravated water saving irrigation is the main method to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use the results of the study can aid in improving the sustainability of surface water and groundwater management in the grain production process via identifying dominant areas keywords virtual water flow groundwater resources surface water resources china 1 introduction water is one of the world s most important fundamental natural resources in terms of quantity and quality that is critical for human and environmental development mattos et al 2018 although water use and consumption is facing unsustainable levels for example steffen et al 2015 proposed the planetary boundary to assess global freshwater use and thought it to be well below a corresponding planetary boundary and jaramillo and destouni 2015a found global consumptive use of freshwater has overpassed the corresponding planetary boundary global freshwater also would increasingly be a fundamental limiting factor in feeding the world rockström and karlberg 2010 furthermore water is a basic resource in grain production which accounts for more than 70 of the global water withdrawal jiang et al 2017 as the world s most populous country water scarcity and grain security in china has attracted significant attention due to its rapid economic development and population growth zhang et al 2013 dong et al 2014 wang et al 2014 sun et al 2019a agricultural production which is both resource provider and consumer consumes a significant amount of water and cultivated land resources while providing production and living materials campbell et al 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2015b highlighted the global impact of local water use activities such as human controlled flow regulation and irrigation therefore in some regions water use is exceeding sustainable levels rosa et al 2018 due to the difference in the geographical distribution of water resources those in south china are obviously higher than those in north china and water availability varies considerably across provinces and regions in china dong et al 2014 for example northern china accounts for 57 of land resources and uses 19 1 of total water resources to satisfy water demand for 45 2 of country s population zhang and anadon 2014 cai et al 2017 currently 14 9 of the total rivers and 26 1 of all lakes present water quality that cannot be used for any purpose cmwr 2014 this geographic mismatch between cultivated land and water has led to unsustainable agricultural expansion in arid regions further supported by the objective of grain self sufficiency zhuo et al 2016 mattos et al 2018 local water problems cannot be only treated locally as virtual water flows between regions can redistribute water resources and discharge cai et al 2017 therefore the mismatch between supply and demand caused by the difference between grain production and consumption among regions results in the flow of grain which will have different effects on water resources previous studies have shown that more than half the country s population are supported with only 20 of the country s water resources guan and hubacek 2007 dong et al 2014 following the economic reform and opening up that commenced in 1978 the southeast region experienced rapid increase in its urban population and acceleration of industrialization process the demand for industrial and other types of land increased zhang et al 2016 the increase in the total population and decrease in the scale of agricultural production in southern regions increased the scale of grain production and consumption of agricultural water in northern regions overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation is an important challenge that affects the sustainable socioeconomic development in the water scarce northern region with significant adverse effects on the environment and ecosystems through the drying of rivers and land subsidence among other reasons foster et al 2004 zheng et al 2010 zhang and anadon 2014 porkka et al 2017 the optimal allocation of water resources is the basis for rational development and utilization of water resources and the fundamental guarantee for the sustainable utilization of water resources however the natural temporal and spatial distribution of regional water resources is not suitable for distribution of productivity and a significant competition in water use exists between regions and various water use departments finally there are many ecological and environmental problems due to improper development and utilization of water resources and thus it is more urgent to implement the rational allocation of water resources most of the traditional water resources allocation is through the construction of water transfer projects to alleviate the pressure of water resources in water shortage areas if combined with the virtual water allocation of the region will achieve more obvious results therefore from the perspective of commodity trade to solve the shortage of water resources allan 2003 it is helpful to understand the impact of virtual water flow on groundwater versus surface water in different regions virtual water was first defined by allan 1993 and corresponds to the volume of water necessary for the production of a commodity virtual water strategy is mainly used to set policies to improve water use efficiency on different scales over the past decade there are a lot of studies focusing on virtual water to explore the trade development on water resources at different scales hoekstra and hung 2002 ma et al 2006 d odorico et al 2012 tamea et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 duarte et al 2016 brindha and k 2017 sun et al 2019b referring to international trade dalin et al 2017 showed that approximately 11 of non renewable groundwater use for irrigation is embedded in international food trade and while 18 of global crop production is traded internationally kumar and singh 2005 compared the virtual water trade in 146 countries and explained that some water shortage regions are net exporters at the national level zhao et al 2019 noted that virtual water trade runs from china s water scarce north to its south from less developed to more developed areas and runs against water availability which is unsustainable to water resources system sun et al 2013 evaluated the virtual water content of grain in china in 2009 feng et al 2014 have considered how changes in the balance of virtual water flow affects provincial water use given provincial water scarcity given the imbalance of grain supply and demand among different regions of china virtual water accompanying the transfer of grain in the region formed a pattern that flows from the water scarce northern region to the water abundant southern region and produced many accompanying effects sun et al 2019a 2019b virtual water usually flows from water poor regions to water rich regions and from regions with high water use efficiency for grain production to regions with low water use efficiency in china wang et al 2014 there were also studies on regional and special districts and river basins such as hetao irrigation district and yellow river basin more than 90 of the virtual water flows in the hetao irrigation district originated from counties with lower water stress and was transferred to those with higher water stress the export of virtual water fluctuated but tended to increase in the hetao irrigation district liu et al 2015 some studies indicated that the interaction between the hydrological process of production and the socio economic system should be simultaneously considered in water scarce areas to solve the problem of local water shortage cai and rosegrant et al 2002 cui et al 2018 thus it is of significant value to evaluate the suitability of virtual water strategy for the sustainable management of water resources in water shortage regions and especially in drought prone areas d odorico et al 2010 marston and konar 2017 extant studies on the impact of virtual water flow on water resources tend to focus only on the static state of a single year as opposed to dynamic characteristics and trends of long time series additionally most previous studies were performed only at the overall level of water resources without considering the differences in water resources utilization between regions for example schyns and hoekstra 2014 and marston et al 2018 represent two studies that evaluate spatial differences in surface water and groundwater consumption within a country morocco and usa respectively which provide us a new perspective to analyze the virtual flow of china for china a country with uneven distribution of water resources and significant regional differences the study only on the overall level of water resources undoubtedly ignores the effect of regional differences in water resources endowment and water use efficiency therefore an examination of surface water and groundwater utilization between provinces and regions more realistically reflects water resource problems faced by various regions in china according to the difference of water resources endowment in different regions based on the regional grain virtual water flow in china this study analyzes the influence of virtual water flow on regional surface water and groundwater which previous studies have rarely involved to fill this observation gap we analyzed national agricultural surface water and groundwater use from 1998 to 2014 then we quantified long time series of virtual water flow embedded in grain from the results we further explored the impact of grain virtual water on regional surface water and groundwater which provides a certain reference for regional water resources evaluation and management and establishing sustainable virtual water flows pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area of this study is mainland china taiwan hong kong and macao are excluded because of a lack of data the area consists of 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipal cities these provinces are classified into eight regions according to their geographic location and their conditions of weather water resources and grain production fig 1 2 2 data the data required for the study include social statistics agricultural production statistics meteorological data and water resources data from 31 provincial administrative regions in mainland china from 1997 to 2014 social statistics data is mainly related to the population agricultural statistics data is mainly related to grain wheat corn and rice production such as the sown area of grain grain production and per capita grain production fertilizer use and irrigation water the social statistics data and agricultural data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook csy 1997 2015 the meteorological data used in the study including temperature precipitation and wind speed were obtained from the cmdc china meteorological data service center 2020 total water resources surface water and groundwater and water use data surface water and groundwater were obtained from the china water resources bulletin 1997 2014 chinese ministry of water resources cmwr 1997 2014 2 3 method 2 3 1 calculation of water use for grain production the mismatch of grain supply and demand among regions is the main driving force of grain trade and consequently virtual water flow food security in china indicated the grain self sufficiency rate exceeds 95 in china and realizes the basic self sufficiency of grain fsy 2019 yang 2019 therefore the study does not consider the impact of international grain trade this research is also based on the following assumptions firstly the social equity law that is the differences in consumption among the regions were not taken into account assuming that there is no difference in consumption so that consumption can be approximately assessed with the per capita grain share secondly it is assumed that the annual grain reserves remain unchanged that is the consumption of grain produced in that year not considering the replenishment of grain reserves and the conversion of grain into feed and so on the virtual water flow related to grain for each region is calculated annually as follows sun et al 2016 1 f t i p o p i p i p o p i p n p o p n where fti denotes the net transfer volume of grain in region i if fti 0 it denotes grain export kg while fti 0

groundwater use data this study assumes that agricultural water use surface water versus groundwater ratio is the same as overall all sectors combined surface water versus groundwater ratio which can be derived from real statistic data at province level and this ratio is uniform throughout the irrigation district for all grains the surface water and groundwater withdrawl in agriculture are calculated as follow 15 s a w u a w u s w u w u where sawu represents surface water withdrawl in agriculture gm³ awu denotes agricultural water use gm³ swu represents total surface water withdrawal

withdrawal gm³ 3 results 3 1 evolution of water use of grain producing in china the amount of national agricultural water use showed a slight decreasing trend first and increasing trend then remaining between 343 6 gm³ 2002 and 392 2 gm³ 2013 the proportion of national agricultural water use over the national total water use generally showed a slight downward trend from about 69 1998 to about 63 2014 due to the differences in industrial structure and water resource endowments among regions the changes both in agricultural water use and in its proportion over regional total water use showed great spatial differences among the studied provincial administrative areas for instance the amount of agricultural water use in most export areas showed an increasing trend from 1998 to 2014 while the agricultural water use in import areas showed a decreasing trend in terms of the proportion of regional agricultural water use over the regional total water use it was generally low in the east and central china yet high in the west meanwhile it showed a decreasing trend in most provincial administrative regions with the exception of liaoning heilongjiang gansu qinghai and tibet taking heilongjiang one of china s main grain producing area as an example both agricultural water use and its proportion in this region showed a clear upward trend from 21 1 gm³ 1998 to 31 6 gm³ 2014 and from 72 6 1998 to 86 8 2014 respectively the agricultural water use in the south and the north accounted for 45 and 55 of the total agricultural water use respectively this study used water footprint of grain to characterize the temporal and spatial evolution of water use in grain production in china from 1998 to 2014 the results found that the total water footprint sum of green and blue water footprints of grain in china generally showed a decreasing trend from 752 6 gm³ in 1998 to 680 0 gm³ in 2014 in specific the national blue water footprint of grain showed a decreasing trend while the green water footprint showed a fluctuating trend however changes of grain water footprint at regional scale showed great spatial difference for instance contrary trends were observed in heilongjiang increasing and hebei decreasing heilongjiang s blue and green water footprints both showed an increasing trend mainly due to the increasing in the use of blue water fig 2 while increasing the use of surface water the dependence on groundwater of heilongjiang has also showed a significant increase consequently the blue water footprint in heilongjiang increased from 7 6 gm³ in 1998 to 15 9 gm³ in 2014 by contrast water footprint of grain in hebei showed a decreasing trend declining from 13 3 gm³ 1998 to 8 3 gm³ 2014 groundwater is the main water source in agricultural production in hebei the decrease of groundwater footprint in this region implied that the agricultural water pressure in the region has been eased to a certain extent to our surprise the northern region relied more on the green water than the southern region did although there was more green water available precipitation in the south the sources of agricultural blue water supply in different regions are closely related to the distribution of surface water and groundwater in other words agricultural production in the southern region mainly depends on surface water whereas it heavily depends on groundwater in the northern region for example agricultural groundwater use in hebei and tianjin significantly exceeded the use of surface water specifically their agricultural groundwater use is 1 1 times and 2 2 times of the agricultural surface water use respectively the proportion of groundwater supply in xinjiang inner mongolia jilin henan and other provinces exhibited an increasing trend during the study period the amount of agricultural blue water in ningxia and tianjin is 8 4 times and 1 2 times of its water resources respectively which is largely caused by the external water resources supplied by yellow river and the south to north water transfer project 3 2 grain transfer in export and import region as a result of the intensification of the imbalance between grain supply and demand among regions the total amount of grain transportation showed a continuous increasing trend in china during the study period the amount of grain transportation increased from 51 24 mt in 1998 to 116 55 mt in 2014 fig 3 shows the proportion of grain exported in the export areas to their own grain production in 1998 and 2014 and also the proportion of grain imported in import areas to their own grain consumption it was found that the direction of grain transportation basically showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions the grain production of the most grain export regions showed an obvious upward trend during the study period similarly the proportion of grain exported also showed an increasing trend in these regions in addition the role of a certain region in being an export area or an import area showed a dynamic transition for instance gansu and jiangxi were import areas in 1998 but become export areas in 2014 whereas jiangsu hubei and liaoning switched from export areas in 1998 to import areas in 2014 as shown in fig 3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain exported meanwhile it is also one of the provinces with the largest increasing rate of grain production grain production in heilongjiang increased from 30 09 mt in 1998 to 62 42 mt in 2014 along with the increase of its grain production the proportion of grain exported accounting for the grain production in heilongjiang also showed a significant increase from 47 89 to 72 64 contrary to heilongjiang guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain imported meanwhile its grain production decreased from 19 48 mt in 1998 to 13 57 mt in 2014 therefore guangdong is increasingly dependent on grain imported from other regions in fact the proportion of grain imported accounting for the total grain consumption in this region increased from 34 39 1998 to 71 60 2014 in 2014 the annual amount of grain transferred to beijing shanghai and tianjin accounted for the largest proportion of their consumption and corresponded to 93 3 89 6 and 74 respectively with respect to the export area the proportion of grain transferred from heilongjiang to its grain yield increased from 57 2 in 1997 to 72 6 in 2014 the proportion of grain exported from inner mongolia and jilin is also very high and reached 59 5 and 65 3 of the grain yield in 2014 fig 3 3 3 influence of virtual water flow on water resources based on the regional grain transfer 1998 2014 the study also analyzed the embedded grain virtual water flow in china although the role of some regions in being the export or import areas transformed in the research period 1998 2014 the total virtual water flow in china increased from 75 8 gm³ in 1998 to 124 6 gm³ in 2014 in specific the total green virtual water flow increased from 45 7 gm³ 1998 to 74 2 gm³ 2014 while the blue virtual water flow increased from 30 1 gm³ 1998 to 50 4 gm³ 2014 meanwhile this study furtherly divided the blue water into surface water and groundwater to investigate water utilization and exploitation similar to the change of blue virtual water flow both the virtual surface water flow and the virtual groundwater flow increased during 1998 to 2014 from 20 1 gm³ to 29 9 gm³ and from 10 0 gm³ to 20 5 gm³ respectively fig 4 showed the temporal and spatial variation patterns of virtual water flow among provinces in 1998 and 2014 as an explanation we took changes of virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong as examples as one of the most typical and largest virtual water export area heilongjiang exported more virtual water in 2014 58 8 gm³ than in 1998 25 0 gm³ showing an obvious increasing trend in virtual water export along with the increase in virtual water export the proportion of virtual water export in heilongjiang also increased from 33 0 to 47 2 specifically the export of virtual surface water increased from 4 1 gm³ to 13 5 gm³ accounting for 20 5 and 45 3 and the export of virtual groundwater increased from 3 7 gm³ to 11 6 gm³ accounting for 36 6 and 56 4 contrary to heilongjiang guangdong is one of the largest virtual water import provinces the imported virtual water increased from 15 1 gm³ in 1998 accounting for 19 9 of the total virtual water flow to 36 6 gm³ in 2014 accounting for 29 3 of the total virtual water the virtual surface water transferred from jilin heilongjiang and inner mongolia accounts for a large proportion of agricultural surface water and shows an increasing trend virtual water transfer into beijing tianjin and shanghai has played an evident role in alleviating the pressure of local water resources the virtual water transferred into beijing tianjin and shanghai is significantly larger than the total amount of local water resources which is approximately 3 times 4 5 times and 2 4 times of the local water resources respectively this phenomenon is associated with a larger population and a smaller amount of water resources because of its small administrative area without the flows of virtual water the pressure on water resources in the northern groundwater areas will be relatively alleviated mainly due to changes in the surface and groundwater including the extent of exploitation of water resources in 2014 the national per capita share of grain was 445 54 kg the population of the northern region was 573 16 million and the grain production of the northern region was 338 35 mt if there is no grain virtual water flow the northern region will meet its own real grain demand by 255 36 mt the northern region would reduce 82 99 mt grain production and that would reduce the export of grain virtual water by 87 0 gm³ however the amount of water resources used in agricultural production in the southern region will increase which will have a certain impact on the local production pattern and economic income and even further affect the national economic income pattern 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic variation in surface water and groundwater in typical areas based on the study grain production and water resources distribution in china are seriously mismatched the southern region possesses more than 80 of the country s water resources while the northern region possesses less than 20 surface water and groundwater accounted for 76 5 and 23 5 of total available water resources in china respectively the proportion of surface water in the south is generally higher than that in the north southwest china has the highest total amount of water resources mainly tibet and the surface water and groundwater contents are also the highest fig 5 the total amount of water resources in north china corresponds to the smallest and the only area with a surface water ratio of less than 50 45 the total amount of water resources in the northwest is slightly higher than that in the rest of the north ningxia possesses the lowest proportion of surface water 25 and chongqing the highest 85 north china plain and the huang huai hai region are important grain production bases and grain export areas in china the amount of water resources per capita in the north china plain is only 456 m³ year which is less than 1 6 of that of the whole country the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water is uneven and groundwater is an important support for the sustainable development of economy and society in north china plain the groundwater exploitation in shijiazhuang beijing xingtai handan baoding hengshui langfang tangshan and other cities has accounted for more than 70 of the total water supply due to the overexploitation of groundwater for many years the north china plain has become the largest cone region in the world the results of a study indicated that the composite groundwater cones in the north china plain including shallow and deep cone covers an area of 73 288 km2 and accounted for 52 6 of the total area zhang et al 2009 for the recovery of funnel area many researchers have thought of sealing wells that is the exploitation of groundwater is prohibited however it is almost impossible to abandon the use of groundwater in the north china plain where the water resources per capita are only 15 of the national average and less than 4 of the world s level in the study the variation in groundwater storage in the plain of 16 provincial administrative regions in the north of china in 2014 was showed comparison of data at the end of 2013 and 2014 fig 6 with the exception of henan and anhui the groundwater storage in the vast majority of virtual water export areas is decreased wherein hebei liaoning and shandong decreased their groundwater reserves by 5 31 gm³ 1 66 gm³ and 1 25 gm³ respectively this study took hebei province located in the north of north china plain as an example the average annual precipitation is 529 1 mm the water resources per capita and water resources per unit area only account for 11 18 and 9 13 of the national average hebei is a typical irrigated grain producing province because of the lack of surface water resources irrigation mainly depends on the extraction of groundwater statistical data at the end of 2016 indicated that the area of irrigated cultivated land in hebei province was 4129 12 kha including 601 92 kha of cultivated land with sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and seepage irrigation facilities cmwr chinese ministry of water resources 2017 among the main sources of irrigation water the use of groundwater accounts for 88 32 and the surface water accounts for only 11 68 therefore hebei is one of the most significant contradictions between supply and demand of water resources in china from 1997 to 2014 the amount of groundwater used in hebei province was larger than that of local groundwater resources and the amount of groundwater used was 1 42 times of that of water supply cmwr 1998 2014 unreasonable exploitation and overuse of groundwater significantly affect water resources and ecological environment in hebei province such as insufficient groundwater recharge cone and deterioration of the ecological environment during the study period the virtual water export of hebei exhibited a downward trend although it has always been the export province of grain virtual water and accounts for 2 27 of the agricultural water consumption along with the decrease of the export of grain virtual water the use of groundwater for agriculture in hebei decreased from 13 3 gm³ to 8 3 gm³ assuming that if there was no grain export from hebei in 2014 hebei would reduce 0 70 mt of grain production correspondingly reducing the use of groundwater by 0 17 gm³ at the same time if hebei reduced grain production and chose to import grain from other regions to satisfy local grain demand it would further alleviate groundwater pressure however heilongjiang liaoning and jilin are also in the northern region and their groundwater storage variables also exhibit a downward trend therefore the unsustainable virtual water flow increases the threat to water resources and environment of the export area 4 2 analysis of the influence of virtual water flow virtual water flow corresponds to the redistribution of virtual water in geographical space which significantly affects regional water resources and environment from 1997 to 2014 the total amount of water resources did not significantly change and the change in water resources between the north and the south evidently varied with time during the study period the amount of virtual water flow in china exhibited an evident increasing trend and displayed the trend of transferring from the central and northern water shortage areas to the southern water rich area ma et al 2006 and zhao et al 2015 got similar results and indicated that the current grain virtual water flow is unsustainable moreover some study found virtual water flow only alleviates water scarcity in importing wealthy countries while it has limited effects on water scarcity alleviation in poorer countries distefano and kelly 2017 for the grain export area and import area the virtual water flow significantly affected the exploitation distribution and use of its water resources especially on the virtual water export area since 1990 grain production in the north region exceeded that in the south region forming a grain transportation from the north to the south grain production necessitates the consumption of a considerable amount of water and thus grain transportation from the north to the south acts as a conduit of virtual water resources from the water scarce north to the water rich south in 2010 the amount of water transferred to the south with the transportation of grain from the north to the south reached 77 49 gm³ and this was 2 8 times of the total amount of water transferred from the south to north water transferred project to the east and middle lines currently based on the national conditions of china the region significantly focused on the development of irrigated agriculture and especially crops with high water consumption the aforementioned factors further aggravate pressure on water resources in the northern region making it even scarcer simultaneously in a manner different from the water rich southern region most of the irrigation in the north mainly depends on groundwater fig 7 such as north china and huang huai hai region the reason why virtual water flow presents the current situation of north to south is mainly because the southern region and especially the south east regions was the earliest place to implement the policy of reform and open up and was the most populous and the richest region in china first a significant amount of investment has led to the prosperity of the industry and the construction of various facilities has occupied a large amount of fertile land as a result many of the resources for grain production are converted to the secondary or tertiary industries it reversed the traditional situation of the south as the main grain producing area in the past the pattern of unsustainable grain transportation from the northern region with shortage of water resources to the south with rich water resources has been formed second the improvement in living conditions led to changes in the diet structure and this has led to the increased consumption of agricultural products the ensuing increase in food demand stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers in some areas such as the northeast and huang huai hai regions in addition to neglecting the lack of local water resources fertile land light and heat in the areas provided good conditions for improving grain production simultaneously the country s grain policy maintains the grain self sufficiency rate at a relatively high level and determines that a new grain producing region should be identified to replace the old and thereby as to feed the large population in china the changes have led to the current situation in which virtual water and physical water resources flow in the opposite direction in northern and southern china agricultural production is a complex and integrated system and virtual water flow caused by the change in agricultural production distribution will affect regional water resources and the environment china s cultivated land is mainly concentrated in heilongjiang inner mongolia hebei henan shandong and other northern regions and exhibited a trend of concentration to the north region from 1998 to 2014 however water resources are mainly concentrated in hainan guangdong guangxi yunnan and other southern regions except qinghai and tibet the use of water resources is relatively high in guangdong guangxi hubei and hunan however the regions with a high proportion of total water occupied by agricultural water include inner mongolia heilongjiang xinjiang and gansu virtual water transfer alleviates agricultural water consumption in the import region and also increases agricultural water use pressure in the export region to a considerable extent fig 8 this study takes heilongjiang a typical export region and guangdong a typical import region as examples to illustrate it in 1998 the grain sown area in heilongjiang was 8088 9 kha accounting for 7 11 of the gross grain sown area in china known as an important part of northeast granary the grain sown area in heilongjiang increased to 11 696 4 kha in 2014 accounting for 10 38 of the national gross grain sown area the total amount of water use in heilongjiang increased from 31 6 gm³ in 1998 to 36 4 gm³ in 2014 accounting for 5 82 and 5 97 of the national total water use respectively the proportion of agricultural water use also showed a clear increasing trend from 72 61 in 1998 to 86 82 in 2014 in contrast to the grain production and agricultural water use in heilongjiang the grain sown area in guangdong has declined from 3529 0 kha to 2507 0 kha and the proportion of grain sown area has decreased from 3 10 to 2 22 the proportion of guangdong s total water use has also decreased from 8 16 to 7 26 mainly due to the reduction in agricultural water use the proportion of agricultural water use has shown an obvious downward trend from 58 75 in 1998 to 50 69 in 2014 meanwhile most of the provinces whose proportion of agricultural water use has declined are grain import areas or export areas where the scale of grain export is gradually shrinking such as hebei 4 3 analysis of water use types and regional water resources pressure relief types in different regions the uneven distribution of water resources in time and space and the geographical mismatch of the primary resources of grain production are the main reasons for the current situation of grain production and consumption in china for example the population of beijing and shanghai is much larger than the one that can be sustained by their own grain production and the per capita water resources exhibits an evident downward trend during the study period the per capita water resources in most provinces exhibited a downward trend previous studies indicated global water withdrawal is projected to increase significantly flörke et al 2018 bijl et al 2018 bijl et al 2018 showed an increasing water withdrawal in the municipal sector 311 366 additional km³ yr flörke et al 2018 found urban water demand would increase by 80 by 2050 while climate change will alter the timing and distribution of water there would have an urban surface water deficit of 1386 to 6764 million m³ and 233 million people would have water demands that exceed surface water availability urban and agricultural sectors would be highly conflict since both sectors cannot obtain their estimated future water demands agriculture is the main user of water resources consumption to a certain extent and improvements in agricultural water use efficiency could free up enough water for urban use investments in improving agricultural water use could thus serve as an important global change adaptation strategy flörke et al 2018 therefore the development of water saving irrigation technology played a significant role in promoting agricultural water saving irrigation is the main measure to ensure agricultural production in china and water saving irrigation is the main measure to save agricultural water the popularization of water saving irrigation technology evidently improved the utilization efficiency of irrigation water for example micro irrigation and low pressure pipe irrigation are significantly more efficient than traditional flood irrigation and traditional channel irrigation therefore the agricultural irrigation water use coefficient which refers to the ratio of the net water used by grains to the total diverted water at the head of the water source during one irrigation period exhibited an increasing trend during the research period in china wang z n 2000 cmwr 1997 2014 it is an important indicator to measure the water use efficiency in the process of water diversion from the water source to the field fig 9 from 2003 to 2014 china s grain sown area and the amount of grain export increased continuously for 11 years although the total amount of water used in agricultural production has not significantly changed and the improvement in irrigation water use efficiency plays an important role water saving irrigation corresponds to the main method to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use the main water saving irrigation methods include canal seepage control low pressure pipe irrigation sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation from 2005 to 2015 the area of water saving irrigation which refers to the grain sown area that uses water saving irrigation measures increased from 21 34 mha to 29 02 mha in china fig 10 the promotion area of micro irrigation increased rapidly from 0 62 mha in 2015 to 5 26 mha in 2015 simultaneously the canal seepage control area increased from 9 13 mha to 14 05 mha the development of irrigation and drainage in china didc 2015 showed that by the end of 2015 the average water use coefficient of main canal systems in large scale irrigation district has increased from 0 481 to 0 597 after the reconstruction meanwhile the average irrigation water effective use coefficient has increased from 0 397 to 0 486 after the reconstruction the water saving capacity increased by 21 18 gm³ the water saving capacity per unit area increased by 1007 25 m³ ha and the actual irrigation volume per unit area decreased from 9480 m³ ha in 1998 to 7695 m³ ha in 2014 the comprehensive agricultural production capacity of irrigation districts has been improved and the operation and maintenance costs of large scale irrigation districts have also been reduced the grain production capacity has increased by 19 07 mt the proportion of grain produced in large scale irrigation districts over the country s total grain production increased from 22 in 1998 to 26 in 2014 which strongly supported national grain security and promoted grain production increasing assuming the same water use scale in 1998 and 2014 we took the difference of irrigation water utilization coefficient between 1998 and 2014 as an example and the water saving effect brought by water saving irrigation was shown compared with 1998 water saving irrigation measures have resulted in a water saving effect for both the whole nation and 31 provinces in 2014 thus the whole country could save 21 89 and five provinces water saving rate exceeded 25 among which tibet and shanghai s water saving effect was the largest 27 80 and 26 98 respectively the water saving rate in most provinces was between 20 and 25 and other provinces water saving rates were between 10 and 20 the variation of water productivity could lead to changes in virtual water flow pattern namely when virtual water flows from the region with high water productivity to the one with low water productivity it would bring water saving benefits at the national level with the improvement of water saving irrigation technology and the expansion of water saving irrigation area the water saving amount of virtual water flow increased to 61 08 gm³ in 2014 four times that of 1998 the main grain export areas were converted from increasing more agricultural water in 1998 to saving water in 2014 by the virtual water flow for example heilongjiang would increase agricultural water use by 0 32 gm³ due to virtual water export in 1998 while in 2014 it would save 12 25 gm³ of water due to virtual water export the phenomena indicated that the grain water productivity in most provinces exporting grain virtual water was higher than that in importing provinces which contributed to reducing agricultural water use at the national level given the distribution and geographical location of water resources the surface water in the southern region essentially satisfies demand while the northern region mainly depends on groundwater although the rapid development of economy and the increase in population lead to a considerable demand for grain the economic benefits of agriculture are still not dominant and the agricultural gdp only accounted for 9 2 of the national gdp in 2014 the economic value of agriculture is significantly less than that of industry and tertiary industry and it is one of the main factors that affects the main grain producing areas and main marketing areas additionally there are also considerable differences in the types and recharge modes of water resources in different regions the recharge of groundwater occurs mainly in north china and huang huai hai area and the exploitation mode and allocation of groundwater are more difficult than those of surface water therefore the exploitation mode and main utilization of water resources in the areas correspond to groundwater with increases in regional population and economic development the competition between agriculture and industry for water resources is becoming increasingly evident in these regions and the demand for water resources is also increasing simultaneously huang huai hai is an important grain production and export region in china the excessive dependence of agricultural production on groundwater poses a significant threat to the local environment and ecological sustainability from the cumulative variation in groundwater storage variables in the northern plain area from 1997 to 2014 it is observed that the groundwater storage variables in the northern plain groundwater exploitation area exhibited a continuous downward trend since 2003 among which huang huai hai is the most evident cmwr 1998 2014 when compared with 1980 the accumulation of groundwater storage variables in hebei beijing henan and shandong provinces decreased by 75 2 gm³ 9 4 gm³ 8 9 gm³ and 5 5 gm³ respectively beijing is one of the cities with the largest population density and large water consumption in china while hebei henan and shandong are the main grain production areas and virtual water transfer areas in china 5 conclusion in the current study the impact of grain virtual water flow on surface water and groundwater was analyzed for provinces in china the results indicate most regions mainly rely on surface water that accounts for less than 50 of surface water supply in only four provinces namely hebei henan beijing and shanxi in the northern region and mainly in north china the dependence on groundwater is very high the total virtual water flow in china increased from 75 8 gm³ in 1998 to 124 6 gm³ in 2014 and showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions the pressure of surface water and groundwater in the export area increased with the increasing virtual water export given the decrease in the scale of virtual water export the decline of groundwater level in north china is not further aggravated irrigation corresponds to the main measure to ensure agricultural production in china and water saving irrigation corresponds to the main measure to save agricultural water by improving the efficiency of irrigation water use and another important method to save water at present is to control the unsustainable scale of the current virtual water transfer the results of the study can aid in improving the sustainability of surface water and groundwater management in the grain production process via identifying dominant areas credit authorship contribution statement y l yin conceptualization writing

336,freezing of unsaturated soil is an important process that influences runoff and infiltration in cold climate regions we used a simple numerical model to simulate water and heat transport with phase change in unsaturated soil via three different approaches empirical semi empirical and physically based we compared the performance and parameterization of each approach through testing on three experimental datasets all approaches reproduced the observed unsaturated freezing process satisfactorily the empirical cryosuction equation used in this study managed to capture observed cryosuction with a fixed empirical parameter value the semi empirical version therefore does not require calibration of a specific frozen soil related parameter in view of simplicity small computational demand and accurate performance all three approaches are suitable for implementation in land use schemes catchment scale hydrological models or multi dimensional thermo hydrological models keywords freezing modelling cryosuction frost unsaturated zone energy transport cold regions 1 introduction there is often a substantial flux of water in a catchment during the springtime snowmelt period in high latitude and high altitude regions rango and dewalle 2008 in many cases part of the soil has become frozen during winter thereby reducing the soil permeability and infiltration capacity stähli 2006 the combination of snowmelt rainfall and soil frost has the potential to cause flooding woo 2012 frozen soil also influences snowmelt groundwater recharge and springtime contaminant transport by altering pathways and soil water retention times evans et al 2018 french et al 2002 french and binley 2004 hayashi et al 2013 ireson et al 2013 in order to predict and understand increased flood risk groundwater recharge and contaminant transport in areas with frozen soil it is therefore necessary to have sufficient understanding of the mechanisms that control soil freezing thawing and infiltration the part of a soil that generally undergoes seasonal freezing and thawing extends from a few centimeters to about a meter or several meters below the surface loranger et al 2017 lundberg et al 2016 hayashi 2013 this mostly comprises the unsaturated zone where moisture content and soil temperature respond to atmospheric dynamics on a relatively short timescale of hours to days carson 1961 it has been demonstrated that the initial moisture and temperature state of the soil when freezing initiates affect frost depth and soil ice saturation ireson et al 2013 cryosuction is an important process in this context as it depends on initial moisture content soil water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity miller and black 2003 cryosuction can be described as the increase in matric suction in the frozen zone with increasing ice content resulting in a redistribution of soil moisture to the freezing front from unfrozen soil below hayashi 2013 another process of importance in frozen soil is the depression of the freezing point of water due to matric pressure there is a relationship between subzero temperature and unfrozen water content in the soil which is represented by the soil freezing curve sfc li et al 2010 jame and norum 1972 koopmans and miller 1966 the presence of solutes can also affect freezing temperature rango and dewalle 2008 lastly the reduction in soil permeability with increasing ice saturation is a characteristic of a frozen soil watanabe and flury 2008 different approaches have been developed to incorporate cryosuction the soil freezing curve and permeability reduction into a numerical or mathematical model kurylyk and watanabe 2013 examples include the models of harlan 1973 taylor and luthin 1978 ippisch 2001 zhang et al 2007 and dall amico et al 2011 publicly available numerical models include a freezing module for hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 1998 a beta version of sutra named sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 and the atmosphere plant soil models shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 and coup jansson and karlberg 2004 sutra ice does not currently include the process of cryosuction and hydrus 1d freezing only works for unsaturated conditions kurylyk and watanabe 2013 noted that the history of frozen soil model development has been characterized by inconsistencies in nomenclature and methodology in part due to different geotechnical and hydrological backgrounds it remains unclear how different mathematical expressions and models for unsaturated soil freezing processes compare to each other in their ability to accurately represent an unsaturated frozen soil an exception to this is the paper by ren et al 2017 in which the outcomes of different sfc equations are fitted to measurements on four different frozen soils regarding the reduction of permeability of frozen soil there is debate about the use of a flow impedance factor based on ice content mohammed et al 2018 furthermore previous models are often tested only on a single experimental dataset which did not include all relevant variables such as ice content and soil temperature mohammed et al 2018 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 as a result confidence in model accuracy remains limited and it remains unclear how the model would be parameterized for a different soil than the soil used in the experiment e g the impedance factor another unresolved question is whether an empirical approach towards unsaturated soil freezing and cryosuction could be adequate and how such an approach would compare to more physically based models using the phase change temperature pressure relationship kurylyk and watanabe 2013 this question is relevant as few multi dimensional hydrological models catchment scale models or land surface schemes have adopted approaches for unsaturated soil freezing likely due to the complexity and often associated numerical instability of physically based simulation of unsaturated soil freezing in this study we compare three different approaches for unsaturated soil freezing these represent a fully empirical a semi empirical and a physically based approach and entail different combinations of previously developed equations the aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the performance and parameterization of each approach datasets from three experiments are used for testing namely those of mizoguchi 1990 watanabe et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 the latter two datasets contain measurements of ice content unfrozen water content and soil temperature which allows us to test for all relevant variables we include a discussion of current points of debate concerning the governing equations for unsaturated frozen soil dynamics as the different approaches rely on previous insights and developments in both empirical and physically based equations 2 current theory and points of debate 2 1 soil freezing curve not all soil moisture freezes at the same temperature due to the dependency of the freezing point of water on pressure hayashi 2013 matric pressure increases with decreasing unfrozen water content as ice replaces water this has been found to resemble the process of soil drying koopmans and miller 1966 the soil freezing curve sfc gives the relationship between subzero temperature and unfrozen water content for a given soil the lower the temperature the less water remains unfrozen ren et al 2017 spaans and baker 1996 the following form of the clausius clapeyron relationship relates pressure to temperature williams and smith 1989 1 d p w d t l f t 273 15 v w where p w is the pressure of liquid water pa t is the temperature c l f is the latent heat of fusion jkg 1 and v w is the specific volume of liquid water m3kg 1 the change in pressure of the ice phase is assumed to be zero furthermore it requires the assumption of thermal mechanic and phase equilibrium during freezing these constraints in the context of frozen soil modeling are discussed in ma et al 2015 expressions for the sfc have been formulated that combine the clapeyron relationship with existing equations for soil water retention during drying wetting an example is from zhang et al 2016 who combined the clapeyron relationship with the van genuchten equation 2 θ u f θ r e s θ s a t θ r e s 1 a v g l f ρ w ln t 273 15 t 0 273 15 n v g m v g where θ uf is the unfrozen water content m3m 3 θ res is the residual total water content m3m 3 θ sat is the saturated total water content m3m 3 ρ w is the density of water kgm 3 t is the temperature c t 0 the freezing point of water c and avg nvg and mvg are fitted model parameters several empirical sfc expressions have been proposed that do not make use of the clausius clapeyron relationship the simplest approach is a linear piecewise relationship between temperature and unfrozen water which has been found to reasonably approximate measured sfc datapoints mckenzie et al 2007 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 anderson and tice 1972 developed an empirical power curve to express unfrozen water content as a function of temperature 3 θ u f ρ d ρ w α t β where ρd is the dry density of the soil kgm 3 and α and β are model parameters the power curve has been used in several models and parameter values for a wide range of soils have been established as well as a method to derive the parameters from the specific surface area of a soil kurylyk and watanabe 2013 in the model sutra ice an empirical exponential function for the unfrozen water content is implemented this function has been suggested by mckenzie et al 2007 based on work by lunardini 1988 4 θ u f θ r e s θ s a t θ r e s exp t t 0 w 2 where w is a fitting parameter it is difficult however to know the correct value for w in eq 4 as very few soils have been parameterized through experimental work ren et al 2017 hence it is a parameter that often requires calibration ren et al 2017 provides a verification of four different sfc expressions on experimental data the sfc expressions of eq 2 3 and 4 included the study shows that all three expressions work well with some slightly better than others depending on soil type 2 2 reduction of hydraulic conductivity several studies have shown that a frozen soil has reduced permeability and that initial water content is important among other factors e g pittman et al 2019 watanabe and osada 2017 but the mathematical representation of the reduction of soil hydraulic conductivity due to freezing remains a point of debate the lack of consensus might exist due to different reasons 1 it is difficult to accurately measure the permeability of a frozen soil hence experimental evidence is scarce azmatch et al 2012 watanabe and osada 2017 2 ice growth in soil voids may have different effects on permeability for different soil types and different initial moisture contents and therefore a single type of reduction may not apply to all soils and moisture conditions 3 soil freezing rate a factor usually not taken into account likely plays a role as it determines how ice crystallizes in soil voids azmatch et al 2012 4 soil structure can be altered by ice lens growth and it is hard to predict how this affects soil hydrological properties mohammed et al 2018 two different causes may be distinguished for a reduced permeability of a frozen soil assuming fixed total water content and no frost heave 1 with decreased unfrozen water content porewater connectivity decreases analogous to air saturation of a soil stähli 2006 lundberg et al 2016 hayashi 2013 2 with an increased ice content the pore geometry changes due to an increase in the solid ice soil constituent certain flow pathways become blocked and effective pore size is reduced zhang et al 2016 azmatch et al 2012 it has been argued that the second set of factors are not different from permeability reduction upon increasing air saturation and that therefore the unfrozen water content of a soil can be used to predict the permeability of frozen soil accurately e g newman and wilson 1997 watanabe and flury 2008 a hydraulic conductivity function derived from the soil water retention curve is therefore used by most models kurylyk and watanabe 2013 some studies however suggest that the unfrozen water content approach overpredicts the permeability at high ice contents these studies suggest that ice blockage of flow paths should be taken into account e g jame and norum 1972 lundin 1990 hansson et al 2004 zhang et al 2007 shoop and bigl 1996 for this reason an impedance factor has been introduced to correct for the additional reduction in permeability due to ice kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the impedance factor approach by jame and norum 1972 for example considers ice content in addition to unfrozen water content 5 k f 10 r i θ i k u f where kf ms 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of partly frozen soil k uf ms 1 is the hydraulic conductivity based on the unfrozen water content θi is the volumetric ice content m3m 3 and e i is a dimensionless empirical factor of impedance due to ice blockage of pores zhang et al 2007 found that including an impedance factor e i 17 was crucial to accurately describe observed moisture transport in the soil during freezing several variations of the impedance equation eq 5 have been developed e g taylor and luthin 1978 but without much added clarity of a most reliable expression shoop and bigl 1997 suggested the following equation to determine e i based on data collected from nine different non cohesive soils 6 r i 5 4 k sat 3 2 6 where k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity ms 1 the impedance factor approach has been criticized by newman and wilson 1997 to be arbitrary and not physically based it is also suggested that it is simply a parameter to correct a numerical model for overestimated cryosuction based on the clausius clapeyron approach as the extreme hydraulic gradient at the frozen fringe is difficult to simulate in a numerical model miller 1980 in addition watanabe and flury 2008 claimed that the use of an impedance factor should be unnecessary when an accurate relative permeability function is used related to unfrozen water content though they also stated that it is a topic of ongoing research several researchers have come up with alternative approaches due to the criticisms surrounding the impedance factor kurylyk and watanabe 2013 an example is watanabe et al 2010 who successfully employed the dual porosity model of durner 1994 to simulate the hydraulic conductivity of a frozen unsaturated silt soil the closure and opening of macropores has also been recognized as an important factor determining water flow in frozen soil by several studies e g mohammed et al 2018 holten 2019 pittman et al 2020 demand et al 2019 which requires a dual porosity approach to incorporate in a numerical model in our study we will assess the need for the impedance factor in a physically based approach as a means to represent a soil ice saturation heterogeneity in an otherwise homogeneous soil i e water flowing from unfrozen to frozen soil 2 3 cryosuction there is no consensus on the most suitable representation of cryosuction in a soil freezing model kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the process is often associated with extreme hydraulic gradients requiring high spatial discretization to successfully simulate in a numerical model in some approaches matric suction is increased based on ice content through an empirical equation to simulate the effect of cryosuction on water redistribution e g zhang et al 2007 the following empirical equation for cryosuction was originally developed by kulik 1970 7 ψ t ψ u f 1 c k θ i 2 where ψ t m is the total matric pressure of the soil including the effect of cryosuction ψ uf m is the matric pressure due to total water content without the effect of possible ice present and c k is an empirical factor that represents the effect of ice on matric pressure a more novel suggestion is that soil properties should be altered through a change in soil water retention parameters and soil porosity the ice free volume noh et al 2012 in most previous numerical models however matric suction is a function of subzero temperature based on the clausius clapeyron relationship eq 1 dall amico et al 2011 uses the following version of the clausius clapeyron relationship to determine matric pressure 8 ψ t l f g t 0 t t 0 where g the gravitational constant ms 2 in case of unsaturated conditions the expression is modified to account for the matric suction resulting from air saturation in the pores most other cryosuction expressions using the clausius clapeyron relationship do not adjust for different total water saturation levels dall amico et al 2011 in this paper we will use both the empirical and physically based clausius clapeyron approaches to cryosuction for comparison 3 methods all abbreviations or symbols used for variables and parameters are listed in table 1 fixed parameters used in the model are listed in table 2 3 1 governing equations of the model 3 1 1 model structure and assumptions a numerical model was used that calculates heat and water transport for a one dimensional soil profile with any number of layers vertical discretization of the layers was set to one centimeter with uniform soil properties for the entire column heat transport occurs at the top and bottom boundary where a fixed temperature boundary can be set there is no water flow possible across the model boundaries the mathematical equations are solved through explicit difference calculation for the fluxes between soil volumes this method increases numerical stability and simplicity but it requires high temporal discretization to maintain accuracy yang et al 2009 successfully used a similar numerical method in their simulations of unsaturated flow governed by the richards equation in our case it appeared to be an adequate model construct for the purpose of 1d laboratory type soil column simulations with freezing the model excludes osmotic processes and density changes of unfrozen water also porosity and soil structure do not change with ice saturation as ice pressure is assumed to be constant 3 1 2 unsaturated flow flow between soil volumes is governed by the richard s equation here presented in its 1 dimensional form richards 1931 9 θ t o t w t z k u f θ u f ψ t z 1 where θ totw is the total water content liquid and ice m3m 3 z is the elevation m ψ tot is the total matric pressure m and kuf θ uf is the hydraulic conductivity ms 1 as a function of the unfrozen water content and also ice content if an impedance factor is used the matric pressure of a soil volume is a state variable that depends on total water content in our case given by the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 10 ψ u f 1 a v g θ s a t θ r e s θ t o t w θ r e s n v g n v g 1 1 1 n v g where a m 1 and n are model parameters hydraulic conductivity the k θ uf term in eq 8 is calculated with the following equation which derives from the relationship between the relative permeability function of the mualem van genuchten model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the unfrozen water content 11 k u f k s a t θ s a t θ r e s θ u f θ r e s 0 5 1 1 θ s a t θ r e s θ u f θ r e s n v g 1 n v g n v g 1 n v g 2 where kuf is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil ms 1 the effect of temperature on hydraulic conductivity by affecting the viscosity of water is neglected 3 1 3 energy exchange there are three forms of energy exchange in the model that govern the energy balance thermal conduction advection and latent heat flux these are expressed in the following general energy balance equation 12 t t θ u f ρ w h w θ i ρ i h i θ a ρ a h a 1 ε ρ s h s h i h w t δ l f ρ i θ i t t t t z θ u f h w ρ w v z c t z where ρ w is the density of water kgm 3 hw is the specific heat of water jkg 1k 1 ρ i is the density of ice kgm 3 hi is the

approach quantifies the effect of cryosuction on flow and the effect of matric potential on freezing point depression without an underlying physical explanation for the soil freezing curve we use the exponential equation of mckenzie et al 2007 eq 4 only the fitting parameter w is needed to approximate the freezing curve of a soil with this equation the rationale for an empirical approach is that the model can easily be calibrated to better fit data in addition it is not affected by assumptions such as thermal equilibrium phase change which is the case for the physically based sfc also an empirical sfc can more easily be applied to non colloidal soils via calibration to simulate cryosuction in the empirical version we make use of eq 7 cryosuction entails both matric potential changes and the resulting flow of water we assume the empirical cryosuction expression represents the observed upward flow correctly not the matric potential changes itself hence it incorporates a possible flow impedance effect due to ice content this approach circumvents the numerical instability associated with the extreme hydraulic gradient at the frozen fringe when using the clausius clapeyron relationship by combining the exponential sfc equation and the empirical cryosuction expression we thus have an empirical approach requiring two parameters w for the sfc and c k for cryosuction the question is whether c k can be generalized for a variety of soil types or if it should be soil type specific we will investigate this by testing the empirical and semi empirical approach on three different experimental datasets later described we will also include a small sensitivity analysis to the parameter c k 3 1 5 freezing approach semi empirical version the semi empirical approach that we use contains the same empirical expression for cryosuction but it is combined with a physically based expression for the sfc we use eq 2 shown above and originally formulated by zhang et al 2016 in which the clausius clapeyron relationship is incorporated into the van genuchten soil water retention expression the freezing curve of the soil is hence determined by the common van genuchten soil water retention parameters a and n the only unsaturated freezing related parameter to be calibrated for the semi empirical version is therefore c k for cryosuction 3 1 6 freezing approach physically based version for the physically based version we use the expressions from dall amico et al 2011 to determine cryosuction first the freezing temperature is determined by 13 t t 0 g t 0 l f ψ t o t w where t k is the freezing point of water at the current matric pressure based on total water content ψ totw and g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 subsequently matric pressure including the effect of ice is determined by the following expression 14 ψ t ψ t o t w l f g t t t if t t the equation collapses to ψ t ψ totw the van genuchten based sfc eq 2 is used to determine the soil freezing curve hence both matric potential and freezing point depression are based on the physical relationship between temperature and pressure however similar to other studies kurulyk and watanabe 2013 we found that the extreme hydraulic gradient at the frozen fringe led to a strong overprediction of upward flow therefore we developed a simple approach to solve this using the ice impedance factor combined with the concept of a soil structure discontinuity in the context of spatial discretization in any numerical model solving differential equations soil water and heat transport need to be discretized in time and space if water flows from a discretized location a to a location b the hydraulic driving force between these points and the hydraulic conductivity of location a determine the flow rate this premise would hold if the soil represented by location b has the same hydrological properties as location a in case of ice in the soil however the assumption of soil homogeneity cannot hold if location b would be partly frozen certain flow paths could be blocked as larger pores freeze first the inflow rate is no longer dependent on the hydraulic conductivity of location a alone therefore a special hydraulic conductivity reduction is needed for the frozen location that receives soil water we limited the flow rate of water to ice filled soil volumes with the following formula developed by zhao et al 2013 15 k m 10 r i θ i θ t k u f where km is the maximum hydraulic conductivity ms 1 for flow towards a frozen soil volume and r i is the impedance factor for flowrate reduction due to ice in the soil pores we will assess to which extent r i varies with soil type 3 2 model testing 3 2 1 numerical method to ensure proper functioning of the numerical method we successfully compared the output of the model to the established models sutra voss and provost 2002 and hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 1998 for unsaturated flow and heat transport during nonfrozen conditions and for fully saturated frozen conditions only sutra the resulting comparisons are given in the appendix 3 2 2 experimental data we make use of the experimental data of mizoguchi 1990 watanabe et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 to test the approaches for frozen unsaturated conditions all experimental soil columns were insulated and closed systems frost heave was not observed in any of the experiments the soil properties and boundary conditions of the experiments are listed in table 3 the parameters w and r i were manually calibrated for each soil type if a soil parameter was unknown this was manually calibrated as well mentioned in table 3 for the datasets of watanabe et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 we compare the empirical and the van genuchten based sfc to the measured unfrozen water contents at several subzero temperatures the simulated sfc s for mizoguchi 1990 will also be shown but without measured unfrozen water content for comparison regarding the c k parameter we investigated whether a single empirical value could capture the cryosuction observed in the experiments we tested for a range of c k values that would provide a water distribution that visually matched the experimental results this range was between a value of 1 and 3 we include a small sensitivity test of the empirical cryosuction parameter to show how we established a single value for c k for all experiments mizoguchi 1990 used a 20 cm high soil column filled with kanagawa sandy loam it was frozen from the top with a temperature of 6 c while the soil had an initial temperature of 6 7 c only total water content was measured in this experiment several authors used the dataset of mizoguchi for model testing such as dall amico et al 2011 and hansson et al 2008 we include the model results from dall amico et al 2011 for this experiment by comparing the three versions to their model results we can assess how well the different mathematical expressions compare with the approach of dall amico who used the clausius clapeyron relationship to simulate cryosuction eq 8 with an equation splitting method combined with the numerical newton method furthermore we will include the output from sutra ice for this experimental setup sutra ice is a multi dimensional saturated and unsaturated water and heat transport model that includes the depression of the freezing point of water but not the process of cryosuction by comparing the results of our model to sutra ice we can assess the effect of cryosuction on simulated soil physics such as soil temperature and ice content watanabe et al 2012 did a freezing experiment on a soil column of 35 cm deep the soil comes from the a horizon of a weeded fallow field and is characterized by a high porosity three different columns were prepared each with a different initial water content 0 31 0 38 and 0 46 the column was brought to a homogenous temperature of 3 5 c and subsequently frozen from the top with a temperature of 6 2 c the bottom of the column was in contact with a temperature element set to 2 c measurements were done after 48 h and included total water content and unfrozen water content zhou et al 2014 performed a freezing soil column experiment on a sieved glacial till sieve size 0 063 mm the 24 cm high column initially had a temperature of 3 c and the experiment was performed with two different initial water contents 0 16 and 0 325 for these two different initial water content setups freezing temperatures of 4 and 4 7 c were respectively applied at the top total water content unfrozen water content ice content and soil temperature were measured 24 and 72 h after freezing started the parameters for saturated hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity are unknown for this experiment and are therefore estimated based on soil type and subsequently slightly adjusted via manual calibration 4 results 4 1 comparison of simulated sfc to measurements the different sfc curves corresponding to the simulations and the different experiments are shown in fig 1 with the experiment of watanabe et al 2012 the empirical sfc equation did not perform well without adjustment when the measured residual water content during drying is used the empirical sfc severely underpredicts the unfrozen water content fig 1 therefore we changed the unfrozen residual water content for the empirical sfc to 0 07 sfc exp2 instead of 0 006 sfc exp after this adjustment it is still apparent that the sfc underpredicts the unfrozen water content as shown in fig 1 a higher w value for the sfc does not solve the problem sfc exp3 as it creates a too steep decrease in unfrozen water content with decreasing temperature in general the empirical sfc displays a near linear relationship between unfrozen water content and temperature that quickly reaches the residual water content at relatively high subzero temperature the van genuchten based sfc on the contrary displays a more gradual decrease in unfrozen water content at lower subzero temperatures and even at 8 c the residual water content is not reached with the experiment of zhou et al 2014 the empirical sfc and the van genuchten sfc represent the measured unfrozen water contents well in the experiment of mizoguchi 1990 no unfrozen water content measurements were performed to compare the results with but it is also clear that the empirical sfc predicts reaching a residual water content at a much higher temperature than the van genuchten based sfc a crucial difference between the two sfc approaches thus seems apparent in the high matric potential range corresponding to low temperatures below 1 c 4 2 calibration results the calibration results table 4 show that w varied for the different soil types used in the experiments the c k parameter was kept at a fixed value of 1 8 to obtain accurate results it was important to calibrate the impedance factor r i for each soil type specifically as otherwise the predicted cryosuction was noticeably under or overpredicted 4 3 mizoguchi 1990 the comparisons with the measurements of the experiment by mizoguchi 1990 and the simulated outputs of the three approaches in this study sutra ice and the numerical model by dall amico et al 2011 are shown in fig 2 with all three approaches used in this study the distribution of total water content after 12 24 and 50 h is in good agreement with measurements each performing slightly better than the model of dall amico et al 2011 the variation amongst the empirical semi empirical and physically based approaches is small the depth to which cryosuction affects the water distribution in all simulations seems to align well with the measured water content profile as can be expected sutra ice does not reproduce the cryosuction based increase of total water content within the frozen zone also shown in fig 2 are the ice contents and soil temperature profiles of our model and sutra ice the frozen zone as well as the zero degree temperature isotherm is deeper in the sutra ice simulation although the vertical extent of the frozen zone is larger the ice content is lower in the sutra ice simulation compared to our model simulation 4 4 watanabe et al 2012 the comparison between simulated output the measurements in the experiment of watanabe et al 2012 are shown in fig 3 all versions of the model perform reasonably well to simulate the observed total and unfrozen water contents for the three different initial water content setups some deviation can be seen with the empirical version as the unfrozen water content is underpredicted the unfrozen water content drops sharply above 23 cm elevation in the empirical version while the other versions and the measurements display a more gradual decrease in unfrozen water content above this point 4 5 zhou et al 2014 figs 4 and 5 compare the output of the simulations to the experiment of zhou et al 2014 for two different initial water contents and at two different measurement times in general model results are in good agreement with observed values all three versions predict the increase of water in the frozen zone and other output variables with reasonable accuracy the variation amongst the different versions is noticeable but small the model however struggles to capture some of the observed cryosuction in the lower initial water content setup as there is a strong deviation of the total water content in the lower section of the freezing front after 3 days fig 4 the model in general predicts a mild increase of total water content with depth in the frozen zone while the experimental data suggests that there was a steep increase in water content at the freezing front depth 12 14 cm after the first day the physically based version performed slightly better in this case than the empirical and semi empirical approach this could imply that the empirical cryosuction expression should take total water content into account to determine the effect of ice on matric potential for this reason we tested with an adapted cryosuction equation for the semi empirical approach that is dependent on total water saturation 16 ψ t ψ u f 1 θ i θ t o t w c i 2 where ci represents the effect of ice on matric pressure we found a value of 0 8 for ci to match the observed cryosuction across the different experiments the result of substituting eq 7 with eq 16 is included in fig 4 cf s2 for all other cases results remained roughly unchanged with eq 16 as the simulated cryosuction was similar these results are therefore not shown the adjusted equation captured the increase of cryosuction with depth better for the dry scenario but only for the result after 72 h 4 6 sensitivity to the empirical cryosuction parameter in addition to the calibrated value for ck of 1 8 the following values were tested 1 1 5 2 5 and 3 we used these ck values in the simulations of several of the experimental setups with the empirical approach the results are shown in fig 6 it is clear that between a ck of 1 to 3 the results are within reasonable accuracy compared to measurements but the midpoint covering the observed cryosuction in all experiments appears to be around the calibrated ck value of 1 8 the band of results differs for each experiment as it is narrow below the frozen zone for watanabe et al 2012 and mizoguchi 1990 but wide for zhou et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 general model performance the model is capable of simulating three different unsaturated soil freezing experiments with reasonable accuracy these experiments have different initial water content freezing intensity and soil type the three versions of the model predict the penetration depth of the freezing front with 1 centimeter accuracy in most cases the ice content and total water contents are predicted reasonably well with an accuracy of about 0 05 m3 m3 it can thus be concluded that a simple freezing extension of a common soil water and heat transport model based on the richard s equation is an adequate means of simulating freezing soil the differences in accuracy amongst the empirical semi empirical and physically based approach are small but noticeable there is no approach that consistently performs better when considering all cases 5 2 empirical approach the empirical sfc equation mckenzie et al 2007 combined with the empirical cryosuction equation kulik 1978 circumvents the use of the more complex clausius clapeyron relationship while the results show it can adequately capture the freezing process of unsaturated soil a promising result is that a fixed parameter value for cryosuction ck set to 1 8 simulated cryosuction well compared to measurements even though the experiments only represented three soil types it suggests that in most cases at least within the textural range of a sandy loam silt loam and loamy silt no soil type specific calibration would be required this eases the applicability of this approach to a wide range of situations only one case showed underpredicted cryosuction when the soil started with a low initial water content of 0 16 adjusting the cryosuction equation eq 7 to include a dependency of the cryosuction effect on total water content eq 16 improved the fit slightly such a dependency on total water content could be expected because there are significant changes in matric potential with changing unfrozen water content in the low water content range of a soil water retention curve i e the effect of changes in ice content on matric potential could be stronger at low total water content the exponential sfc requires soil type specific calibration of the empirical sfc parameter w it also became clear that though the empirical exponential sfc works well in most cases it tends to underpredict the unfrozen water content in a fine soil in this specific case a loamy silt the unfrozen residual water content is quickly reached at relatively high subzero temperature between 0 and 1 c the residual unfrozen water content should be set to a different value than the unsaturated residual water content to avoid a drop to residual unfrozen water content too quickly this unfortunately limits the applicability of the exponential sfc to soils with weak soil water retention if an accurate unfrozen water content and thus ice content is desired in soils with strong soil water tension such as clays and silts the matric potential will increase significantly at lower unfrozen water contents leading to a strong depression of the freezing point of water for this reason the exponential sfc could not capture the sfc of a silt loam well 5 3 semi empirical approach the advantage of the semi empirical approach is that it uses the empirical cryosuction equation but it relies on the clausius clapeyron relationship to determine the freezing point of water this means the depression of the freezing point of water is thus based on the well known physics of phase change the van genuchten based sfc in combination with the empirical cryosuction equation worked well in all cases considered except for the low initial water content case the van genuchten based sfc captures the measured sfcs better than the empirical sfc equation and it provides a more realistic drop of unfrozen water content at low subzero temperatures with this approach residual unfrozen water content is reached at significantly lower subzero temperatures compared to the exponential sfc another benefit of the semi empirical approach is that it does not require a special parameter for the sfc hence only the ck parameter is needed since the empirical cryosuction equation predicts cryosuction well with a fixed value for ck it is implied that this approach does not need calibration of a freezing related soil parameter 5 4 physically based approach by limiting the flow of unfrozen water to the frozen zone with an impedance function we were able to simulate cryosuction based on the clausius clapeyron relationship in a simple numerical model with good accuracy in all cases results were in good agreement with observations only at the onset of freezing the impedance factor tends to limit the flow towards the freezing front slightly too strongly in some cases the main advantage of the physically based approach is that it relies on the underlying physics of the temperature pressure phase change relationship for both the freezing point depression and cryosuction and it should therefore be widely applicable the disadvantage is that at least in our case it requires reduction of flow to the frozen zone via an empirical impedance factor the impedance factor is an empirical soil type specific parameter and as we noted there is debate about the validity of its use we used the impedance factor as a representation of reduced soil porosity in the frozen soil akin to a soil heterogeneity in our approach the impedance parameter had to vary for the different soil types in the experiment to capture the cryosuction process well an alternative approach could be the dual porosity model used by watanabe et al 2010 a next step in a physically based approach would likely involve changing the soil hydrological properties based on ice content as it can be expected that the soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity would change with increasing ice content noh et al 2012 but this would require further experimental study 5 5 the importance of simulating cryosuction by comparing the results of our model to sutra ice which does not simulate cryosuction we could identify the effect it had on total water content ice content and temperature cryosuction logically increases the total water content in the frozen zone accordingly it slows down the freezing front as the heat capacity of the upper soil is increased and more energy is used for phase change consequently in sutra ice the freezing front progresses faster and the frozen zone becomes larger though with a lower ice content this implies that without cryosuction the frozen zone has a higher permeability and more space for accommodating infiltrating water of practical concern in flood risk assessment cryosuction thus strongly affects the infiltration capacity of a soil our study however is based on medium to fine textured soils in the range of loam and silt it can be expected that for coarse soils such as sand in which gravitational drainage significantly precedes cryosuction the effect of cryosuction on total water content is strongly diminished in very fine soils such as clays cryosuction has been found to play a limited role as well due to very low hydraulic conductivity preventing water redistribution miller 1980 6 conclusion in this study a simple 1d numerical model is used to simulate water and heat transport with phase change in unsaturated soil via three different approaches empirical semi empirical and physically based these approaches constitute new combinations of previously developed equations the fully empirical approach uses an empirical exponential function for the soil freezing curve sfc and an empirical function for cryosuction we found that the empirical sfc underpredicts unfrozen water content for fine soils at low subzero temperatures below 1 c leading to a loss of accuracy the advantage of this approach is that it does not require accurate soil water retention parameters to work and that it does not rely on the assumptions associated with the clausius clapeyron approach such as thermal phase and mechanic equilibrium the semi empirical approach uses the van genuchten soil water retention model combined with the clapeyron relationship for the sfc while cryosuction is based on the empirical equation since the cryosuction equation worked well with the same parameter value for a sandy loam silt loam and loamy silt the main advantage of this approach seems to be that calibration of a soil type related freezing parameter can be avoided the van genuchten based sfc also performs better at temperatures below 1 c as it more accurately links matric pressure to the freezing point depression therefore if correct unfrozen water content is desired for freezing soils with significant fine particle content the semi empirical approach is preferred the physically based approach was used in our numerical scheme by regarding a frozen soil volume as a soil discontinuity similar to other studies it was also necessary to use an impedance function in order to not overpredict upward flow kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the main advantage of this approach is that it is more physically based and therefore should be more widely applicable to different freezing circumstances although it requires soil type calibration of the impedance factor the suggested approaches are useful for large scale models in the simulation of frozen unsaturated soil depending on available soil data and model scale an empirical semi empirical or physically based approach could be preferred correct simulation of ice and water content is relevant in case of determining soil infiltration capacity and possible contaminant pathways in addition by simulating cryosuction correctly it will be possible to predict zones of increased total water content which are thus susceptible to ice lensing and frost heave further modeling studies could investigate soil freezing and thawing dynamics in relation to actual infiltration of rain and meltwater which has received little attention an important topic would for example be freezing of infiltrating water which would lower infiltration capacity but add significant amounts of energy as latent heat credit authorship contribution statement joris c stuurop writing original draft methodology investigation sjoerd

336,freezing of unsaturated soil is an important process that influences runoff and infiltration in cold climate regions we used a simple numerical model to simulate water and heat transport with phase change in unsaturated soil via three different approaches empirical semi empirical and physically based we compared the performance and parameterization of each approach through testing on three experimental datasets all approaches reproduced the observed unsaturated freezing process satisfactorily the empirical cryosuction equation used in this study managed to capture observed cryosuction with a fixed empirical parameter value the semi empirical version therefore does not require calibration of a specific frozen soil related parameter in view of simplicity small computational demand

altering pathways and soil water retention times evans et al 2018 french et al 2002 french and binley 2004 hayashi et al 2013 ireson et al 2013 in order to predict and understand increased flood risk groundwater recharge and contaminant transport in areas with frozen soil it is therefore necessary to have sufficient understanding of the mechanisms that control soil freezing thawing and infiltration the part of a soil that generally undergoes seasonal freezing and thawing extends from a few centimeters to about a meter or several meters below the surface loranger et al 2017 lundberg et al 2016 hayashi 2013 this mostly comprises the unsaturated zone where moisture content and soil temperature respond to atmospheric dynamics on a relatively short timescale of hours to days carson 1961 it has been demonstrated that the initial moisture and temperature state of the soil when freezing initiates affect frost depth and soil ice saturation ireson et al 2013 cryosuction is an important process in this context as it depends on initial moisture content soil water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity miller and black 2003 cryosuction can be described as the increase in matric suction in the frozen zone with increasing ice content resulting in a redistribution of soil moisture to the freezing front from unfrozen soil below hayashi 2013 another process of importance in frozen soil is the depression of the freezing point of water due to matric pressure there is a relationship between subzero temperature and unfrozen water content in the soil which is represented by the soil freezing curve sfc li et al 2010 jame and norum 1972 koopmans and miller 1966 the presence of solutes can also affect freezing temperature rango and dewalle 2008 lastly the reduction in soil permeability with increasing ice saturation is a characteristic of a frozen soil watanabe and flury 2008 different approaches have been developed to incorporate cryosuction the soil freezing curve and permeability reduction into a numerical or mathematical model kurylyk and watanabe 2013 examples include the models of harlan 1973 taylor and luthin 1978 ippisch 2001 zhang et al 2007 and dall amico et al 2011 publicly available numerical models include a freezing module for hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 1998 a beta version of sutra named sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 and the atmosphere plant soil models shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 and coup jansson and karlberg 2004 sutra ice does not currently include the process of cryosuction and hydrus 1d freezing only works for unsaturated conditions kurylyk and watanabe 2013 noted that the history of frozen soil model development has been characterized by inconsistencies in nomenclature and methodology in part due to different geotechnical and hydrological backgrounds it remains unclear how different mathematical expressions and models for unsaturated soil freezing processes compare to each other in their ability to accurately represent an unsaturated frozen soil an exception to this is the paper by ren et al 2017 in which the outcomes of different sfc equations are fitted to measurements on four different frozen soils regarding the reduction of permeability of frozen soil there is debate about the use of a flow impedance factor based on ice content mohammed et al 2018 furthermore previous models are often tested only on a single experimental dataset which did not include all relevant variables such as ice content and soil temperature mohammed et al 2018 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 as a result confidence in model accuracy remains limited and it remains unclear how the model would be parameterized for a different soil than the soil used in the experiment e g the impedance factor another unresolved question is whether an empirical approach towards unsaturated soil freezing and cryosuction could be adequate and how such an approach would compare to more physically based models using the phase change temperature pressure relationship kurylyk and watanabe 2013 this question is relevant as few multi dimensional hydrological models catchment scale models or land surface schemes have adopted approaches for unsaturated soil freezing likely due to the complexity and often associated numerical instability of physically based simulation of unsaturated soil freezing in this study we compare three different approaches for unsaturated soil freezing these represent a fully empirical a semi empirical and a physically based approach and entail different combinations of previously developed equations the aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the performance and parameterization of each approach datasets from three experiments are used for testing namely those of mizoguchi 1990 watanabe et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 the latter two datasets contain measurements of ice content unfrozen water content and soil temperature which allows us to test for all relevant variables we include a discussion of current points of debate concerning the governing equations for unsaturated frozen soil dynamics as the different approaches rely on previous insights and developments in both empirical and physically based equations 2 current theory and points of debate 2 1 soil freezing curve not all soil moisture freezes at the same temperature due to the dependency of the freezing point of water on pressure hayashi 2013 matric pressure increases with decreasing unfrozen water content as ice replaces water this has been found to resemble the process of soil drying koopmans and miller 1966 the soil freezing curve sfc gives the relationship between subzero temperature and unfrozen water content for a given soil the lower the temperature the less water remains unfrozen ren et al 2017 spaans and baker 1996 the following form of the clausius clapeyron relationship relates pressure to temperature williams and smith 1989 1 d p w d t l f t 273 15 v w where p w is the pressure of liquid water pa t is the temperature c l f is the latent heat of fusion jkg 1 and v w is the specific volume of liquid water m3kg 1 the change in pressure of the ice phase is assumed to be zero furthermore it requires the assumption of thermal mechanic and phase equilibrium during freezing these constraints in the context of frozen soil modeling are discussed in ma et al 2015 expressions for the sfc have been formulated that combine the clapeyron relationship with existing equations for soil water retention during drying wetting an example is from zhang et al 2016 who combined the clapeyron relationship with the van genuchten equation 2 θ u f θ r e s θ s a t θ r e s 1 a v g l f ρ w ln t 273 15 t 0 273 15 n v g m v g where θ uf is the unfrozen water content m3m 3 θ res is the residual total water content m3m 3 θ sat is the saturated total water content m3m 3 ρ w is the density of water kgm 3 t is the temperature c t 0 the freezing point of water c and avg nvg and mvg are fitted model parameters several empirical sfc expressions have been proposed that do not make use of the clausius clapeyron relationship the simplest approach is a linear piecewise relationship between temperature and unfrozen water which has been found to reasonably approximate measured sfc datapoints mckenzie et al 2007 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 anderson and tice 1972 developed an empirical power curve to express unfrozen water content as a function of temperature 3 θ u f ρ d ρ w α t β where ρd is the dry density of the soil kgm 3 and α and β are model parameters the power curve has been used in several models and parameter values for a wide range of soils have been established as well as a method to derive the parameters from the specific surface area of a soil kurylyk and watanabe 2013 in the model sutra ice an empirical exponential function for the unfrozen water content is implemented this function has been suggested by mckenzie et al 2007 based on work by lunardini 1988 4 θ u f θ r e s θ s a t θ r e s exp t t 0 w 2 where w is a fitting parameter it is difficult however to know the correct value for w in eq 4 as very few soils have been parameterized through experimental work ren et al 2017 hence it is a parameter that often requires calibration ren et al 2017 provides a verification of four different sfc expressions on experimental data the sfc expressions of eq 2 3 and 4 included the study shows that all three expressions work well with some slightly better than others depending on soil type 2 2 reduction of hydraulic conductivity several studies have shown that a frozen soil has reduced permeability and that initial water content is important among other factors e g pittman et al 2019 watanabe and osada 2017 but the mathematical representation of the reduction of soil hydraulic conductivity due to freezing remains a point of debate the lack of consensus might exist due to different reasons 1 it is difficult to accurately measure the permeability of a frozen soil hence experimental evidence is scarce azmatch et al 2012 watanabe and osada 2017 2 ice growth in soil voids may have different effects on permeability for different soil types and different initial moisture contents and therefore a single type of reduction may not apply to all soils and moisture conditions 3 soil freezing rate a factor usually not taken into account likely plays a role as it determines how ice crystallizes in soil voids azmatch et al 2012 4 soil structure can be altered by ice lens growth and it is hard to predict how this affects soil hydrological properties mohammed et al 2018 two different causes may be distinguished for a reduced permeability of a frozen soil assuming fixed total water content and no frost heave 1 with decreased unfrozen water content porewater connectivity decreases analogous to air saturation of a soil stähli 2006 lundberg et al 2016 hayashi 2013 2 with an increased ice content the pore geometry changes due to an increase in the solid ice soil constituent certain flow pathways become blocked and effective pore size is reduced zhang et al 2016 azmatch et al 2012 it has been argued that the second set of factors are not different from permeability reduction upon increasing air saturation and that therefore the unfrozen water content of a soil can be used to predict the permeability of frozen soil accurately e g newman and wilson 1997 watanabe and flury 2008 a hydraulic conductivity function derived from the soil water retention curve is therefore used by most models kurylyk and watanabe 2013 some studies however suggest that the unfrozen water content approach overpredicts the permeability at high ice contents these studies suggest that ice blockage of flow paths should be taken into account e g jame and norum 1972 lundin 1990 hansson et al 2004 zhang et al 2007 shoop and bigl 1996 for this reason an impedance factor has been introduced to correct for the additional reduction in permeability due to ice kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the impedance factor approach by jame and norum 1972 for example considers ice content in addition to unfrozen water content 5 k f 10 r i θ i k u f where kf ms 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of partly frozen soil k uf ms 1 is the hydraulic conductivity based on the unfrozen water content θi is the volumetric ice content m3m 3 and e i is a dimensionless empirical factor of impedance due to ice blockage of pores zhang et al 2007 found that including an impedance factor e i 17 was crucial to accurately describe observed moisture transport in the soil during freezing several variations of the impedance equation eq 5 have been developed e g taylor and luthin 1978 but without much added clarity of a most reliable expression shoop and bigl 1997 suggested the following equation to determine e i based on data collected from nine different non cohesive soils 6 r i 5 4 k sat 3 2 6 where k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity ms 1 the impedance factor approach has been criticized by newman and wilson 1997 to be arbitrary and not physically based it is also suggested that it is simply a parameter to correct a numerical model for overestimated cryosuction based on the clausius clapeyron approach as the extreme hydraulic gradient at the frozen fringe is difficult to simulate in a numerical model miller 1980 in addition watanabe and flury 2008 claimed that the use of an impedance factor should be unnecessary when an accurate relative permeability function is used related to unfrozen water content though they also stated that it is a topic of ongoing research several researchers have come up with alternative approaches due to the criticisms surrounding the impedance factor kurylyk and watanabe 2013 an example is watanabe et al 2010 who successfully employed the dual porosity model of durner 1994 to simulate the hydraulic conductivity of a frozen unsaturated silt soil the closure and opening of macropores has also been recognized as an important factor determining water flow in frozen soil by several studies e g mohammed et al 2018 holten 2019 pittman et al 2020 demand et al 2019 which requires a dual porosity approach to incorporate in a numerical model in our study we will assess the need for the impedance factor in a physically based approach as a means to represent a soil ice saturation heterogeneity in an otherwise homogeneous soil i e water flowing from unfrozen to frozen soil 2 3 cryosuction there is no consensus on the most suitable representation of cryosuction in a soil freezing model kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the process is often associated with extreme hydraulic gradients requiring high spatial discretization to successfully simulate in a numerical model in some approaches matric suction is increased based on ice content through an empirical equation to simulate the effect of cryosuction on water redistribution e g zhang et al 2007 the following empirical equation for cryosuction was originally developed by kulik 1970 7 ψ t ψ u f 1 c k θ i 2 where ψ t m is the total matric pressure of the soil including the effect of cryosuction ψ uf m is the matric pressure due to total water content without the effect of possible ice present and c k is an empirical factor that represents the effect of ice on matric pressure a more novel suggestion is that soil properties should be altered through a change in soil water retention parameters and soil porosity the ice free volume noh et al 2012 in most previous numerical models however matric suction is a function of subzero temperature based on the clausius clapeyron relationship eq 1 dall amico et al 2011 uses the following version of the clausius clapeyron relationship to determine matric pressure 8 ψ t l f g t 0 t t 0 where g the gravitational constant ms 2 in case of unsaturated conditions the expression is modified to account for the matric suction resulting from air saturation in the pores most other cryosuction expressions using the clausius clapeyron relationship do not adjust for different total water saturation levels dall amico et al 2011 in this paper we will use both the empirical and physically based clausius clapeyron approaches to cryosuction for comparison 3 methods all abbreviations or symbols used for variables and parameters are listed in table 1 fixed parameters used in the model are listed in table 2 3 1 governing equations of the model 3 1 1 model structure and assumptions a numerical model was used that calculates heat and water transport for a one dimensional soil profile with any number of layers vertical discretization of the layers was set to one centimeter with uniform soil properties for the entire column heat transport occurs at the top and bottom boundary where a fixed temperature boundary can be set there is no water flow possible across the model boundaries the mathematical equations are solved through explicit difference calculation for the fluxes between soil volumes this method increases numerical stability and simplicity but it requires high temporal discretization to maintain accuracy yang et al 2009 successfully used a similar numerical method in their simulations of unsaturated flow governed by the richards equation in our case it appeared to be an adequate model construct for the purpose of 1d laboratory type soil column simulations with freezing the model excludes osmotic processes and density changes of unfrozen water also porosity and soil structure do not change with ice saturation as ice pressure is assumed to be constant 3 1 2 unsaturated flow flow between soil volumes is governed by the richard s equation here presented in its 1 dimensional form richards 1931 9 θ t o t w t z k u f θ u f ψ t z 1 where θ totw is the total water content liquid and ice m3m 3 z is the elevation m ψ tot is the total matric pressure m and kuf θ uf is the hydraulic conductivity ms 1 as a function of the unfrozen water content and also ice content if an impedance factor is used the matric pressure of a soil volume is a state variable that depends on total water content in our case given by the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 10 ψ u f 1 a v g θ s a t θ r e s θ t o t w θ r e s n v g n v g 1 1 1 n v g where a m 1 and n are model parameters hydraulic conductivity the k θ uf term in eq 8 is calculated with the following equation which derives from the relationship between the relative permeability function of the mualem van genuchten model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the unfrozen water content 11 k u f k s a t θ s a t θ r e s θ u f θ r e s 0 5 1 1 θ s a t θ r e s θ u f θ r e s n v g 1 n v g n v g 1 n v g 2 where kuf is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil ms 1 the effect of temperature on hydraulic conductivity by affecting the viscosity of water is neglected 3 1 3 energy exchange there are three forms of energy exchange in the model that govern the energy balance thermal conduction advection and latent heat flux these are expressed in the following general energy balance equation 12 t t θ u f ρ w h w θ i ρ i h i θ a ρ a h a 1 ε ρ s h s h i h w t δ l f ρ i θ i t t t t z θ u f h w ρ w v z c t z where ρ w is the density of water kgm 3 hw is the specific heat of water jkg 1k 1 ρ i is the density of ice kgm 3 hi is the specific heat of ice jkg 1k 1 θ a is the volumetric air content ρ a is the density of air kgm 3 ha is the specific heat of air jkg 1k 1 ε is porosity ρ s is the density of solid soil kgm 3 hs is the specific heat of solid soil jkg 1k 1 c is the average thermal conductivity of the soil wm 1k 1 v is the flow velocity of unfrozen water ms 1 lf is the latent heat of fusion jkg 1 and z is the elevation m thermal dispersion is assumed to be negligible for heat transfer in small scale unsaturated soil liu et al 2014 jouybari et al 2020 3 1 4 freezing approach empirical version the empirical approach quantifies the effect of cryosuction on flow and the effect of matric potential on freezing point depression without an underlying physical explanation for the soil freezing curve we use the exponential equation of mckenzie et al 2007 eq 4 only the fitting parameter w is needed to approximate the freezing curve of a soil with this equation the rationale for an empirical approach is that the model can easily be calibrated to better fit data in addition it is not affected by assumptions such as thermal equilibrium phase change which is the case for the physically based sfc also an empirical sfc can more easily be applied to non colloidal soils via calibration to simulate cryosuction in the empirical version we make use of eq 7 cryosuction entails both matric potential changes and the resulting flow of water we assume the empirical cryosuction expression represents the observed upward flow correctly not the matric potential changes itself hence it incorporates a possible flow impedance effect due to ice content this approach circumvents the numerical instability associated with the extreme hydraulic gradient at the frozen fringe when using the clausius clapeyron relationship by combining the exponential sfc equation and the empirical cryosuction expression we thus have an empirical approach requiring two parameters w for the sfc and c k for cryosuction the question is whether c k can be generalized for a variety of soil types or if it should be soil type specific we will investigate this by testing the empirical and semi empirical approach on three different experimental datasets later described we will also include a small sensitivity analysis to the parameter c k 3 1 5 freezing approach semi empirical version the semi empirical approach that we use contains the same empirical expression for cryosuction but it is combined with a physically based expression for the sfc we use eq 2 shown above and originally formulated by zhang et al 2016 in which the clausius clapeyron relationship is incorporated into the van genuchten soil water retention expression the freezing curve of the soil is hence determined by the common van genuchten soil water retention parameters a and n the only unsaturated freezing related parameter to be calibrated for the semi empirical version is therefore c k for cryosuction 3 1 6 freezing approach physically based version for the physically based version we use the expressions from dall amico et al 2011 to determine cryosuction first the freezing temperature is determined by 13 t t 0 g t 0 l f ψ t o t w where t k is the freezing point of water at the current matric pressure based on total water content ψ totw and g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 subsequently matric pressure including the effect of ice is determined by the following expression 14 ψ t ψ t o t w l f g t t t if t t the equation collapses to ψ t ψ totw the van genuchten based sfc eq 2 is used to determine the soil freezing curve hence both matric potential and freezing point depression are based on the physical relationship between temperature and pressure however similar to other studies kurulyk and watanabe 2013 we found that the extreme hydraulic gradient at the frozen fringe led to a strong overprediction of upward flow therefore we developed a simple approach to solve this using the ice impedance factor combined with the concept of a soil structure discontinuity in the context of spatial discretization in any numerical model solving differential equations soil water and heat transport need to be discretized in time and space if water flows from a discretized location a to a location b the hydraulic driving force between these points and the hydraulic conductivity of location a determine the flow rate this premise would hold if the soil represented by location b has the same hydrological properties as location a in case of ice in the soil however the assumption of soil homogeneity cannot hold if location b would be partly frozen certain flow paths could be blocked as larger pores freeze first the inflow rate is no longer dependent on the hydraulic conductivity of location a alone therefore a special hydraulic conductivity reduction is needed for the frozen location that receives soil water we limited the flow rate of water to ice filled soil volumes with the following formula developed by zhao et al 2013 15 k m 10 r i θ i θ t k u f where km is the maximum hydraulic conductivity ms 1 for flow towards a frozen soil volume and r i is the impedance factor for flowrate reduction due to ice in the soil pores we will assess to which extent r i varies with soil type 3 2 model testing 3 2 1 numerical method to ensure proper functioning of the numerical method we successfully compared the output of the model to the established models sutra voss and provost 2002 and hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 1998 for unsaturated flow and heat transport during nonfrozen conditions and for fully saturated frozen conditions only sutra the resulting comparisons are given in the appendix 3 2 2 experimental data we make use of the experimental data of mizoguchi 1990 watanabe et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 to test the approaches for frozen unsaturated conditions all experimental soil columns were insulated and closed systems frost heave was not observed in any of the experiments the soil properties and boundary conditions of the experiments are listed in table 3 the parameters w and r i were manually calibrated for each soil type if a soil parameter was unknown this was manually calibrated as well mentioned in table 3 for the datasets of watanabe et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 we compare the empirical and the van genuchten based sfc to the measured unfrozen water contents at several subzero temperatures the simulated sfc s for mizoguchi 1990 will also be shown but without measured unfrozen water content for comparison regarding the c k parameter we investigated whether a single empirical value could capture the cryosuction observed in the experiments we tested for a range of c k values that would provide a water distribution that visually matched the experimental results this range was between a value of 1 and 3 we include a small sensitivity test of the empirical cryosuction parameter to show how we established a single value for c k for all experiments mizoguchi 1990 used a 20 cm high soil column filled with kanagawa sandy loam it was frozen from the top with a temperature of 6 c while the soil had an initial temperature of 6 7 c only total water content was measured in this experiment several authors used the dataset of mizoguchi for model testing such as dall amico et al 2011 and hansson et al 2008 we include the model results from dall amico et al 2011 for this experiment by comparing the three versions to their model results we can assess how well the different mathematical expressions compare with the approach of dall amico who used the clausius clapeyron relationship to simulate cryosuction eq 8 with an equation splitting method combined with the numerical newton method furthermore we will include the output from sutra ice for this experimental setup sutra ice is a multi dimensional saturated and unsaturated water and heat transport model that includes the depression of the freezing point of water but not the process of cryosuction by comparing the results of our model to sutra ice we can assess the effect of cryosuction on simulated soil physics such as soil temperature and ice content watanabe et al 2012 did a freezing experiment on a soil column of 35 cm deep the soil comes from the a horizon of a weeded fallow field and is characterized by a high porosity three different columns were prepared each with a different initial water content 0 31 0 38 and 0 46 the column was brought to a homogenous temperature of 3 5 c and subsequently frozen from the top with a temperature of 6 2 c the bottom of the column was in contact with a temperature element set to 2 c measurements were done after 48 h and included total water content and unfrozen water content zhou et al 2014 performed a freezing soil column experiment on a sieved glacial till sieve size 0 063 mm the 24 cm high column initially had a temperature of 3 c and the experiment was performed with two different initial water contents 0 16 and 0 325 for these two different initial water content setups freezing temperatures of 4 and 4 7 c were respectively applied at the top total water content unfrozen water content ice content and soil temperature were measured 24 and 72 h after freezing started the parameters for saturated hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity are unknown for this experiment and are therefore estimated based on soil type and subsequently slightly adjusted via manual calibration 4 results 4 1 comparison of simulated sfc to measurements the different sfc curves corresponding to the simulations and the different experiments are shown in fig 1 with the experiment of watanabe et al 2012 the empirical sfc equation did not perform well without adjustment when the measured residual water content during drying is used the empirical sfc severely underpredicts the unfrozen water content fig 1 therefore we changed the unfrozen residual water content for the empirical sfc to 0 07 sfc exp2 instead of 0 006 sfc exp after this adjustment it is still apparent that the sfc underpredicts the unfrozen water content as shown in fig 1 a higher w value for the sfc does not solve the problem sfc exp3 as it creates a too steep decrease in unfrozen water content with decreasing temperature in general the empirical sfc displays a near linear relationship between unfrozen water content and temperature that quickly reaches the residual water content at relatively high subzero temperature the van genuchten based sfc on the contrary displays a more gradual decrease in unfrozen water content at lower subzero temperatures and even at 8 c the residual water content is not reached with the experiment of zhou et al 2014 the empirical sfc and the van genuchten sfc represent the measured unfrozen water contents well in the experiment of mizoguchi 1990 no unfrozen water content measurements were performed to compare the results with but it is also clear that the empirical sfc predicts reaching a residual water content at a much higher temperature than the van genuchten based sfc a crucial difference between the two sfc approaches thus seems apparent in the high matric potential range corresponding to low temperatures below 1 c 4 2 calibration results the calibration results table 4 show that w varied for the different soil types used in the experiments the c k parameter was kept at a fixed value of 1 8 to obtain accurate results it was important to calibrate the impedance factor r i for each soil type specifically as otherwise the predicted cryosuction was noticeably under or overpredicted 4 3 mizoguchi 1990 the comparisons with the measurements of the experiment by mizoguchi 1990 and the simulated outputs of the three approaches in this study sutra ice and the numerical model by dall amico et al 2011 are shown in fig 2 with all three approaches used in this study the distribution of total water content after 12 24 and 50 h is in good agreement with measurements each performing slightly better than the model of dall amico et al 2011 the variation amongst the empirical semi empirical and physically based approaches is small the depth to which cryosuction affects the water distribution in all simulations seems to align well with the measured water content profile as can be expected sutra ice does not reproduce the cryosuction based increase of total water content within the frozen zone also shown in fig 2 are the ice contents and soil temperature profiles of our model and sutra ice the frozen zone as well as the zero degree temperature isotherm is deeper in the sutra ice simulation although the vertical extent of the frozen zone is larger the ice content is lower in the sutra ice simulation compared to our model simulation 4 4 watanabe et al 2012 the comparison between simulated output the measurements in the experiment of watanabe et al 2012 are shown in fig 3 all versions of the model perform reasonably well to simulate the observed total and unfrozen water contents for the three different initial water content setups some deviation can be seen with the empirical version as the unfrozen water content is underpredicted the unfrozen water content drops sharply above 23 cm elevation in the empirical version while the other versions and the measurements display a more gradual decrease in unfrozen water content above this point 4 5 zhou et al 2014 figs 4 and 5 compare the output of the simulations to the experiment of zhou et al 2014 for two different initial water contents and at two different measurement times in general model results are in good agreement with observed values all three versions predict the increase of water in the frozen zone and other output variables with reasonable accuracy the variation amongst the different versions is noticeable but small the model however struggles to capture some of the observed cryosuction in the lower initial water content setup as there is a strong deviation of the total water content in the lower section of the freezing front after 3 days fig 4 the model in general predicts a mild increase of total water content with depth in the frozen zone while the experimental data suggests that there was a steep increase in water content at the freezing front depth 12 14 cm after the first day the physically based version performed slightly better in this case than the empirical and semi empirical approach this could imply that the empirical cryosuction expression should take total water content into account to determine the effect of ice on matric potential for this reason we tested with an adapted cryosuction equation for the semi empirical approach that is dependent on total water saturation 16 ψ t ψ u f 1 θ i θ t o t w c i 2 where ci represents the effect of ice on matric pressure we found a value of 0 8 for ci to match the observed cryosuction across the different experiments the result of substituting eq 7 with eq 16 is included in fig 4 cf s2 for all other cases results remained roughly unchanged with eq 16 as the simulated cryosuction was similar these results are therefore not shown the adjusted equation captured the increase of cryosuction with depth better for the dry scenario but only for the result after 72 h 4 6 sensitivity to the empirical cryosuction parameter in addition to the calibrated value for ck of 1 8 the following values were tested 1 1 5 2 5 and 3 we used these ck values in the simulations of several of the experimental setups with the empirical approach the results are shown in fig 6 it is clear that between a ck of 1 to 3 the results are within reasonable accuracy compared to measurements but the midpoint covering the observed cryosuction in all experiments appears to be around the calibrated ck value of 1 8 the band of results differs for each experiment as it is narrow below the frozen zone for watanabe et al 2012 and mizoguchi 1990 but wide for zhou et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 general model performance the model is capable of simulating three different unsaturated soil freezing experiments with reasonable accuracy these experiments have different initial water content freezing intensity and soil type the three versions of the model predict the penetration depth of the freezing front with 1 centimeter accuracy in most cases the ice content and total water contents are predicted reasonably well with an accuracy of about 0 05 m3 m3 it can thus be concluded that a simple freezing extension of a common soil water and heat transport model based on the richard s equation is an adequate means of simulating freezing soil the differences in accuracy amongst the empirical semi empirical and physically based approach are small but noticeable there is no approach that consistently performs better when considering all cases 5 2 empirical approach the empirical sfc equation mckenzie et al 2007 combined with the empirical cryosuction equation kulik 1978 circumvents the use of the more complex clausius clapeyron relationship while the results show it can adequately capture the freezing process of unsaturated soil a promising result is that a fixed parameter value for cryosuction ck set to 1 8 simulated cryosuction well compared to measurements even though the experiments only represented three soil types it suggests that in most cases at least within the textural range of a sandy loam silt loam and loamy silt no soil type specific calibration would be required this eases the applicability of this approach to a wide range of situations only one case showed underpredicted cryosuction when the soil started with a low initial water content of 0 16 adjusting the cryosuction equation eq 7 to include a dependency of the cryosuction effect on total water content eq 16 improved the fit slightly such a dependency on total water content could be expected because there are significant changes in matric potential with changing unfrozen water content in the low water content range of a soil water retention curve i e the effect of changes in ice content on matric potential could be stronger at low total water content the exponential sfc requires soil type specific calibration of the empirical sfc parameter w it also became clear that though the empirical exponential sfc works well in most cases it tends to underpredict the unfrozen water content in a fine soil in this specific case a loamy silt the unfrozen residual water content is quickly reached at relatively high subzero temperature between 0 and 1 c the residual unfrozen water content should be set to a different value than the unsaturated residual water content to avoid a drop to residual unfrozen water content too quickly this unfortunately limits the applicability of the exponential sfc to soils with weak soil water retention if an accurate unfrozen water content and thus ice content is desired in soils with strong soil water tension such as clays and silts the matric potential will increase significantly at lower unfrozen water contents leading to a strong depression of the freezing point of water for this reason the exponential sfc could not capture the sfc of a silt loam well 5 3 semi empirical approach the advantage of the semi empirical approach is that it uses the empirical cryosuction equation but it relies on the clausius clapeyron relationship to determine the freezing point of water this means the depression of the freezing point of water is thus based on the well known physics of phase change the van genuchten based sfc in combination with the empirical cryosuction equation worked well in all cases considered except for the low initial water content case the van genuchten based sfc captures the measured sfcs better than the empirical sfc equation and it provides a more realistic drop of unfrozen water content at low subzero temperatures with this approach residual unfrozen water content is reached at significantly lower subzero temperatures compared to the exponential sfc another benefit of the semi empirical approach is that it does not require a special parameter for the sfc hence only the ck parameter is needed since the empirical cryosuction equation predicts cryosuction well with a fixed value for ck it is implied that this approach does not need calibration of a freezing related soil parameter 5 4 physically based approach by limiting the flow of unfrozen water to the frozen zone with an impedance function we were able to simulate cryosuction based on the clausius clapeyron relationship in a simple numerical model with good accuracy in all cases results were in good agreement with observations only at the onset of freezing the impedance factor tends to limit the flow towards the freezing front slightly too strongly in some cases the main advantage of the physically based approach is that it relies on the underlying physics of the temperature pressure phase change relationship for both the freezing point depression and cryosuction and it should therefore be widely applicable the disadvantage is that at least in our case it requires reduction of flow to the frozen zone via an empirical impedance factor the impedance factor is an empirical soil type specific parameter and as we noted there is debate about the validity of its use we used the impedance factor as a representation of reduced soil porosity in the frozen soil akin to a soil heterogeneity in our approach the impedance parameter had to vary for the different soil types in the experiment to capture the cryosuction process well an alternative approach could be the dual porosity model used by watanabe et al 2010 a next step in a physically based approach would likely involve changing the soil hydrological properties based on ice content as it can be expected that the soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity would change with increasing ice content noh et al 2012 but this would require further experimental study 5 5 the importance of simulating cryosuction by comparing the results of our model to sutra ice which does not simulate cryosuction we could identify the effect it had on total water content ice content and temperature cryosuction logically increases the total water content in the frozen zone accordingly it slows down the freezing front as the heat capacity of the upper soil is increased and more energy is used for phase change consequently in sutra ice the freezing front progresses faster and the frozen zone becomes larger though with a lower ice content this implies that without cryosuction the frozen zone has a higher permeability and more space for accommodating infiltrating water of practical concern in flood risk assessment cryosuction thus strongly affects the infiltration capacity of a soil our study however is based on medium to fine textured soils in the range of loam and silt it can be expected that for coarse soils such as sand in which gravitational drainage significantly precedes cryosuction the effect of cryosuction on total water content is strongly diminished in very fine soils such as clays cryosuction has been found to play a limited role as well due to very low hydraulic conductivity preventing water redistribution miller 1980 6 conclusion in this study a simple 1d numerical model is used to simulate water and heat transport with phase change in unsaturated soil via three different approaches empirical semi empirical and physically based these approaches constitute new combinations of previously developed equations the fully empirical approach uses an empirical exponential function for the soil freezing curve sfc and an empirical function for cryosuction we found that the empirical sfc underpredicts unfrozen water content for fine soils at low subzero temperatures below 1 c leading to a loss of accuracy the advantage of this approach is that it does not require accurate soil water retention parameters to work and that it does not rely on the assumptions associated with the clausius clapeyron approach such as thermal phase and mechanic equilibrium the semi empirical approach uses the van genuchten soil water retention model combined with the clapeyron relationship for the sfc while cryosuction is based on the empirical equation since the cryosuction equation worked well with the same parameter value for a sandy loam silt loam and loamy silt the main advantage of this approach seems to be that calibration of a soil type related freezing parameter can be avoided the van genuchten based sfc also performs better at temperatures below 1 c as it more accurately links matric pressure to the freezing point depression therefore if correct unfrozen water content is desired for freezing soils with significant fine particle content the semi empirical approach is preferred the physically based approach was used in our numerical scheme by regarding a frozen soil volume as a soil discontinuity similar to other studies it was also necessary to use an impedance function in order to not overpredict upward flow kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the main advantage of this approach is that it is more physically based and therefore should be more widely applicable to different freezing circumstances although it requires soil type calibration of the impedance factor the suggested approaches are useful for large scale models in the simulation of frozen unsaturated soil depending on available soil data and model scale an empirical semi empirical or physically based approach could be preferred correct simulation of ice and water content is relevant in case of determining soil infiltration capacity and possible contaminant pathways in addition by simulating cryosuction correctly it will be possible to predict zones of increased total water content which are thus susceptible to ice lensing and frost heave further modeling studies could investigate soil freezing and thawing dynamics in relation to actual infiltration of rain and meltwater which has received little attention an important topic would for example be freezing of infiltrating water which would lower infiltration capacity but add significant amounts of energy as latent heat credit authorship contribution statement joris c stuurop writing original draft methodology investigation sjoerd

337,using generalizations of the cahn hilliard equation for modeling two phase flow in porous media at the pore scale has become popular due to its ability to capture interfacial effects by adding minimal complications here we use upscaled field equations and exploit the second law of thermodynamics in the spirit of rational thermodynamics to develop a framework that for two phases at the macroscale recovers the korteweg stress tensor for the liquid phase generalizes darcy s law and recovers the classical cahn hilliard equation the corresponding results for three phases at the macroscale are derived and are shown to be a generalization of richards equation and with appropriate simplifying assumptions are shown to recover the two phase results simplifying the results appropriately produces a pore scale model for two liquid phases and are shown to generalize previous works by cueto felgueroso and juanes and boyer and quintard et al the results are are also compared with the cahn hilliard brinkman equations where it is noted that to be physically consistent the state variable should represent a physical quantity one key aspect that distinguishes this formulation from others is that it captures the different energies of the three interfaces gas liquid gas solid and liquid solid without introducing the corresponding quantities at the microscale interfacial tension contact angle etc keywords two phase flow pporous media cahn hilliard cahn hilliard brinkman richards equation korteweg stress tensor 1 introduction for multiphase flow in soils probably the most commonly used equation is richards equation richards 1931 charbeneau 2000 a generalization of darcy s law where interfacial effects are incorporated by using a relative conductivity tensor and a capillary pressure saturation relationship it is the capillary pressure saturation relationship that makes this model difficult to work with experimental results indicate the capillary pressure saturation relationship exhibits hysteresis leading to either approximating the relationship by a non hysteretic relationship such as the brooks corey brooks and corey 1966 or van genuchten van genuchten 1980 relations or by solving a model incorporating hysteresis which requires special care to solve see e g peszynska and showalter 2020 other approaches include adding interfacial effects through additional field equations continuity momentum energy over the interface as has been done using hybrid mixture theory bennethum and cushman 1999 or thermodynamically constrained averaging theory tcat gray and miller 2014 miller and gray 2005 gray and miller 2011 these approaches add many more equations with corresponding additional parameters and although they have provided valuable insights adaptation of these models by the hydrology community has perhaps not been what was expected here we propose another model a macroscopic version of the cahn hilliard equation in developing this theory we use a methodical framework that generalizes what is already used in the hydrology and petroleum industry richards equation and simultaneously generalizes the two fluid no solid phase flow equations cahn hilliard equation and the two fluid stress tensor korteweg stress tensor using a methodical framework to develop the equations allows for future generalizations such as incorporating multi component fluids charged particles and deformation the cahn hilliard equation was originally designed to model phase separation in binary solutions in 1958 by cahn and hilliard 1958 although only strictly valid near the critical point of phase separation its simplicity and capability to reproduce interfacial effects makes it a robust tool to model two fluid phases liquid gas liquid liquid that captures interfacial effects it does so by adding an energy term resulting in a system that minimizes not only the energy due to variations of density through pressure but also due to the energy of the existence of the interface i e the energy is a function of the magnitude of the gradient of a density cahn and hilliard 1958 this density parameter is often normalized so that it is 1 when in one phase and 0 or 1 when in the other phase although often referred to as phase concentration boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 or just concentration elliott and french 1987 novick cohen 2008 we avoid this terminology so as to distinguish between components in a single phase measured in terms of concentration and immiscible fluids measured in terms of volume fraction here we shall refer to it as a state variable the system then minimizes with other forces negligible the surface area resulting in e g bubbles for a water gas system while conserving mass for two phase flow at the pore scale incorporating the additional gradient term is an alternative to employing e g the young laplace equation due to its pattern formation properties and the ability to view the equation as a gradient flow of the ginzburg landau free energy functional it has been used in many other applications such as tumor growth ebenbeck and garcke 2019 and two phase flow or mass exchange in a porous media cueto felgueroso et al 2014 2018 the cahn hilliard equation as written for a binary liquid mixture is given by cahn and hilliard 1958 1 c t f c α c where c is the state variable denotes the laplace operator α is a parameter related to the thickness of the transition region interface and f c is the derivative of the chemical potential energy of the system if the time derivative is replaced by the material time derivative d d t t v then the equation is known as the convective cahn hilliard equation equation 1 is often written as two equations 2 c t w 3 w f c α c and the energy of the system a functional of c is 4 e c ω f c 1 2 α c c where f c f c and f c is usually a quartic with local minima at the values of c denoting the two phases the system evolves so as to minimize the energy while conserving mass and it is these properties that are exploited to prove existence and develop numerical methods for solving the equation e g elliott and larsson 2007 feng and karakashian 2007 incorporating gradients of a state variable into the energy of the system results in a non classical form of the cauchy stress tensor of the fluid in order to be thermodynamically consistent de sobrino 1976 antanovskii 1995 the more commonly used form of the cauchy stress tensor t has the form t p i 2 μ d where p is pressure μ is the viscosity and d is the rate of deformation tensor or the symmetric part of the gradient of velocity malvern 1969 when this form of the cauchy stress tensor is substituted into the conservation of linear momentum the result is the navier stokes system of equations however if the gradient of the state variable is included in the energy then the result is a korteweg stress tensor or capillary stress tensor anderson et al 1998 5 t p i α c c α 2 c c i α c c where the symbol denotes the outer tensor product there are several upscaling approaches that can be used cushman et al 2002 including volume averaging in the sense of whitaker whitaker 1986 lasseux et al 2019 homogenization lévy 1987 chen et al 2019 and hybrid mixture theory hassanizadeh and gray 1979a 1979b 1980 in both volume averaging and homogenization field equations conservation laws such as conservation of mass and momentum and constitutive equations for e g stress and heat flux are posited at the microscale and then either averaged or homogenized to obtain macroscopic equation in hybrid mixture theory only the field equations are upscaled to their macroscopic counterparts the constitutive equations are obtained by postulating a set of independent variables and then using the second law of thermodynamics the result is that the constitutive equations are formulated directly in terms of macroscopic quantities whereas in the former two approaches microscopic constitutive equations are used cushman et al 2002 provides a good comparison of these and other upscaling techniques here we use hybrid mixture theory to derive a cahn hilliard type equation for two phase flow through a deformable porous medium the derivation is closest in spirit to the derivations given in de sobrino 1976 dunn and serrin 1986 antanovskii 1995 verschueren et al 2001 valid for two fluids not in a porous medium in this setting the field equations conservation of mass momenta energy and the entropy inequality for each phase liquid gas and solid are volume averaged so that at the macroscale the medium is assumed to be a mixture of the three phases e g the density of the liquid is defined at every point in space just as concentrations of a multi component liquid are defined at every point in space to perform the volume upscaling we assume a representative elementary volume rev exists and the upscaling process introduces a volume fraction ε α for each phase α l g s so that ε l ε g ε s 1 constitutive equations needed to obtain the same number of equations as unknowns are obtained directly at the macroscale by using the second law of thermodynamics and exploiting the entropy inequality in the sense of coleman and noll 1963 published in the1960 s the coleman and noll method significantly advanced the field of continuum mechanics by combining classical mechanics e g conservation of mass momentum energy and experimentally obtained constitutive equations with thermodynamics and entropy direction of energy transfer it formalized the development of a dissipative inequality that can then be exploited to obtain restrictions on the forms of equations for constitutive variables the idea is that no matter what conditions a body of material is subjected to the entropy inequality cannot be violated and so when constitutive equations are used to eliminate constitutive variables in the entropy inequality the inequality must still hold for all possible conditions choosing an appropriate physical state variable and exploiting the entropy inequality that contains functionals and give results that are consistent with richard s equation the classical cahn hilliard equation and the korteweg stress tensor requires significant extension of work done previously using hybrid mixture theory hassanizadeh and gray 1979a 1979b 1980 bennethum and cushman 1996a 1996b because the math and manipulations and math are quite involved for the three phase system we first present the derivation and key concepts of the derivation for a two phase system also demonstrating that the results are consistent with darcy s law the original cahn hilliard system and the korteweg stress tensor the concepts are the same for the derivation of the three phase system and the details are provided as a supplemental document in the next section we review the macroscopic conservation laws obtained after volume averaging we follow this with the assumptions used to develop constitutive equations via exploiting the entropy inequality for two phases single phase flow we show that we obtain a generalization of the korteweg stress tensor and cahn hilliard equation next we present the same results extended to the three phase problem with details relegated to a supplemental file to partially validate the model and check for consistency we simplify the equations to obtain a pore scale model and compare our results with others who have used a cahn hilliard type equation for modeling two fluid phases at the pore scale in particular cueto felgueroso et al 2014 cueto felgueroso et al 2018 and modeling three fluid phases boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 we next simplify the two phase flow model for a rigid solid and incompressible liquid and compare the resulting model with the cahn hilliard brinkman model schmuck et al 2013 conti and giorgini 2020 ebenbeck and garcke 2019 liu et al 2020 2 conservation laws here we review the balance laws for each phase we note that we do not incorporate the balance laws for interfaces since we can capture interfacial effects through the constitutive equations we denote each phase by α for single phase flow in porous media α l s where l denotes the liquid phase and s denotes the solid phase for two phase flow in porous media α l s g where g denotes the other liquid phase often a gas phase to keep the focus of this paper on the concepts behind the model development we assume that each phase is composed of a single component so that we do not introduce concentrations although it can be done bennethum and cushman 2002a bennethum et al 1996b but produces equations that are more complex within hmt the upscaled balance laws are obtained formally by volume averaging using an indicator function for each phase see e g cushman et al 2002 hassanizadeh and gray 1979a whitaker 1967 the results are equations that are analogous to their microscale counterparts but also incorporate volume fractions and allow for rate of exchange terms the upscaled conservation of mass is given by 6 ε α ρ α t ε α ρ α v α e β α β α where ε α is the volume fraction of phase α α ε α 1 ρ α is the density of phase α mass of α per volume of α v α is the upscaled velocity of phase α and e β α is the rate of exchange of mass from phase β to phase α such as might occur if the two phases consisted of liquid water and ice for the reader s convenience all variables are defined in appendix a the restriction that no mass is lost when transferring between phases yields 7 e β α e α β 0 β α the macroscale conservation of linear momentum is given by 8 ε α ρ α d α v α d t ε α t α ε α ρ α g β α t β α β α where d α d t is the material time derivative given by d α d t t v α t α is the cauchy stress tensor for phase α and t β α represents the rate of exchange of momentum from β to α the restriction that no momentum is lost between phases is 9 t β α e β α v α t α β e α β v β 0 β α the conservation of angular momentum can be similarly upscaled and analogous to the conservation of linear momentum the macroscopic version of the equation has exchange terms unfortunately this means that the stress tensors for each phase can no longer be shown to be symmetric however summing over phases yields a macroscopic conservation of angular momentum equation that does not have exchange terms and so it can be shown that t α ε α t α is symmetric similarly the conservation of energy is given by 10 ε α ρ α d α e α d t ε α t α v α ε α q α ε α ρ α h α β α q β α β α where e α is the energy density of phase α energy of α mass of α q α is the heat flux of phase α h α is the rate of heat produced per unit mass due to e g chemical reactions or radioactive material and q β α is the rate of energy gained by phase α from phase β not due to mass exchange or momentum exchange the restriction that no energy is gained or lost at an interface is given by 11 q β α t β α v α e β α e α 1 2 v α 2 q α β t α β v β e α β e β 1 2 v β 2 0 β α the last equation needed is a form of the second law of thermodynamics in an isolated system energy evolves so as to increase entropy we write the law as a balance equation in terms of intensive variables using a variable that accounts for the rate of change of entropy for phase α after upscaling we have 12 ε α ρ α d α η α d t ε α t q α ε α ρ α t h α β α φ β α λ α β α where η α is entropy density of phase α entropy of α mass of α 1 t q α is the entropy flux 1 t h α is entropy source φ β α is the rate of entropy gained by phase α from phase β and λ α is a quantity that accounts for the second law of thermodynamics the assumption that entropy flux is related to heat flux and entropy source is related to heat source assumes that we are modeling a simple material as defined by eringen 1967 and this assumption can be relaxed giving results that are generalizations of the results obtained by assuming the materials modeled are simple see e g the theory of extended irreversible thermodynamics jou et al 1996 the restriction that no entropy is gained or lost at an interface is given by 13 φ β α e β α η α φ α β e α β η β 0 β α the second law of thermodynamics can then be written as 14 λ α λ α 0 3 constitutive relations we begin with the entropy inequality as presented above where no constitutive assumptions have been made we eliminate the rate of exchange of entropy variables φ β α using restriction 13 and the rate of exchange of energy variable q β α using restriction 11 the details can be found in bennethum et al 2000 we simplify the manipulations by using lagrange multipliers λ α to enforce the continuity equations liu 1972 here d l is the rate of deformation tensor symmetric part of v l ψ is the helmholtz potential related to the internal energy e α through a legendre transformation callen 1985 15 ψ α e α t η α assuming that at each point in time and space the temperature of the solid and liquid are equal sometimes referred to as thermal equilibrium we have 16 t λ α ε α ρ α d α ψ α dt η α d α t dt α ε α d α t α α ε α t t q α v l t s l v s t l s e s l ψ l 1 2 v l v l e l s ψ s 1 2 v s v s α λ α d α ε α ρ α dt ε α ρ α v α β α e β α 0 using restrictions 7 and 9 gives 17 t λ α ε α ρ α d α ψ α d t η α d α t d t α ε α d α t α α ε α t t q α v l s t s l e s l ψ l ψ s 1 2 v l s v l s α λ α d α ε α ρ α d t ε α ρ α v α β α e β α 0 where v l s v l v s the unknowns include 18 ε l ρ l ρ s v l v s t 19 e s l t l t s t s l ψ l ψ s η l η s we count the number of field equations and match them with the variables in the first row assuming thermal equilibrium so that we have only one conservation of energy equation to obtain the same number of equations as unknowns we need constitutive equations for the variables in the second row referred to as constitutive variables the exception is the volume fraction for which it is not natural to treat as a constitutive variable this is known as the closure condition and in this case we assume that the material time derivative of ε l d s ε l d t ε l t v s ε l is also a constitutive variable 3 1 constitutive assumptions selecting a set of variables called independent variables upon which the constitutive variables depend is the key assumption for hmt once the set is chosen the constitutive equations are derived in a methodical matter often referred to as the coleman and noll method coleman and noll 1963 to recover darcy s law and the classical form of the liquid stress tensor and linear elastic constitutive equation for the solid phase it is well known that the list of independent variables should include the density of each phase the relative velocity v l s v l v s the macroscale strain tensor e s and the liquid rate of deformation tensor d l hassanizadeh and gray 1980 bennethum and cushman 1996b to obtain a cahn hilliard type equation a state variable must be chosen originally cahn and hilliard 1958 used a normalized density function that is 1 when in one phase and 0 in the other by introducing the gradient of the state variable as an independent variable the energy of the system decays so as to minimize the energy of the system incorporating the interfacial energy causing two phases to slowly desegregate this worked very well for modeling two phases such as appears when quenching an alloy however using normalized density functions are not appropriate for 3 phases or more the reasons are two fold the results do not reproduce the korteweg stress tensor and such state variables do not allow the system to model the difference between transitioning between the liquid phase and the gas phase versus the liquid phase and the solid phase in both cases the state variable transitions from 1 to 0 not allowing a preference another option is volume fractions but again these suffer the same drawbacks the energy of the liquid at the same liquid volume fraction ε l would not be able to tell whether the rest of the system was all solid all gas or something in between we choose to use quantities that are physically meaningful and capture the effects that at the microscale would capture interfaces for the simplified case discussed in detail in this section the choice of the state variable is a weighted average of the density 20 ρ l s ε l ρ l ε s ρ s where the additional state variables needed for three phases are similarly defined e g ρ l g ρ g s note that ρ l s ranges between ρ l ε l 1 to ρ s ε l 0 being consistent with the original interpretation of the state variable given by cahn and hilliard 1958 before normalizing it we will consider the coefficient in front of the term involving ρ l s classically denoted as α related to the thickness of the interface at the microscale as a second order tensor a l s to account for the nonhomogeneity of the medium and we assume it will be a function of the volume fraction the introduction of a term analogous to a l s has been obtained before using homogenization see schmuck et al 2013 so assume that the following variables are independent e g all constitutive variables are a function of these independent variables 21 t ε l ρ l ρ l s d α ρ α d t v l s d l e s α β l s where e s represents the lagrangian strain tensor we note that since ρ s ε s and e s are related through the conservation of mass of the solid phase if there is no mass loss from the solid phases we must either enforce the relationship weakly through the conservation of mass or must drop one of these independent variables from the list of independent variables here we choose to exclude ρ s although the solid phase is still considered compressible through its energy dependence upon e s we now exploit the entropy inequality which results in restrictions on the form of the constitutive variables essentially exploiting the entropy inequality is done by noting that the inequality must hold for all possible physical realizations of the system by choosing particular realizations so that many terms are zero and using first order expansions as the simplest possible form and second order and higher if necessary one obtains restrictions on the forms of constitutive relations the details are presented in appendix b and here we proceed by using the results of the exploitation 3 2 results for specific form of energy we next assume a specific form of the helmholtz free energy decomposing it into a term that is classical for a fluid only a function of density and temperature although we shall neglect temperature here and a form that is also a function of the gradient of our chosen order parameter ρ l s we choose a form that as close as possible 1 gives a liquid stress tensor that simplifies to the classical korteweg stress tensor for a single fluid 2 produces a generalized darcy s law 3 produces a generalization of the classical cahn hilliard equation for a single fluid when the generalized darcy s law and continuity equations are combined 4 allows for a generalization in which each interface has a unique state variable as will be seen we have a formulation that satisfies 2 4 and satisfies 1 under simplifying assumptions we simplify as much as possible beyond meeting these requirements so that for example we do not assume the energy of a fluid is a function of porosity explicitly as would be necessary to model e g swelling porous materials achanta and cushman 1994 achanta et al 1997 bennethum and weinstein 2002 singh et al 2003a b weinstein and bennethum 2006 weinstein et al 2008a b schreyer bennethum 2012 so we derive the generalized korteweg stress tensor and a generalized darcy s law given the following assumed form of liquid and solid energy 22 ψ l ψ l ρ l 1 2 ρ l ρ l s a l s ρ l s 23 ψ s ψ s ρ s 1 2 ρ s ρ l s a l s ρ l s where a l s is a second order tensor that may be a function of the densities ρ l and ρ s and porosity ε l note that this is the classical cahn hilliard assumption if a l s α i ρ l s c and ρ l 1 cahn and hilliard 1958 the total helmholtz energy is thus 24 ψ ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l ε s ρ s ψ s e s 1 2 ρ l s a l s ρ l s with this definition we have e g 25 ψ l ρ l ψ l ρ l 1 2 ρ l 2 ρ l s a l s ρ l s 26 ψ l ε l 0 27 ψ l ρ l s 1 2 ρ l a l s ρ l s defining pressure as is classically done in thermodynamics callen 1985 28 p l ρ l 2 ψ l ρ l we get that the lagrange multipliers are from equations 94 95 29 λ l 1 ρ l p l 1 2 ρ l ρ l s a l s ρ l s a l s ρ l s 30 λ s 1 2 ρ s ρ l s a l s ρ l s a l s ρ l s thus the liquid stress tensor is from equation 102 31 t l ρ l λ l i a l s ρ l s ρ l s 2 μ l d l 32 p l i 1 2 ρ l s a l s ρ l s i ρ l a l s ρ l s i a l s ρ l s ρ l s 2 μ l d l this formulation is one way of accounting for the macroscale liquid stresses due to the anisotropic nature of the liquid solid interface note that if we consider a single phase ε l 1 ε s 0 so that ρ l s ρ l and consider a l s α i then we obtain a generalized korteweg stress tensor a korteweg stress tensor with viscous terms 33 t l p l i α ρ l ρ l 1 2 α ρ l 2 i α ρ l ρ l 2 μ d l for the liquid cauchy stress tensor however we also note that unless a l s is a scalar multiple of the identity tensor the liquid stress tensor is not symmetric this formulation thus accounts for the traditional korteweg stresses due to e g variations in liquid density due to a mixing of components within the liquid phase generally considered small but is able to capture resulting instabilities we now work our way toward a generalized darcy s law we use the conservation of linear momentum for the liquid phase equation 8 34 ε l ρ l d l v l d t ε l t l ε l ρ l g t s l with the constitutive equation for the conservation for the rate of exchange of momentum from 104 using our form of the helmholtz potential 22 35 t s l ρ l λ l ε l r l v l s ρ l ε l a l s ρ l s ε l ε l a l s ρ l s ε s ρ s ε l ε s a l s ρ l s ρ l and the constitutive equation for the cauchy stress tensor t l 31 to get 36 ε l ρ l λ l ε l a l s ρ l s ρ l s 2 ε l μ l d l ε l ρ l g ρ l λ l ε l r v l s ρ l ε l a l s ρ l s ε l ε l a l s ρ l s ε s ρ s ε l ε s a l s ρ l s ρ l where we have neglected the inertial term as is usual to obtain the darcy s law where flow is considered slow and steady it takes quite a bit of manipulation to simplify this expression and the details are provided in appendix c letting r l ε l 2 k l 1 so that k l can be interpreted as the

the third term is the brinkman coefficient and the last two terms are a result of incorporating the energy of the interface for use later consider the simplifying assumptions that the porosity ε l is constant the solid phase is incompressible and that a l s α i where α is a constant then ε s ρ s is a constant and ρ l s ε l ρ l the generalized darcy s law 37 simplifies to 38 ε l v l s k l p l ρ l g 2 μ l d l α ε l ρ l ρ l which is the classical darcy s law with the brinkman term with one additional 3rd order term that accounts for the effects of the gradient of density the above equation illustrates that the coefficient k l can be readily identified as the hydraulic conductivity tensor 3 3 cahn hilliard equation for single phase flow to derive a generalized cahn hilliard equation we begin with the continuity equation 6 for the liquid and solid phases 39 ε l ρ l t ε l ρ l v l 0 40 ε s ρ s t ε s ρ s v s 0 adding these two equations and subtracting and adding the term ε l ρ l v s to the right side yields 41 ρ l s t ε l ρ l v s ε l ρ l v l s ε s ρ s v s 0 ρ l s t v s ε l ρ l ε l ρ l v s ε l ρ l v l s 0 d s ρ l s d t ε l ρ l v s ε l ρ l v l s 0 assuming that the term with v s is negligible relative to the other terms we have 42 d s ρ l s d t ε l ρ l v l s 0 we thus have a modified darcy s law 37 and a continuity equation 42 eliminating ε l v l s from 42 by using 37 we have 43 d s ρ ls dt ρ l k l p l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ρ l a ls ρ ls 1 2 a ls ρ ls ρ ls 0 we readily admit that for most hydrological applications solving an equation for a parameter ρ l s that tells us where the liquid solid interface is not practical nor desired we continue on in an academic exercise so as to illustrate the mathematical manipulations used to derive a generalization of the cahn hilliard equation since these same manipulations are repeated again for the more complicated three phase case if we define the function f ρ l with units of energy per unit mass as 44 f ρ l ψ l ρ l ρ l ψ l ρ l ρ l ψ l ρ l then we get the following relationship 45 1 ρ l p l f ρ l this allows us to rewrite 43 as 46 d s ρ ls dt ρ l k l ρ l f ρ l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ρ l a ls ρ ls 1 2 a ls ρ ls ρ ls 0 if we neglect the brinkman term viscosity and write gravity in terms of a potential g ϕ and define k l ρ l k l we get 47 d s ρ l s d t ρ l k l f ρ l a l s ρ l s ϕ 1 2 k l a l s ρ l s ρ l s where again we assume that k l and a l s are symmetric tensors we also note that the form of 47 has second order tensors that match an upscaled version derived using homogenization schmuck et al 2013 with the exception that the homogenized convective term as part of the material time derivative has an additional tensor and the homogenized equation does not have the last term to check that the above is indeed a generalization of the cahn hilliard equation assume that we have a single phase so that d s d t t ρ l s ρ l and assume that k l i and a l s α i then we see we get the classical cahn hilliard equation with a body source potential ϕ 48 ρ l t ρ l f ρ l α ρ l ϕ 4 multiphase flow results the calculations for obtaining the results for two fluids and a solid can be done similarly the details of the calculations are provided in a supplemental information file and here we present only the results the specific form of energies that are used are given by 49 ψ l ψ l ρ l 1 2 ρ l ρ l g a l g ρ l g

2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a l s ρ l s ρ l s the first two terms on the right side give the classical darcy s law or richards equation for multiphase flow the third term is the brinkman coefficient we get an analogous result for the darcy flux of the gas phase and finally the generalized version of the cahn hilliard equation is 57 d s ρ l s d t ρ l k l f ρ l ϕ ε l ε g a l g ρ l g ε l ε s a l s ρ l

for example if there is no gas phase ε g 0 and ε l ε s 1 and a l g a g s 0 57 simplifies to the liquid solid counterpart 47 neglecting the viscosity term 5 discussion the above equations are very general and at this point it has been shown that the results are consistent with the two phase cahn hilliard equation 48 the korteweg stress tensor for two liquid phases 55 darcy s law 38 and a generalization of richards equation see 58 here we further validate the model by making simplifying assumptions so that we can directly compare our results with a pore scale model developed by cueto felgueroso et al 2018 a three fluid model by boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 and the cahn hilliard brinkman system schmuck et al 2013 conti and giorgini 2020 ebenbeck and garcke 2019 liu et al 2020 5 1 pore scale model we preface this section by stating that this is an academic exercise to allow us to further validate the model and to gain additional insight into the physical interpretation of some of the coefficients we begin by reinterpreting the size of the representative elementary volume rev so that its size is small enough that the volume fractions can capture the phase by being either 0 or 1 this does not affect the derivation because the size of the rev is not used mathematically but if the rev is not large enough we cannot consider the system as a mixture the conductivity tensor however is not well defined at the pore scale we use the pore scale models as an indication of what form it and the other tensorial coefficients must be in order for the resulting equation to be physically meaningful let s consider the case where the solid phase is incompressible and rigid ε s ε 0 s v s 0 so that ε l ε g is a constant we thus only consider the continuity equations for the liquid and gas 58 ε l ρ l t ε l ρ l v l 0 59 ε g ρ g t ε g ρ g v g 0 as well as the generalized darcy s law for each fluid phase neglecting viscosity 60 ε l v l k l p l ρ l g ε l ε g ρ l a l g ρ l g ρ l ε l ε s a l s ρ l s 1 2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a l s ρ l s ρ l s 61 ε g v g k g p g ρ g g ε l ε g ρ g a l g ρ l g ρ g ε l ε s a g s ρ g s 1 2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a g s ρ g s ρ g s assuming we know the coefficients k α β a α β and the porosity or equivalently the solid volume fraction we have 4 equations and 5 unknowns ε l v l ε g v g ρ l ρ g ε l we note that ε g 1 ε s ε l thus we are one equation short a well known problem known as the closure issue obtained when upscaling bouré 1987 within the framework of using a cahn hilliard type approach the closure issue has been addressed in several ways in cueto felgueroso et al 2014 the two immiscible fluids are considered to have matching densities in schmuck et al 2013 the viscosities of the two fluids are assumed identical in cueto felgueroso et al 2018 the two fluids are considered to have the same velocities and the same functional form of viscosity an argument can be made for the reasonableness of each of these assumptions based on the problem considered let us take for example the modeling of a liquid water and water vapor in a rigid porous media at the pore scale considered by cueto felgueroso et al 2018 in this problem the transport is primarily due to phase change and so in any given point in space and time one is either in the liquid or gas phase and so there is only one velocity at the interface the velocities of the two phases are very close the variable used in this work is ρ l g the generalized cahn hilliard equation used is cueto felgueroso et al 2018 equation 26 62 ρ l g t ρ l g k μ ρ l g p ρ l g g λ ρ l g ρ l g where k is a function of the geometry μ ρ l g is the viscosity of the liquid and vapor transitioned through the function and λ is related to the square of the surface tension according to cueto felgueroso et al 2018 while this formulation has been very successful and insightful in describing important nonlinear features of the hydrodynamics of multiphase flows it has some limitations in particular it cannot resolve the formation of fluid wedges at corners for strongly wetting systems we now show how 62 can be derived within this framework to see if there are any additional terms that might help resolve this conundrum let v v l v g then adding 58 and 59 gives 63 ρ l g t ρ l g v 0 next consider ρ l g ε l v l ε g v g where we use 60 and 61 for the terms in parenthesis let k l ε l k μ ρ l g i k g ε g k μ ρ l g i a l g ε l ε g λ l g i assumed constant a l s λ l s i assumed constant and a l s λ l s i assumed constant and we get 64 ρ l g v ρ l g μ ρ l g ε l p l ε g p g ρ l g g λ l g ρ l g ρ l g λ l s ε l ρ l ε l ε s ρ l s λ g s ε g ρ g ε g ε s ρ g s the first three terms on the right side when substituted into 63 give a close match with 62 requiring only a common form for the pressure of the liquid and gas phases to combine to get a single pressure as is assumed in cueto felgueroso et al 2018 the pore scale model from cueto felgueroso et al 2018 indicates that the coefficient corresponding to λ l g is related to the surface tension generalizing slightly we can conclude that λ l g λ l s and λ g s represent the relative energies of the interfaces at the pore scale with two liquid phases if the energy of an interface is very low then the pore scale tension is small and more interfaces can form without increasing the system energy significantly for the case of the liquid solid and gas solid interfaces the corresponding coefficients represent the relative energy of wetting if the system is water wet then λ l s λ g s and the energy of the system decreases as the water phase wets the solid the relative energy for wetting is not accounted for in cueto felgueroso et al 2018 we next compare with boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 in this work the authors develop a generalized cahn hilliard model by postulating the energy functional for the system knowing that the energy functional must satisfy particular properties such as reproducing the two phase case should one phase be missing they also assume a single continuous velocity field the state variables are chosen to be c i where c 1 c 2 c 3 1 and each respective state variable is 1 in one phase and 0 in the other in boyer and lapuerta 2006 equation 5 the postulated free energy is given by 65 e c 1 c 2 c 3 ω 12 α f c 1 c 2 c 3 3 8 α σ 1 c 1 2 3 8 α σ 2 c 2 2 3 8 α σ 3 c 3 2 where σ i must satisfy a relationship involving the viscosities and the mobilities conductivities for each phase we compare the integrand with the total helmholtz potential from 52 66 ψ α l g s ε α ρ α ψ α ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l ε g ρ g ψ g ρ g ε s ρ s ψ s e s ε l ε g 2 ρ l g a l g ρ l g ε l ε s 2 ρ l s a l s ρ l s ε g ε s 2 ρ g s a g s ρ g s and we see that the forms are similar the authors of boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 admit to some difficulties in particular a non classical form of the conservation of mass see e g equation 13 of boyer et al 2010 and obtaining a phase when not initially present this latter issue may be a numerical issue the cahn hilliard equation is sensitive to perturbations about state variables at equilibrium 5 2 sample macroscale model for multiphase flow in rigid porous media here we model the movement of one fluid relative to another in a rigid heterogeneous porous media developing a simplified version of the model so that we can compare it with another frequently used model the cahn hilliard brinkman system we consider the movement of a wetting liquid water through an initially unsaturated isotropic heterogeneous porous media we begin with 58 and 59 adding these two equations and assuming that ρ g v g ρ l v l we have 67 ρ l g t ε l ρ l v l 0 we use 56 to eliminate v l because the solid is assumed rigid v s 0 and ρ l s ε l ρ l ε s ρ s ε l ρ l this gives 68 ρ l g t ρ l k l p l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ρ l ε l ε g a l g ρ l g ρ l ε l ε s a l s ε l ρ l 1 2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a l s ε l ρ l ε l ρ l because of the isotropy assumption and for simplification assume that a l g a l g i and a l s a l s i where a l s and a l g are positive scalar constants further because the solid phase is incompressible ε s 1 ε l ε g is constant so that ε l ε g is also constant assuming that the density of the air phase is zero relative to the liquid phase we have ρ l g ε l ρ l this yields ε l ρ l t ρ l k l p l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ε l ε g ρ l a l g ε l ρ l ρ l a l s ε l ε s ε l ρ l we assume that a l g and a l s measure the relative wetting between the liquid solid and gas solid interfaces if water is the wetting fluid we expect a l s a l g let s suppose a l s β a l g next we assume that the liquid is incompressible so that ρ l can be considered constant because p l p l ρ l pressure becomes an additional unknown using the knowledge that capillary pressure is related to saturated we assume instead that p l p l ε l analogous to 45 we use 69 1 ρ l p l f ε l we assume the solid porous medium is isotropic so the hydraulic conductivity k l is isotropic this is a relative conductivity often approximated using the brooks corey or van genuchten expressions here however we have other parameters that can be used to capture some of the effects in particular relative wetting is captured by the parameters β so we consider a simple expression 70 k l ε l k l i where k l is constant we now have 71 ε l t ε l k l w 72 w f ε l ϕ 2 ε l ρ l ε l μ l d l ε l ε g ρ l a l g ε l β ρ l a l g ε l ε s ε l where g ϕ in cahn hilliard type models a quartic form for energy is assumed where the derivative of the energy gives f ε l to obtain minimum chemical potentials at liquid saturated ε l 1 ε s and air saturated ε l 0 we assume a quadratic form of the energy so that 73 f ε l d d ε l γ 1 ε l 1 ε s 2 1 ε l 1 ε s 2 γ d d ε l ε l 2 1 ε s ε l 2 where γ γ 1 1 ε s 4 is an unknown constant let us compare this with a commonly cited model the cahn hilliard brinkman system modeling two phase flow through an isotropic porous media schmuck et al 2013 conti and giorgini 2020 ebenbeck and garcke 2019 liu et al 2020 both fluids are assumed incompressible and the solid is assumed rigid here c is the state variable using notation presented here this model which appears to be used as a pore scale model although the fluids appear to be treated as a mixture is chen et al 2019 74 v 0 75 c t c v μ 76 ν v k l v p μ c 77 μ c f c where v is the averaged velocity ν is viscosity of the mixture k l is related to the permeability of the system and μ is the chemical potential of the system this system of equations has a net additional equation and unknown c compared with 71 72 the first equation is a version of a bulk continuity equation where ρ v ε l ρ l v l ε g ρ g v g and ρ ε l ρ l ε g ρ g with the density of both phases assumed constant it may be reasonable to assume that ρ is constant so that v 0 the second equation appears to be a conservation of the state variable c equations 76 and 77 is a version of the conservation of linear momentum with appropriate constitutive equations as developed here this cahn hilliard brinkman model appears to be a generalization of a derivation by verschueren et al 2001 for two phase flow no solid in verschueren et al s derivation the state variable is the mass fraction of one of the components c and this interpretation of the state variable appears to have gotten lost in subsequent uses in more recent uses the state variable c is a normalized function range is between 1 and 1 or 0 to 1 in verschueren et al the conservation of mass is postulated to be equation 3 2 ρ d c d t j where d d t t v is the material time derivative j is called a flux and is assumed to be a constitutive variable for two phase liquid flow no solid the mass fraction is given using notation from our paper c l ε l ρ l ε l ρ l ε g ρ g thus c l 1 for all liquid and 0 for all gas assuming that ρ ε l ρ l ε g ρ g is constant as is done in verschueren et al we have beginning with the conservation of mass at the macroscale ε l ρ l t ε l ρ l v l 0 ρ c t ρ c v l 0 d c d t c v l 0 that is we do not need a constitutive equation for j as we can show that from the conservation of mass j c v l for a saturated porous medium the flux term turns out to be relate to v l s which can be obtained from darcy s law as is done in this paper equation 75 in the original work could be expressed as ρ d c d t c μ 0 i e 75 is not consistent with verschueren s formulation similarly the cahn hilliard brinkman system is not consistent with the formulation presented here this is because as verschuerent et al demonstrated the state variable has a natural physical interpretation reducing the number of unknowns and therefore not requiring one of the two conservation equations 74 and 75 6 conclusion using hybrid mixture theory we have developed a thermodynamically consistent macroscopic model that captures macroscale interfaces that is generalizable so that multi physics problems can be modeled incorporating interfacial effects without having to model interfaces at the microscale the resulting equations are consistent with the two phase cahn hilliard equation 48 the korteweg stress tensor for two liquid phases 55 darcy s law 38 and a generalization of richards equation see 58 further the result is a macroscopic system of equations that can capture macroscopic interfaces we were also able to simplify the model so that it can be interpreted as a pore scale model allowing for direct comparison with a pore scale model developed by cueto felgueroso et al 2018 and a three fluid model by boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 giving insight into the physical interpretation of some of the parameters in the model the novel additions to the traditional richards equation include three state variables each a weighted sum of the densities of two phases and three coefficients that add appropriate weight to the coefficient of the gradients of the state variables squared the coefficients are second order tensors that go to zero if the volume fraction of either phase associated with it is zero this allows the weight of each interface as it contributes to the overall energy of the system to differ perhaps allowing a differentiation of the wetting and non wetting phases the three phase model reduces to the two phase model appropriately the advantages of this formulation are numerous 1 it combines the strength of a mixture theory formulation which allows for a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent framework and the interface capturing approach of the cahn hilliard equation 2 it generalizes richards equation so that it extends concepts already existing rather than having to understand an entirely new field 3 the two phase flow equations in porous media simplify to appropriate single phase flow this is not trivial as pointed out in boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 4 although this formulation does not capture e g interfacial area density it is much simpler than macroscopic models that incorporate equations for interfaces interfacial curvatures and even possibly contact lines gray and miller 2014 miller and gray 2005 gray and miller 2011 5 the incorporation of the gradient of the state variable in the list of independent variables 21 allows for the system to capture some nonlocal behavior just as increasing the order of a taylor polynomial of a smooth function about a point c approximates the function on a larger interval incorporating higher order spatial and similarly temporal derivatives into the list of independent variables better captures nonlocal or time history dependence adding an infinite number of derivatives into the list of independent variables can be shown to being equivalent to an integral differential constitutive equation see e g singh et al 2003b wojciechowski 2011 6 the model developed here allows each phase to be compressible 7 the framework allows for generalizing the model in a systematic way by modifying the list of independent variables 21 and postulating an analogous form of the helmholtz potential 22 23 models for phase changes bennethum et al 1996a alexandersson et al 2016 heat transfer bennethum and cushman 1999 alexandersson et al 2016 incorporating transport bennethum et al 1996a charged particles bennethum and cushman 2002a 2002b swelling wojciechowski et al 2014 sauerwein and steeb 2020 etc have all been modeled using hybrid mixture theory and so by adding a state variable and modifying the form of the helmoltz potentials all of these models which are generalizations of commonly used models can be formulated further this model shows that when the state variable is given a physical interpretation the number of equations needed is reduced this was demonstrated by comparing the developed model with the cahn hilliard brinkman model the model has its weaknesses the stress tensors for each phase are not symmetric although in mixture theory the stress tensors are often assumed to be symmetric anyway and there is the closure issue determining additional equations so that the system has the same number of equations as unknowns in two phase flow through porous media at the macrosacle a condition relating capillary pressure to saturation is often used although this itself has issues hysteresis being one other possible closure conditions include assuming one or more phases are incompressible or that there is a common velocity field comparing a numerical simulation of this model with experimental results is

must be zero t d l ρ l d t d g ρ g d t d s ρ s d t d l d g d s v l s v g s t the coefficient of t yields 93 ε l ρ l ψ l t η l ε s ρ s ψ s t η s 0 which is consistent with the classical thermodynamics result η ψ t callen 1985 for the remainder of this paper we will assume that η α ψ α t which is a slightly more restrictive assumption than what actually can be obtained from the entropy inequality 93 from the coefficients of d l ρ l d t we obtain 94 λ l ρ l ψ l ρ l ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l s ε s ρ s ψ s ρ l s ρ l ψ l ρ l ψ ρ l s where ψ ε l ρ l ψ l ε s ρ s ψ s is the energy of the system energy per volume of porous medium similarly for d s ρ s d t we have 95 λ s ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l s ε s ρ s ψ s ρ l s ψ ρ l s this gives us the definition of the lagrange multipliers λ α that we will use as needed henceforth moving forward the next term yields 96 ε l ρ l ψ l d l 0 which tells us that the hemholtz potential of the liquid phases is not a function of the rate of deformation tensors d l the coefficient of d s must also be zero and gives a constitutive restriction for the solid cauchy stress tensor 97 t s ρ s f ψ s e s f t ρ s λ s i ρ s ψ s ρ l s ρ l s ρ s f ψ s e s f t ρ s ψ ρ l s i ρ s ψ s ρ l s ρ l s and the coefficients of v l s gives 98 ε l ρ l ψ l v l s ε s ρ s ψ s v l s ψ t v l s 0 this tells us the energy of the system is not a function of relative velocity and we shall make a slightly more restrictive assumption in that we will assume that the helmholtz potentials of each phase is not a function of the relative velocity finally the coefficient of t gives 99 ε l q l ε s q s 0 which tells us that the net heat flux is always zero clearly untrue unless at constant temperature this assumption can be relaxed by incorporating the gradient of temperature into the list of independent variables bennethum and cushman 1999 thus we now have 100 ψ l ψ l t ε l ρ l ρ l s 101 ψ s ψ s t ε l e s ρ l s although other constitutive variables can still be a function of d l and v l s b2 results that hold near equilibrium the variables d l v l s ε l and e s l are zero at equilibrium and in order for the rate of entropy production to be minimum at equilibrium the partial derivative of t λ with respect to each of these quantities must be zero at equilibrium the result is that the coefficients of these variables are zero at equilibrium coleman and noll 1963 bennethum et al 2000 we then linearize about each of these quantities to obtain a near equilibrium result only keeping the above variable that produces a quadratic term in the entropy inequality e g coleman and noll method coleman and noll 1963 so consider the coefficient of d l the coefficient is zero at equilibrium and the near equilibrium result is this coefficient plus a coefficient times d l giving 102 t l ρ l λ l

note that if we substitute this expression back into the entropy inequality we obtain a quadratic term in d l guaranteeing a positive or zero term in the entropy inequality if we impose the

337,using generalizations of the cahn hilliard equation for modeling two phase flow in porous media at the pore scale has become popular due to its ability to capture interfacial effects by adding minimal complications here we use upscaled field equations and exploit the second law of thermodynamics in the spirit of rational thermodynamics to develop a framework that for two phases at the macroscale recovers the korteweg stress tensor for the liquid phase generalizes darcy s law and recovers the classical cahn hilliard equation the corresponding results for three phases at the macroscale are derived and are shown to be a generalization of richards equation and with appropriate simplifying assumptions are shown to recover the two phase results simplifying the results appropriately produces a pore scale model for two liquid phases and are shown to generalize previous works by cueto felgueroso and juanes and boyer and quintard et al the results are are also compared with the cahn hilliard brinkman equations where it is noted that to be physically consistent the state variable should represent a physical quantity one key aspect that distinguishes this formulation from others is that it captures the different energies of the three interfaces gas liquid gas solid and liquid solid without introducing the corresponding quantities at the microscale interfacial tension contact angle etc keywords two phase flow pporous media cahn hilliard cahn hilliard brinkman richards equation korteweg stress tensor 1 introduction for multiphase flow in soils probably the most commonly used equation is richards equation richards 1931 charbeneau 2000 a generalization of darcy s law where interfacial effects are incorporated by using a relative conductivity tensor and a capillary pressure saturation relationship it is the capillary pressure saturation relationship that makes this model difficult to work with experimental results indicate the capillary pressure saturation relationship exhibits hysteresis leading to either approximating the relationship by a non hysteretic relationship such as the brooks corey brooks and corey 1966 or van genuchten van genuchten 1980 relations or by solving a model incorporating hysteresis which requires special care to solve see e g peszynska and showalter 2020 other approaches include adding interfacial effects through additional field equations continuity momentum energy over the interface as has been done using hybrid mixture theory bennethum and cushman 1999 or thermodynamically constrained averaging theory tcat gray and miller 2014 miller and gray 2005 gray and miller 2011 these approaches add many more equations with corresponding additional parameters and although they have provided valuable insights adaptation of these models by the hydrology community has perhaps not been what was expected here we propose another model a macroscopic version of the cahn hilliard equation in developing this theory we use a methodical framework that generalizes what is already used in the hydrology and petroleum industry richards equation and simultaneously generalizes the two fluid no solid phase flow equations cahn hilliard equation and the two fluid stress tensor korteweg stress tensor using a methodical framework to develop the equations allows for future generalizations such as incorporating multi component fluids charged particles and deformation the cahn hilliard equation was originally designed to model phase separation in binary solutions in 1958 by cahn and hilliard 1958 although only strictly valid near the critical point of phase separation its simplicity and capability to reproduce interfacial effects makes it a robust tool to model two fluid phases liquid gas liquid liquid that captures interfacial effects it does so by adding an energy term resulting in a system that minimizes not only the energy due to variations of density through pressure but also due to the energy of the existence of the interface i e the energy is a function of the magnitude of the gradient of a density cahn and hilliard 1958 this density parameter is often normalized so that it is 1 when in one phase and 0 or 1 when in the other phase although often referred to as phase concentration boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 or just concentration elliott and french 1987 novick cohen 2008 we avoid this terminology so as to distinguish between components in a single phase measured in terms of concentration and immiscible fluids measured in terms of volume fraction here we shall refer to it as a state variable the system then minimizes with other forces negligible the surface area resulting in e g bubbles for a water gas system while conserving mass for two phase flow at the pore scale incorporating the additional gradient term is an alternative to employing e g the young laplace equation due to its pattern formation properties and the ability to view the equation as a gradient flow of the ginzburg landau free energy functional it has been used in many other applications such as tumor growth ebenbeck and garcke 2019 and two phase flow or mass exchange in a porous media cueto felgueroso et al 2014 2018 the cahn hilliard equation as written for a binary liquid mixture is given by cahn and hilliard 1958 1 c t f c α c where c is the state variable denotes the laplace operator α is a parameter related to the thickness of the transition region interface and f c is the derivative of the chemical potential energy of the system if the time derivative is replaced by the material time derivative d d t t v then the equation is known as the convective cahn hilliard equation equation 1 is often written as two equations 2 c t w 3 w f c α c and the energy of the system a functional of c is 4 e c ω f c 1 2 α c c where f c f c and f c is usually a quartic with local minima at the values of c denoting the two phases the system evolves so as to minimize the energy while conserving mass and it is these properties that are exploited to prove existence and develop numerical methods for solving the equation e g elliott and larsson 2007 feng and karakashian 2007 incorporating gradients of a state variable into the energy of the system results in a non classical form of the cauchy stress tensor of the fluid in order to be thermodynamically consistent de sobrino 1976 antanovskii 1995 the more commonly used form of the cauchy stress tensor t has the form t p i 2 μ d where p is pressure μ is the viscosity and d is the rate of deformation tensor or the symmetric part of the gradient of velocity malvern 1969 when this form of the cauchy stress tensor is substituted into the conservation of linear momentum the result is the navier stokes system of equations however if the gradient of the state variable is included in the energy then the result is a korteweg stress tensor or capillary stress tensor anderson et al 1998 5 t p i α c c α 2 c c i α c c where the symbol denotes the outer tensor product there are several upscaling approaches that can be used cushman et al 2002 including volume averaging in the sense of whitaker whitaker 1986 lasseux et al 2019 homogenization lévy 1987 chen et al 2019 and hybrid mixture theory hassanizadeh and gray 1979a 1979b 1980 in both volume averaging and homogenization field equations conservation laws such as conservation of mass and momentum and constitutive equations for e g stress and heat flux are posited at the microscale and then either averaged or homogenized to obtain macroscopic equation in hybrid mixture theory only the field equations are upscaled to their macroscopic counterparts the constitutive equations are obtained by postulating a set of independent variables and then using the second law of thermodynamics the result is that the constitutive equations are formulated directly in terms of macroscopic quantities whereas in the former two approaches microscopic constitutive equations are used cushman et al 2002 provides a good comparison of these and other upscaling techniques here we use hybrid mixture theory to derive a cahn hilliard type equation for two phase flow through a deformable porous medium the derivation is closest in spirit to the derivations given in de sobrino 1976 dunn and serrin 1986 antanovskii 1995 verschueren et al 2001 valid for two fluids not in a porous medium in this setting the field equations conservation of mass momenta energy and the entropy inequality for each phase liquid gas and solid are volume averaged so that at the macroscale the medium is assumed to be a mixture of the three phases e g the density of the liquid is defined at every point in space just as concentrations of a multi component liquid are defined at every point in space to perform the volume upscaling we assume a representative elementary volume rev exists and the upscaling process introduces a volume fraction ε α for each phase α l g s so that ε l ε g ε s 1 constitutive equations needed to obtain the same number of equations as unknowns are obtained directly at the macroscale by using the second law of thermodynamics and exploiting the entropy inequality in the sense of coleman and noll 1963 published in the1960 s the coleman and noll method significantly advanced the field of continuum mechanics by combining classical mechanics e g conservation of mass momentum energy and experimentally obtained constitutive equations with thermodynamics and entropy direction of energy transfer it formalized the development of a dissipative inequality that can then be exploited to obtain restrictions on the forms of equations for constitutive variables the idea is that no matter what conditions a body of material is subjected to the entropy inequality cannot be violated and so when constitutive equations are used to eliminate constitutive variables in the entropy inequality the inequality must still hold for all possible conditions choosing an appropriate physical state variable and exploiting the entropy inequality that contains functionals and give results that are consistent with richard s equation the classical cahn hilliard equation and the korteweg stress tensor requires significant extension of work done previously using hybrid mixture theory hassanizadeh and gray 1979a 1979b 1980 bennethum and cushman 1996a 1996b because the math and manipulations and math are quite involved for the three phase system we first present the derivation and key concepts of the derivation for a two phase system also demonstrating that the results are consistent with darcy s law the original cahn hilliard system and the korteweg stress tensor the concepts are the same for the derivation of the three phase system and the details are provided as a supplemental document in the next section we review the macroscopic conservation laws obtained after volume averaging we follow this with the assumptions used to develop constitutive equations via exploiting the entropy inequality for two phases single phase flow we show that we obtain a generalization of the korteweg stress tensor and cahn hilliard equation next we present the same results extended to the three phase problem with details relegated to a supplemental file to partially validate the model and check for consistency we simplify the equations to obtain a pore scale model and compare our results with others who have used a cahn hilliard type equation for modeling two fluid phases at the pore scale in particular cueto felgueroso et al 2014 cueto felgueroso et al 2018 and modeling three fluid phases boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 we next simplify the two phase flow model for a rigid solid and incompressible liquid and compare the resulting model with the cahn hilliard brinkman model schmuck et al 2013 conti and giorgini 2020 ebenbeck and garcke 2019 liu et al 2020 2 conservation laws here we review the balance laws for each phase we note that we do not incorporate the balance laws for interfaces since we can capture interfacial effects through the constitutive equations we denote each phase by α for single phase flow in porous media α l s where l denotes the liquid phase and s denotes the solid phase for two phase flow in porous media α l s g where g denotes the other liquid phase often a gas phase to keep the focus of this paper on the concepts behind the model development we assume that each phase is composed of a single component so that we do not introduce concentrations although it can be done bennethum and cushman 2002a bennethum et al 1996b but produces equations that are more complex within hmt the upscaled balance laws are obtained formally by volume averaging using an indicator function for each phase see e g cushman et al 2002 hassanizadeh and gray 1979a whitaker 1967 the results are equations that are analogous to their microscale counterparts but also incorporate volume fractions and allow for rate of exchange terms the upscaled conservation of mass is given by 6 ε α ρ α t ε α ρ α v α e β α β α where ε α is the volume fraction of phase α α ε α 1 ρ α is the density of phase α mass of α per volume of α v α is the upscaled velocity of phase α and e β α is the rate of exchange of mass from phase β to phase α such as might occur if the two phases consisted of liquid water and ice for the reader s convenience all variables are defined in appendix a the restriction that no mass is lost when transferring between phases yields 7 e β α e α β 0 β α the macroscale conservation of linear momentum is given by 8 ε α ρ α d α v α d t ε α t α ε α ρ α g β α t β α β α where d α d t is the material time derivative given by d α d t t v α t α is the cauchy stress tensor for phase α and t β α represents the rate of exchange of momentum from β to α the restriction that no momentum is lost between phases is 9 t β α e β α v α t α β e α β v β 0 β α the conservation of angular momentum can be similarly upscaled and analogous to the conservation of linear momentum the macroscopic version of the equation has exchange terms unfortunately this means that the stress tensors for each phase can no longer be shown to be symmetric however summing over phases yields a macroscopic conservation of angular momentum equation that does not have exchange terms and so it can be shown that t α ε α t α is symmetric similarly the conservation of energy is given by 10 ε α ρ α d α e α d t ε α t α v α ε α q α ε α ρ α h α β α q β α β α where e α is the energy density of phase α energy of α mass of α q α is the heat flux of phase α h α is the rate of heat produced per unit mass due to e g chemical reactions or radioactive material and q β α is the rate of energy gained by phase α from phase β not due to mass exchange or momentum exchange the restriction that no energy is gained or lost at an interface is given by 11 q β α t β α v α e β α e α 1 2 v α 2 q α β t α β v β e α β e β 1 2 v β 2 0 β α the last equation needed is a form of the second law of thermodynamics in an isolated system energy evolves so as to increase entropy we write the law as a balance equation in terms of intensive variables using a variable that accounts for the rate of change of entropy for phase α after upscaling we have 12 ε α ρ α d α η α d t ε α t q α ε α ρ α t h α β α φ β α λ α β α where η α is entropy density of phase α entropy of α mass of α 1 t q α is the entropy flux 1 t h α is entropy source φ β α is the rate of entropy gained by phase α from phase β and λ α is a quantity that accounts for the second law of thermodynamics the assumption that entropy flux is related to heat flux and entropy source is related to heat source assumes that we are modeling a simple material as defined by eringen 1967 and this assumption can be relaxed giving results that are generalizations of the results obtained by assuming the materials modeled are simple see e g the theory of extended irreversible thermodynamics jou et al 1996 the restriction that no entropy is gained or lost at an interface is given by 13 φ β α e β α η α φ α β e α β η β 0 β α the second law of thermodynamics can then be written as 14 λ α λ α 0 3 constitutive relations we begin with the entropy inequality as presented above where no constitutive assumptions have been made we eliminate the rate of exchange of entropy variables φ β α using restriction 13 and the rate of exchange of energy variable q β α using restriction 11 the details can be found in bennethum et al 2000 we simplify the manipulations by using lagrange multipliers λ α to enforce the continuity equations liu 1972 here d l is the rate of deformation tensor symmetric part of v l ψ is the helmholtz potential related to the internal energy e α through a legendre transformation callen 1985 15 ψ α e α t η α assuming that at each point in time and space the temperature of the solid and liquid are equal sometimes referred to as thermal equilibrium we have 16 t λ α ε α ρ α d α ψ α dt η α d α t dt α ε α d α t α α ε α t t q α v l t s l v s t l s e s l ψ l 1 2 v l v l e l s ψ s 1 2 v s v s α λ α d α ε α ρ α dt ε α ρ α v α β α e β α 0 using restrictions 7 and 9 gives 17 t λ α ε α ρ α d α ψ α d t η α d α t d t α ε α d α t α α ε α t t q α v l s t s l e s l ψ l ψ s 1 2 v l s v l s α λ α d α ε α ρ α d t ε α ρ α v α β α e β α 0 where v l s v l v s the unknowns include 18 ε l ρ l ρ s v l v s t 19 e s l t l t s t s l ψ l ψ s η l η s we count the number of field equations and match them with the variables in the first row assuming thermal equilibrium so that we have only one conservation of energy equation to obtain the same number of equations as unknowns we need constitutive equations for the variables in the second row referred to as constitutive variables the exception is the volume fraction for which it is not natural to treat as a constitutive variable this is known as the closure condition and in this case we assume that the material time derivative of ε l d s ε l d t ε l t v s ε l is also a constitutive variable 3 1 constitutive assumptions selecting a set of variables called independent variables upon which the constitutive variables depend is the key assumption for hmt once the set is chosen the constitutive equations are derived in a methodical matter often referred to as the coleman and noll method coleman and noll 1963 to recover darcy s law and the classical form of the liquid stress tensor and linear elastic constitutive equation for the solid phase it is well known that the list of independent variables should include the density of each phase the relative velocity v l s v l v s the macroscale strain tensor e s and the liquid rate of deformation tensor d l hassanizadeh and gray 1980 bennethum and cushman 1996b to obtain a cahn hilliard type equation a state variable must be chosen originally cahn and hilliard 1958 used a normalized density function that is 1 when in one phase and 0 in the other by introducing the gradient of the state variable as an independent variable the energy of the system decays so as to minimize the energy of the system incorporating the interfacial energy causing two phases to slowly desegregate this worked very well for modeling two phases such as appears when quenching an alloy however using normalized density functions are not appropriate for 3 phases or more the reasons are two fold the results do not reproduce the korteweg stress tensor and such state variables do not allow the system to model the difference between transitioning between the liquid phase and the gas phase versus the liquid phase and the solid phase in both cases the state variable transitions from 1 to 0 not allowing a preference another option is volume fractions but again these suffer the same drawbacks the energy of the liquid at the same liquid volume fraction ε l would not be able to tell whether the rest of the system was all solid all gas or something in between we choose to use quantities that are physically meaningful and capture the effects that at the microscale would capture interfaces for the simplified case discussed in detail in this section the choice of the state variable is a weighted average of the density 20 ρ l s ε l ρ l ε s ρ s where the additional state variables needed for three phases are similarly defined e g ρ l g ρ g s note that ρ l s ranges between ρ l ε l 1 to ρ s ε l 0 being consistent with the original interpretation of the state variable given by cahn and hilliard 1958 before normalizing it we will consider the coefficient in front of the term involving ρ l s classically denoted as α related to the thickness of the interface at the microscale as a second order tensor a l s to account for the nonhomogeneity of the medium and we assume it will be a function of the volume fraction the introduction of a term analogous to a l s has been obtained before using homogenization see schmuck et al 2013 so assume that the following variables are independent e g all constitutive variables are a function of these independent variables 21 t ε l ρ l ρ l s d α ρ α d t v l s d l e s α β l s where e s represents the lagrangian strain tensor we note that since ρ s ε s and e s are related through the conservation of mass of the solid phase if there is no mass loss from the solid phases we must either enforce the relationship weakly through the conservation of mass or must drop one of these independent variables from the list of independent variables here we choose to exclude ρ s although the solid phase is still considered compressible through its energy dependence upon e s we now exploit the entropy inequality which results in restrictions on the form of the constitutive variables essentially exploiting the entropy inequality is done by noting that the inequality must hold for all possible physical realizations of the system by choosing particular realizations so that many terms are zero and using first order expansions as the simplest possible form and second order and higher if necessary one obtains restrictions on the forms of constitutive relations the details are presented in appendix b and here we proceed by using the results of the exploitation 3 2 results for specific form of energy we next assume a specific form of the helmholtz free energy decomposing it into a term that is classical for a fluid only a function of density and temperature although we shall neglect temperature here and a form that is also a function of the gradient of our chosen order parameter ρ l s we choose a form that as close as possible 1 gives a liquid stress tensor that simplifies to the classical korteweg stress tensor for a single fluid 2 produces a generalized darcy s law 3 produces a generalization of the classical cahn hilliard equation for a single fluid when the generalized darcy s law and continuity equations are combined 4 allows for a generalization in which each interface has a unique state variable as will be seen we have a formulation that satisfies 2 4 and satisfies 1 under simplifying assumptions we simplify as much as possible beyond meeting these requirements so that for example we do not assume the energy of a fluid is a function of porosity explicitly as would be necessary to model e g swelling porous materials achanta and cushman 1994 achanta et al 1997 bennethum and weinstein 2002 singh et al 2003a b weinstein and bennethum 2006 weinstein et al 2008a b schreyer bennethum 2012 so we derive the generalized korteweg stress tensor and a generalized darcy s law given the following assumed form of liquid and solid energy 22 ψ l ψ l ρ l 1 2 ρ l ρ l s a l s ρ l s 23 ψ s ψ s ρ s 1 2 ρ s ρ l s a l s ρ l s where a l s is a second order tensor that may be a function of the densities ρ l and ρ s and porosity ε l note that this is the classical cahn hilliard assumption if a l s α i ρ l s c and ρ l 1 cahn and hilliard 1958 the total helmholtz energy is thus 24 ψ ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l ε s ρ s ψ s e s 1 2 ρ l s a l s ρ l s with this definition we have e g 25 ψ l ρ l ψ l ρ l 1 2 ρ l 2 ρ l s a l s ρ l s 26

λ l 1 ρ l p l 1 2 ρ l ρ l s a l s ρ l s a l s ρ l s 30 λ s 1 2 ρ s ρ l s a l s ρ l s a l s ρ l s thus the liquid stress tensor is from equation 102 31 t l ρ l λ l i a l s ρ l s ρ l s 2 μ l d l 32 p l

interface note that if we consider a single phase ε l 1 ε s 0 so that ρ l s ρ l and consider a l s α i then we obtain a generalized korteweg stress tensor a korteweg stress tensor with viscous terms 33 t l p l i α ρ l ρ l 1 2 α ρ l 2 i α ρ l ρ l 2 μ d l for the liquid cauchy stress tensor however we also note that unless a l s is a scalar multiple of the identity tensor the liquid stress tensor is not symmetric this formulation thus accounts for the traditional korteweg stresses due to e g variations in liquid density due to a mixing of components within the liquid phase generally considered small but is able to capture resulting instabilities we now work our way toward a generalized darcy s law we use the conservation of linear momentum for the liquid phase equation 8 34 ε l ρ l d l v l d t ε l t l ε l ρ l g t s l with the constitutive equation for the conservation for the rate of exchange of momentum from 104 using our form of the helmholtz potential 22 35 t s l ρ l λ l ε l r l v l

l ρ l g ρ l λ l ε l r v l s ρ l ε l a l s ρ l s ε l ε l a l s ρ l s ε s ρ s ε l ε s a l s ρ l s ρ l where we have neglected the inertial term as is usual to obtain the darcy s law where flow is considered slow and steady it takes quite a bit of manipulation to simplify this expression and the details are provided in appendix c letting r l ε l 2 k l 1 so that k l can be interpreted as the conductivity tensor the result can be expressed as 37 ε l v l s k l p l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ρ l a ls ρ ls 1 2 a ls ρ ls ρ ls the first two terms on the right side give the classical darcy s law the third term is the brinkman coefficient and the last two terms are a result of incorporating the energy of the interface for use later consider the simplifying assumptions that the porosity ε l is constant the solid phase is incompressible and that a l s α i where α is a constant then ε s ρ s is a constant and ρ l s ε l ρ l the generalized darcy s law 37 simplifies to 38 ε l v l s k l p l ρ l g 2 μ l d l α ε l ρ l ρ l which is the classical darcy s law with the brinkman term with one additional 3rd order term that accounts for the effects of the gradient of density the above equation illustrates that the coefficient k l can be readily identified as the hydraulic conductivity tensor 3 3 cahn hilliard equation for single phase flow to derive a generalized cahn hilliard equation we begin with the continuity equation 6 for the liquid and solid phases 39 ε l ρ l t ε l ρ l v l 0 40 ε s ρ s t ε s ρ s v s 0 adding these two equations and subtracting and adding the term ε l ρ l v s to the right side yields 41 ρ l s t ε l ρ l v s ε l ρ l v l s ε s ρ s v s 0 ρ l s t v s ε l ρ l ε l ρ l v s ε l ρ l v l s 0 d s ρ l s d t ε l ρ l v s ε l ρ l v l s 0 assuming that the term with v s is negligible relative to the other terms we have 42 d s ρ l s d t ε l ρ l v l s 0 we thus have a modified darcy s law 37 and a continuity equation 42 eliminating ε l v l s from 42 by using 37 we have 43 d s ρ ls dt ρ l k l p l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ρ l a ls ρ ls 1 2 a ls ρ ls ρ ls 0 we readily admit that for most hydrological applications solving an equation for a parameter ρ l s that tells us where the liquid solid interface is not practical nor desired we continue on in an academic exercise so as to illustrate the mathematical manipulations used to derive a generalization of the cahn hilliard equation since these same manipulations are repeated again for the more complicated three phase case if we define the function f ρ l with units of energy per unit mass as 44 f ρ l ψ l ρ l ρ l ψ l ρ l ρ l ψ l ρ l then we get the following relationship 45 1 ρ l p l f ρ l this allows us to rewrite 43 as 46 d s ρ ls dt ρ l k l ρ l f ρ l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ρ l a ls ρ ls 1 2 a ls ρ ls ρ ls 0 if we neglect the brinkman term viscosity and write gravity in terms of a potential g ϕ and define k l ρ l k l we get 47 d s ρ l s d t ρ l k l f ρ l a l s ρ l s ϕ 1 2 k l a l s ρ l s ρ l s where again we assume that k l and a l s are symmetric tensors we also note that the form of 47 has second order tensors that match an upscaled version derived using homogenization schmuck et al 2013 with the exception that the homogenized convective term as part of the material time derivative has an additional tensor and the homogenized equation does not have the last term to check that the above is indeed a generalization of the cahn hilliard equation assume that we have a single phase so that d s d t t ρ l s ρ l and assume that k l i and a l s α i then we see we get the classical cahn hilliard equation with a body source potential ϕ 48 ρ l t ρ l f ρ l α ρ l ϕ 4 multiphase flow results the calculations for obtaining the results for two fluids and a solid can be done similarly the details of the calculations are provided in a supplemental information file and here we present only the results the specific form of energies that are used are given by 49 ψ l ψ l ρ l 1 2 ρ l ρ l g a l g ρ l g

analogous result for the gas phase again we note that unless all the coefficients a α β are scalar multiples of the identity then the stress tensor is not necessarily symmetric we also note under the assumptions 1 ε s 0 so that ε l ε g 1 2 a l s a g s 0 3 a l g α l g i and 4 negligible viscosities we recover the korteweg stress tensor anderson et al 1998 55 t ε l t l ε g t g ε l p l ε g p g i 1 2

2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a l s ρ l s ρ l s the first two terms on the right side give the classical darcy s law or richards equation for multiphase flow the third term is the brinkman coefficient we get an analogous result for the darcy flux of the gas phase and finally the generalized version of the cahn hilliard equation is 57 d s ρ l s d t ρ l k l f ρ l ϕ ε l ε g a l g ρ l g ε l ε s a l s ρ l

for example if there is no gas phase ε g 0 and ε l ε s 1 and a l g a g s 0 57 simplifies to the liquid solid counterpart 47 neglecting the viscosity term 5 discussion the above equations are very general and at this point it has been shown that the results are consistent with the two phase cahn hilliard equation 48 the korteweg stress tensor for two liquid phases 55 darcy s law 38 and a generalization of richards equation see 58 here we further validate the model by making simplifying assumptions so that we can directly compare our results with a pore scale model developed by cueto felgueroso et al 2018 a three fluid model by boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 and the cahn hilliard brinkman system schmuck et al 2013 conti and giorgini 2020 ebenbeck and garcke 2019 liu et al 2020 5 1 pore scale model we preface this section by stating that this is an academic exercise to allow us to further validate the model and to gain additional insight into the physical interpretation of some of the coefficients we begin by reinterpreting the size of the representative elementary volume rev so that its size is small enough that the volume fractions can capture the phase by being either 0 or 1 this does not affect the derivation because the size of the rev is not used mathematically but if the rev is not large enough we cannot consider the system as a mixture the conductivity tensor however is not well defined at the pore scale we use the pore scale models as an indication of what form it and the other tensorial coefficients must be in order for the resulting equation to be physically meaningful let s consider the case where the solid phase is incompressible and rigid ε s ε 0 s v s 0 so that ε l ε g is a constant we thus only consider the continuity equations for the liquid and gas 58 ε l ρ l t ε l ρ l v l 0 59 ε g ρ g t ε g ρ g v g 0 as well as the generalized darcy s law for each fluid phase neglecting viscosity 60 ε l v l k l p l ρ l g ε l ε g ρ l a l g ρ l g ρ l ε l ε s a l s ρ l s 1 2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a l s ρ l s ρ l s 61 ε g v g k g p g ρ g g ε l ε g ρ g a l g ρ l g ρ g ε l ε s a g s ρ g s 1 2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a g s ρ g s ρ g s assuming we know the coefficients k α β a α β and the porosity or equivalently the solid volume fraction we have 4 equations and 5 unknowns ε l v l ε g v g ρ l ρ g ε l we note that ε g 1 ε s ε l thus we are one equation short a well known problem known as the closure issue obtained when upscaling bouré 1987 within the framework of using a cahn hilliard type approach the closure issue has been addressed in several ways in cueto felgueroso et al 2014 the two immiscible fluids are considered to have matching densities in schmuck et al 2013 the viscosities of the two fluids are assumed identical in cueto felgueroso et al 2018 the two fluids are considered to have the same velocities and the same functional form of viscosity an argument can be made for the reasonableness of each of these assumptions based on the problem considered let us take for example the modeling of a liquid water and water vapor in a rigid porous media at the pore scale considered by cueto felgueroso et al 2018 in this problem the transport is primarily due to phase change and so in any given point in space and time one is either in the liquid or gas phase and so there is only one velocity at the interface the velocities of the two phases are very close the variable used in this work is ρ l g the generalized cahn hilliard equation used is cueto felgueroso et al 2018 equation 26 62 ρ l g t ρ l g k μ ρ l g p ρ l g g λ ρ l g ρ l g where k is a function of the geometry μ ρ l g is the viscosity of the liquid and vapor transitioned through the function and λ is related to the square of the surface tension according to cueto felgueroso et al 2018 while this formulation has been very successful and insightful in describing important nonlinear features of the hydrodynamics of multiphase flows it has some limitations in particular it cannot resolve the formation of fluid wedges at corners for strongly wetting systems we now show how 62 can be derived within this framework to see if there are any additional terms that might help resolve this conundrum let v v l v g then adding 58 and 59 gives 63 ρ l g t ρ l g v 0 next consider ρ l g ε l v l ε g v g where we use 60 and 61 for the terms in parenthesis let k l ε l k μ ρ l g i k g ε g k μ ρ l g i a l g ε l ε g λ l g i assumed constant a l s λ l s i assumed constant and a l s λ l s i assumed constant and we get 64 ρ l g v ρ l g μ ρ l g ε l p l ε g p g ρ l g g λ l g ρ l g ρ l g λ l s ε l ρ l ε l ε s ρ l s λ g s ε g ρ g ε g ε s ρ g s the first three terms on the right side when substituted into 63 give a close match with 62 requiring only a common form for the pressure of the liquid and gas phases to combine to get a single pressure as is assumed in cueto felgueroso et al 2018 the pore scale model from cueto felgueroso et al 2018 indicates that the coefficient corresponding to λ l g is related to the surface tension generalizing slightly we can conclude that λ l g λ l s and λ g s represent the relative energies of the interfaces at the pore scale with two liquid phases if the energy of an interface is very low then the pore scale tension is small and more interfaces can form without increasing the system energy significantly for the case of the liquid solid and gas solid interfaces the corresponding coefficients represent the relative energy of wetting if the system is water wet then λ l s λ g s and the energy of the system decreases as the water phase wets the solid the relative energy for wetting is not accounted for in cueto felgueroso et al 2018 we next compare with boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 in this work the authors develop a generalized cahn hilliard model by postulating the energy functional for the system knowing that the energy functional must satisfy particular properties such as reproducing the two phase case should one phase be missing they also assume a single continuous velocity field the state variables are chosen to be c i where c 1 c 2 c 3 1 and each respective state variable is 1 in one phase and 0 in the other in boyer and lapuerta 2006 equation 5 the postulated free energy is given by 65 e c 1 c 2 c 3 ω 12 α f c 1 c 2 c 3 3 8 α σ 1 c 1 2 3 8 α σ 2 c 2 2 3 8 α σ 3 c 3 2 where σ i must satisfy a relationship involving the viscosities and the mobilities conductivities for each phase we compare the integrand with the total helmholtz potential from 52 66 ψ α l g s ε α ρ α ψ α ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l ε g ρ g ψ g ρ g ε s ρ s ψ s e s ε l ε g 2 ρ l g a l g ρ l g ε l ε s 2 ρ l s a l s ρ l s ε g ε s 2 ρ g s a g s ρ g s and we see that the forms are similar the authors of boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 admit to some difficulties in particular a non classical form of the conservation of mass see e g equation 13 of boyer et al 2010 and obtaining a phase when not initially present this latter issue may be a numerical issue the cahn hilliard equation is sensitive to perturbations about state variables at equilibrium 5 2 sample macroscale model for multiphase flow in rigid porous media here we model the movement of one fluid relative to another in a rigid heterogeneous porous media developing a simplified version of the model so that we can compare it with another frequently used model the cahn hilliard brinkman system we consider the movement of a wetting liquid water through an initially unsaturated isotropic heterogeneous porous media we begin with 58 and 59 adding these two equations and assuming that ρ g v g ρ l v l we have 67 ρ l g t ε l ρ l v l 0 we use 56 to eliminate v l because the solid is assumed rigid v s 0 and ρ l s ε l ρ l ε s ρ s ε l ρ l this gives 68 ρ l g t ρ l k l p l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ρ l ε l ε g a l g ρ l g ρ l ε l ε s a l s ε l ρ l 1 2 a l g ρ l g ρ l g 1 2 a l s ε l ρ l ε l ρ l because of the isotropy assumption and for simplification assume that a l g a l g i and a l s a l s i where a l s and a l g are positive scalar constants further because the solid phase is incompressible ε s 1 ε l ε g is constant so that ε l ε g is also constant assuming that the density of the air phase is zero relative to the liquid phase we have ρ l g ε l ρ l this yields ε l ρ l t ρ l k l p l ρ l g 2 ε l ε l μ l d l ε l ε g ρ l a l g ε l ρ l ρ l a l s ε l ε s ε l ρ l we assume that a l g and a l s measure the relative wetting between the liquid solid and gas solid interfaces if water is the wetting fluid we expect a l s a l g let s suppose a l s β a l g next we assume that the liquid is incompressible so that ρ l can be considered constant because p l p l ρ l pressure becomes an additional unknown using the knowledge that capillary pressure is related to saturated we assume instead that p l p l ε l analogous to 45 we use 69 1 ρ l p l f ε l we assume the solid porous medium is isotropic so the hydraulic conductivity k l is isotropic this is a relative conductivity often approximated using the brooks corey or van genuchten expressions here however we have other parameters that can be used to capture some of the effects in particular relative wetting is captured by the parameters β so we consider a simple expression 70 k l ε l k l i where k l is constant we now have 71 ε l t ε l k l w 72 w f ε l ϕ 2 ε l ρ l ε l μ l d l ε l ε g ρ l a l g ε l β ρ l a l g ε l ε s ε l where g ϕ in cahn hilliard type models a quartic form for energy is assumed where the derivative of the energy gives f ε l to obtain minimum chemical potentials at liquid saturated ε l 1 ε s and air saturated ε l 0 we assume a quadratic form of the energy so that 73 f ε l d d ε l γ 1 ε l 1 ε s 2 1 ε l 1 ε s 2 γ d d ε l ε l 2 1 ε s ε l 2 where γ γ 1 1 ε s 4 is an unknown constant let us compare this with a commonly cited model the cahn hilliard brinkman system modeling two phase flow through an isotropic porous media schmuck et al 2013 conti and giorgini 2020 ebenbeck and garcke 2019 liu et al 2020 both fluids are assumed incompressible and the solid is assumed rigid here c is the state variable using notation presented here this model which appears to be used as a pore scale model although the fluids appear to be treated as a mixture is chen et al 2019 74 v 0 75 c t c v μ 76 ν v k l v p μ c 77 μ c f c where v is the averaged velocity ν is viscosity of the mixture k l is related to the permeability of the system and μ is the chemical potential of the system this system of equations has a net additional equation and unknown c compared with 71 72 the first equation is a version of a bulk continuity equation where ρ v ε l ρ l v l ε g ρ g v g and ρ ε l ρ l ε g ρ g with the density of both phases assumed constant it may be reasonable to assume that ρ is constant so that v 0 the second equation appears to be a conservation of the state variable c equations 76 and 77 is a version of the conservation of linear momentum with appropriate constitutive equations as developed here this cahn hilliard brinkman model appears to be a generalization of a derivation by verschueren et al 2001 for two phase flow no solid in verschueren et al s derivation the state variable is the mass fraction of one of the components c and this interpretation of the state variable appears to have gotten lost in subsequent uses in more recent uses the state variable c is a normalized function range is between 1 and 1 or 0 to 1 in verschueren et al the conservation of mass is postulated to be equation 3 2 ρ d c d t j where d d t t v is the material time derivative j is called a flux and is assumed to be a constitutive variable for two phase liquid flow no solid the mass fraction is given using notation from our paper c l ε l ρ l ε l ρ l ε g ρ g thus c l 1 for all liquid and 0 for all gas assuming that ρ ε l ρ l ε g ρ g is constant as is done in verschueren et al we have beginning with the conservation of mass at the macroscale ε l ρ l t ε l ρ l v l 0 ρ c t ρ c v l 0 d c d t c v l 0 that is we do not need a constitutive equation for j as we can show that from the conservation of mass j c v l for a saturated porous medium the flux term turns out to be relate to v l s which can be obtained from darcy s law as is done in this paper equation 75 in the original work could be expressed as ρ d c d t c μ 0 i e 75 is not consistent with verschueren s formulation similarly the cahn hilliard brinkman system is not consistent with the formulation presented here this is because as verschuerent et al demonstrated the state variable has a natural physical interpretation reducing the number of unknowns and therefore not requiring one of the two conservation equations 74 and 75 6 conclusion using hybrid mixture theory we have developed a thermodynamically consistent macroscopic model that captures macroscale interfaces that is generalizable so that multi physics problems can be modeled incorporating interfacial effects without having to model interfaces at the microscale the resulting equations are consistent with the two phase cahn hilliard equation 48 the korteweg stress tensor for two liquid phases 55 darcy s law 38 and a generalization of richards equation see 58 further the result is a macroscopic system of equations that can capture macroscopic interfaces we were also able to simplify the model so that it can be interpreted as a pore scale model allowing for direct comparison with a pore scale model developed by cueto felgueroso et al 2018 and a three fluid model by boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 giving insight into the physical interpretation of some of the parameters in the model the novel additions to the traditional richards equation include three state variables each a weighted sum of the densities of two phases and three coefficients that add appropriate weight to the coefficient of the gradients of the state variables squared the coefficients are second order tensors that go to zero if the volume fraction of either phase associated with it is zero this allows the weight of each interface as it contributes to the overall energy of the system to differ perhaps allowing a differentiation of the wetting and non wetting phases the three phase model reduces to the two phase model appropriately the advantages of this formulation are numerous 1 it combines the strength of a mixture theory formulation which allows for a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent framework and the interface capturing approach of the cahn hilliard equation 2 it generalizes richards equation so that it extends concepts already existing rather than having to understand an entirely new field 3 the two phase flow equations in porous media simplify to appropriate single phase flow this is not trivial as pointed out in boyer and lapuerta 2006 boyer et al 2010 4 although this formulation does not capture e g interfacial area density it is much simpler than macroscopic models that incorporate equations for interfaces interfacial curvatures and even possibly contact lines gray and miller 2014 miller and gray 2005 gray and miller 2011 5 the incorporation of the gradient of the state variable in the list of independent variables 21 allows for the system to capture some nonlocal behavior just as increasing the order of a taylor polynomial of a smooth function about a point c approximates the function on a larger interval incorporating higher order spatial and similarly temporal derivatives into the list of independent variables better captures nonlocal or time history dependence adding an infinite number of derivatives into the list of independent variables can be shown to being equivalent to an integral differential constitutive equation see e g singh et al 2003b wojciechowski 2011 6 the model developed here allows each phase to be compressible 7 the framework allows for generalizing the model in a systematic way by modifying the list of independent variables 21 and postulating an analogous form of the helmholtz potential 22 23 models for phase changes bennethum et al 1996a alexandersson et al 2016 heat transfer bennethum and cushman 1999 alexandersson et al 2016 incorporating transport bennethum et al 1996a charged particles bennethum and cushman 2002a 2002b swelling wojciechowski et al 2014 sauerwein and steeb 2020 etc have all been modeled using hybrid mixture theory and so by adding a state variable and modifying the form of the helmoltz potentials all of these models which are generalizations of commonly used models can be formulated further this model shows that when the state variable is given a physical interpretation the number of equations needed is reduced this was demonstrated by comparing the developed model with the cahn hilliard brinkman model the model has its weaknesses the stress tensors for each phase are not symmetric although in mixture theory the stress tensors are often assumed to be symmetric anyway and there is the closure issue determining additional equations so that the system has the same number of equations as unknowns in two phase flow through porous media at the macrosacle a condition relating capillary pressure to saturation is often used although this itself has issues hysteresis being one other possible closure conditions include assuming one or more phases are incompressible or that there is a common velocity field comparing a numerical simulation of this model with experimental results is

from the coefficients of d l ρ l d t we obtain 94 λ l ρ l ψ l ρ l ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l s ε s ρ s ψ s ρ l s ρ l ψ l ρ l ψ ρ l s where ψ ε l ρ l ψ l ε s ρ s ψ s is the energy of the system energy per volume of porous medium similarly for d s ρ s d t we have 95 λ s ε l ρ l ψ l ρ l s ε s ρ s ψ s ρ l s ψ ρ l s this gives us the definition of the lagrange multipliers λ α that we will use as needed henceforth moving forward the next term yields 96 ε l ρ l ψ l d l 0 which tells us that the hemholtz potential of the liquid phases is not a function of the rate of deformation tensors d l the coefficient of d s

the coefficients of v l s gives 98 ε l ρ l ψ l v l s ε s ρ s ψ s v l s ψ t v l s 0 this tells us the energy of the system is not a function of relative velocity and we shall make a slightly more restrictive assumption in that we will assume that the helmholtz potentials of each phase is not a function of the relative velocity finally the coefficient of t gives 99 ε l q l ε s q s 0 which tells us that the net heat flux is always zero clearly untrue unless at constant temperature this assumption can be relaxed by incorporating the gradient of temperature into the list of independent variables bennethum and cushman 1999 thus we now have 100 ψ l ψ l t ε l ρ l ρ l s 101 ψ s ψ s t ε l e s ρ l s although other constitutive variables can still be a function of d l and v l s b2 results that hold near equilibrium the variables d l v l s ε l and e s l are zero at equilibrium and in order for the rate of entropy production to be minimum at equilibrium the partial derivative of t λ with respect to each of these quantities must be zero at equilibrium the result is that the coefficients of these variables are zero at equilibrium coleman and noll 1963 bennethum et al 2000 we then linearize about each of these quantities to obtain a near equilibrium result only keeping the above variable that produces a quadratic term in the entropy inequality e g coleman and noll method coleman and noll 1963 so consider the coefficient of d l the coefficient is zero at equilibrium and the near equilibrium result is this coefficient plus a coefficient times d l giving 102 t l ρ l λ l

note that if we substitute this expression back into the entropy inequality we obtain a quadratic term in d l guaranteeing a positive or zero term in the entropy inequality if we impose the

338,travel time distributions ttds provide an effective way to describe the transport and mixing processes of water parcels in a subsurface hydrological system a major challenge in characterizing catchment ttd is quantifying the travel times in deep groundwater and its contribution to the streamflow ttd here we develop and test a novel modeling framework for an integrated assessment of catchment scale ttds through explicit representation of 3d groundwater dynamics the proposed framework is based on the linkage between a flux tracking scheme with the surface hydrologic model mhm for the soil water compartment and a particle tracking scheme with the 3d groundwater model opengeosys ogs for the groundwater compartment this linkage provides us with the ability to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of ttds in these different hydrological compartments from grid scale to regional scale we apply this framework in the nägelstedt catchment in central germany simulation results reveal that both shape and scale of grid scale groundwater ttds are spatially heterogeneous which are strongly dependent on the topography and aquifer structure the component wise analysis of catchment ttd shows a time dependent sensitivity of transport processes in soil zone and groundwater to driving meteorological forcing catchment ttd exhibits a power law shape and fractal behavior the predictive uncertainty in catchment mean travel time is dominated by the uncertainty in the deep groundwater rather than that in the soil zone catchment mean travel time is severely biased by a marginal error in groundwater characterization accordingly we recommend to use multiple summary statistics to minimize the predictive uncertainty introduced by the tailing behavior of catchment ttd keywords travel time distribution flux tracking particle tracking coupled model predictive uncertainty 1 introduction characterizing the travel or transit time tt of a water parcel is important for the assessment and management of global and regional water resources travel time distributions ttds provide a statistical representation of this property by accounting for the storage mixing and transport processes in a hydrologic system niemi 1977 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 botter et al 2010 mcdonnell et al 2010 analysis of water parcel tts is therefore of high relevance to the groundwater recharge estimation cartwright et al 2017 mccallum et al 2017 the vulnerability of water resources molnat and gascuel odoux 2002 benettin et al 2015 and the assessment of nonpoint source agricultural contamination böhlke and denver 1995 eberts et al 2012 kumar et al 2020 water tts are typically not measured directly instead they are inferred using models constrained by hydrological and geochemical data mccallum et al 2014 mcguire et al 2007 benettin et al 2019 such models of ttds can be classified into lumped parameter models dynamic storage selection sas functions flux tracking models and particle tracking models sprenger et al 2019 among them the sas approach is a state of art technique to characterize the temporal dynamics of ttds and mixing processes of water parcels botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2015 harman 2015 it distinguishes between the ttds and residence time distributions rtds botter et al 2011 by virtue of said sas functions and is able to comprehensively describe the age specific outflow generation moreover two different forms of time variant ttds forward and backward forms can be distinguished in this framework benettin et al 2015 flux tracking models are based on the determinants i e hydrological fluxes storages of resulting precipitation partitioning processes although these models are often highly conceptualized by e g assuming perfect mixing inside each control volume they have been proven to be a valuable modeling framework to interpret tracer data and derive catchment scale ttds to better characterize the age distribution of water storage and outflow fluxes hrachowitz et al 2013 benettin et al 2015 heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 flux tracking therefore helps to estimate ttds of different water storages and to understand the mixing behaviors of soil water and groundwater hrachowitz et al 2013 if spatially distributed models are used for input the spatial heterogeneity in ttds can also be assessed using flux tracking heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 on the other hand lagrangian particle tracking is a physically based approach that uses the explicit characterization of velocity fields and associated flow lines of the water particles in a heterogeneous subsurface system particle tracking can be used to trace the transport pathways of individual water particles under the assumption of dispersive advective transport or sole advective transport eberts et al 2012 leray et al 2016 davies and beven 2012 such a particle tracking approach is typically linked with three dimensional distributed groundwater models that account for unsaturated and saturated groundwater flow and related age estimation de rooij et al 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2015 yang et al 2018 jing et al 2019 although being computationally expensive particle tracking models enable the direct link between tts and the physical processes nevertheless the particle tracking approach is not immune from certain methodological choices like spatial resolution or discretization of the mesh and geological attributes representing the subsurface system sprenger et al 2019 maxwell et al 2019 jing et al 2019 flux tracking approaches work very well with conceptual hydrological models i e bucket type models that track water fluxes between different compartments by partitioning precipitation generating runoff and reproducing near surface hydrological variables e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration unfortunately their groundwater characterizations are always implicit and processes are simplified conceptualized with one or two lumped parameters resulting in a possibly over simplified characterization of groundwater flow and transport processes fenicia et al 2006 stewart et al 2012 this is mainly due to the fact that the signal near the surface i e discharge or tracer concentration is insensitive to the variation in groundwater storage a recent study by gleeson et al 2016 demonstrates that only around 6 of total groundwater in the uppermost 2 km over the globe is found to be contributed by contemporary modern recharge fluxes indicating that only a modest portion of the total groundwater storage actively interacts with surface water groundwater ages may consequently span a wide range of values e g over 50 years over a short distance less than 1 5 m in the vertical direction weissmann et al 2002 this strong heterogeneity in groundwater ages cannot be explicitly captured by conceptual approaches used with flux tracking but requires a detailed treatment of subsurface heterogeneity and tracing of water particles through physically based groundwater models jing et al 2018 another important challenge to the ttd characterization is the fact that tts of water parcels are time variant and spatially heterogeneous this transient behavior of ttds has only been investigated more recently botter et al 2010 rinaldo et al 2011 cornaton 2012 harman 2015 engdahl 2017 kaandorp et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 the temporal variability has been investigated using tracer experiments birkel et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2012 benettin et al 2015 the spatial variability in tt behavior however cannot be assessed using tracer data in streamflow because this signal is a lumped representation of the whole catchment kirchner 2016 the spatial distribution of water tts is critical to the assessment of point and nonpoint source contamination the spatial variability in ttds is closely related to the topographical morphological and geological properties within the catchment the inferred mean travel time mtt using tracer data is subject to a high aggregation error in heterogeneous catchments kirchner 2016 some studies unveiled that the shape of ttds among different catchments can be different kaandorp et al 2018 abrams and haitjema 2018 remondi et al 2019 however the spatial heterogeneity of the grid scale ttds parameters e g shape and scale within a catchment has rarely been investigated although many studies deployed flux tracking methods to estimate catchment scale ttds the characterizations of groundwater storages are often conceptual indicating that an analytical relationship between the storage and discharge has typically been presumed in a simplified manner often as the outflow from a linear reservoir this simplified characterization may lead to severe errors in interpreting tracer data and could essentially underestimate the catchment ttd due to its incapability in seeing the old water stewart et al 2012 2017 yet given the known heterogeneity of subsurface flow patterns this paucity of spatially explicit representation of the groundwater system restricts the accuracy and reliability of inferred tt while some studies have begun accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the soil compartment heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 a similar approach to the deeper groundwater system is still missing due to this gap a number of questions remain currently unanswered for example what is the explicit role of groundwater in shaping up the travel time distributions ttds of an overall streamflow behavior in other words how to disentangle the role of near surface soil and groundwater tts how does the spatial heterogeneity of ttds resulting from the differences in climate and landscape attributes e g soil and geological features affect the overall i e catchment wide tt behavior and finally how different are the spatial feature of ttds corresponding to near surface and groundwater components to answer these questions we comprehensively investigate the spatial and temporal variability in ttds through the integration of the flux tracking approach with the particle tracking approach we describe and test the methodology to provide an integrated assessment of the catchment scale subsurface ttds accounting for an explicit treatment of the groundwater component using a 3 d groundwater model we adapted a spatially varying description of transient ttds through a flux tracking scheme hrachowitz et al 2013 heße et al 2017 that accounts for the daily variation in near surface hydrological processes e g soil moisture evapotranspiration fast flows groundwater recharge represented in a distributed surface hydrologic model the groundwater component is represented through a three dimensional groundwater model and a particle tracking scheme is used to infer the corresponding groundwater tts both components are interactively linked such that spatial and temporal variability of ttds can be deduced for each hydrologic compartment at any specified location within a study domain the proposed modeling framework explicitly accounts for the spatial heterogeneity of climate and landscape attributes including the representing of deep groundwater aquifers we apply and test the proposed approach in a single densely mapped catchment located in central europe 2 methodology 2 1 integrated hydrological model for the numerical modeling of the subsurface water flow we employ the coupled mhm ogs model as described by jing et al 2018 this model was developed to account for the different challenges faced when modeling near surface flow e g soil moisture vs modeling deeper subsurface flow i e groundwater in the coupled mhm ogs model the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 is used to track the surface and near surface hydrologic fluxes and storages e g root zone soil moisture evapotranspiration infiltration groundwater recharge on the other hand the groundwater model opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012 is used to simulate the groundwater flow in the deeper aquifers and track the paths of water particles mhm is a distributed hydrologic model that employs grid cells as the basic unit and is capable of simulating various near surface water fluxes and states these include interception surface runoff evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture dynamics samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 the root zone has been partitioned into several water storages including the canopy storage x 1 the snowpack x 2 the soil moisture content in the root zone x 3 impounded water in reservoirs or sealed area x 4 subsurface reservoir x 5 and groundwater reservoir x 6 the root zone is further discretized into three soil layers with the two upper layers end in 0 05 and 0 25 m and the lowest layer is spatially variable with the depth prescribed based on the soil map average of around 1 8 m deep see zink et al 2017 the conceptualization of these water storages can be found in fig 1 and details of the model parameterizations can be found in samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 livneh et al 2015 and heße et al 2017 the model uses a unique multiscale parameter regionalization mpr technique to explicitly incorporate the sub grid variability of basin physical properties e g terrain soil and landcover attributes and facilitates model runs at multiple spatial resolutions samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 mhm can be conditioned and evaluated using various types and sources of data rakovec et al 2016 zink et al 2018 the model is available under an open source license and details on model conceptualisation and parameterization can be obtained at www ufz de mhm it has been successfully established for many large scale applications including to investigate climate change impact assessment studies samaniego et al 2018 thober et al 2018 ogs is a physically based porous media simulator employing the finite element method to solve subsurface processes kolditz et al 2012 ogs has been successfully applied to cope with a broad range of hydrogeological problems including seawater intrusion groundwater depletion and water resources management sun et al 2011 kalbacher et al 2012 jing et al 2018 ogs explicitly solves the partial differential equations of 3 d unsaturated saturated groundwater flow two models are linked through a mhm ogs coupling interface through this interface mhm based spatially distributed recharge and baseflow along stream network are transferred as neumann boundary conditions in the ogs groundwater model jing et al 2018 2019 here we provide a brief overview of the coupling workflow and for more details please refer to jing et al 2018 1 after calibration mhm is first run to calculate soil zone fluxes and variables including the recharge and baseflow at the time step t i 2 the stepwise routed baseflow calculated by mhm is converted into distributed river discharges this distributed river discharge serves as a neumann boundary condition in the ogs model 3 groundwater recharge estimated by mhm is also interpolated onto the upper surface of ogs mesh serving as a neumann boundary condition 4 ogs model calculates the updated groundwater flow and transport variables at time step t i and replaces the original groundwater variables in mhm 5 the same procedure is repeated at the time step t i 1 until the end of simulation 2 2 integrated travel time framework corresponding to this coupled numerical modeling framework we deploy different strategies to track the tts within their respective soil and groundwater compartments see fig 1 for the water that travels through the soil compartment we use a flux tracking scheme following heße et al 2017 the flux tracking scheme is built upon the bucket type hydrologic conceptualization wherein each bucket is presumed to be well mixed water storage and the water can be stored in the bucket infiltrated into the deeper bucket or discharged as runoff or evapotranspiration the storage discharge behaviors in each bucket are conditioned by climate forcing and topographical morphological and geological properties this scheme consequently relies on the model results of mhm see the upper part of the schematic in fig 1 following heße et al 2017 for the water that travels through the aquifer system we use a particle tracking scheme namely the random walk particle tracking rwpt algorithm to track the flow path lines in the heterogeneous aquifer system rwpt is a lagrangian particle tracking method assuming that the advection process is deterministic and the dispersion process is stochastic rwpt has been used to simulate reactive transport processes as well as particle tts in heterogeneous groundwater systems park et al 2008 jing et al 2019 this algorithm is connected to the physically based groundwater model ogs see the lower part of the schematic in fig 1 the integrated ttds of the whole input water can then be derived through the mass weighted combination of the component wise ttds fig 1 travel time in the soil compartment to begin let us consider the ttd in a control volume cv e g a grid cell here we define interflow as the water flux that infiltrates the soil surface and flows into the stream which typically travels above the groundwater level and baseflow as the runoff component generated by deep saturated groundwater beven 1989 the hydrological processes in this cv are controlled by an influx j typically precipitation as well as several outflux components namely evapotranspiration e t q i f representing the interflow and r representing the percolation or recharge to the deeper groundwater aquifer the continuity equation can be given as 1 d s d t j q i f r e t here the input flux j contains numerous water particles each of which enters the system at time t i and leaves the cv at time t e as e t q i f or r for the non stationary hydrologic system it is advantageous to distinguish the tt t t from the residence time t r let us define the tt t t as the time elapsed by the water particle from entering till exiting the cv t t t e t i conversely at a given time t the residence time t r is defined as t r t t i the forward expression of ttd p t t t t i tracks the tts of particles injected into the system at a given time t i we assume that the soil water storage is well mixed wherein the water particles randomly exit as q i f r or e t following botter et al 2010 the analytical form of the travel time pdf of water parcels exiting as q i f in a well mixed storage can be expressed by 2 p t i f t t i t i q i f t s t e t i t q i f r e t s x d x θ i f t i in this equation the hydrologic partition function of interflow θ i f t i is expressed as 3 θ i f t i t i q i f τ s τ e t i t q i f r e t s x d x d τ eq 2 and 3 are forward expressions of travel time pdfs for water particles discharged as interflow similarly pdfs for water particles recharged to the deep groundwater aquifers p t r t t i t i can also be expressed using eq 2 and 3 by swapping q i f with r travel time in the groundwater compartment water particles that recharged into the deeper groundwater aquifers are traced using rwpt in an explicit three dimensional groundwater model for such a system let p t g w t represent the ttd of water particles passing through groundwater aquifers estimated by the rwpt method then the ttd of water particles from their entrance to the subsurface system through recharge until their discharge as baseflow can be expressed using the following convolution integral 4 p t b f t t i t i t i p t r τ t i t i p t g w t τ t i d τ this convolution represents the fact that the tt of any water parcel leaving as baseflow can be considered as a the sum of two random variables the tt for passing through the soil compartment and the tt for passing through the groundwater compartment see schematic in fig 1 once the tts for water parcels leaving as interflow and baseflow are determined the integrated tt for water parcels leaving the entire subsurface can be computed integrated travel time in the subsurface the catchment wide subsurface ttd p t s s t t i t i can now be calculated by the mass weighted average of p t i f t t i t i and p t b f t t i t i note that for the grid cell based hydrologic model the catchment ttd can be calculated by mass weighted averaging the ttd of each grid cell over the whole catchment 5 p t s s t t i t i θ i f t i p t i f t t i t i 1 θ i f t i p t b f t t i t i in the above described way the catchment ttd can be realized by linking flux tracking in the soil zone and particle tracking in the groundwater storage fig 1 using the above modeling framework we can analyse the spatio temporal behaviour of the resulting ttds furthermore we also characterize the marginal quasi stationary behaviour of ttds through a time averaging approach heße et al 2017 summary statistics we use several summary statistics to characterize and compare the shape and scale of ttds in different hydrological compartments these include the mean travel time mtt the median tt the standard deviation sd the coefficient of variation cv and the interquartile range besides for the parametric form of mean ttds we choose the two parameter gamma distribution this parametric distribution can account for the nonlinear behavior and the heterogeneity of the reservoir kirchner et al 2000 hrachowitz et al 2010 the gamma distribution has two parameters a shape factor α and a scale factor β and its pdfs can be expressed as 6 p t t α 1 β α γ α e t β t α 1 t α α γ α e α t t where t is the travel time and t α β is the mean travel time 2 3 study area to exemplify the use of this integrated travel time framework we applied it to the nägelstedt catchment located in central germany fig 2 the study area is a mesoscale headwater catchment of the unstrut river catchment with an area of approximately 850 km2 the terrain elevation in the study area ranges from 166 m to 516 m above mean sea level the climate is classified as warm temperate fully humid and warm summer a cfb type according to the kȵppen geiger method kottek et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation is around 660 mm and the mean annual temperature is around 8 3 degrees celsius as shown in fig 2 four 1 1 km2 grid cells are selected as samples for tracing water travel times these four grid cells are selected to cover both the groundwater recharge areas at highlands c2 and c4 and drainage areas c1 and c3 the locations of these selected cells with varying geographical characteristics are depicted in fig 2 specifically c1 is a grid cell at a lowland close to the discharge point c2 represents the grid cell in the western mountainous area close to the left tributary c3 represents the point at the central lowland near the mainstream and c4 represent the eastern mountainous area close to the right tributary the study area is intensively used for agricultural purposes around 78 of the total land in this area has been classified as arable land wechsung et al 2008 around 17 of the land is marked as forests while the remaining 5 is regarded as urban areas heße et al 2017 fig 2 groundwater plays a critical role in supplying public water in this area wechsung et al 2008 the main geological unit in nägelstedt catchment is muschelkalk muschelkalk is mainly composed of marine sediments fig 3 it can be further divided into three sub units which are upper muschelkalk mo middle muschelkalk mm and lower muschelkalk mu fig 3 besides the keuper sediments overlying the muschelkalk form an aquifer aquitard system in the central floodplain the keuper can be divided into middle keuper km and lower keuper ku wherein the lower keuper has a high content of grey clay and may form an aquitard fig 3 this catchment is dominated by agriculture land with a high risk of groundwater contamination due to intensive agricultural activities wechsung et al 2008 the fate of input water is of high relevance with groundwater quantity and resilience additionally this area is also a target area of the aquadiva project http www aquadiva uni jena de which aims to cope with environmental problems by multi disciplinary investigations of biogeochemical processes in the hainich critical zone observatory küsel et al 2016 kohlhepp et al 2017 2 4 model setup calibration and evaluation the mhm and ogs models were established and calibrated for this catchment using the framework described in jing et al 2018 and jing et al 2019 the distributed mhm simulations were established at a daily time step over 60 years 1955 2004 and with a spatial resolution of 500 m 500 m the climate forcings driving the mhm model e g atmospheric temperature and precipitation are based on the observations from the german meteorological service dwd other data for the mhm model setup include the dem data the land cover data the soil type data the hydrogeological data and the discharge data heße et al 2017 jing et al 2018 a detailed evaluation of the mhm model including simulations of near surface fluxes such as runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge has been presented in several past studies zink et al 2017 heße et al 2017 jing et al 2018 for the groundwater model we used a three dimensional mesh based on a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 25 m combined with information on the geological zonation we established a stratigraphic model based on the geological data from the thuringian state office for the environment and geology tlug based on this we used a mesh with a spatial resolution of 250 m 250 m 10 m in x y and z directions respectively fischer et al 2015 specifically the less permeable muschelkalk zones underlying the keuper formation mo2 mm2 and mu2 are distinguished from the more permeable muschelkalk zones mo1 mm1 and mu1 see table 1 this three dimensional mesh is shown in fig 3 moreover we also account for the uncertainty in prescribing the hydraulic conductivity values in different geological formations and their contribution to the simulated groundwater and resulting travel times specifically we generate an ensemble of hydraulic conductivity fields using the null space monte carlo nsmc approach tonkin and doherty 2009 the range and distribution of parameters for this uncertainty analysis can be found in appendix fig b 14 here we assume steady state transport processes in the deep groundwater aquifers this assumption is only limited to the ogs model this assumption is justified due to fluctuations in recharge rates having only a minor influence on groundwater ttds benettin et al 2015 engdahl 2017 jing et al 2019 given the large storage of groundwater systems we then assigned a no flow boundary condition at the bottom and outer perimeter of the mesh whereas a fixed head boundary condition was assigned on the stream beds of the perennial rivers the river network can be found in fig 2 to track the flow paths of water parcels we released a large number of particles 100 000 particles at the top surface of the mesh the spatial distribution of these particles was arranged to meet the spatial distribution of the mean recharge fields fig 4 in the calibration phase the model satisfactorily computed the daily discharge at the catchment outlet over a 30 year period the calibrated model demonstrated good capability in reproducing high frequency discharge fig 5 the skill score based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is 0 60 which is satisfactory considering the 30 year simulation period and daily resolution simulated dynamics of evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge were also evaluated and validated by the observation at eddy covariance stations and the hydrological atlas of germany heße et al 2017 zink et al 2017 these results confirmed the reliability and accuracy of mhm in capturing the soil zone water dynamics we then calibrated the ogs groundwater model against the observed groundwater levels 1955 2004 at 18 spatially distributed monitoring wells jing et al 2018 2019 hydrogeological parameters of the calibrated groundwater model are shown in table 1 the ogs model was also capable to reproduce the pattern of groundwater circulation in the deep aquifers fig 5 to confirm the accuracy and reliability of the mhm ogs model in simulating the groundwater dynamics we evaluate the modeled groundwater using observations of multiple distributed monitoring wells wherein 30 year time series of observed groundwater levels are available the evaluation results are shown in fig 5 and fig a 13 in this evaluation phase the model also satisfactorily simulated the response of groundwater levels to climate forcing fig 5 and appendix fig a 13 the calibrated model was able to adequately characterize the observed trend and magnitude of monthly groundwater level fluctuations across the observation wells fig 5 and appendix fig a 13 this is demonstrated by pearson correlation coefficient r values of 0 71 0 82 0 48 0 81 and 0 70 for five monitoring wells respectively based on this successful establishment and evaluation exercise the coupled mhm ogs model was used to track the movements and tts of water parcels across the whole catchment 3 results in the following we show the application of this integrated modeling framework for a single case study namely the nägelstedt catchment we track the tts of water inputs from january 1955 to december 1974 because the 60 year data 1955 2004 of the precipitation and discharge enable the tracing of water influxes in this period for the following 30 years 1974 2004 specifically we show the spatial variability in ttds associated with different spatial scales grid scale and regional scale the temporal variability of catchment ttd the contribution of groundwater to the catchment ttd and the sensitivity of component wise ttd to the climate forcing 3 1 sensitivity of groundwater ttds to spatial scale and topography fig 6 shows the groundwater ttds for the catchment and for four selected 1 1 km2 local grid cells c1 c2 c3 and c4 the analysis results presented here correspond to the derived tts for water particles from their entrance to their exit from the deep aquifers we also fit the gamma distribution against the simulated catchment scale groundwater ttd to show its preference for discharging young old water the catchment scale groundwater ttd shows a preference for discharging younger water with a α value of 0 71 the parameter α of the gamma distribution characterizes the shape of ttds a α value less than 1 indicates a strong initial peak and a long tail however the grid scale groundwater ttds exhibit a strong spatial variability in both shape and scale simulated groundwater ttds in c1 c2 c3 and c4 have diverse shapes and scales which also deviate from the catchment groundwater ttd this is attributed to their different hydrogeological conditions and the resulting different layout of the flow pathways e g the occurrence of preferential pathways in some cells due to the more permeable geological formation meanwhile the mean travel times mtts of groundwater in these cells vary widely ranging from 70 4 years for c4 to 115 2 years for c1 this pronounced spatial variability in the mtts shows the distinct behavior of flow paths and velocities of water particles for different areas the parameter uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity propagates to the simulated groundwater ttd which is demonstrated by the coefficient of variation cv of the catchment scale groundwater mtt 14 2 the spatial distributions of the mean and standard deviation of groundwater tt mtt and sd in distributed 1 1 km2 grid cells over the whole catchment are shown in fig 7 specifically we category the grid cells into central lowland and surrounding highland according to topography we find a strong spatial heterogeneity in mtt of grid scale groundwater ttds noticeably the volume averaged ttd in the surrounding highland is about twice as large as that in central lowland the groundwater mtt ranges from years to decades for lowland whereas these values lie in the decadal to centurial scale for the outer highlands this is mainly attributed to the relatively sparse stream network and the lower hydraulic conductivity of main geological formations in the highland area the sd of tts also shows similar spatial structure sd is generally lower in central lowland around the vicinity of the stream network and higher at highland far away from streams these two summary statistics provide not much information on the shape of grid scale groundwater ttds but we can expect a large variability in them based on the distinct shape of four sampled ttds fig 6 3 2 climate control on water travel times tracking historical trajectories of the tts over a long period of precipitation events helps us to understand the relationship between time variant tts and the resulting hydrologic controls fig 8 shows the time series of tts and the corresponding monthly precipitation rates over the span of 20 years 1955 1974 fig 8 shows a large temporal variation in the median tts of soil water interflows which closely follow the temporal dynamics of precipitation in general higher precipitation rates result in a shorter tt of soil water a result well known from the literature we can also observe a significant seasonality in soil water tt which is largely attributed to the seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 8 conversely the temporal fluctuations in precipitation have a minor effect on the tt of groundwater there is no seasonal pattern in the groundwater tts see the second panel in fig 8 the integrated tt of the whole catchment has an intermediate temporal variability which is attributed to the fact that the catchment ttd is a weighted average between the soil zone ttd and the groundwater ttd the median tts over the 20 year simulation period are around 1 2 41 and 8 years for the soil water interflow groundwater baseflow and the total streamflow respectively the groundwater tts show the largest interquartile range indicating the large time scale e g decade of the groundwater transport processes the interquartile range is also strongly inversely related to precipitation such that low precipitation causes a larger interquartile range of water tts these simulation results through the integrated modeling framework reveal the contrasting tt characteristics of the different hydrological compartments we use the modeling framework to understand the effect of climate forcing on the varying behavior of water transport and mixing in different hydrologic compartments specifically we evaluate the characteristics and response of the hydrologic partition function eq 3 and the resulting median tts of different hydrological compartments to varying hydroclimatic conditions fig 9 in a scatter plot shown in fig 9 the individual points represent the monthly averaged values for 40 years from 1955 1995 we separated the 40 years time period into wet and dry years depending on the deviation from the average annual effective precipitation rate effective precipitation is defined as the precipitation that is not evapotranspired and eventually discharges into streams the hydrologic partition function for water discharged as interflow θ i f is positively related to higher effective precipitation indicating the key part of hydroclimatic forcing in partitioning the water budget and generating quick interflows the θ i f values in many years deviate from the fitted regression line fig 9 this is because θ i f is a function of all precipitation events after water parcels enters into the catchment rather than the precipitation events of a given year mtts are negatively correlated with the effective precipitation in the soil zone groundwater aquifer and the whole catchment although with different degrees of absolute values the mtts in the soil zone are more sensitive to the climate forcing with the mtts in dry years being on average two times higher than the values observed in wet years the dependency of mtts on hydro climatic conditions for baseflow is not as pronounced as that for interflow the mtts for the whole catchment show the moderate response with values in the wet years being on average 20 lower than those observed during dry years 3 3 contribution of groundwater to catchment ttd the numerical framework described here allows for the investigation of space time behavior of ttds in different hydrologic compartments and their contribution to overall ttd here we explicitly examine the role of component wise ttds and their relationship to the integrated catchment signal specifically we show how the parameter uncertainty in different hydrologic components affects the predictive capability of the integrated ttd fig 10 shows the probability density functions pdfs for water tts discharged as interflow baseflow and the total runoff over the whole catchment from 1955 to 1974 the catchment ttd exhibits a power law behavior with a significant long tail fig 10 this indicates that the catchment discharge is comprised of water parcels with a wide range of travel times the mean tt of water particles discharged as interflow mttif is approximately 1 93 years conversely the mean tt of water particles discharged as baseflow mttbf is 74 16 years based on the hydrologic partition function the mean tt for the whole catchment mttq is 37 50 years it is worth noting that the estimated mtt is much larger than the corresponding median tt in every hydrological compartment which emphasizes the asymmetric long tail behavior of the ttds fig 8 and fig 10 we could also observe a narrower shading width towards the higher tails of the ttds indicating a decreasing temporal variance in the probability function with increasing tt there is also a contrasting shape width between the ttds of the two hydrologic compartments with a larger temporal variability for the soil water tts than that of the groundwater tts we attribute this to the relatively more dynamic fluxes and storage volumes in the shallow soil zone compared to those in the deep groundwater aquifer this also reveals the damping effect of the catchment to the input signal e g precipitation fig 11 shows the simulation results of the grid scale ttds in four 1 1 km2 grid cells through the mass weighted average of the ttds of interflow and the ttds of baseflow a remarkable difference in the scales of the interflow tts and baseflow tts can be observed across the four analyzed locations the mtts of water discharged as interflow are approximately 2 years for all four cells whereas the mttbf values vary over a wide range 63 18 96 78 years as a mass weighted average between the above two ttds the integrated mean tts of the total runoff range from 38 43 61 39 years the shapes of the integrated ttds are irregular due to the distinct shapes and time scales of soil water ttds and groundwater ttds the shapes of the integrated ttds are dominated by the soil water for an early period e g tts less than 1 year and thereafter by the groundwater for the tails of the distribution fig 11 we can also observe a multi modal shape of the overall ttd for the c4 cell which is mainly controlled by the complex aquifer geometry and stratigraphy overall ttds in c1 c2 and c3 present similar power law shape and fractal behaviors the mtts of overall discharge flux show a strong spatial heterogeneity which is largely due to the heterogeneous mtts in baseflow moreover the decadal scale of mtt of total runoff can be attributed to the long tails of baseflow ttd this signifies the importance of appropriate characterization of deep groundwater such that it strongly controls the scale of overall mtts 3 4 predictive uncertainty in catchment ttd we further study the influence of uncertainties in different hydrological compartments and their contributions to the total uncertainty in streamflow signal the simulation results in subsection 3 1 already shows that the parameter uncertainty in aquifer hydraulic properties results in a 14 18 variation in simulated groundwater mtt accordingly we investigate how this degree of variation in groundwater affects the predicted overall mtt in streamflow we also set up a reference scenario wherein the same degree of variation in soil water mtt is considered and compare the predictive uncertainty in overall mtt in these two scenarios we then calculate the induced variation in median tt of the catchment from the same degree of variation in soil zone and groundwater fig 12 clearly shows the contrasting degree of predictive uncertainty in these two scenarios note that the volume contribution of soil zone and deep groundwater is computed using the hydrologic partition function θ we find that the contribution from the soil zone is about 56 a 14 2 variation in groundwater mtt leads to an around 48 4 variation in catchment mtt whereas the same variation in soil water mtt only results in an around 1 6 variation in catchment mtt however the same level of variation in soil zone and groundwater only leads to 8 7 and 7 8 variations in catchment scale median tt this indicates that although the volume contributions from soil water and groundwater to the streamflow are almost equal the sensitivities of catchment mtt to them are distinct in the study area where baseflow from deep groundwater substantially makes up a large portion of streamflow catchment mtt is extremely sensitive to variation in groundwater and not sensitive to that in soil water although quick interflow from soil zone constitutes about 56 of the total volume of streamflow their tts appear to have a minor influence on the overall mtt alternatively speaking mtt is not representative of the transport processes in the soil zone even if the volume of interflow constitutes more than half of the total volume of streamflow the sensitivities of catchment scale median tts to soil zone and groundwater seem to be consistent with the volume weights of these two components indicating that the median tt is more robust in terms of representing the overall behavior of water transport processes relative to the mtt 4 discussion this study introduces a novel modeling framework that couples the flux tracking approach and the particle tracking approach to achieve a full spatially explicit description of subsurface ttds we use this modeling framework to investigate the spatio temporal behaviors of ttds in different compartments of the subsurface water cycle in the nägelstedt catchment although the simulations in this study are particular to the study area the method used here is applicable to other regional catchment the numerical simulation results have important implications for understanding the transient and spatially heterogeneous tts in subsurface systems 4 1 spatial variability in ttds and its dependence on topography and aquifer structure the proposed modeling approach explicitly characterizes the spatial variability in component wise water ttds across scales from grid scale to catchment scale therefore it facilitates the study of topographic and geologic controls on catchment ttds since we could observe a significant influence of the subsurface hydraulic heterogeneity on the shapes of grid scale ttds it follows that the explicit characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is a nontrivial element to a comprehensive characterization of ttds fig 11 this influence can be attributed to the complex spatial organization of flow pathlines within the aquifer system resulting from a said pattern of stratigraphy these findings are in line with the ones described by danesh yazdi et al 2018 and kaandorp et al 2018 who also report strong variability in the shapes of ttds either using different realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields or in different catchments we also observe different patterns of groundwater ttd for central lowland and surrounding highland which is likely related to the distance to the groundwater discharge zone and the underlying subsurface structure a similarly strong dependence of ttd on topography has been reported in other real world catchments cardenas 2007 remondi et al 2019 the contrasting shapes and scales of groundwater ttds in different investigated cells see fig 7 and fig 8 highlight the key role of subsurface heterogeneity in controlling the flow paths and tts of water parcels this effect is unveiled by direct simulation of the pathways and velocities of a large number of released particle tracers using the rwpt algorithm investigating the relationship between the properties of the aquifer system and the behavior of groundwater ttds revealed a number of relevant relationships the strong spatial heterogeneity in the shapes of grid scale groundwater ttd is mainly introduced by the stratigraphical structure of the aquifer system and the zoned hydraulic conductivity distribution prevailed across the study area the grid scale mtt appears to be closely related to the distance of the corresponding grid cell to the stream network these findings are in line with fiori and russo 2008 and ameli et al 2016 wherein they also found a strong dependence of ttd on the vertical pattern of hydraulic properties the aforementioned strong spatial variability of tts has greater implications for the assessment of nonpoint source agricultural contamination the long tail and fractal behavior of catchment ttd imply a high risk of legacy contamination in the nägelstedt catchment wherein agricultural activities are extremely intensive wechsung et al 2008 the proposed mhm ogs modeling framework could therefore be a valuable tool in revealing the intrinsic mechanism of the legacy nitrogen in streamflow which has been frequently reported in many catchments across germany and the globe mueller et al 2016 van meter et al 2017 2018 4 2 temporal variability in catchment ttd conditioned by precipitation the second contribution of this study is on the time varying impact of soil water and groundwater to the integrated ttds this finding is crucial to the understanding and prediction of the fate and the tts of nonpoint source input solute such as agricultural contaminants in general we observe a decrease in variability for longer times see fig 10 and fig 11 this can be attributed to the different sensitivities of the shallow soil storage and the deeper groundwater aquifer to the climate forcing the shallow storage is highly dynamic due to being subjected to the highly dynamic input of precipitation its small storage volume compared to the deeper groundwater system the varying land use type and the impact of evapotranspiration benettin et al 2015 conversely the deeper groundwater aquifer system has a large storage volume and no apparent direct connections with the atmosphere leading to the overall less dynamic input forcing in the form of groundwater recharge jing et al 2019 heße et al 2017 the hydroclimatic conditions also control the contribution from different hydrological compartments to the overall ttd the median travel time in dry years is expected to be larger than that in wet years implying that transport and mixing characteristics of the catchment will be altered by the changing climatic conditions this is attributed to the fact that higher precipitation essentially increases the hydraulic potential difference in both soil and groundwater and thus activates shallow flow pathlines kaandorp et al 2018 remondi et al 2019 these kinds of response behaviors tts vs climate forcings noticed here are in line with those of remondi et al 2018 and jing et al 2019 wherein they also found a strong dependence of catchment tts on hydroclimatic forcing conditions 4 3 contribution of different hydrological compartments to catchment ttd this study provides insights into the constitution of catchment ttd of different hydrological compartments compared with the partition of the hydrograph the partition of water mass in streamflow suffers from a wider range of uncertainty which is mainly attributed to the difficulty in quantifying contribution from slow baseflow component stewart et al 2012 tracer based analysis e g interpretation of tritium data using lumped parameter model is a common approach used for this purpose but it also suffers from many sources of error such as the aggregation error kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the application in the nägelstedt catchment is built on a 60 years of the daily hydroclimatic forcing data and a 3 d stratigraphic aquifer model therefore explicitly accounts for the spatial and temporal heterogeneity that facilitates the forward type of particle tracking the partitioning of contributions from different hydrological compartments is achieved through the hydrologic partition function θ which explicitly tracks all precipitation events after the entrance of water parcels to the catchment several recent studies have also demonstrated the advantages of forward simulation of travel times in explicitly accounting for the constitution of catchment ttd koh et al 2018 eberts et al 2012 4 4 uncertainty and robustness of mtt in describing catchment transport processes the catchment ttd exhibits a power law behavior with a high probability at an early stage and a long tail fig 10 and fig 11 this tailing behavior is also revealed by the strong deviation from mtt 37 50 years to median tt 8 years of the catchment the decadal scale of catchment mtt has also been reported in several tritium based studies although the catchment properties may vary greatly from this study cartwright and morgenstern 2015 stewart et al 2017 the power law behavior also exhibit the uncertainty propagating from parameters varying hydraulic conductivity values to groundwater simulations and the resulting ttds in the study area the same degrees of uncertainty in soil zone and groundwater can lead to distinct scales of predictive uncertainty in mtt although the volume contributions from two components to streamflow are almost the same this suggests the accurate characterization of groundwater ttd is critical to the accuracy and reliability of simulated mtt and the uncertainty in soil water tts is almost irrelevant to the simulated mtt unfortunately the simulated groundwater ttd is inevitably subject to parameter uncertainty because the regional hydraulic parameters are typically inferred through model calibration many studies also reveal that a calibrated groundwater model cannot be exempted from parameter uncertainty due to the calibration null space and the model structural error moore and doherty 2006 zink et al 2017 jing et al 2019 mtt seems to be an incomplete description of such power law type ttds due to the fact that a marginal error in groundwater characterization will dramatically bias the value of mtt similarly the sd of tt is also sensitive to the long tail of ttd some recent studies also show that mtt inferred from tracer data may significantly bias from the true mtt due to the nonlinear mixing of tracers with different ages kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 our study extends this conclusion from tracer interpretation to explicit numerical modeling although mtt is the most commonly used summary statistics to represent catchment transport processes we advocate for using multiple summary statistics including the mean the standard deviation the median the interquartile range and the young water fraction kirchner 2016 to describe catchment ttd the median and interquartile range of travel times are relatively less error prone to the tailing behavior of catchment ttd which are more representative of power law type ttds than the mean and standard deviation the young water fraction i e the fraction of runoff younger than a certain threshold say 2 3 months is immune to the aggregation error kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 although not used in this study young water fraction proves to be effective in reducing the uncertainty in tracer based ttd predictions stewart et al 2017 lutz et al 2018 4 5 advantages and limitations of current modeling framework the proposed modeling framework allows for different spatial discretizations of the domain and temporal resolutions in soil zone and groundwater aquifer for example it allows daily simulation of soil zone dynamics and monthly simulation of saturated groundwater flow as well as the coarse spatial resolution of climate forcing and fine spatial resolution of terrain in contrast fully physically based models e g hydrogeosphere parflow and cathy explicitly solve partial differential equations of surface flow and unsaturated saturated groundwater flow therefore require continuous discretization of mesh meaning that the size of the grid can essentially vary in several magnitudes in the same mesh due to the fine scale features in the soil zone and the coarse scale aquifer properties this may cause huge numerical expense and potential numerical oscillation when dealing with complex large scale real world catchments paniconi and putti 2015 our method allows different grid sizes in soil zone and groundwater aquifer because these two compartments are simulated in two models and dynamically linked through model interfaces therefore the proposed mhm ogs model provides better numerical stability than those of richard s equation based models notwithstanding the aforementioned advantages the proposed modeling framework also has certain limitations first the current framework relies on the hydrologic partition function that partitions the subsurface into functional zones this approach has been extensively used to investigate the transport of environmental tracers and to derive catchment ttds benettin et al 2015 birkel et al 2015 the accurate estimation of internal fluxes e g groundwater recharge is critical to the simulated ttds in this approach jing et al 2019 this partitioning is straightforward and flexible therefore it enables the coupling of flux tracking approach and particle tracking approach and the integrated modeling of catchment ttd however it is a conceptual assumption and suffers from a lack of physical interpretation while a fully physically based modeling approach to catchment flow and transport processes is more sound in this respect kaandorp et al 2018 yang et al 2018 it does suffer from the high computational and data demand and uncertain parameterizations and numerical instabilities for their application in a real world mesoscale catchment conversely the approach proposed in this study is computationally efficient parsimonious and numerically robust the second limitation of this study lies in the exclusive use of hydrometric data for the model evaluation mcdonnell and beven 2014 isotope or conservative tracer concentrations prove to be beneficial in testing and validating the flux tracking and particle tracking models eberts et al 2012 davies et al 2013 remondi et al 2018 lutz et al 2018 however it is difficult to integrate tracer datasets into the numerical setup in the study area because long term high frequency measurements of tracer concentrations for groundwater and streams are required which are unfortunately not available yet even if available a reasonable reconstruction of distributed inputs might be problematic for a catchment of this size the absence of the tracer datasets implies that the simulated ttds and the summary statistics are subject to a certain degree of uncertainty other avenues to test these integrated modeling approach lie in utilizing model to capture observed dynamics of non conservative solutes like no3 n nitrate however such efforts require integration and tracking of both hydrologic and biogeochemical processes there has been some recent efforts utilizing the valuable flux tracking ttds approach within the mhm modeling framework for the solute transport modeling kumar et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020 this study by considering spatially explicit ttds has important implications for the assessment of nonpoint source contamination it provides additional information on the spatial pattern in grid scale water ttds which can not be revealed by a lumped catchment scale tracer experiment the particle tracking model can be used to interpret the tracer data with better accuracy compared to the lumped parameter model leray et al 2016 danesh yazdi et al 2018 therefore the joint investigation by integrating the tracer experiment and numerical modeling is strongly recommended for future studies 5 conclusions this study proposes a novel modeling framework to estimate the water ttds based on flux tracking in a near surface soil water compartment and particle tracking in the deeper groundwater compartment we use the proposed approach to investigate the ttds in nägelstedt catchment in central germany based on the hydrologic partition function the ttds in soil zone and groundwater aquifer have been studied separately using two different approaches the ttds for different hydrologic compartments are integrated as ttds for the whole subsurface system this framework facilitates the explicit representation of the groundwater transport process meanwhile it is also flexible and computationally robust the simulation results reveal strong spatial variability in both shapes and scales of grid scale groundwater ttds in the study area specifically grid scale groundwater ttds in different grid cells vary significantly in both shape and scale which is attributed to the stratigraphy and the heterogeneity in the topographic properties and the spatially variable organizations of groundwater flow pathways simulated grid scale water ttds have great implications in assessing the nonpoint source contamination in central germany this study also reveals the contrasting temporal variability in tts in different hydrological components we observe a seasonal behavior in soil water tts and a relatively stable groundwater tts indicating the contrasting sensitivities of soil water and groundwater transport processes to climate forcings the temporal variability decreases with the time in the nägelstedt catchment indicating the highly variable distributions of soil water tts and the almost constant distribution of groundwater tts simulation results suggest a power law type and fractal behavior of catchment ttd it further shows that the predictive uncertainty in catchment mtt is dominated by the contribution from groundwater uncertainty and almost immune to the uncertainty in the soil zone the power law shape catchment ttd makes the mtt extremely vulnerable to biased groundwater characterization a joint description of catchment ttd using multiple summary statistics is strongly recommended to characterize catchment transport processes data availability statement the coupled mhm ogs model can be freely downloaded and distributed through the following online repository https doi org 10 5281

338,travel time distributions ttds provide an effective way to describe the transport and mixing processes of water parcels in a subsurface hydrological system a major challenge in characterizing catchment ttd is quantifying the travel times in deep groundwater and its contribution to the streamflow ttd here we develop and test a novel modeling framework for an integrated assessment of catchment scale ttds through explicit representation of 3d groundwater dynamics the proposed framework is based on the linkage between a flux tracking scheme with the surface hydrologic model mhm for the soil water compartment and a particle tracking scheme with the 3d groundwater model opengeosys ogs for the groundwater compartment this linkage provides us with the ability to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of ttds in these different hydrological compartments from grid scale to regional scale we apply this framework in the nägelstedt catchment in central germany simulation results reveal that both shape and scale of grid scale groundwater ttds are spatially heterogeneous which are strongly dependent on the topography and aquifer structure the component wise analysis of catchment ttd shows a time dependent sensitivity of transport processes in soil zone and groundwater to driving meteorological forcing catchment ttd exhibits a power law shape and fractal behavior the predictive uncertainty in catchment mean travel time is dominated by the uncertainty in the deep groundwater rather than that in the soil zone catchment mean travel time is severely biased by a marginal error in groundwater characterization accordingly we recommend to use multiple summary statistics to minimize the predictive uncertainty introduced by the tailing behavior of catchment ttd keywords travel time distribution flux tracking particle tracking coupled model predictive uncertainty 1 introduction characterizing the travel or transit time tt of a water parcel is important for the assessment and management of global and regional water resources travel time distributions ttds provide a statistical representation of this property by accounting for the storage mixing and transport processes in a hydrologic system niemi 1977 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 botter et al 2010 mcdonnell et al 2010 analysis of water parcel tts is therefore of high relevance to the groundwater recharge estimation cartwright et al 2017 mccallum et al 2017 the vulnerability of water resources molnat and gascuel odoux 2002 benettin et al 2015 and the assessment of nonpoint source agricultural contamination böhlke and denver 1995 eberts et al 2012 kumar et al 2020 water tts are typically not measured directly instead they are inferred using models constrained by hydrological and geochemical data mccallum et al 2014 mcguire et al 2007 benettin et al 2019 such models of ttds can be classified into lumped parameter models dynamic storage selection sas functions flux tracking models and particle tracking models sprenger et al 2019 among them the sas approach is a state of art technique to characterize the temporal dynamics of ttds and mixing processes of water parcels botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2015 harman 2015 it distinguishes between the ttds and residence time distributions rtds botter et al 2011 by virtue of said sas functions and is able to comprehensively describe the age specific outflow generation moreover two different forms of time variant ttds forward and backward forms can be distinguished in this framework benettin et al 2015 flux tracking models are based on the determinants i e hydrological fluxes storages of resulting precipitation partitioning processes although these models are often highly conceptualized by e g assuming perfect mixing inside each control volume they have been proven to be a valuable modeling framework to interpret tracer data and derive catchment scale ttds to better characterize the age distribution of water storage and outflow fluxes hrachowitz et al 2013 benettin et al 2015 heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 flux tracking therefore helps to estimate ttds of different water storages and to understand the mixing behaviors of soil water and groundwater hrachowitz et al 2013 if spatially distributed models are used for input the spatial heterogeneity in ttds can also be assessed using flux tracking heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 on the other hand lagrangian particle tracking is a physically based approach that uses the explicit characterization of velocity fields and associated flow lines of the water particles in a heterogeneous subsurface system particle tracking can be used to trace the transport pathways of individual water particles under the assumption of dispersive advective transport or sole advective transport eberts et al 2012 leray et al 2016 davies and beven 2012 such a particle tracking approach is typically linked with three dimensional distributed groundwater models that account for unsaturated and saturated groundwater flow and related age estimation de rooij et al 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2015 yang et al 2018 jing et al 2019 although being computationally expensive particle tracking models enable the direct link between tts and the physical processes nevertheless the particle tracking approach is not immune from certain methodological choices like spatial resolution or discretization of the mesh and geological attributes representing the subsurface system sprenger et al 2019 maxwell et al 2019 jing et al 2019 flux tracking approaches work very well with conceptual hydrological models i e bucket type models that track water fluxes between different compartments by partitioning precipitation generating runoff and reproducing near surface hydrological variables e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration unfortunately their groundwater characterizations are always implicit and processes are simplified conceptualized with one or two lumped parameters resulting in a possibly over simplified characterization of groundwater flow and transport processes fenicia et al 2006 stewart et al 2012 this is mainly due to the fact that the signal near the surface i e discharge or tracer concentration is insensitive to the variation in groundwater storage a recent study by gleeson et al 2016 demonstrates that only around 6 of total groundwater in the uppermost 2 km over the globe is found to be contributed by contemporary modern recharge fluxes indicating that only a modest portion of the total groundwater storage actively interacts with surface water groundwater ages may consequently span a wide range of values e g over 50 years over a short distance less than 1 5 m in the vertical direction weissmann et al 2002 this strong heterogeneity in groundwater ages cannot be explicitly captured by conceptual approaches used with flux tracking but requires a detailed treatment of subsurface heterogeneity and tracing of water particles through physically based groundwater models jing et al 2018 another important challenge to the ttd characterization is the fact that tts of water parcels are time variant and spatially heterogeneous this transient behavior of ttds has only been investigated more recently botter et al 2010 rinaldo et al 2011 cornaton 2012 harman 2015 engdahl 2017 kaandorp et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 the temporal variability has been investigated using tracer experiments birkel et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2012 benettin et al 2015 the spatial variability in tt behavior however cannot be assessed using tracer data in streamflow because this signal is a lumped representation of the whole catchment kirchner 2016 the spatial distribution of water tts is critical to the assessment of point and nonpoint source contamination the spatial variability in ttds is closely related to the topographical morphological and geological properties within the catchment the inferred mean travel time mtt using tracer data is subject to a high aggregation error in heterogeneous catchments kirchner 2016 some studies unveiled that the shape of ttds among different catchments can be different kaandorp et al 2018 abrams and haitjema 2018 remondi et al 2019 however the spatial heterogeneity of the grid scale ttds parameters e g shape and scale within a catchment has rarely been investigated although many studies deployed flux tracking methods to estimate catchment scale ttds the characterizations of groundwater storages are often conceptual indicating that an analytical relationship between the storage and discharge has typically been presumed in a simplified manner often as the outflow from a linear reservoir this simplified characterization may lead to severe errors in interpreting tracer data and could essentially underestimate the catchment ttd due to its incapability in seeing the old water stewart et al 2012 2017 yet given the known heterogeneity of subsurface flow patterns this paucity of spatially explicit representation of the groundwater system restricts the accuracy and reliability of inferred tt while some studies have begun accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the soil compartment heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 a similar approach to the deeper groundwater system is still missing due to this gap a number of questions remain currently unanswered for example what is the explicit role of groundwater in shaping up the travel time distributions ttds of an overall streamflow behavior in other words how to disentangle the role of near surface soil and groundwater tts how does the spatial heterogeneity of ttds resulting from the differences in climate and landscape attributes e g soil and geological features affect the overall i e catchment wide tt behavior and finally how different are the spatial feature of ttds corresponding to near surface and groundwater components to answer these questions we comprehensively investigate the spatial and temporal variability in ttds through the integration of the flux tracking approach with the particle tracking approach we describe and test the methodology to provide an integrated assessment of the catchment scale subsurface ttds accounting for an explicit treatment of the groundwater component using a 3 d groundwater model we adapted a spatially varying description of transient ttds through a flux tracking scheme hrachowitz et al 2013 heße et al 2017 that accounts for the daily variation in near surface hydrological processes e g soil moisture evapotranspiration fast flows groundwater recharge represented in a distributed surface hydrologic model the groundwater component is represented through a three dimensional groundwater model and a particle tracking scheme is used to infer the corresponding groundwater tts both components are interactively linked such that spatial and temporal variability of ttds can be deduced for each hydrologic compartment at any specified location within a study domain the proposed modeling framework explicitly accounts for the spatial heterogeneity of climate and landscape attributes including the representing of deep groundwater aquifers we apply and test the proposed approach in a single densely mapped catchment located in central europe 2 methodology 2 1 integrated hydrological model for the numerical modeling of the subsurface water flow we employ the coupled mhm ogs model as described by jing et al 2018 this model was developed to account for the different challenges faced when modeling near surface flow e g soil moisture vs modeling deeper subsurface flow i e groundwater in the coupled mhm ogs model the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 is used to track the surface and near surface hydrologic fluxes and storages e g root zone soil moisture evapotranspiration infiltration groundwater recharge on the other hand the groundwater model opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012 is used to simulate the groundwater flow in the deeper aquifers and track the paths of water particles mhm is a distributed hydrologic model that employs grid cells as the basic unit and is capable of simulating various near surface water fluxes and states these include interception surface runoff evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture dynamics samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 the root zone has been partitioned into several water storages including the canopy storage x 1 the snowpack x 2 the soil moisture content in the root zone x 3 impounded water in reservoirs or sealed area x 4 subsurface reservoir x 5 and groundwater reservoir x 6 the root zone is further discretized into three soil layers with the two upper layers end in 0 05 and 0 25 m and the lowest layer is spatially variable with the depth prescribed based on the soil map average of around 1 8 m deep see zink et al 2017 the conceptualization of these water storages can be found in fig 1 and details of the model parameterizations can be found in samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 livneh et al 2015 and heße et al 2017 the model uses a unique multiscale parameter regionalization mpr technique to explicitly incorporate the sub grid variability of basin physical properties e g terrain soil and landcover attributes and facilitates model runs at multiple spatial resolutions samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 mhm can be conditioned and evaluated using various types and sources of data rakovec et al 2016 zink et al 2018 the model is available under an open source license and details on model conceptualisation and parameterization can be obtained at www ufz de mhm it has been successfully established for many large scale applications including to investigate climate change impact assessment studies samaniego et al 2018 thober et al 2018 ogs is a physically based porous media simulator employing the finite element method to solve subsurface processes kolditz et al 2012 ogs has been successfully applied to cope with a broad range of hydrogeological problems including seawater intrusion groundwater depletion and water resources management sun et al 2011 kalbacher et al 2012 jing et al 2018 ogs explicitly solves the partial differential equations of 3 d unsaturated saturated groundwater flow two models are linked through a mhm ogs coupling interface through this interface mhm based spatially distributed recharge and baseflow along stream network are transferred as neumann boundary conditions in the ogs groundwater model jing et al 2018 2019 here we provide a brief overview of the coupling workflow and for more details please refer to jing et al 2018 1 after calibration mhm is first run to calculate soil zone fluxes and variables including the recharge and baseflow at the time step t i 2 the stepwise routed baseflow calculated by mhm is converted into distributed river discharges this distributed river discharge serves as a neumann boundary condition in the ogs model 3 groundwater recharge estimated by mhm is also interpolated onto the upper surface of ogs mesh serving as a neumann boundary condition 4 ogs model calculates the updated groundwater flow and transport variables at time step t i and replaces the original groundwater variables in mhm 5 the same procedure is repeated at the time step t i 1 until the end of simulation 2 2 integrated travel time framework corresponding to this coupled numerical modeling framework we deploy different strategies to track the tts within their respective soil and groundwater compartments see fig 1 for the water that travels through the soil compartment we use a flux tracking scheme following heße et al 2017 the flux tracking scheme is built upon the bucket type hydrologic conceptualization wherein each bucket is presumed to be well mixed water storage and the water can be stored in the bucket infiltrated into the deeper bucket or discharged as runoff or evapotranspiration the storage discharge behaviors in each bucket are conditioned by climate forcing and topographical morphological and geological properties this scheme consequently relies on the model results of mhm see the upper part of the schematic in fig 1 following heße et al 2017 for the water that travels through the aquifer system we use a particle tracking scheme namely the random walk particle tracking rwpt algorithm to track the flow path lines in the heterogeneous aquifer system rwpt is a lagrangian particle tracking method assuming that the advection process is deterministic and the dispersion process is stochastic rwpt has been used to simulate reactive transport processes as well as particle tts in heterogeneous groundwater systems park et al 2008 jing et al 2019 this algorithm is connected to the physically based groundwater model ogs see the lower part of the schematic in fig 1 the integrated ttds of the whole input water can then be derived through the mass weighted combination of the component wise ttds fig 1 travel time in the soil compartment to begin let us consider the ttd in a control volume cv e g a grid cell here we define interflow as the water flux that infiltrates the soil surface and flows into the stream which typically travels above the groundwater level and baseflow as the runoff component generated by deep saturated groundwater beven 1989 the hydrological processes in this cv are controlled by an influx j typically precipitation as well as several outflux components namely evapotranspiration e t q i f representing the interflow and r representing the percolation or recharge to the deeper groundwater aquifer the continuity equation can be given as 1 d s d t j q i f r e t here the input flux j contains numerous water particles each of which enters the system at time t i and leaves the cv at time t e as e t q i f or r for the non stationary hydrologic system it is advantageous to distinguish the tt t t from the residence time t r let us define the tt t t as the time elapsed by the water particle from entering till exiting the cv t t t e t i conversely at a given time t the residence time t r is defined as t r t t i the forward expression of ttd p t t t t i tracks the tts of particles injected into the system at a given time t i we assume that the soil water storage is well mixed wherein the water particles randomly exit as q i f r or e t following botter et al 2010 the analytical form of the travel time pdf of water parcels exiting as q i f in a well mixed storage can be expressed by 2 p t i f t t i t i q i f t s t e t i t q i f r e t s x d x θ i f t i in this equation the hydrologic partition function of interflow θ i f t i is expressed as 3 θ i f t i t i q i f τ s τ e t i t q i f r e t s x d x d τ eq 2 and 3 are forward expressions of travel time pdfs for water particles discharged as interflow similarly pdfs for water particles recharged to the deep groundwater aquifers p t r t t i t i can also be expressed using eq 2 and 3 by swapping q i f with r travel time in the groundwater compartment water particles that recharged into the deeper groundwater aquifers are traced using rwpt in an explicit three dimensional groundwater model for such a system let p t g w t represent the ttd of water particles passing through groundwater aquifers estimated by the rwpt method then the ttd of water particles from their entrance to the subsurface system through recharge until their discharge as baseflow can be expressed using the following convolution integral 4 p t b f t t i t i t i p t r τ t i t i p t g w t τ t i d τ this convolution represents the fact that the tt of any water parcel leaving as baseflow can be considered as a the sum of two random variables the tt for passing through the soil compartment and the tt for passing through the groundwater compartment see schematic in fig 1 once the tts for water parcels leaving as interflow and baseflow are determined the integrated tt for water parcels leaving the entire subsurface can be computed integrated travel time in the subsurface the catchment wide subsurface ttd p t s s t t i t i can now be calculated by the mass weighted average of p t i f t t i t i and p t b f t t i t i note that for the grid cell based hydrologic model the catchment ttd can be calculated by mass weighted averaging the ttd of each grid cell over the whole catchment 5 p t s s t t i t i θ i f t i p t i f t t i t i 1 θ i f t i p t b f t t i t i in the above described way the catchment ttd can be realized by linking flux tracking in the soil zone and particle tracking in the groundwater storage fig 1 using the above modeling framework we can analyse the spatio temporal behaviour of the resulting ttds furthermore we also characterize the marginal quasi stationary behaviour of ttds through a time averaging approach heße et al 2017 summary statistics we use several summary statistics to characterize and compare the shape and scale of ttds in different hydrological compartments these include the mean travel time mtt the median tt the standard deviation sd the coefficient of variation cv and the interquartile range besides for the parametric form of mean ttds we choose the two parameter gamma distribution this parametric distribution can account for the nonlinear behavior and the heterogeneity of the reservoir kirchner et al 2000 hrachowitz et al 2010 the gamma distribution has two parameters a shape factor α and a scale factor β and its pdfs can be expressed as 6 p t t α 1 β α γ α e t β t α 1 t α α γ α e α t t where t is the travel time and t α β is the mean travel time 2 3 study area to exemplify the use of this integrated travel time framework we applied it to the nägelstedt catchment located in central germany fig 2 the study area is a mesoscale headwater catchment of the unstrut river catchment with an area of approximately 850 km2 the terrain elevation in the study area ranges from 166 m to 516 m above mean sea level the climate is classified as warm temperate fully humid and warm summer a cfb type according to the kȵppen geiger method kottek et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation is around 660 mm and the mean annual temperature is around 8 3 degrees celsius as shown in fig 2 four 1 1 km2 grid cells are selected as samples for tracing water travel times these four grid cells are selected to cover both the groundwater recharge areas at highlands c2 and c4 and drainage areas c1 and c3 the locations of these selected cells with varying geographical characteristics are depicted in fig 2 specifically c1 is a grid cell at a lowland close to the discharge point c2 represents the grid cell in the western mountainous area close to the left tributary c3 represents the point at the central lowland near the mainstream and c4 represent the eastern mountainous area close to the right tributary the study area is intensively used for agricultural purposes around 78 of the total land in this area has been classified as arable land wechsung et al 2008 around 17 of the land is marked as forests while the remaining 5 is regarded as urban areas heße et al 2017 fig 2 groundwater plays a critical role in supplying public water in this area wechsung et al 2008 the main geological unit in nägelstedt catchment is muschelkalk muschelkalk is mainly composed of marine sediments fig 3 it can be further divided into three sub units which are upper muschelkalk mo middle muschelkalk mm and lower muschelkalk mu fig 3 besides the keuper sediments overlying the muschelkalk form an aquifer aquitard system in the central floodplain the keuper can be divided into middle keuper km and lower keuper ku wherein the lower keuper has a high content of grey clay and may form an aquitard fig 3 this catchment is dominated by agriculture land with a high risk of groundwater contamination due to intensive agricultural activities wechsung et al 2008 the fate of input water is of high relevance with groundwater quantity and resilience additionally this area is also a target area of the aquadiva project http www aquadiva uni jena de which aims to cope with environmental problems by multi disciplinary investigations of biogeochemical processes in the hainich critical zone observatory küsel et al 2016 kohlhepp et al 2017 2 4 model setup calibration and evaluation the mhm and ogs models were established and calibrated for this catchment using the framework described in jing et al 2018 and jing et al 2019 the distributed mhm simulations were established at a daily time step over 60 years 1955 2004 and with a spatial resolution of 500 m 500 m the climate forcings driving the mhm model e g atmospheric temperature and precipitation are based on the observations from the german meteorological service dwd other data for the mhm model setup include the dem data the land cover data the soil type data the hydrogeological data and the discharge data heße et al 2017 jing et al 2018 a detailed evaluation of the mhm model including simulations of near surface fluxes such as runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge has been presented in several past studies zink et al 2017 heße et al 2017 jing et al 2018 for the groundwater model we used a three dimensional mesh based on a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 25 m combined with information on the geological zonation we established a stratigraphic model based on the geological data from the thuringian state office for the environment and geology tlug based on this we used a mesh with a spatial resolution of 250 m 250 m 10 m in x y and z directions respectively fischer et al 2015 specifically the less permeable muschelkalk zones underlying the keuper formation mo2 mm2 and mu2 are distinguished from the more permeable muschelkalk zones mo1 mm1 and mu1 see table 1 this three dimensional mesh is shown in fig 3 moreover we also account for the uncertainty in prescribing the hydraulic conductivity values in different geological formations and their contribution to the simulated groundwater and resulting travel times specifically we generate an ensemble of hydraulic conductivity fields using the null space monte carlo nsmc approach tonkin and doherty 2009 the range and distribution of parameters for this uncertainty analysis can be found in appendix fig b 14 here we assume steady state transport processes in the deep groundwater aquifers this assumption is only limited to the ogs model this assumption is justified due to fluctuations in recharge rates having only a minor influence on groundwater ttds benettin et al 2015 engdahl 2017 jing et al 2019 given the large storage of groundwater systems we then assigned a no flow boundary condition at the bottom and outer perimeter of the mesh whereas a fixed head boundary condition was assigned on the stream beds of the perennial rivers the river network can be found in fig 2 to track the flow paths of water parcels we released a large number of particles 100 000 particles at the top surface of the mesh the spatial distribution of these particles was arranged to meet the spatial distribution of the mean recharge fields fig 4 in the calibration phase the model satisfactorily computed the daily discharge at the catchment outlet over a 30 year period the calibrated model demonstrated good capability in reproducing high frequency discharge fig 5 the skill score based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is 0 60 which is satisfactory considering the 30 year simulation period and daily resolution simulated dynamics of evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge were also evaluated and validated by the observation at eddy covariance stations and the hydrological atlas of germany heße et al 2017 zink et al 2017 these results confirmed the reliability and accuracy of mhm in capturing the soil zone water dynamics we then calibrated the ogs groundwater model against the observed groundwater levels 1955 2004 at 18 spatially distributed monitoring wells jing et al 2018 2019 hydrogeological parameters of the calibrated groundwater model are shown in table 1 the ogs model was also capable to reproduce the pattern of groundwater circulation in the deep aquifers fig 5 to confirm the accuracy and reliability of the mhm ogs model in simulating the groundwater dynamics we evaluate the modeled groundwater using observations of multiple distributed monitoring wells wherein 30 year time series of observed groundwater levels are available the evaluation results are shown in fig 5 and fig a 13 in this evaluation phase the model also satisfactorily simulated the response of groundwater levels to climate forcing fig 5 and appendix fig a 13 the calibrated model was able to adequately characterize the observed trend and magnitude of monthly groundwater level fluctuations across the observation wells fig 5 and appendix fig a 13 this is demonstrated by pearson correlation coefficient r values of 0 71 0 82 0 48 0 81 and 0 70 for five monitoring wells respectively based on this successful establishment and evaluation exercise the coupled mhm ogs model was used to track the movements and tts of water parcels across the whole catchment 3 results in the following we show the application of this integrated modeling framework for a single case study namely the nägelstedt catchment we track the tts of water inputs from january 1955 to december 1974 because the 60 year data 1955 2004 of the precipitation and discharge enable the tracing of water influxes in this period for the following 30 years 1974 2004 specifically we show the spatial variability in ttds associated with different spatial scales grid scale and regional scale the temporal variability of catchment ttd the contribution of groundwater to the catchment ttd and the sensitivity of component wise ttd to the climate forcing 3 1 sensitivity of groundwater ttds to spatial scale and topography fig 6 shows the groundwater ttds for the catchment and for four selected 1 1 km2 local grid cells c1 c2 c3 and c4 the analysis results presented here correspond to the derived tts for water particles from their entrance to their exit from the deep aquifers we also fit the gamma distribution against the simulated catchment scale groundwater ttd to show its preference for discharging young old water the catchment scale groundwater ttd shows a preference for discharging younger water with a α value of 0 71 the parameter α of the gamma distribution characterizes the shape of ttds a α value less than 1 indicates a strong initial peak and a long tail however the grid scale groundwater ttds exhibit a strong spatial variability in both shape and scale simulated groundwater ttds in c1 c2 c3 and c4 have diverse shapes and scales which also deviate from the catchment groundwater ttd this is attributed to their different hydrogeological conditions and the resulting different layout of the flow pathways e g the occurrence of preferential pathways in some cells due to the more permeable geological formation meanwhile the mean travel times mtts of groundwater in these cells vary widely ranging from 70 4 years for c4 to 115 2 years for c1 this pronounced spatial variability in the mtts shows the distinct behavior of flow paths and velocities of water particles for different areas the parameter uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity propagates to the simulated groundwater ttd which is demonstrated by the coefficient of variation cv of the catchment scale groundwater mtt 14 2 the spatial distributions of the mean and standard deviation of groundwater tt mtt and sd in distributed 1 1 km2 grid cells over the whole catchment are shown in fig 7 specifically we category the grid cells into central lowland and surrounding highland according to topography we find a strong spatial heterogeneity in mtt of grid scale groundwater ttds noticeably the volume averaged ttd in the surrounding highland is about twice as large as that in central lowland the groundwater mtt ranges from years to decades for lowland whereas these values lie in the decadal to centurial scale for the outer highlands this is mainly attributed to the relatively sparse stream network and the lower hydraulic conductivity of main geological formations in the highland area the sd of tts also shows similar spatial structure sd is generally lower in central lowland around the vicinity of the stream network and higher at highland far away from streams these two summary statistics provide not much information on the shape of grid scale groundwater ttds but we can expect a large variability in them based on the distinct shape of four sampled ttds fig 6 3 2 climate control on water travel times tracking historical trajectories of the tts over a long period of precipitation events helps us to understand the relationship between time variant tts and the resulting hydrologic controls fig 8 shows the time series of tts and the corresponding monthly precipitation rates over the span of 20 years 1955 1974 fig 8 shows a large temporal variation in the median tts of soil water interflows which closely follow the temporal dynamics of precipitation in general higher precipitation rates result in a shorter tt of soil water a result well known from the literature we can also observe a significant seasonality in soil water tt which is largely attributed to the seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration fig 8 conversely the temporal fluctuations in precipitation have a minor effect on the tt of groundwater there is no seasonal pattern in the groundwater tts see the second panel in fig 8 the integrated tt of the whole catchment has an intermediate temporal variability which is attributed to the fact that the catchment ttd is a weighted average between the soil zone ttd and the groundwater ttd the median tts over the 20 year simulation period are around 1 2 41 and 8 years for the soil water interflow groundwater baseflow and the total streamflow respectively the groundwater tts show the largest interquartile range indicating the large time scale e g decade of the groundwater transport processes the interquartile range is also strongly inversely related to precipitation such that low precipitation causes a larger interquartile range of water tts these simulation results through the integrated modeling framework reveal the contrasting tt characteristics of the different hydrological compartments we use the modeling framework to understand the effect of climate forcing on the varying behavior of water transport and mixing in different hydrologic compartments specifically we evaluate the characteristics and response of the hydrologic partition function eq 3 and the resulting median tts of different hydrological compartments to varying hydroclimatic conditions fig 9 in a scatter plot shown in fig 9 the individual points represent the monthly averaged values for 40 years from 1955 1995 we separated the 40 years time period into wet and dry years depending on the deviation from the average annual effective precipitation rate effective precipitation is defined as the precipitation that is not evapotranspired and eventually discharges into streams the hydrologic partition function for water discharged as interflow θ i f is positively related to higher effective precipitation indicating the key part of hydroclimatic forcing in partitioning the water budget and generating quick interflows the θ i f values in many years deviate from the fitted regression line fig 9 this is because θ i f is a function of all precipitation events after water parcels enters into the catchment rather than the precipitation events of a given year mtts are negatively correlated with the effective precipitation in the soil zone groundwater aquifer and the whole catchment although with different degrees of absolute values the mtts in the soil zone are more sensitive to the climate forcing with the mtts in dry years being on average two times higher than the values observed in wet years the dependency of mtts on hydro climatic conditions for baseflow is not as pronounced as that for interflow the mtts for the whole catchment show the moderate response with values in the wet years being on average 20 lower than those observed during dry years 3 3 contribution of groundwater to catchment ttd the numerical framework described here allows for the investigation of space time behavior of ttds in different hydrologic compartments and their contribution to overall ttd here we explicitly examine the role of component wise ttds and their relationship to the integrated catchment signal specifically we show how the parameter uncertainty in different hydrologic components affects the predictive capability of the integrated ttd fig 10 shows the probability density functions pdfs for water tts discharged as interflow baseflow and the total runoff over the whole catchment from 1955 to 1974 the catchment ttd exhibits a power law behavior with a significant long tail fig 10 this indicates that the catchment discharge is comprised of water parcels with a wide range of travel times the mean tt of water particles discharged as interflow mttif is approximately 1 93 years conversely the mean tt of water particles discharged as baseflow mttbf is 74 16 years based on the hydrologic partition function the mean tt for the whole catchment mttq is 37 50 years it is worth noting that the estimated mtt is much larger than the corresponding median tt in every hydrological compartment which emphasizes the asymmetric long tail behavior of the ttds fig 8 and fig 10 we could also observe a narrower shading width towards the higher tails of the ttds indicating a decreasing temporal variance in the probability function with increasing tt there is also a contrasting shape width between the ttds of the two hydrologic compartments with a larger temporal variability for the soil water tts than that of the groundwater tts we attribute this to the relatively more dynamic fluxes and storage volumes in the shallow soil zone compared to those in the deep groundwater aquifer this also reveals the damping effect of the catchment to the input signal e g precipitation fig 11 shows the simulation results of the grid scale ttds in four 1 1 km2 grid cells through the mass weighted average of the ttds of interflow and the ttds of baseflow a remarkable difference in the scales of the interflow tts and baseflow tts can be observed across the four analyzed locations the mtts of water discharged as interflow are approximately 2 years for all four cells whereas the mttbf values vary over a wide range 63 18 96 78 years as a mass weighted average between the above two ttds the integrated mean tts of the total runoff range from 38 43 61 39 years the shapes of the integrated ttds are irregular due to the distinct shapes and time scales of soil water ttds and groundwater ttds the shapes of the integrated ttds are dominated by the soil water for an early period e g tts less than 1 year and thereafter by the groundwater for the tails of the distribution fig 11 we can also observe a multi modal shape of the overall ttd for the c4 cell which is mainly controlled by the complex aquifer geometry and stratigraphy overall ttds in c1 c2 and c3 present similar power law shape and fractal behaviors the mtts of overall discharge flux show a strong spatial heterogeneity which is largely due to the heterogeneous mtts in baseflow moreover the decadal scale of mtt of total runoff can be attributed to the long tails of baseflow ttd this signifies the importance of appropriate characterization of deep groundwater such that it strongly controls the scale of overall mtts 3 4 predictive uncertainty in catchment ttd we further study the influence of uncertainties in different hydrological compartments and their contributions to the total uncertainty in streamflow signal the simulation results in subsection 3 1 already shows that the parameter uncertainty in aquifer hydraulic properties results in a 14 18 variation in simulated groundwater mtt accordingly we investigate how this degree of variation in groundwater affects the predicted overall mtt in streamflow we also set up a reference scenario wherein the same degree of variation in soil water mtt is considered and compare the predictive uncertainty in overall mtt in these two scenarios we then calculate the induced variation in median tt of the catchment from the same degree of variation in soil zone and groundwater fig 12 clearly shows the contrasting degree of predictive uncertainty in these two scenarios note that the volume contribution of soil zone and deep groundwater is computed using the hydrologic partition function θ we find that the contribution from the soil zone is about 56 a 14 2 variation in groundwater mtt leads to an around 48 4 variation in catchment mtt whereas the same variation in soil water mtt only results in an around 1 6 variation in catchment mtt however the same level of variation in soil zone and groundwater only leads to 8 7 and 7 8 variations in catchment scale median tt this indicates that although the volume contributions from soil water and groundwater to the streamflow are almost equal the sensitivities of catchment mtt to them are distinct in the study area where baseflow from deep groundwater substantially makes up a large portion of streamflow catchment mtt is extremely sensitive to variation in groundwater and not sensitive to that in soil water although quick interflow from soil zone constitutes about 56 of the total volume of streamflow their tts appear to have a minor influence on the overall mtt alternatively speaking mtt is not representative of the transport processes in the soil zone even if the volume of interflow constitutes more than half of the total volume of streamflow the sensitivities of catchment scale median tts to soil zone and groundwater seem to be consistent with the volume weights of these two components indicating that the median tt is more robust in terms of representing the overall behavior of water transport processes relative to the mtt 4 discussion this study introduces a novel modeling framework that couples the flux tracking approach and the particle tracking approach to achieve a full spatially explicit description of subsurface ttds we use this modeling framework to investigate the spatio temporal behaviors of ttds in different compartments of the subsurface water cycle in the nägelstedt catchment although the simulations in this study are particular to the study area the method used here is applicable to other regional catchment the numerical simulation results have important implications for understanding the transient and spatially heterogeneous tts in subsurface systems 4 1 spatial variability in ttds and its dependence on topography and aquifer structure the proposed modeling approach explicitly characterizes the spatial variability in component wise water ttds across scales from grid scale to catchment scale therefore it facilitates the study of topographic and geologic controls on catchment ttds since we could observe a significant influence of the subsurface hydraulic heterogeneity on the shapes of grid scale ttds it follows that the explicit characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is a nontrivial element to a comprehensive characterization of ttds fig 11 this influence can be attributed to the complex spatial organization of flow pathlines within the aquifer system resulting from a said pattern of stratigraphy these findings are in line with the ones described by danesh yazdi et al 2018 and kaandorp et al 2018 who also report strong variability in the shapes of ttds either using different realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields or in different catchments we also observe different patterns of groundwater ttd for central lowland and surrounding highland which is likely related to the distance to the groundwater discharge zone and the underlying subsurface structure a similarly strong dependence of ttd on topography has been reported in other real world catchments cardenas 2007 remondi et al 2019 the contrasting shapes and scales of groundwater ttds in different investigated cells see fig 7 and fig 8 highlight the key role of subsurface heterogeneity in controlling the flow paths and tts of water parcels this effect is unveiled by direct simulation of the pathways and velocities of a large number of released particle tracers using the rwpt algorithm investigating the relationship between the properties of the aquifer system and the behavior of groundwater ttds revealed a number of relevant relationships the strong spatial heterogeneity in the shapes of grid scale groundwater ttd is mainly introduced by the stratigraphical structure of the aquifer system and the zoned hydraulic conductivity distribution prevailed across the study area the grid scale mtt appears to be closely related to the distance of the corresponding grid cell to the stream network these findings are in line with fiori and russo 2008 and ameli et al 2016 wherein they also found a strong dependence of ttd on the vertical pattern of hydraulic properties the aforementioned strong spatial variability of tts has greater implications for the assessment of nonpoint source agricultural contamination the long tail and fractal behavior of catchment ttd imply a high risk of legacy contamination in the nägelstedt catchment wherein agricultural activities are extremely intensive wechsung et al 2008 the proposed mhm ogs modeling framework could therefore be a valuable tool in revealing the intrinsic mechanism of the legacy nitrogen in streamflow which has been frequently reported in many catchments across germany and the globe mueller et al 2016 van meter et al 2017 2018 4 2 temporal variability in catchment ttd conditioned by precipitation the second contribution of this study is on the time varying impact of soil water and groundwater to the integrated ttds this finding is crucial to the understanding and prediction of the fate and the tts of nonpoint source input solute such as agricultural contaminants in general we observe a decrease in variability for longer times see fig 10 and fig 11 this can be attributed to the different sensitivities of the shallow soil storage and the deeper groundwater aquifer to the climate forcing the shallow storage is highly dynamic due to being subjected to the highly dynamic input of precipitation its small storage volume compared to the deeper groundwater system the varying land use type and the impact of evapotranspiration benettin et al 2015 conversely the deeper groundwater aquifer system has a large storage volume and no apparent direct connections with the atmosphere leading to the overall less dynamic input forcing in the form of groundwater recharge jing et al 2019 heße et al 2017 the hydroclimatic conditions also control the contribution from different hydrological compartments to the overall ttd the median travel time in dry years is expected to be larger than that in wet years implying that transport and mixing characteristics of the catchment will be altered by the changing climatic conditions this is attributed to the fact that higher precipitation essentially increases the hydraulic potential difference in both soil and groundwater and thus activates shallow flow pathlines kaandorp et al 2018 remondi et al 2019 these kinds of response behaviors tts vs climate forcings noticed here are in line with those of remondi et al 2018 and jing et al 2019 wherein they also found a strong dependence of catchment tts on hydroclimatic forcing conditions 4 3 contribution of different hydrological compartments to catchment ttd this study provides insights into the constitution of catchment ttd of different hydrological compartments compared with the partition of the hydrograph the partition of water mass in streamflow suffers from a wider range of uncertainty which is mainly attributed to the difficulty in quantifying contribution from slow baseflow component stewart et al 2012 tracer based analysis e g interpretation of tritium data using lumped parameter model is a common approach used for this purpose but it also suffers from many sources of error such as the aggregation error kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the application in the nägelstedt catchment is built on a 60 years of the daily hydroclimatic forcing data and a 3 d stratigraphic aquifer model therefore explicitly accounts for the spatial and temporal heterogeneity that facilitates the forward type of particle tracking the partitioning of contributions from different hydrological compartments is achieved through the hydrologic partition function θ which explicitly tracks all precipitation events after the entrance of water parcels to the catchment several recent studies have also demonstrated the advantages of forward simulation of travel times in explicitly accounting for the constitution of catchment ttd koh et al 2018 eberts et al 2012 4 4 uncertainty and robustness of mtt in describing catchment transport processes the catchment ttd exhibits a power law behavior with a high probability at an early stage and a long tail fig 10 and fig 11 this tailing behavior is also revealed by the strong deviation from mtt 37 50 years to median tt 8 years of the catchment the decadal scale of catchment mtt has also been reported in several tritium based studies although the catchment properties may vary greatly from this study cartwright and morgenstern 2015 stewart et al 2017 the power law behavior also exhibit the uncertainty propagating from parameters varying hydraulic conductivity values to groundwater simulations and the resulting ttds in the study area the same degrees of uncertainty in soil zone and groundwater can lead to distinct scales of predictive uncertainty in mtt although the volume contributions from two components to streamflow are almost the same this suggests the accurate characterization of groundwater ttd is critical to the accuracy and reliability of simulated mtt and the uncertainty in soil water tts is almost irrelevant to the simulated mtt unfortunately the simulated groundwater ttd is inevitably subject to parameter uncertainty because the regional hydraulic parameters are typically inferred through model calibration many studies also reveal that a calibrated groundwater model cannot be exempted from parameter uncertainty due to the calibration null space and the model structural error moore and doherty 2006 zink et al 2017 jing et al 2019 mtt seems to be an incomplete description of such power law type ttds due to the fact that a marginal error in groundwater characterization will dramatically bias the value of mtt similarly the sd of tt is also sensitive to the long tail of ttd some recent studies also show that mtt inferred from tracer data may significantly bias from the true mtt due to the nonlinear mixing of tracers with different ages kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 our study extends this conclusion from tracer interpretation to explicit numerical modeling although mtt is the most commonly used summary statistics to represent catchment transport processes we advocate for using multiple summary statistics including the mean the standard deviation the median the interquartile range and the young water fraction kirchner 2016 to describe catchment ttd the median and interquartile range of travel times are relatively less error prone to the tailing behavior of catchment ttd which are more representative of power law type ttds than the mean and standard deviation the young water fraction i e the fraction of runoff younger than a certain threshold say 2 3 months is immune to the aggregation error kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 although not used in this study young water fraction proves to be effective in reducing the uncertainty in tracer based ttd predictions stewart et al 2017 lutz et al 2018 4 5 advantages and limitations of current modeling framework the proposed modeling framework allows for different spatial discretizations of the domain and temporal resolutions in soil zone and groundwater aquifer for example it allows daily simulation of soil zone dynamics and monthly simulation of saturated groundwater flow as well as the coarse spatial resolution of climate forcing and fine spatial resolution of terrain in contrast fully physically based models e g hydrogeosphere parflow and cathy explicitly solve partial differential equations of surface flow and unsaturated saturated groundwater flow therefore require continuous discretization of mesh meaning that the size of the grid can essentially vary in several magnitudes in the same mesh due to the fine scale features in the soil zone and the coarse scale aquifer properties this may cause huge numerical expense and potential numerical oscillation when dealing with complex large scale real world catchments paniconi and putti 2015 our method allows different grid sizes in soil zone and groundwater aquifer because these two compartments are simulated in two models and dynamically linked through model interfaces therefore the proposed mhm ogs model provides better numerical stability than those of richard s equation based models notwithstanding the aforementioned advantages the proposed modeling framework also has certain limitations first the current framework relies on the hydrologic partition function that partitions the subsurface into functional zones this approach has been extensively used to investigate the transport of environmental tracers and to derive catchment ttds benettin et al 2015 birkel et al 2015 the accurate estimation of internal fluxes e g groundwater recharge is critical to the simulated ttds in this approach jing et al 2019 this partitioning is straightforward and flexible therefore it enables the coupling of flux tracking approach and particle tracking approach and the integrated modeling of catchment ttd however it is a conceptual assumption and suffers from a lack of physical interpretation while a fully physically based modeling approach to catchment flow and transport processes is more sound in this respect kaandorp et al 2018 yang et al 2018 it does suffer from the high computational and data demand and uncertain parameterizations and numerical instabilities for their application in a real world mesoscale catchment conversely the approach proposed in this study is computationally efficient parsimonious and numerically robust the second limitation of this study lies in the exclusive use of hydrometric data for the model evaluation mcdonnell and beven 2014 isotope or conservative tracer concentrations prove to be beneficial in testing and validating the flux tracking and particle tracking models eberts et al 2012 davies et al 2013 remondi et al 2018 lutz et al 2018 however it is difficult to integrate tracer datasets into the numerical setup in the study area because long term high frequency measurements of tracer concentrations for groundwater and streams are required which are unfortunately not available yet even if available a reasonable reconstruction of distributed inputs might be problematic for a catchment of this size the absence of the tracer datasets implies that the simulated ttds and the summary statistics are subject to a certain degree of uncertainty other avenues to test these integrated modeling approach lie in utilizing model to capture observed dynamics of non conservative solutes like no3 n nitrate however such efforts require integration and tracking of both hydrologic and biogeochemical processes there has been some recent efforts utilizing the valuable flux tracking ttds approach within the mhm modeling framework for the solute transport modeling kumar et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020 this study by considering spatially explicit ttds has important implications for the assessment of nonpoint source contamination it provides additional information on the spatial pattern in grid scale water ttds which can not be revealed by a lumped catchment scale tracer experiment the particle tracking model can be used to interpret the tracer data with better accuracy compared to the lumped parameter model leray et al 2016 danesh yazdi et al 2018 therefore the joint investigation by integrating the tracer experiment and numerical modeling is strongly recommended for future studies 5 conclusions this study proposes a novel modeling framework to estimate the water ttds based on flux tracking in a near surface soil water compartment and particle tracking in the deeper groundwater compartment we use the proposed approach to investigate the ttds in nägelstedt catchment in central germany based on the hydrologic partition function the ttds in soil zone and groundwater aquifer have been studied separately using two different approaches the ttds for different hydrologic compartments are integrated as ttds for the whole subsurface system this framework facilitates the explicit representation of the groundwater transport process meanwhile it is also flexible and computationally robust the simulation results reveal strong spatial variability in both shapes and scales of grid scale groundwater ttds in the study area specifically grid scale groundwater ttds in different grid cells vary significantly in both shape and scale which is attributed to the stratigraphy and the heterogeneity in the topographic properties and the spatially variable organizations of groundwater flow pathways simulated grid scale water ttds have great implications in assessing the nonpoint source contamination in central germany this study also reveals the contrasting temporal variability in tts in different hydrological components we observe a seasonal behavior in soil water tts and a relatively stable groundwater tts indicating the contrasting sensitivities of soil water and groundwater transport processes to climate forcings the temporal variability decreases with the time in the nägelstedt catchment indicating the highly variable distributions of soil water tts and the almost constant distribution of groundwater tts simulation results suggest a power law type and fractal behavior of catchment ttd it further shows that the predictive uncertainty in catchment mtt is dominated by the contribution from groundwater uncertainty and almost immune to the uncertainty in the soil zone the power law shape catchment ttd makes the mtt extremely vulnerable to biased groundwater characterization a joint description of catchment ttd using multiple summary statistics is strongly recommended to characterize catchment transport processes data availability statement the coupled mhm ogs model can be freely downloaded and distributed through the following online repository https doi org 10 5281

339,in this study we investigate the impact of topological disorder on liquid distribution and transport phenomena in three dimensional unsaturated granular media using the shan chen lattice boltzmann method distinct samples of disordered media are generated characterized by the disorder index i v under different i v varied liquid cluster distributions are demonstrated in a gravity driven vapour liquid system gradually increasing the initial liquid phase in the simulation domain allows the full range of saturation the focuses are placed on the liquid cluster statistics from the connectivity total cluster number largest cluster and mean cluster volume at an increasing saturation meanwhile the interfacial area liquid retention curves and relative permeability saturation curves are produced at diverse i v and wettability it is found that the slopes of retention curves are well correlated with the proposed capillary index i c that unifies both disorder and wettability the proposed generalized correlation between capillary index and slope index is useful in terms of determining the capillary pressure saturation curve and relative permeability saturation curve for a given granular system at varied contact angles additionally the cohesive strength saturation curves are also obtained with the aid of the interfacial area and negative capillary pressure which elucidates that a packing with a higher i v experiences a relatively larger cohesive strength these results enhance the understanding of disorder effect and will be beneficial for the exploration of many retention curves related phenomena such as liquid transfer and stress strain relation for wet granular media keywords disordered porous medium retention curve relative permeability liquid cluster distribution shan chen lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction granular materials in nature or industry usually consist of three phases including air liquid and solid grains the interaction among them is critical in determining both hydraulic and mechanical properties of partially saturated granular media fournier et al 2005 sheng 2011 for example the rainfall induced slope instability is caused by the decrease of shear strength under an increasing water saturation in soil zhu and anderson 1998 in the field of unsaturated porous media the water retention curve wrc is a fundamental correlation which introduces the variation of capillary pressure with the water saturation brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 the accurate representation of this curve is of importance in many practical aspects such as the determination of shear strength and water relative permeability zhou et al 2016 sheng et al 2019 that is the capillary pressure saturation equation can be embedded in the analytical expression of shear strength or relative permeability thus an increasing focus is put on investigating the wrc and its dependence ahrenholz et al 2008 zhou 2013 likos et al 2014 the wrc as a macroscopic feature is a result of the pore scale liquid distribution at varied saturation governed by the surface and geometrical characteristics in porous media including the surface tension contact angle and pore size distribution which have been already explored in many studies zhou 2013 likos and jaafar 2013 delenne et al 2015 wang et al 2017 as many natural porous media are heterogeneous with varied pore characteristics the effects of topological disorder of porous media on the two phase fluid displacement has attracted an increasing attention holtzman and juanes 2010 holtzman 2016 hu et al 2019 lu et al 2019 however less studies have been conducted on the impact of topological disorder on unsaturated porous media with focusing on the liquid cluster distribution interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability the liquid distribution under the capillary condensation process has been modelled with the identification of four states including pendular early funicular late funicular and capillary states which shows a strong correlation with the wrc delenne et al 2015 zhou 2013 developed a contact angle hysteresis dependent model for the water retention curve which shows the difference of wrc between the drainage and imbibition process li et al 2018 analyzed the effects of heterogeneity grain surface area contact angle and surface tension on the interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability in a steady state two phase flow the computed interfacial area is also used to describe the fluid distribution and the heterogeneous medium is found to experience a larger capillary pressure smaller relative permeability and fluid fluid interfacial length at a given saturation compared with a relatively uniform medium for the fluid displacement bakhshian and hosseini 2019 studied the impact of wettability heterogeneity on the co 2 brine displacement in rock samples of tuscaloosa sandstone finding that an increasing percentage of co 2 wet regions during drainage leads to a more stable displacement a lower co 2 relative permeability and capillary pressure at a given brine saturation bakhshian et al 2020 probed the interaction between wettability and pore geometry on the fluid displacement by adopting homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media at varied wettability in addition to above factors the disorder of porous media modifies the mode of two phase flow through varying the shape of pore and throat size distributions wang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 a highly disordered porous medium is preferred to enhance the liquid retention behaviour in a gravity driven drainage through providing a wide trapped saturated cluster distribution cui et al 2019 the interplay between the wettability and the degree of disorder on the fluid displacement has been explored by wang et al 2019 by proposing a correlation between the interfacial length and invading saturation with the incorporation of both disorder and wettability nevertheless as with the aforementioned studies the direct correlation between the disorder and liquid distribution in partially saturated porous media has not been developed analytical experimental and numerical approaches have been adopted to study the behaviour of unsaturated porous media pore scale water retention hysteresis models have been developed based on the representation of void space by classical cylindrical capillaries likos and jaafar 2013 ferraro et al 2017 however the capillary properties are often obtained according to the statistical distribution and cannot capture the information at pore scale the hysteresis of wrcs can also be computed via the drainage and imbibition experiments under a glass bead packing and the fluid interfacial area can be obtained through using x ray microtomography to reveal the unsaturated flow culligan et al 2004 porter et al 2010 in addition the existing numerical models include the pore network model joekar niasar et al 2010 volume of fluid cui et al 2019 and lattice boltzmann methods schaap et al 2007 li et al 2018 nekoeian et al 2018 although the pore network model is advantageous in terms of the computation efficiency it is limited to the simplified pore information and flow equations joekar niasar et al 2010 tranter et al 2018 the volume of fluid method is also proposed to study the unsaturated flow cui et al 2019 but this method is computationally expensive which limits its applicability for simulating larger scale three dimensional unsaturated flow alternatively the lattice boltzmann method lbm is another powerful tool to reveal pore scale unsaturated flow in porous media which is employed by many recent investigations due to its superiority of handling the complex geometry readily capturing the interface and vastly parallel computation yang and boek 2013 chen et al 2014 li et al 2018 nekoeian et al 2018 bakhshian et al 2019 among many multiphase models in the lbm shan chen single component model is proved to be competent in simulating the liquid gas flow with a high density ratio sukop and or 2004 huang and lu 2009 chen et al 2014 the study carried by sukop and or 2004 is based on the singe component model showing numerical liquid retention curves in silts and in angular pores validated by the theoretical equations the similar model was adopted by huang and lu 2009 to study the gas liquid distribution which has been validated by comparing the numerical velocity profile and relative permeability in a two dimensional channel with analytical solutions this paper presents a pore scale investigation using the lattice boltzmann method to study gravity driven unsaturated flow in three dimensional disordered porous media with varied surface wettability distinct porous samples containing spherical grains are generated with the introduction of the disorder index i v which characterizes the degree of topological disorder by gradually increasing the initial saturation of liquid phase in the simulation domain different states are achieved from a pendular to a fully saturated state the effects of disorder on the distribution of liquid cluster as well as the interfacial area are analysed at different saturation the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation curves are then demonstrated under varied disorder and wettability with constructing the relation between the slope index and the capillary index i c that unifies both disorder and wettability effects the obtained relation can be used to predict the overall shape of these two critical curves the cohesive strength induced by the negative capillary pressure is further discussed under varied i v and wettability 2 method 2 1 generation of disordered media the porous medium is a rectangular cuboid filled with mono sized spherical obstacles initially hexagonal close packed hcp as the solid phase then the monte carlo iterative movement is applied to each obstacle to introduce topological disorder with considering the periodic boundary condition in all directions the voronoi method is used to tessellate the pore space for the analysis of disorder the disorder index i v is given as the fluctuation of the local porosity ϕ i calculated from each voronoi cell as cui et al 2019 1 i v ϕ i 2 ϕ i 2 1 2 where the operator corresponds to the volume average compared to the traditional disorder index based on regular meshes laubie et al 2017 the used disorder index can capture the small variation in microstructures cui et al 2019 this index can be another way of expressing the pore size distribution but it provides more information about the throat size distribution importantly it is simple to use one single parameter i e the disorder index to characterise the effects of polydispersity of granular media during the monte carlo moves the degree of disorder is controlled by the apparent diameter d app λ d with λ 1 d max d where d and d max are the particle diameter and the diameter for the closed packing respectively laubie et al 2017 wang et al 2019 therefore λ 1 represents the system with the maximum i v where the spheres are free to move without overlap while λ d max d represents the hexagonal packing under a given λ sufficient steps are run to obtain the stabilized i v it is noted that the maximum i v depends on the size packing factor and number of spheres of porous medium although current work only involves the monodisperse packing the above method can be extended to consider the polydisperse packing zakirov and khramchenkov 2020 using the above generation method of disordered packing four distinct porous media consisting of 128 solid grains are generated with the disorder index i v 0 013 0 030 0 050 and 0 073 shown in fig 1 a the radius of spherical obstacle is 20 lattice unit with the maximum apparent radius of 22 lattice unit which makes the overall packing factor of 0 556 to achieve statistical information of pores and throats delaunay tessellation is then conducted for the pore space tessellation the volume of each pore is equal to the volume of corresponding delanuay tetrahedron without the solid section shown in fig 1 c the throat size is calculated as the maximal inscribed radius of triangular face in delanuay tetrahedrons as in fig 1 d with an increasing i v the packing tends to become more disordered which is reflected by the pore volume and throat size distribution as shown in fig 1 c and 1 d respectively it is seen that a larger disorder index leads to a wider distribution for both pore volume and throat size note that for a better visible comparison the maximum pore volume is not displaced at the tail of the probability distribution in fig 1 c 2 2 simulation method to numerically study two phase flow into disordered porous media we implement the shan chen single component multiphase lattice boltzmann method in three dimensions with the use of d3q19 lattice shan and chen 1994 the density distribution function under the bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision operator satisfies the following lattice boltzmann equation bhatnagar et al 1954 2 f i x c i δ t t δ t f i x t δ t τ f i x t f i e q x t where f i is the density distribution in i th velocity direction and τ is a relaxation time leading to the kinematic viscosity as ν c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t in lattice unit where c s denotes of the speed of sound although the multiple relaxation time mrt model can improve the uncertainty when the relaxation time is close to 0 5 it is demonstrated that both bgk and mrt models can yield similar results at the relaxation time of 1 pan et al 2006 therefore the relaxation time in our study is set up to be 1 0 so that the applied bgk model is feasible with the ranges of relevant model parameters and preferred due to less computation complexity the equilibrium distribution function f i e q is calculated by 3 f i e q x t ω i ρ 1 u c i c s 2 u c i 2 2 c s 4 u u 2 c s 2 where ω i denotes the weighting factor in the i th direction u denotes the macroscopic equilibrium fluid velocity and ρ denotes the fluid density in current case d3q19 is adopted as a velocity set to solve the navier stokes equations in three dimensions therefore c i is given by 4 c i c u 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 where c u δ x δ t represents the lattice speed and δ x is the lattice spacing in eq 3 for the d3q19 model ω i 1 3 for i 0 ω i 1 18 for i 1 2 3 6 ω i 1 36 for i 7 8 9 18 the density of the fluid in eq 3 is given as ρ f i and the macroscopic velocity can be then computed as 5 u u τ f ρ where u f i c i ρ and f denotes the total force acting on the lattice site the total force includes the interaction force f sc due to the surface tension the adhesion force f ad due to the wettability and the external force f b i e gravity in this study as f f sc f ad f b the shan chen single component multiphase model introduces an interaction force as shan and chen 1994 6 f s c x g ψ x i ω i ψ x c i δ t c i δ t where ψ is the pseudopotential function or the effective mass depending on the local density and g is the strength parameters that can characterize the interaction between different phases to achieve the phase separation g should be negative which represents the attractive force between lattice nodes this expression can also account for the fluid solid interaction i e wettability by tuning the wall density so that the variation of contact angles can be controlled benzi et al 2006 from the equation of state of shan chen model the pressure at any node is given as 7 p c s 2 ρ c s 2 g 2 ψ 2 ρ re arranging eq 7 obtains 8 ψ ρ 2 p c s 2 ρ c s 2 g to minimize the spurious velocity the carnahan starling equation of state is applied in eq 8 as yuan and schaefer 2006 9 p ρ r t 1 b ρ 4 b ρ 4 2 b ρ 4 3 1 b ρ 4 3 a ρ 2 with a 0 4963 r 2 t c 2 p c b 0 18727 r t c p c and r and t are the gas constant and temperature respectively from the above equations the critical temperature t c can be calculated the phase separation does not occur if t t c note that the value of g does not influence the simulation results as it is cancelled out with the substitution of eq 8 into eq 6 the density ratio and surface tension are determined by the input temperature a lower temperature leads to a higher density ratio and surface tension given the fact that the shan chen two component model shows the incompetency when the viscosity ratio is over 5 yang and boek 2013 the adopted single component model is an ideal selection for the liquid vapour system and is proven to be capable to simulate high density ratio fluids sukop and or 2004 huang and lu 2009 chen et al 2014 the generated packing with varied i v are imported into the lattice boltzmann modelling with the total lattice number of m n z 152 176 287 the radius of sphere r s is set to be 20 lattice unit lu for the convergence purpose pan et al 2004 we set a 1 b 4 r 1 and t 0 7 t c in the equation of the state shown in eq 9 which yields an equilibrium density of vapour and liquid with 0 005 and 0 352 in the lattice unit system respectively the density ratio is calculated as 70 the current temperature is chosen for the numerical stability and this input temperature has been also adopted in other studies richefeu et al 2016 huang and lu 2009 initially the liquid occupies the region near the bottom while the rest of pore space is occupied by the vapour phase as in fig 1 b periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions to avoid the boundary effect i e outflowing liquid or vapour re enters the domain through the opposite boundary the height of wetting phase can be modified to vary the saturation in the whole domain with the relaxation time τ 1 the value of kinematic viscosity is calculated to be 0 167 for both phases resulting in the kinematic viscosity ratio of 1 the density difference between liquid and vapour causes the dynamic viscosity ratio of 70 the magnitude of liquid vapour surface tension γ is determined as 0 015 through the bubble test the variation of contact angles between liquid phase and grain surface is achieved by altering the fictitious wall density the benchmark of surface tension and contact angle is summarised in fig 2 the gravity g with a value of 0 00032 is applied vertically downwards corresponding to a bond number of b o δ ρ g r s 2 γ e 3 68 where e denotes the void ratio cui et al 2019 although a larger surface tension is always preferred for considering the capillary effect the bond number in this case can demonstrate both gravitational and capillary effects the calculated reynolds number is less than 10 for the conversion of lattice units towards physical values three reference quantities including length scale l 0 time scale t 0 and mass scale m 0 are applied as l 0 8 10 6 m t 0 7 2 10 7 s and m 0 1 46 10 12 kg consequently the physical particle radius becomes r s l 0 1 6 10 4 m the physical liquid density and dynamic viscosity are obtained as ρ phy ρ m 0 l 0 3 1000 kg m 3 and μ phy ν ρ m 0 l 0 t 0 2 49 10 3 pa s respectively the physical liquid vapour surface tension and gravity are computed as γ phy γ m 0 t 0 2 42 2 mn m 1 and g phy g l 0 t 0 2 4 94 10 3 m s 2 respectively table 1 summarises geometrical parameters of studied porous media and properties of two phases in both lattice and physical unit systems the simulations are initialized with a zero velocity field and then runs 2 0 10 5 time steps which is found to be sufficient to reach the equilibrium state see fig 1 e for a typical evolution overall 10 saturation values from 0 to 1 are simulated with different disorder indexes i v 0 013 0 030 0 050 0 073 and contact angles θ 25 45 82 133 note that the case with i v 0 073 and θ 25 is not carried out due to the numerical instability reason i e in total 150 cases the multiple relaxation time method instead of bgk method can be adopted in the future to deal with the instability problem all simulations are run using the university of sydney s high performance computing hpc 2 3 data processing upon the simulation completion the lbm exports data consisting of density and velocity of each lattice node with respect to the time step the post processing procedure includes the conversions from the raw data to preferred variable e g saturation capillary pressure interfacial area liquid cluster distribution and relative permeability before the conversions the lattice nodes need to be identified as either the vapour liquid interface or solid phase based on empirical threshold densities in this study the lattice nodes with density greater than 0 26 lu are regarded as the liquid the number of which is calculated as n l while if the density of the lattice nodes are smaller than 0 09 lu the nodes are regarded as the vapour the number of which is calculated as n v the nodes with density between these two threshold values is considered as the liquid vapour interface node with the number of n i the solid nodes with the number of n s are located when the density equals the wall density that depends on the input of contact angles a sensitivity analysis of the threshold values has been conducted and it is found that variations near the selected thresholds do not significantly affect the results the liquid retention curve is critical in two phase flow which describes the relationship between the liquid saturation and capillary pressure the liquid saturation s is defined as 10 s n l 0 5 n i m n z n s on average at varied saturation the liquid vapour interface nodes account for 5 of the total nodes although there are only few interface nodes they are still counted in the saturation calculation and distributed equally for the liquid and vapour saturation li et al 2018 however these interface nodes induce the unfavourable spurious velocity and are excluded in the calculation for the flow rate connington and lee 2012 the capillary pressure p c defined as the difference between average vapour pressure u v and liquid pressure u l is given as p c u v u l and the pressures are direct functions of densities according to the equation of state as in eq 9 delenne et al 2015 richefeu et al 2016 li et al 2018 nekoeian et al 2018 the interfacial area is also needed in this study to analyze the fluid distribution and cohesive strength once the liquid phase is identified the isosurface function in matlab can be used to generate the surface area of liquid a l which is then normalised by the total volume of the domain porter et al 2010 the surface area of vapour a v and solid phase a s are obtained using the same method subsequently the liquid vapour area a v l the liquid solid area a l s and vapour solid area a v s are computed as culligan et al 2004 porter et al 2010 11 a l v a l a v a s 2 a l s a l a v l a v s a v a v l in the meantime with the location of the liquid nodes using bwconncomp function in a matlab environment can help to determine the connected components the post processing includes relabeling components at the domain edges to comply with the periodic boundary condition which allows to obtain the distribution of liquid cluster as stated above the interface nodes are excluded in the calculation of the flow rate due to the spurious velocity as the gravity is only applied vertically and volume average fluxes in x and y directions are nearly zero only velocities in z direction are taken into account and the corresponding volume averaging fluxes of liquid q l and vapour q v are given by 12 q l 1 m n z n l u z l q v 1 m n z n v u z v where u z l and u z v are the velocity of each lattice node in z direction for the liquid and vapour respectively then the relative permeability of liquid k r l and vapour k r v are defined as li et al 2018 13 k r l q l ν k i g k r v q v ν k i g where k i is the intrinsic permeability measured using single phase flow into disordered media with k i r s 2 of 5 62 10 3 7 01 10 3 9 49 10 3 and 1 36 10 2 for i v 0 013 0 030 0 050 0 073 respectively see appendix for details ν represents the kinematic viscosity of each phase the capillary number can be considered an indicator of the equilibrium state which is computed as c a q l μ l γ where μ l represents the dynamic viscosity of liquid and γ represents the surface tension the capillary number is observed to keep nearly unchanged after 2 0 10 5 simulation time steps as shown in fig 1 e 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster statistics we aim to find the disorder effect on the liquid clusters under the fixed wettability of 45 when the solid surface has a lower wettability i e at the contact angle of 82 and 133 the number of identified liquid clusters in current domain is less than 10 which is not enough for the cluster statistical analysis however the number of liquid clusters increases with a decreasing contact angle and therefore we choose the contact angle of 45 as a typical example the cases under an even smaller contact angle i e 25 follow the same trend as those under 45 in the following sections for the analyse of interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability the wettability effect will be considered the pore scale phenomena of liquid cluster distribution are critical in determining the macroscopic behaviour of wet granular packing e g capillary pressure and relative permeability fig 3 a displays four typical snapshots of liquid cluster distribution with an increasing liquid saturation for i v 0 030 showing the pendular funicular and capillary states the pendular state is where the wetting phase exists in the form of liquid bridges between a pair of grains and the saturation is low less than 0 1 in the funicular state the wetting phase binds more than 2 grains the capillary state refers to the condition that grains are fully immersed in the wetting phase with only isolated nonwetting phase in fig 3 a for s 0 014 all liquid exists in the form of liquid bridges which shows the pendular state in this state each liquid cluster only connects two solid grains at an increasing saturation the funicular state is recognized via observing the coalescence of some liquid bridges when s 0 176 0 275 and a number of liquid clusters connect more than two solid grains a percolating cluster is apparently observed for s 0 275 and we also define this state as the funicular because it has one or more main percolating liquid cluster and a number of isolated liquid clusters with a further increase in saturation all solid grains are immersed in liquid at s 0 797 this is defined as the capillary state where only one liquid cluster exists and it connects all 128 solid grains in the current system these different snapshots show the cluster evolution and the feasibility of current simulation setup to more quantitatively compare the liquid distribution at different saturation the cluster connectivity c is defined as the number of solid grains connected by a single cluster which is then normalised by the total number of grains in the system i e 128 the connectivity of each cluster is averaged to obtain the normalised mean connectivity of the system c n fig 3 b shows the mean connectivity of varied disordered media with saturation s the mean liquid connectivity increases with saturation from 0 15625 2 128 to 1 128 128 because each liquid cluster starts from a liquid bridge with a connectivity of 2 128 and in the end a single cluster is formed and connects all of 128 grains it is observed that a porous medium with a larger i v has a larger mean liquid connectivity at a given saturation this explains the phenomenon observed by cui et al 2019 that disorder facilitates the merging of clusters thus connecting more grains cui et al 2019 i e there are more dense packing zones in medium with a high degree of disorder as a result large saturated zones occur more frequently in a more disordered packing and it is more likely for these zones to join together to form a percolating cluster to summarize the disorder can enhance the cluster connectivity and the formation of percolating clusters as the total cluster number and volume change with the connectivity the focus is then put on the influence of disorder on them fig 3 f depicts the cluster volume distribution of varied disordered packing at the saturation of 0 08 showing that a packing with a larger i v has the largest percolating cluster the volume of the largest cluster is then normalised by the current total cluster volume and the number of liquid clusters is normalised by the total number of grains fig 3 c shows the normalised number of liquid clusters and the normalised volume of the largest liquid cluster as a function of saturation the number of clusters is found to decreases with an increasing saturation due to the coalescence of adjacent clusters under the same saturation a higher degree of disorder causes a smaller cluster number the reason for this phenomenon is explained in the discussion of cluster connectivity that the disorder promotes the cluster coalescence to reduce the total cluster number after the saturation of 0 8 there is no significant difference among varied disordered packing on the cluster number regarding the normalised volume of the largest cluster it can be seen that the normalised volume for a higher disordered packing approaches one early here we define the threshold of normalised volume with 0 8 to distinguish the pendular from the funicular state based on the observed transition at s 0 2 in the second subfigure of fig 4 b beyond that value a single cluster can account for most of the liquid phase and less isolated clusters occur in the domain we consider this state as a funicular state less than the threshold value most of clusters exist in an isolated form which is considered as a pendular state it is revealed that the disorder can make wet porous media enter the funicular state early with the increase of saturation it is noted that a threshold of 0 8 used in current study is only chosen for the comparison reason to obtain the qualitative conclusion of disorder effect on different states more discrete saturation points near the transition region need to be simulated for further quantitative investigation the relation between the normalised mean cluster volume and saturation is further demonstrated in fig 3 d it is not surprising that an increase in the disorder index leads to an increasing mean cluster volume at the same saturation this is because the disorder causes a less total number of clusters as depicted in fig 3 c 3 2 effect of wettability after the investigation of pore scale cluster distribution the attention is then put on the effect of packing disorder on the interfacial area as well as the macroscopic behaviour including capillary pressure and relative permeability varied liquid contact angles are applied including θ 25 45 82 133 to demonstrate the combined impacts of topological disorder and wettability 3 2 1 interfacial area the enhancement of cluster merging induced by the disorder can be reflected from the interfacial area including a l s and a v s and a l v fig 4 demonstrates the variation of three types of interfacial area normalised by the total volume of the domain as a function of saturation for varied i v at different contact angles θ 25 45 82 133 for θ 90 it can be seen that a higher degree of disorder results in a larger liquid solid interfacial area it is because that the disorder causes a larger mean liquid cluster connectivity at the same saturation the liquid cluster in the disordered media tends to attach more solid surface in the meantime less vapour solid interfacial area is observed with an increasing i v similar tendencies are also identified in the work by li et al 2018 who made a comparison of interfacial area among varied heterogeneous porous media however when θ 133 the reverse trend is identified that an increasing i v leads to a decrease in a l s and an increase in a v s due to the hydrophobic grain surface the liquid solid interfacial area is a key parameter affecting the relative permeability the increase in a l s leads to a significant decrease in the liquid relative permeability shown in fig 8 the disorder results in a larger liquid solid interfacial area while leads to a decrease of relative permeability the disorder effect on the relative permeability will be discussed further in the following section besides for the wettability effect a l s for the same i v becomes larger at a smaller θ because the liquid clusters are more discrete in terms of distribution at the strong wettability for the weak wettability the liquid clusters become connected and less isolated clusters are formed another observation from fig 4 a is that the curve for the liquid solid interfacial area is sharper for the strong wettability θ 25 while becomes straight line for the neutral wettability θ 82 with the increase of contact angle the intersection saturation between the liquid solid and vapour solid interfacial area increases for the nearly neutral wettability i e θ 82 the intersection occurs close to s 0 5 that is both liquid and vapour attach nearly the same area of solid surface at the equivalent saturation regarding the liquid vapour interfacial area shown in fig 4 b a peak value is found at s 0 2 followed by a drop when θ 25 or 45 this trend is also shown in the drainage and imbibition experiments conducted by culligan et al 2004 that peak point can correspond to the transition from the pendular to funicular state when θ 82 or 133 a peak value can also be observed and it occurs at s 0 5 therefore an increase in wettability makes the peak value of a l v occur at a smaller s additionally the disorder effect on a l v is not obvious for θ 45 82 133 compared to the clear effect for θ 25 that an increasing i v causes a smaller a l v due to the improved cluster connectivity 3 2 2 liquid retention curves the classical liquid retention curves are plotted in fig 5 for different disorder indexes and contact angles the capillary pressure is normalized by the grain diameter d and surface tension γ it is noted again that the simulation under i v 0 073 and θ 25 is not conducted due to the numerical instability issue the liquid retention curve has many crucial applications such as characterising the type of soil based on the pore size distribution its generic shape is well reproduced by our simulations it is observed that there is a transition point of saturation at the middle when θ 90 below that saturation the capillary pressure becomes larger with an increasing i v at a given saturation above that saturation the capillary pressure is smaller with an increasing i v the fraction of fine pores is relatively large in a disorder medium at a low saturation these fine pores are filled first enhancing the fluid solid adhesion and thus enlarging capillary pressure li et al 2018 however the relatively large pores in a disordered packing remain unoccupied at a higher saturation which contributes less to the overall capillary pressure thus the capillary pressure decreases with increasing i v after the middle transition saturation when the solid surface turns to be hydrophobic the impact of disorder on liquid retention curves become different shown in fig 5 with θ 133 the increasing disorder leads to a decreasing capillary pressure at the same saturation it should be noted that in order to ensure a nearly zero capillary pressure when the saturation approaches one a special treatment is applied that the lattice nodes which are 2 lu away from the grain surface are excluded in the calculation of the capillary pressure this is to avoid the transition lattice nodes between the liquid and solid grains 3 2 3 cohesive strength the computed capillary pressure p c and liquid solid interfacial area a l s can serve to analyse the cohesive strength of wet granular medium as the liquid exerts the negative pressure on grains the average pressure on grains is the sum of normal force divided by the grain surface area the obtained average pressure is then multiplied by the packing factor ϕ to relate to the scale of packing as follows delenne et al 2015 14 c a l s a s p c ϕ here we regard the average grain pressure c as a cohesive strength of the packing induced by the capillary pressure from eq 14 it can be seen that c tends to increase to a maximum value followed by a drop due to the competition between increasing interfacial area and decreasing capillary pressure with an increase in liquid saturation fig 6 illustrates cohesive strength curves as a function of saturation when θ 25 45 82 133 similar curves have been generated from other studies scheel et al 2008 richefeu et al 2016 it can be seen that the packing with a higher i v induces a larger cohesive strength and reaches the peak cohesive strength early before a transitional saturation for θ 25 45 82 while an increasing i v implies a decreasing cohesive strength after the transitional saturation besides the transitional saturation is found to become larger from around 0 5 to 0 8 when θ varies from 25 to 82 this is due to the disorder effect on the capillary pressure shown from fig 5 when θ 133 the opposite tendency is found that the cohesive strength decreases with an increasing i v overall these cohesive strength curves elucidate that the disorder can enhance the cohesive strength in a wet granular medium for θ 90 and weaken the cohesive strength for θ 90 which contributes to better understanding the mechanical properties of disordered packing and provides a good baseline to design a granular system with the desired cohesive strength 3 2 4 soil water characteristic curves all of data points in fig 5 are further fitted using the famous van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 as 15 s p c s r s s s r 1 α p c n 1 1 n where s r 0 and s s 1 denotes the residual and saturated liquid saturation respectively and α and n are two fitting parameters that relate to the air entry pressure and pore size distribution respectively van genuchten 1980 here α is inversely proportional to the air entry pressure which depends on the largest pore in the granular media a packing with a number of relatively large pores tends to have a small air entry pressure as the disorder widens the pore size distribution seen in fig 1 c the packing with a higher i v tends to have a lower air entry pressure thus a larger α regarding another fitting parameter n a wet granular packing with a wider pore size distribution has a steeper liquid retention curve resulting in a smaller n value while a packing with a narrow pore size distribution tends to have a flatter liquid retention curve with a larger n value it is obvious from fig 5 that the disorder is strongly correlated to the slope index n in van genuchten equation a larger disorder index represents a wide pore size distribution shown in fig 1 c which leads to a steeper curve with a smaller slope index n in the meantime the wettability can also change the liquid distribution in the wet granular packing a lower contact angle represents a high affinity of liquid to the solid grain and the liquid can be distributed more easily among pores therefore resulting in a steeper curve with a lower slope index n as well shown in fig 5 consequently both a higher disorder index and a lower contact angle can make a wet granular packing experience a steeper van genuchten curve one important application of van genuchten equation is to predict the relative permeability the van genuchten model is analytically incorporated into the mualem s relative permeability model shown as van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 16 k r l s ϵ 1 1 s 1 m m 2 where m 1 1 n is a van genuchten parameter related to the symmetry of liquid retention curves and ϵ is related to the connection between pores and the flow path tortuosity and it can be negative zero or positive although ϵ 0 5 is widely used in most of studies valiantzas 2011 mahabadi et al 2016 the selection of ϵ 0 5 is originally derived based on fitting experimental data mualem 1976 and there seems to be no clear understanding on ϵ yet sheng et al 2019 adopted ϵ 0 which also turns out to be feasible additionally brooks and corey 1964 derived the general form for the capillary pressure function as 17 s p c p b λ here p b corresponds to the entry capillary pressure and λ corresponds to the pore size distribution which is theoretically larger than 0 and becomes smaller for a wider pore size distribution brooks and corey 1964 as a result the data points in fig 5 are also fitted by using eq 17 to compare with the van genuchten model shown in next section this model can also be incorporated into the relative permeability equation as 18 k rl s 2 3 λ λ 3 2 5 capillary index compared with the parameter related to the entry pressure we are more interested in slope parameter i e n and λ as it can be used for the identification of soil type based on the pore size distribution as shown in fig 5 both a larger i v and smaller θ can result in the reduction of slope index to be related with this index we then propose a capillary index i c incorporating both disorder and wettability effects given as 19 i c i v max i v i v max i v min cos θ cos θ min cos θ max cos θ min the form of i c is developed based on wang et al s 2019 initial proposal here i v min 0 representing the disorder index for a regular packing and i v max 0 085 is the maximum disorder index in the current geometry configuration it changes depending on the geometry packing factor and number of solid grains the packing with the maximum disorder index allows the contact of solid grains moreover θ max 90 and θ min 0 denote the largest and minimum contact angles respectively the maximum contact angle of 90 is selected because the disorder effect on liquid retention curves becomes different when the contact angle is above 90 and the cases under θ 133 are excluded in i c four constant boundary values are considered to formulate the expression of i c between 0 and 1 the capillary index of 1 stands for the regular packing and the contact angle of 90 whilst i c 0 represents the most disordered packing or the extreme wetting condition a larger i c implies a lower i v and larger θ in eq 19 and it corresponds to a larger slope index which results in a flatter liquid retention curve while a smaller i c corresponds to a steeper liquid retention curve both slope indexes n and λ follow this tendency plots of quantitative correlations between i c and slope indexes are made for both van genchuten and brooks corey models in fig 7 which show strong linear relationships with pearson correlation coefficients r of 0 9460 and 0 9019 respectively based on these high r a linear relationship between i c and the slope index is proposed and used to fit the simulation results as 20 g a i c g min g n λ where g min represents the minimum slope index under the current system and a denotes the slope of the relationship this g min is intrinsically measurable and can be obtained when the input contact angle is set up to be 0 or the most disordered media is applied in the simulation however due to the numerical instability reason the actual g min is not attained consequently for the slope index n used in the van genchuten model n min 1 is currently selected because n in principle should be larger than 1 and a is then obtained as 76 91 through fitting 11 discrete cases for the slope index λ in the brooks corey model a and λ min are obtained as 17 061 and 2 97 through the fitting using the proposed correlation between the capillary index and slope index the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation curve can be obtained for a given granular media with known wettability in chen s study chen 2020 a linear fit was conducted between the slope index and dry density to fit the slope index wang et al 2017 adopted the expression as n c 1 log 10 c u 1 where c 1 and c u denote the fitting parameter and the soil gradation parameter respectively here we provide a first attempt to correlate the slope of water retention curve with properties of liquid and porous media and such linear correlation has not been reported from available literature in this study we focused on the correlation analyses rather than empirical correlations thus the linear fitting functions are presented for reference only 3 2 6 relative permeability in addition to the capillary pressure the relative permeability is another essential parameter to describe the ability of a partially saturated porous medium to transport liquid or air and it is affected by both topological disorder and wettability fig 8 presents their effects on the relative permeability for both liquid and vapour the simulation results successfully reproduce the trend of liquid and vapour relative permeability as a function of saturation for the hydrophilic grain surface the results show that the liquid relative permeability decreases with an increasing i v or a decreasing θ at the same saturation it is because that the high tortuosity in the disorder granular medium and increased liquid solid adhesion i e larger liquid solid interfacial area can intensify the flow resistance thus leading to the decrease of relative permeability li et al 2018 for the hydrophobic grain surface the disorder effect shows differently and an increase in i v can enlarge the liquid relative permeability to predict the relative permeability curve for liquid using eqs 16 and 18 the slope indexes n and λ are firstly determined from its relation with i c described in eq 20 for the van genchuten model n can then be easily converted to m 1 1 n used in the relative permeability equation seen in eq 16 and ϵ 0 is applied sheng et al 2019 the predication of the liquid relative permeability with different wettability is then made in fig 9 using both van genchuten and brook corey models it is observed that the predication can only provide a qualitative agreement with the experimental simulation results however the predication for a higher i v is in a relatively better consistence with the simulation results as the used two models are derived based on realistic disordered structures that is eqs 16 and 18 seem not applicable in nearly regular packing overall the van genchuten based relatively permeability model is found to be more competent by introducing ϵ to represents the tortuosity and its connection with the pore space although a constant ϵ in eq 16 is usually employed in most of research mualem 1976 mahabadi et al 2016 valiantzas 2011 sheng et al 2019 we propose that ϵ is not a constant since freeing ϵ as a fitting parameter can apparently obtain a better consistence as a result ϵ should be determined based on the specific granular medium system and the comprehensive understanding of it and its dependence need further parametric studies by experiments and modelling 4 conclusion in this study we provide a systematic study on the combined effects of topological disorder and wettability on liquid distribution interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability under different saturation using the shan chen lattice boltzmann method the results show that the connectivity of liquid clusters is enhanced with increasing disorder leading to earlier transition towards funicular state from pendular state we also found that the packing structure of grains has profound influence on the interfacial area and capillary pressure across a wide range of saturation interestingly the total liquid solid interfacial area increases with topological disorder at a wetting condition while being suppressed when θ 90 consequently the cohesive strength c computed as the product of interfacial area and capillary pressure has similar behaviour further to unify the impact from disorder and wettability a capillary index is proposed for estimation of the van genuchten slope index n and brooks corey slope index λ providing an effective method for determination of the liquid retention curve and relative permeability curve it is worth noting that the selection of ϵ in the van genchuten based relative permeability equation is based on empirical values the understanding for it has not reached an agreement which should be studied in future work the evidence from this work highlights the significant impact of topological disorder on liquid distribution and transport phenomena in porous media such findings will help expand our understanding of the behavior of unsaturated granular media especially water retention curve dependent phenomena this work also provides a tool for simulating the bubble motion and two phase flow velocity distribution in the granular system it would be more interesting to see the bubble coalescence breakup and trapping and corresponding velocity profiles in the

under varied disordered media 
339,in this study we investigate the impact of topological disorder on liquid distribution and transport phenomena in three dimensional unsaturated granular media using the shan chen lattice boltzmann method distinct samples of disordered media are generated characterized by the disorder index i v under different i v varied liquid cluster distributions are demonstrated in a gravity driven vapour liquid system gradually increasing the initial liquid phase in the simulation domain allows the full range of saturation the focuses are placed on the liquid cluster statistics from the connectivity total cluster number largest cluster and mean cluster volume at an increasing saturation meanwhile the interfacial area liquid retention curves and relative permeability saturation curves are produced at diverse i v and wettability it is found that the slopes of retention curves are well correlated with the proposed capillary index i c that unifies both disorder and wettability the proposed generalized correlation between capillary index and slope index is useful in terms of determining the capillary pressure saturation curve and relative permeability saturation curve for a given granular system at varied contact angles additionally the cohesive strength saturation curves are also obtained with the aid of the interfacial area and negative capillary pressure which elucidates that a packing with a higher i v experiences a relatively larger cohesive strength these results enhance the understanding of disorder effect and will be beneficial for the exploration of many retention curves related phenomena such as liquid transfer and stress strain relation for wet granular media keywords disordered porous medium retention curve relative permeability liquid cluster distribution shan chen lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction granular materials in nature or industry usually consist of three phases including air liquid and solid grains the interaction among them is critical in determining both hydraulic and mechanical properties of partially saturated granular media fournier et al 2005 sheng 2011 for example the rainfall induced slope instability is caused by the decrease of shear strength under an increasing water saturation in soil zhu and anderson 1998 in the field of unsaturated porous media the water retention curve wrc is a fundamental correlation which introduces the variation of capillary pressure with the water saturation brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 the accurate representation of this curve is of importance in many practical aspects such as the determination of shear strength and water relative permeability zhou et al 2016 sheng et al 2019 that is the capillary pressure saturation equation can be embedded in the analytical expression of shear strength or relative permeability thus an increasing focus is put on investigating the wrc and its dependence ahrenholz et al 2008 zhou 2013 likos et al 2014 the wrc as a macroscopic feature is a result of the pore scale liquid distribution at varied saturation governed by the surface and geometrical characteristics in porous media including the surface tension contact angle and pore size distribution which have been already explored in many studies zhou 2013 likos and jaafar 2013 delenne et al 2015 wang et al 2017 as many natural porous media are heterogeneous with varied pore characteristics the effects of topological disorder of porous media on the two phase fluid displacement has attracted an increasing attention holtzman and juanes 2010 holtzman 2016 hu et al 2019 lu et al 2019 however less studies have been conducted on the impact of topological disorder on unsaturated porous media with focusing on the liquid cluster distribution interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability the liquid distribution under the capillary condensation process has been modelled with the identification of four states including pendular early funicular late funicular and capillary states which shows a strong correlation with the wrc delenne et al 2015 zhou 2013 developed a contact angle hysteresis dependent model for the water retention curve which shows the difference of wrc between the drainage and imbibition process li et al 2018 analyzed the effects of heterogeneity grain surface area contact angle and surface tension on the interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability in a steady state two phase flow the computed interfacial area is also used to describe the fluid distribution and the heterogeneous medium is found to experience a larger capillary pressure smaller relative permeability and fluid fluid interfacial length at a given saturation compared with a relatively uniform medium for the fluid displacement bakhshian and hosseini 2019 studied the impact of wettability heterogeneity on the co 2 brine displacement in rock samples of tuscaloosa sandstone finding that an increasing percentage of co 2 wet regions during drainage leads to a more stable displacement a lower co 2 relative permeability and capillary pressure at a given brine saturation bakhshian et al 2020 probed the interaction between wettability and pore geometry on the fluid displacement by adopting homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media at varied wettability in addition to above factors the disorder of porous media modifies the mode of two phase flow through varying the shape of pore and throat size distributions wang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 a highly disordered porous medium is preferred to enhance the liquid retention behaviour in a gravity driven drainage through providing a wide trapped saturated cluster distribution cui et al 2019 the interplay between the wettability and the degree of disorder on the fluid displacement has been explored by wang et al 2019 by proposing a correlation between the interfacial length and invading saturation with the incorporation of both disorder and wettability nevertheless as with the aforementioned studies the direct correlation between the disorder and liquid distribution in partially saturated porous media has not been developed analytical experimental and numerical approaches have been adopted to study the behaviour of unsaturated porous media pore scale water retention hysteresis models have been developed based on the representation of void space by classical cylindrical capillaries likos and jaafar 2013 ferraro et al 2017 however the capillary properties are often obtained according to the statistical distribution and cannot capture the information at pore scale the hysteresis of wrcs can also be computed via the drainage and imbibition experiments under a glass bead packing and the fluid interfacial area can be obtained through using x ray microtomography to reveal the unsaturated flow culligan et al 2004 porter et al 2010 in addition the existing numerical models include the pore network model joekar niasar et al 2010 volume of fluid cui et al 2019 and lattice boltzmann methods schaap et al 2007 li et al 2018 nekoeian et al 2018 although the pore network model is advantageous in terms of the computation efficiency it is limited to the simplified pore information and flow equations joekar niasar et al 2010 tranter et al 2018 the volume of fluid method is also proposed to study the unsaturated flow cui et al 2019 but this method is computationally expensive which limits its applicability for simulating larger scale three dimensional unsaturated flow alternatively the lattice boltzmann method lbm is another powerful tool to reveal pore scale unsaturated flow in porous media which is employed by many recent investigations due to its superiority of handling the complex geometry readily capturing the interface and vastly parallel computation yang and boek 2013 chen et al 2014 li et al 2018 nekoeian et al 2018 bakhshian et al 2019 among many multiphase models in the lbm shan chen single component model is proved to be competent in simulating the liquid gas flow with a high density ratio sukop and or 2004 huang and lu 2009 chen et al 2014 the study carried by sukop and or 2004 is based on the singe component model showing numerical liquid retention curves in silts and in angular pores validated by the theoretical equations the similar model was adopted by huang and lu 2009 to study the gas liquid distribution which has been validated by comparing the numerical velocity profile and relative permeability in a two dimensional channel with analytical solutions this paper presents a pore scale investigation using the lattice boltzmann method to study gravity driven unsaturated flow in three dimensional disordered porous media with varied surface wettability distinct porous samples containing spherical grains are generated with the introduction of the disorder index i v which characterizes the degree of topological disorder by gradually increasing the initial saturation of liquid phase in the simulation domain different states are achieved from a pendular to a fully saturated state the effects of disorder on the distribution of liquid cluster as well as the interfacial area are analysed at different saturation the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation curves are then demonstrated under varied disorder and wettability with constructing the relation between the slope index and the capillary index i c that unifies both disorder and wettability effects the obtained relation can be used to predict the overall shape of these two critical curves the cohesive strength induced by the negative capillary pressure is further discussed under varied i v and wettability 2 method 2 1 generation of disordered media the porous medium is a rectangular cuboid filled with mono sized spherical obstacles initially hexagonal close packed hcp as the solid phase then the monte carlo iterative movement is applied to each obstacle to introduce topological disorder with considering the periodic boundary condition in all directions the voronoi method is used to tessellate the pore space for the analysis of disorder the disorder index i v is given as the fluctuation of the local porosity ϕ i calculated from each voronoi cell as cui et al 2019 1 i v ϕ i 2 ϕ i 2 1 2 where the operator corresponds to the volume average compared to the traditional disorder index based on regular meshes laubie et al 2017 the used disorder index can capture the small variation in microstructures cui et al 2019 this index can be another way of expressing the pore size distribution but it provides more information about the throat size distribution importantly it is simple to use one single parameter i e the disorder index to characterise the effects of polydispersity of granular media during the monte carlo moves the degree of disorder is controlled by the apparent diameter d app λ d with λ 1 d max d where d and d max are the particle diameter and the diameter for the closed packing respectively laubie et al 2017 wang et al 2019 therefore λ 1 represents the system with the maximum i v where the spheres are free to move without overlap while λ d max d represents the hexagonal packing under a given λ sufficient steps are run to obtain the stabilized i v it is noted that the maximum i v depends on the size packing factor and number of spheres of porous medium although current work only involves the monodisperse packing the above method can be extended to consider the polydisperse packing zakirov and khramchenkov 2020 using the above generation method of disordered packing four distinct porous media consisting of 128 solid grains are generated with the disorder index i v 0 013 0 030 0 050 and 0 073 shown in fig 1 a the radius of spherical obstacle is 20 lattice unit with the maximum apparent radius of 22 lattice unit which makes the overall packing factor of 0 556 to achieve statistical information of pores and throats delaunay tessellation is then conducted for the pore space tessellation the volume of each pore is equal to the volume of corresponding delanuay tetrahedron without the solid section shown in fig 1 c the throat size is calculated as the maximal inscribed radius of triangular face in delanuay tetrahedrons as in fig 1 d with an increasing i v the packing tends to become more disordered which is reflected by the pore volume and throat size distribution as shown in fig 1 c and 1 d respectively it is seen that a larger disorder index leads to a wider distribution for both pore volume and throat size note that for a better visible comparison the maximum pore volume is not displaced at the tail of the probability distribution in fig 1 c 2 2 simulation method to numerically study two phase flow into disordered porous media we implement the shan chen single component multiphase lattice boltzmann method in three dimensions with the use of d3q19 lattice shan and chen 1994 the density distribution function under the bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision operator satisfies the following lattice boltzmann equation bhatnagar et al 1954 2 f i x c i δ t t δ t f i x t δ t τ f i x t f i e q x t where f i is the density distribution in i th velocity direction and τ is a relaxation time leading to the kinematic viscosity as ν c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t in lattice unit where c s denotes of the speed of sound although the multiple relaxation time mrt model can improve the uncertainty when the relaxation time is close to 0 5 it is demonstrated that both bgk and mrt models can yield similar results at the relaxation time of 1 pan et al 2006 therefore the relaxation time in our study is set up to be 1 0 so that the applied bgk model is feasible with the ranges of relevant model parameters and preferred due to less computation complexity the equilibrium distribution function f i e q is calculated by 3 f i e q x t ω i ρ 1 u c i c s 2 u c i 2 2 c s 4 u u 2 c s 2 where ω i denotes the weighting factor in the i th direction u denotes the macroscopic equilibrium fluid velocity and ρ denotes the fluid density in current case d3q19 is adopted as a velocity set to solve the navier stokes equations in three dimensions therefore c i is given by 4 c i c u 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 where c u δ x δ t represents the lattice speed and δ x is the lattice spacing in eq 3 for the d3q19 model ω i 1 3 for i 0 ω i 1 18 for i 1 2 3 6 ω i 1 36 for i 7 8 9 18 the density of the fluid in eq 3 is given as ρ f i and the macroscopic velocity can be then computed as 5 u u τ f ρ where u f i c i ρ and f denotes the total force acting on the lattice site the total force includes the interaction force f sc due to the surface tension the adhesion force f ad due to the wettability and the external force f b i e gravity in this study as f f sc f ad f b the shan chen single component multiphase model introduces an interaction force as shan and chen 1994 6 f s c x g ψ x i ω i ψ x c i δ t c i δ t where ψ is the pseudopotential function or the effective mass depending on the local density and g is the strength parameters that can characterize the interaction between different phases to achieve the phase separation g should be negative which represents the attractive force between lattice nodes this expression can also account for the fluid solid interaction i e wettability by tuning the wall density so that the variation of contact angles can be controlled benzi et al 2006 from the equation of state of shan chen model the pressure at any node is given as 7 p c s 2 ρ c s 2 g 2 ψ 2 ρ re arranging eq 7 obtains 8 ψ ρ 2 p c s 2 ρ c s 2 g to minimize the spurious velocity the carnahan starling equation of state is applied in eq 8 as yuan and schaefer 2006 9 p ρ r t 1 b ρ 4 b ρ 4 2 b ρ 4 3 1 b ρ 4 3 a ρ 2 with a 0 4963 r 2 t c 2 p c b 0 18727 r t c p c and r and t are the gas constant and temperature respectively from the above equations the critical temperature t c can be calculated the phase separation does not occur if t t c note that the value of g does not influence the simulation results as it is cancelled out with the substitution of eq 8 into eq 6 the density ratio and surface tension are determined by the input temperature a lower temperature leads to a higher density ratio and surface tension given the fact that the shan chen two component model shows the incompetency when the viscosity ratio is over 5 yang and boek 2013 the adopted single component model is an ideal selection for the liquid vapour system and is proven to be capable to simulate high density ratio fluids sukop and or 2004 huang and lu 2009 chen et al 2014 the generated packing with varied i v are imported into the lattice boltzmann modelling with the total lattice number of m n z 152 176 287 the radius of sphere r s is set to be 20 lattice unit lu for the convergence purpose pan et al 2004 we set a 1 b 4 r 1 and t 0 7 t c in the equation of the state shown in eq 9 which yields an equilibrium density of vapour and liquid with 0 005 and 0 352 in the lattice unit system respectively the density ratio is calculated as 70 the current temperature is chosen for the numerical stability and this input temperature has been also adopted in other studies richefeu et al 2016 huang and lu 2009 initially the liquid occupies the region near the bottom while the rest of pore space is occupied by the vapour phase as in fig 1 b periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions to avoid the boundary effect i e outflowing liquid or vapour re enters the domain through the opposite boundary the height of wetting phase can be modified to vary the saturation in the whole domain with the relaxation time τ 1 the value of kinematic viscosity is calculated to be 0 167 for both phases resulting in the kinematic viscosity ratio of 1 the density difference between liquid and vapour causes the dynamic viscosity ratio of 70 the magnitude of liquid vapour surface tension γ is determined as 0 015 through the bubble test the variation of contact angles between liquid phase and grain surface is achieved by altering the fictitious wall density the benchmark of surface tension and contact angle is summarised in fig 2 the gravity g with a value of 0 00032 is applied vertically downwards corresponding to a bond number of b o δ ρ g r s 2 γ e 3 68 where e denotes the void ratio cui et al 2019 although a larger surface tension is always preferred for considering the capillary effect the bond number in this case can demonstrate both gravitational and capillary effects the calculated reynolds number is less than 10 for the conversion of lattice units towards physical values three reference quantities including length scale l 0 time scale t 0 and mass scale m 0 are applied as l 0 8 10 6 m t 0 7 2 10 7 s and m 0 1 46 10 12 kg consequently the physical particle radius becomes r s l 0 1 6 10 4 m the physical liquid density and dynamic viscosity are obtained as ρ phy ρ m 0 l 0 3 1000 kg m 3 and μ phy ν ρ m 0 l 0 t 0 2 49 10 3 pa s respectively the physical liquid vapour surface tension and gravity are computed as γ phy γ m 0 t 0 2 42 2 mn m 1 and g phy g l 0 t 0 2 4 94 10 3 m s 2 respectively table 1 summarises geometrical parameters of studied porous media and properties of two phases in both lattice and physical unit systems the simulations are initialized with a zero velocity field and then runs 2 0 10 5 time steps which is found to be sufficient to reach the equilibrium state see fig 1 e for a typical evolution overall 10 saturation values from 0 to 1 are simulated with different disorder indexes i v 0 013 0 030 0 050 0 073 and contact angles θ 25 45 82 133 note that the case with i v 0 073 and θ 25 is not carried out due to the numerical instability reason i e in total 150 cases the multiple relaxation time method instead of bgk method can be adopted in the future to deal with the instability problem all simulations are run using the university of sydney s high performance computing hpc 2 3 data processing upon the simulation completion the lbm exports data consisting of density and velocity of each lattice node with respect to the time step the post processing procedure includes the conversions from the raw data to preferred variable e g saturation capillary pressure interfacial area liquid cluster distribution and relative permeability before the conversions the lattice nodes need to be identified as either the vapour liquid interface or solid phase based on empirical threshold densities in this study the lattice nodes with density greater than 0 26 lu are regarded as the liquid the number of which is calculated as n l while if the density of the lattice nodes are smaller than 0 09 lu the nodes are regarded as the vapour the number of which is calculated as n v the nodes with density between these two threshold values is considered as the liquid vapour interface node with the number of n i the solid nodes with the number of n s are located when the density equals the wall density that depends on the input of contact angles a sensitivity analysis of the threshold values has been conducted and it is found that variations near the selected thresholds do not significantly affect the results the liquid retention curve is critical in two phase flow which describes the relationship between the liquid saturation and capillary pressure the liquid saturation s is defined as 10 s n l 0 5 n i m n z n s on average at varied saturation the liquid vapour interface nodes account for 5 of the total nodes although there are only few interface nodes they are still counted in the saturation calculation and distributed equally for the liquid and vapour saturation li et al 2018 however these interface nodes induce the unfavourable spurious velocity and are excluded in the calculation for the flow rate connington and lee 2012 the capillary pressure p c defined as the difference between average vapour pressure u v and liquid pressure u l is given as p c u v u l and the pressures are direct functions of densities according to the equation of state as in eq 9 delenne et al 2015 richefeu et al 2016 li et al 2018 nekoeian et al 2018 the interfacial area is also needed in this study to analyze the fluid distribution and cohesive strength once the liquid phase is identified the isosurface function in matlab can be used to generate the surface area of liquid a l which is then normalised by the total volume of the domain porter et al 2010 the surface area of vapour a v and solid phase a s are obtained using the same method subsequently the liquid vapour area a v l the liquid solid area a l s and vapour solid area a v s are computed as culligan et al 2004 porter et al 2010 11 a l v a l a v a s 2 a l s a l a v l a v s a v a v l in the meantime with the location of the liquid nodes using bwconncomp function in a matlab environment can help to determine the connected components the post processing includes relabeling components at the domain edges to comply with the periodic boundary condition which allows to obtain the distribution of liquid cluster as stated above the interface nodes are excluded in the calculation of the flow rate due to the spurious velocity as the gravity is only applied vertically and volume average fluxes in x and y directions are nearly zero only velocities in z direction are taken into account and the corresponding volume averaging fluxes of liquid q l and vapour q v are given by 12 q l 1 m n z n l u z l q v 1 m n z n v u z v where u z l and u z v are the velocity of each lattice node in z direction for the liquid and vapour respectively then the relative permeability of liquid k r l and vapour k r v are defined as li et al 2018 13 k r l q l ν k i g k r v q v ν k i g where k i is the intrinsic permeability measured using single phase flow into disordered media with k i r s 2 of 5 62 10 3 7 01 10 3 9 49 10 3 and 1 36 10 2 for i v 0 013 0 030 0 050 0 073 respectively see appendix for details ν represents the kinematic viscosity of each phase the capillary number can be considered an indicator of the equilibrium state which is computed as c a q l μ l γ where μ l represents the dynamic viscosity of liquid and γ represents the surface tension the capillary number is observed to keep nearly unchanged after 2 0 10 5 simulation time steps as shown in fig 1 e 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster statistics we aim to find the disorder effect on the liquid clusters under the fixed wettability of 45 when the solid surface has a lower wettability i e at the contact angle of 82 and 133 the number of identified liquid clusters in current domain is less than 10 which is not enough for the cluster statistical analysis however the number of liquid clusters increases with a decreasing contact angle and therefore we choose the contact angle of 45 as a typical example the cases under an even smaller contact angle i e 25 follow the same trend as those under 45 in the following sections for the analyse of interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability the wettability effect will be considered the pore scale phenomena of liquid cluster distribution are critical in determining the macroscopic behaviour of wet granular packing e g capillary pressure and relative permeability fig 3 a displays four typical snapshots of liquid cluster distribution with an increasing liquid saturation for i v 0 030 showing the pendular funicular and capillary states the pendular state is where the wetting phase exists in the form of liquid bridges between a pair of grains and the saturation is low less than 0 1 in the funicular state the wetting phase binds more than 2 grains the capillary state refers to the condition that grains are fully immersed in the wetting phase with only isolated nonwetting phase in fig 3 a for s 0 014 all liquid exists in the form of liquid bridges which shows the pendular state in this state each liquid cluster only connects two solid grains at an increasing saturation the funicular state is recognized via observing the coalescence of some liquid bridges when s 0 176 0 275 and a number of liquid clusters connect more than two solid grains a percolating cluster is apparently observed for s 0 275 and we also define this state as the funicular because it has one or more main percolating liquid cluster and a number of isolated liquid clusters with a further increase in saturation all solid grains are immersed in liquid at s 0 797 this is defined as the capillary state where only one liquid cluster exists and it connects all 128 solid grains in the current system these different snapshots show the cluster evolution and the feasibility of current simulation setup to more quantitatively compare the liquid distribution at different saturation the cluster connectivity c is defined as the number of solid grains connected by a single cluster which is then normalised by the total number of grains in the system i e 128 the connectivity of each cluster is averaged to obtain the normalised mean connectivity of the system c n fig 3 b shows the mean connectivity of varied disordered media with saturation s the mean liquid connectivity increases with saturation from 0 15625 2 128 to 1 128 128 because each liquid cluster starts from a liquid bridge with a connectivity of 2 128 and in the end a single cluster is formed and connects all of 128 grains it is observed that a porous medium with a larger i v has a larger mean liquid connectivity at a given saturation this explains the phenomenon observed by cui et al 2019 that disorder facilitates the merging of clusters thus connecting more grains cui et al 2019 i e there are more dense packing zones in medium with a high degree of disorder as a result large saturated zones occur more frequently in a more disordered packing and it is more likely for these zones to join together to form a percolating cluster to summarize the disorder can enhance the cluster connectivity and the formation of percolating clusters as the total cluster number and volume change with the connectivity the focus is then put on the influence of disorder on them fig 3 f depicts the cluster volume distribution of varied disordered packing at the saturation of 0 08 showing that a packing with a larger i v has the largest percolating cluster the volume of the largest cluster is then normalised by the current total cluster volume and the number of liquid clusters is normalised by the total number of grains fig 3 c shows the normalised number of liquid clusters and the normalised volume of the largest liquid cluster as a function of saturation the number of clusters is found to decreases with an increasing saturation due to the coalescence of adjacent clusters under the same saturation a higher degree of disorder causes a smaller cluster number the reason for this phenomenon is explained in the discussion of cluster connectivity that the disorder promotes the cluster coalescence to reduce the total cluster number after the saturation of 0 8 there is no significant difference among varied disordered packing on the cluster number regarding the normalised volume of the largest cluster it can be seen that the normalised volume for a higher disordered packing approaches one early here we define the threshold of normalised volume with 0 8 to distinguish the pendular from the funicular state based on the observed transition at s 0 2 in the second subfigure of fig 4 b beyond that value a single cluster can account for most of the liquid phase and less isolated clusters occur in the domain we consider this state as a funicular state less than the threshold value most of clusters exist in an isolated form which is considered as a pendular state it is revealed that the disorder can make wet porous media enter the funicular state early with the increase of saturation it is noted that a threshold of 0 8 used in current study is only chosen for the comparison reason to obtain the qualitative conclusion of disorder effect on different states more discrete saturation points near the transition region need to be simulated for further quantitative investigation the relation between the normalised mean cluster volume and saturation is further demonstrated in fig 3 d it is not surprising that an increase in the disorder index leads to an increasing mean cluster volume at the same saturation this is because the disorder causes a less total number of clusters as depicted in fig 3 c 3 2 effect of wettability after the investigation of pore scale cluster distribution the attention is then put on the effect of packing disorder on the interfacial area as well as the macroscopic behaviour including capillary pressure and relative permeability varied liquid contact angles are applied including θ 25 45 82 133 to demonstrate the combined impacts of topological disorder and wettability 3 2 1 interfacial area the enhancement of cluster merging induced by the disorder can be reflected from the interfacial area including a l s and a v s and a l v fig 4 demonstrates the variation of three types of interfacial area normalised by the total volume of the domain as a function of saturation for varied i v at different contact angles θ 25 45 82 133 for θ 90 it can be seen that a higher degree of disorder results in a larger liquid solid interfacial area it is because that the disorder causes a larger mean liquid cluster connectivity at the same saturation the liquid cluster in the disordered media tends to attach more solid surface in the meantime less vapour solid interfacial area is observed with an increasing i v similar tendencies are also identified in the work by li et al 2018 who made a comparison of interfacial area among varied heterogeneous porous media however when θ 133 the reverse trend is identified that an increasing i v leads to a decrease in a l s and an increase in a v s due to the hydrophobic grain surface the liquid solid interfacial area is a key parameter affecting the relative permeability the increase in a l s leads to a significant decrease in the liquid relative permeability shown in fig 8 the disorder results in a larger liquid solid interfacial area while leads to a decrease of relative permeability the disorder effect on the relative permeability will be discussed further in the following section besides for the wettability effect a l s for the same i v becomes larger at a smaller θ because the liquid clusters are more discrete in terms of distribution at the strong wettability for the weak wettability the liquid clusters become connected and less isolated clusters are formed another observation from fig 4 a is that the curve for the liquid solid interfacial area is sharper for the strong wettability θ 25 while becomes straight line for the neutral wettability θ 82 with the increase of contact angle the intersection saturation between the liquid solid and vapour solid interfacial area increases for the nearly neutral wettability i e θ 82 the intersection occurs close to s 0 5 that is both liquid and vapour attach nearly the same area of solid surface at the equivalent saturation regarding the liquid vapour interfacial area shown in fig 4 b a peak value is found at s 0 2 followed by a drop when θ 25 or 45 this trend is also shown in the drainage and imbibition experiments conducted by culligan et al 2004 that peak point can correspond to the transition from the pendular to funicular state when θ 82 or 133 a peak value can also be observed and it occurs at s 0 5 therefore an increase in wettability makes the peak value of a l v occur at a smaller s additionally the disorder effect on a l v is not obvious for θ 45 82 133 compared to the clear effect for θ 25 that an increasing i v causes a smaller a l v due to the improved cluster connectivity 3 2 2 liquid retention curves the classical liquid retention curves are plotted in fig 5 for different disorder indexes and contact angles the capillary pressure is normalized by the grain diameter d and surface tension γ it is noted again that the simulation under i v 0 073 and θ 25 is not conducted due to the numerical instability issue the liquid retention curve has many crucial applications such as characterising the type of soil based on the pore size distribution its generic shape is well reproduced by our simulations it is observed that there is a transition point of saturation at the middle when θ 90 below that saturation the capillary pressure becomes larger with an increasing i v at a given saturation above that saturation the capillary pressure is smaller with an increasing i v the fraction of fine pores is relatively large in a disorder medium at a low saturation these fine pores are filled first enhancing the fluid solid adhesion and thus enlarging capillary pressure li et al 2018 however the relatively large pores in a disordered packing remain unoccupied at a higher saturation which contributes less to the overall capillary pressure thus the capillary pressure decreases with increasing i v after the middle transition saturation when the solid surface turns to be hydrophobic the impact of disorder on liquid retention curves become different shown in fig 5 with θ 133 the increasing disorder leads to a decreasing capillary pressure at the same saturation it should be noted that in order to ensure a nearly zero capillary pressure when the saturation approaches one a special treatment is applied that the lattice nodes which are 2 lu away from the grain surface are excluded in the calculation of the capillary pressure this is to avoid the transition lattice nodes between the liquid and solid grains 3 2 3 cohesive strength the computed capillary pressure p c and liquid solid interfacial area a l s can serve to analyse the cohesive strength of wet granular medium as the liquid exerts the negative pressure on grains the average pressure on grains is the sum of normal force divided by the grain surface area the obtained average pressure is then multiplied by the packing factor ϕ to relate to the scale of packing as follows delenne et al 2015 14 c a l s a s p c ϕ here we regard the average grain pressure c as a cohesive strength of the packing induced by the capillary pressure from eq 14 it can be seen that c tends to increase to a maximum value followed by a drop due to the competition between increasing interfacial area and decreasing capillary pressure with an increase in liquid saturation fig 6 illustrates cohesive strength curves as a function of saturation when θ 25 45 82 133 similar curves have been generated from other studies scheel et al 2008 richefeu et al 2016 it can be seen that the packing with a higher i v induces a larger cohesive strength and reaches the peak cohesive strength early before a transitional saturation for θ 25 45 82 while an increasing i v implies a decreasing cohesive strength after the transitional saturation besides the transitional saturation is found to become larger from around 0 5 to 0 8 when θ varies from 25 to 82 this is due to the disorder effect on the capillary pressure shown from fig 5 when θ 133 the opposite tendency is found that the cohesive strength decreases with an increasing i v overall these cohesive strength curves elucidate that the disorder can enhance the cohesive strength in a wet granular medium for θ 90 and weaken the cohesive strength for θ 90 which contributes to better understanding the mechanical properties of disordered packing and provides a good baseline to design a granular system with the desired cohesive strength 3 2 4 soil water characteristic curves all of data points in fig 5 are further fitted using the famous van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 as 15 s p c s r s s s r 1 α p c n 1 1 n where s r 0 and s s 1 denotes the residual and saturated liquid saturation respectively and α and n are two fitting parameters that relate to the air entry pressure and pore size distribution respectively van genuchten 1980 here α is inversely proportional to the air entry pressure which depends on the largest pore in the granular media a packing with a number of relatively large pores tends to have a small air entry pressure as the disorder widens the pore size distribution seen in fig 1 c the packing with a higher i v tends to have a lower air entry pressure thus a larger α regarding another fitting parameter n a wet granular packing with a wider pore size distribution has a steeper liquid retention curve resulting in a smaller n value while a packing with a narrow pore size distribution tends to have a flatter liquid retention curve with a larger n value it is obvious from fig 5 that the disorder is strongly correlated to the slope index n in van genuchten equation a larger disorder index represents a wide pore size distribution shown in fig 1 c which leads to a steeper curve with a smaller slope index n in the meantime the wettability can also change the liquid distribution in the wet granular packing a lower contact angle represents a high affinity of liquid to the solid grain and the liquid can be distributed more easily among pores therefore resulting in a steeper curve with a lower slope index n as well shown in fig 5 consequently both a higher disorder index and a lower contact angle can make a wet granular packing experience a steeper van genuchten curve one important application of van genuchten equation is to predict the relative permeability the van genuchten model is analytically incorporated into the mualem s relative permeability model shown as van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 16 k r l s ϵ 1 1 s 1 m m 2 where m 1 1 n is a van genuchten parameter related to the symmetry of liquid retention curves and ϵ is related to the connection between pores and the flow path tortuosity and it can be negative zero or positive although ϵ 0 5 is widely used in most of studies valiantzas 2011 mahabadi et al 2016 the selection of ϵ 0 5 is originally derived based on fitting experimental data mualem 1976 and there seems to be no clear understanding on ϵ yet sheng et al 2019 adopted ϵ 0 which also turns out to be feasible additionally brooks and corey 1964 derived the general form for the capillary pressure function as 17 s p c p b λ here p b corresponds to the entry capillary pressure and λ corresponds to the pore size distribution which is theoretically larger than 0 and becomes smaller for a wider pore size distribution brooks and corey 1964 as a result the data points in fig 5 are also fitted by using eq 17 to compare with the van genuchten model shown in next section this model can also be incorporated into the relative permeability equation as 18 k rl s 2 3 λ λ 3 2 5 capillary index compared with the parameter related to the entry pressure we are more interested in slope parameter i e n and λ as it can be used for the identification of soil type based on the pore size distribution as shown in fig 5 both a larger i v and smaller θ can result in the reduction of slope index to be related with this index we then propose a capillary index i c incorporating both disorder and wettability effects given as 19 i c i v max i v i v max i v min cos θ cos θ min cos θ max cos θ min the form of i c is developed based on wang et al s 2019 initial proposal here i v min 0 representing the disorder index for a regular packing and i v max 0 085 is the maximum disorder index in the current geometry configuration it changes depending on the geometry packing factor and number of solid grains the packing with the maximum disorder index allows the contact of solid grains moreover θ max 90 and θ min 0 denote the largest and minimum contact angles respectively the maximum contact angle of 90 is selected because the disorder effect on liquid retention curves becomes different when the contact angle is above 90 and the cases under θ 133 are excluded in i c four constant boundary values are considered to formulate the expression of i c between 0 and 1 the capillary index of 1 stands for the regular packing and the contact angle of 90 whilst i c 0 represents the most disordered packing or the extreme wetting condition a larger i c implies a lower i v and larger θ in eq 19 and it corresponds to a larger slope index which results in a flatter liquid retention curve while a smaller i c corresponds to a steeper liquid retention curve both slope indexes n and λ follow this tendency plots of quantitative correlations between i c and slope indexes are made for both van genchuten and brooks corey models in fig 7 which show strong linear relationships with pearson correlation coefficients r of 0 9460 and 0 9019 respectively based on these high r a linear relationship between i c and the slope index is proposed and used to fit the simulation results as 20 g a i c g min g n λ where g min represents the minimum slope index under the current system and a denotes the slope of the relationship this g min is intrinsically measurable and can be obtained when the input contact angle is set up to be 0 or the most disordered media is applied in the simulation however due to the numerical instability reason the actual g min is not attained consequently for the slope index n used in the van genchuten model n min 1 is currently selected because n in principle should be larger than 1 and a is then obtained as 76 91 through fitting 11 discrete cases for the slope index λ in the brooks corey model a and λ min are obtained as 17 061 and 2 97 through the fitting using the proposed correlation between the capillary index and slope index the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation curve can be obtained for a given granular media with known wettability in chen s study chen 2020 a linear fit was conducted between the slope index and dry density to fit the slope index wang et al 2017 adopted the expression as n c 1 log 10 c u 1 where c 1 and c u denote the fitting parameter and the soil gradation parameter respectively here we provide a first attempt to correlate the slope of water retention curve with properties of liquid and porous media and such linear correlation has not been reported from available literature in this study we focused on the correlation analyses rather than empirical correlations thus the linear fitting functions are presented for reference only 3 2 6 relative permeability in addition to the capillary pressure the relative permeability is another essential parameter to describe the ability of a partially saturated porous medium to transport liquid or air and it is affected by both topological disorder and wettability fig 8 presents their effects on the relative permeability for both liquid and vapour the simulation results successfully reproduce the trend of liquid and vapour relative permeability as a function of saturation for the hydrophilic grain surface the results show that the liquid relative permeability decreases with an increasing i v or a decreasing θ at the same saturation it is because that the high tortuosity in the disorder granular medium and increased liquid solid adhesion i e larger liquid solid interfacial area can intensify the flow resistance thus leading to the decrease of relative permeability li et al 2018 for the hydrophobic grain surface the disorder effect shows differently and an increase in i v can enlarge the liquid relative permeability to predict the relative permeability curve for liquid using eqs 16 and 18 the slope indexes n and λ are firstly determined from its relation with i c described in eq 20 for the van genchuten model n can then be easily converted to m 1 1 n used in the relative permeability equation seen in eq 16 and ϵ 0 is applied sheng et al 2019 the predication of the liquid relative permeability with different wettability is then made in fig 9 using both van genchuten and brook corey models it is observed that the predication can only provide a qualitative agreement with the experimental simulation results however the predication for a higher i v is in a relatively better consistence with the simulation results as the used two models are derived based on realistic disordered structures that is eqs 16 and 18 seem not applicable in nearly regular packing overall the van genchuten based relatively permeability model is found to be more competent by introducing ϵ to represents the tortuosity and its connection with the pore space although a constant ϵ in eq 16 is usually employed in most of research mualem 1976 mahabadi et al 2016 valiantzas 2011 sheng et al 2019 we propose that ϵ is not a constant since freeing ϵ as a fitting parameter can apparently obtain a better consistence as a result ϵ should be determined based on the specific granular medium system and the comprehensive understanding of it and its dependence need further parametric studies by experiments and modelling 4 conclusion in this study we provide a systematic study on the combined effects of topological disorder and wettability on liquid distribution interfacial area capillary pressure and relative permeability under different saturation using the shan chen lattice boltzmann method the results show that the connectivity of liquid clusters is enhanced with increasing disorder leading to earlier transition towards funicular state from pendular state we also found that the packing structure of grains has profound influence on the interfacial area and capillary pressure across a wide range of saturation interestingly the total liquid solid interfacial area increases with topological disorder at a wetting condition while being suppressed when θ 90 consequently the cohesive strength c computed as the product of interfacial area and capillary pressure has similar behaviour further to unify the impact from disorder and wettability a capillary index is proposed for estimation of the van genuchten slope index n and brooks corey slope index λ providing an effective method for determination of the liquid retention curve and relative permeability curve it is worth noting that the selection of ϵ in the van genchuten based relative permeability equation is based on empirical values the understanding for it has not reached an agreement which should be studied in future work the evidence from this work highlights the significant impact of topological disorder on liquid distribution and transport phenomena in porous media such findings will help expand our understanding of the behavior of unsaturated granular media especially water retention curve dependent phenomena this work also provides a tool for simulating the bubble motion and two phase flow velocity distribution in the granular system it would be more interesting to see the bubble coalescence breakup and trapping and corresponding velocity profiles in the
