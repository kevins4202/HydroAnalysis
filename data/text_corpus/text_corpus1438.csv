7190,regional climate models rcms generate past and future climate simulations that serve as input for subsequent modelling of impact projections the most recent coordinated regional climate modelling initiative cordex provides rcm data for europe with increased spatial resolution 12 5 km for the cordex eur 11 ensemble and based on the new representative concentration pathways rcps rcm data from the previous initiative ensembles had a spatial resolution of 25 km and was based on the sres emission scenarios in this contribution we explore the development from ensembles to cordex in a hydrological impact study for the upper danube focussing on the representation of past climate and projections of the future for climate and resulting river discharge we replicated a hydrological modelling framework including rcm downscaling and bias correction that used data of 21 ensembles rcms under sres a1b emission scenario kling et al 2012 and now applied cordex eur 11 data of 32 rcm simulations under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios results with cordex show a small improvement in the representation of historical precipitation but a decline in the accuracy of historical temperature simulations despite the increase in spatial model resolution the tendency of ensembles climate projections is reproduced with the cordex rcms albeit with slightly higher precipitation in the cordex data yielding a less pronounced reduction in future mean annual discharge for the upper danube at vienna the previously identified change in discharge seasonality increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge is confirmed with the new cordex data updating climate impact simulations in the presented rigorous replication framework allows analysing specific new information in the latest generation climate model data as well as crystallizing essential expectable patterns of change that need to be addressed in adaptation strategies keywords climate change impact cordex ensembles danube 1 introduction the danube river is the second largest and second longest european river crossing 10 countries and draining areas that belong to 19 countries in the historically turbulent and culturally diverse central and southeast european regions the danube is an important inland waterway and provides enormous economic value for diverse sectors as hydropower water supply irrigation and tourism its water and the large variety of habitats along its course sustain an immense ecological diversity the upper danube basin with its mainly alpine catchment area is a water tower for the entire danube providing around 30 of its discharge at the mouth at the black sea from around 13 of the catchment area and seasonally contributing to higher flows through the drier summers in southeast europe for a concise overview of general facts and figures on the danube basin refer to icpdr 2011 comprehensive elaborations on hydrological processes and water management in the danube basin are provided by icpdr 2005 and brilly 2010 due to this manifold importance of the danube river possible changes in its discharge regime triggered by global climate change have been subject of hydrological climate change impact research for many years with several studies focussing on the snow dominated upper danube catchment with its high sensitivity to warming climate impact studies based on global hydrological models and projections from global climate models gcms by arnell 1999 lehner et al 2006 nohara et al 2006 and sperna weiland et al 2012 presented results for the danube gcm data were also applied in a water balance analysis for the danube basin by lucarini et al 2008 and used for stochastic climate generation as input for hydrological modelling by mauser and bach 2009 acknowledging the need of climate simulations at higher spatial resolution than available from gcms for relevant hydrological impact research following studies applied climate data of one or several regional climate models rcms from subsequent model generations hagemann and jacob 2007 stanzel and nachtnebel 2010 prasch et al 2011 koch et al 2011 blöschl et al 2011 wagner et al 2017 applying large ensembles of rcm data kling et al 2012 and stagl and hattermann 2015 also investigated the uncertainty in climate impact scenarios due to the range of potential climate model projections the continuous elaboration of hydrological climate change impact scenarios for the danube river has been stimulated by advances in regional climate modelling updated climate simulations for europe from subsequent rcm generations have been triggered by and coordinated in three large initiatives prudence christensen and christensen 2007 ensembles hewitt and griggs 2004 and cordex giorgi et al 2009 one main development was the ongoing increase in horizontal model resolution from 50 km in prudence to 25 km in ensembles to 12 5 km in the latest generation high resolution rcm simulations of the cordex eur 11 ensemble jacob et al 2014 this paper describes the first application of cordex eur 11 climate data the most advanced rcm ensemble available for europe to update the climate change projections for the upper danube basin the progress in climate modelling from one generation of climate models to the next is regularly investigated e g knutti and sedlacek 2013 ylhäisi et al 2015 for gcms deque et al 2012 kotlarski et al 2014 smiatek et al 2016 for rcms a singular long term chronology of the development of climate projections was presented by whetton et al 2016 for australia different results of hydrological impact based on different assessment methods and generations of climate model data were compiled in review articles e g roudier et al 2014 for west africa di baldassarre et al 2011 for the nile basin but without a focus on the development of knowledge over time the presented study attempts for the first time to our knowledge a detailed exploration of the development of hydrological impact scenarios resulting from the evolution of climate simulations from one generation of climate models to the next in a rigorous replication experiment we applied exactly the same methodology in climate data processing and hydrological modelling as described in kling et al 2012 replacing the data of 21 rcms of the ensembles initiative with simulations of 16 rcms of the cordex initiative development from ensembles to cordex can be expected due to increased spatial resolution from 25 km in ensembles to 12 5 km in the applied cordex eur 11 simulations due to changes in the assumed greenhouse gas emission scenarios from the sres a1b scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 in the applied ensembles data to representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 in the cordex scenarios and due to general climate model development ylhäisi et al 2015 the objectives of this study are 1 to derive updated climate impact scenarios for the upper danube river based on the latest generation of high resolution rcms from the cordex initiative for europe and 2 to investigate the differences compared with previous results with ensembles data the development from ensembles to cordex is analysed with respect to representation of past climate in the upper danube basin focusing on temperature and precipitation as the main drivers of hydrological impact projections for future climate the related impacts on danube river discharge at vienna and at selected tributaries the structure of this paper generally follows the structure of the original ensembles article by kling et al 2012 without repeating details of unchanged methods data and results section 2 outlines the study area section 3 describes the applied climate model data section 4 shortly recapitulates the methods of modelling and analyses section 5 presents the results with the new cordex data and shows comparisons with ensembles results section 6 provides a discussion of the main findings of research questions remaining open and of implications for water management section 7 gives a concise summary of the presented study and proposes some main conclusions 2 study area this study focuses on the danube river at vienna which has an upstream catchment area of 101810 km2 fig 1 the observed mean annual discharge in the period 1961 1990 was 1923 m3 s there is a strong seasonality in discharge due to accumulation and melting of snow in the alpine southern parts of the basin annual precipitation is higher in the alpine parts than in the pre alpine and lowland areas in the northern and eastern parts of the basin precipitation in summer is larger than in winter the basin averaged annual precipitation amounts to approximately 1100 mm which is roughly split equally into runoff and actual evapotranspiration more details about the study area and the water balance of the basin are given in kling et al 2012 specific results are also presented for three smaller tributary catchments that represent different regions and hydrological regimes within the basin the upper inn at kajetansbrücke 2157 km2 in the highest alpine region in switzerland the lowland naab at heitzenhofen 5415 km2 in germany and the traun at wels 3505 km2 located in the austrian lower alps and alpine foothills 3 climate model data the climate model data used for the new analyses presented here are the recent results of the global cordex initiative giorgi et al 2009 for europe euro cordex jacob et al 2014 as available via the data portals of the earth system grid federation esgf in september 2016 euro cordex rcm simulations are provided with a spatial resolution of 50 km corresponding to 0 44 therefore called eur 44 and with a higher spatial resolution of 12 5 km 0 11 therefore called eur 11 for this study only eur 11 cordex simulations were applied listed in the upper part of table 1 as they provide an increased spatial resolution compared with the ensembles data the 21 applied ensembles climate model simulations listed in the lower part of table 1 have a spatial resolution of 25 km for more details on the used ensembles data refer to kling et al 2012 in addition to rcm resolution different greenhouse gas emission scenarios are a major difference between the climate simulations of ensembles and cordex models while the analysed ensembles projections are based on the sres a1b scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 the cordex projections are based on the new representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 with the driving global climate models gcms being part of the cmip5 experiment taylor et al 2012 only cordex rcm data with scenario runs available for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used in the presented analysis the two other of the four rcp scenarios 2 6 and 6 0 are not available for as many cordex simulations as they are not defined as part of the core set of runs in cmip5 the applied 16 cordex rcms with 32 scenario runs as provided for both rcps are the result of a simulation matrix with seven different regional models driven by five different gcms see table 1 rcp4 5 can be regarded as a medium emission scenario and rcp8 5 as a high emission scenario the names of the rcps relate to the radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century a measure of overall change in the earth s energy balance due to external perturbation cubasch et al 2013 rcp8 5 shows a constant rise of radiative forcing in the 21st century to around 8 5 w m2 in 2100 stabilizing only after the year 2200 rcp4 5 stabilizes at around 4 5 w m2 after 2100 with the stabilization process starting around 2070 reaching a value of around 4 w m2 in 2100 radiative forcing of the sres a1b scenario follows a pathway that is roughly midway between the pathways of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios reaching around 6 w m2 in 2100 cubasch et al 2013 despite its name the radiative forcing pathway of rcp6 0 is markedly below the pathway of sres a1b as rcp6 0 stabilizes at 6 w m2 after 2100 and reaches only around 5 3 w m2 in 2100 4 methods 4 1 hydrological modelling framework the hydrological model is described in detail by kling et al 2012 the exact same model is re used in the current study in this section we only give a short summary of the main features of the hydrological modelling framework of kling et al including model structure historical input data calibration approach evaluation approach the applied precipitation runoff model cosero kling et al 2015 uses a simple conceptual model structure which is similar to the well known hbv model bergström 1995 for the application of the cosero model in monthly time steps internal temporal discretization schemes are applied a semi distributed spatial discretization is used the upper danube basin is split into 16 sub basins and further into overall 61 hydrological response units hrus according to elevation bands for each hru the model determines rainfall and snowfall from precipitation and air temperature data snowmelt is simulated with a temperature index approach actual evapotranspiration is determined from soil moisture and potential evapotranspiration runoff generation due to rainfall and melt water is split into a fast component surface flow plus interflow and base flow a simple glacier module is used to simulate the mass balance of major glaciers in the highest parts of the basin furthermore 14 large reservoirs and their basic operation rules are included in the model see fig 1 routing of flow in the river is not considered for monthly time step modelling in the upper danube basin the historical data used for setting up the hydrological model included precipitation data of histalp auer et al 2007 a map showing the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation kling et al 2005 petrovic et al 2006 air temperature data of histalp stations regionalized to hru values by use of linear regression with elevation as well as potential evapotranspiration computed with the turc 1961 method observed discharge data were collected at 16 gauges to enable calibration and evaluation of the model calibration focussed on six key model parameters controlling snow melt soil moisture storage runoff generation and base flow recession automatic parameter optimization was performed with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1992 using a slightly modified version of the kge statistic gupta el al 2009 modified by kling et al 2012 as objective function to minimize the difference between simulated and observed discharge time series at 16 gauges in the period 1961 1990 kling et al 2012 present a detailed evaluation of the hydrological model in independent evaluation periods 1901 1930 1931 1960 and 1991 2007 for various measures of model performance computed at key gauges additional evaluation presents plots of simulated and observed seasonality in discharge for the calibration period and the ten warmest years on record most of them occurred after 1990 as well as the simulated and observed monthly flow duration curve in conclusion the high agreement between the simulated discharge and historical observations over the last 100 years yields a high confidence that the model is suitable for climate change impact assessment in the upper danube basin 4 2 downscaling and bias correction of rcm data for downscaling and bias correction of the cordex rcm data we present results with the well known delta change method see e g hay et al 2000 the same approach was used by kling et al 2012 for ensembles data and therefore the results are directly comparable see kling et al for details about the spatio temporal application of the bias correction in each month and each hru historical observations of precipitation and air temperature of the period 1961 1990 which were also applied for the historical calibration of the hydrological model see chapter 4 1 were used as a reference for the bias correction in addition we also applied four other methods of bias correction with ensembles data including linear scaling quantile mapping a de trended version of quantile mapping and moment scaling adjusting the first and second moments of the rcm data however apart from some minor peculiarities when applying e g quantile mapping the overall results for projected future discharge of the danube river at vienna are very similar to the results obtained with the delta change method therefore the results with the four additional methods are not reported in this paper 4 3 evaluation of historical rcm simulations increased spatial resolution of rcm simulations with the objective of increased representation of regional climate characteristics has been formulated as one major direction of research in regional climate modelling leung et al 2003 2006 consequently it was one of the focuses of the large european regional climate modelling initiatives of the past decades with rcm resolution increasing from 50 km in prudence christensen and christensen 2007 to 25 km in ensembles hewitt and griggs 2004 to 12 5 km in euro cordex jacob et al 2014 increasing performance of historical climate simulations with increasing spatial resolution can be expected due to a better description of orography and land sea contrast and the potential of better representation of physical and dynamical processes christensen and christensen 2007 the extent to which such an improvement is successfully achieved is shown to vary considerably depending on the geographical region the investigated variables and the spatial and temporal scales of the respective study e g wang et al 2004 hohenegger et al 2008 rauscher et al 2010 van roosmalen et al 2010 kotlarski et al 2014 prein et al 2016 in our comparative evaluation of the performance of ensembles and cordex rcms in simulating historical climate features of the upper danube basin we qualitatively analysed the overall mean and seasonal biases in temperature and precipitation in the entire basin and calculated for both variables quantitative performance measures of the reproduction of spatio temporal patterns of mean and inter annual variability the evaluation period was 1961 1990 for the rcms that do not cover the years before 1970 the period of 1971 1990 was used as alternative reference period which is not referred to explicitly in the remainder of this article the equations for the quantitative performance measures which are based on a similar approach by sennikovs and bethers 2009 are described in detail in kling et al 2012 four sub components of model performance smp refer to the representation of mean temperature mt and precipitation mp and the inter annual variability of temperature vt and precipitation vp for each rcm each sub component of model performance was calculated from the root mean square error rmse of one of these four variables over all 61 spatial units of the hydrological model and all 12 months of the year normalized by the median rmse of all rcms one aggregate measure of model performance mp is determined by averaging the values of the four sub components for each sub component smp as well as for the aggregate mp values smaller than one show that an individual rcm performs better than the median of all rcms and values larger than one indicate the opposite 5 results 5 1 representation of historical climate for a straightforward qualitative evaluation of rcm simulations of temperature and precipitation long term mean values for the entire upper danube basin upstream of vienna are compared with observations fig 2 left ensembles rcms right cordex rcms visual comparison of mean monthly precipitation for the period of 1961 1990 upper panel in fig 2 shows that the cordex ensemble does not include rcms with inverse rainfall seasonality anymore lowest instead of highest values in summer as it was the case with some ensembles rcms contrariwise there is one cordex rcm clmcom mpi with an overestimation of summer rainfall in the basin mean that is markedly higher than in any of the ensembles rcms generally representation of seasonal precipitation has improved only marginally and still exhibits significant errors the long term mean precipitation bias over the entire basin ranges from 13 to 33 in the ensembles data with a median value of 8 3 for cordex data the median of overall precipitation biases is 9 5 with a range from 5 to 43 the maximum value resulting again from clmcom mpi the steady increase in observed mean temperature in the historical period is captured well by all climate models lower panel in fig 2 while the bias in long term mean basin temperature for 1961 1990 in the ensembles models ranges from 2 5 c to 2 9 c with a median value of 0 1 c the cordex rcms almost only exhibit underestimation of temperature the deviations from observed mean values range from 3 2 c to 0 5 c with a median cordex value of 1 1 c representation of the seasonal distribution of temperature is generally good in all rcms as already shown for the ensembles data by kling et al 2012 the quantitative evaluation of spatio temporal patterns of mean precipitation and temperature and their inter annual variability in the rcm simulations enable a ranking of the analysed climate models according to their ability to reproduce historical climate in the upper danube basin fig 3 shows the computed model performance with the best to worst performing rcms sorted from left to right for the aggregate measure of model performance mp fig 3 top also listed in table 1 the cordex models filled bars show no relevant improvement as compared to the ensembles models dashed bars cordex rcms are found both among the best and among the worst performing models a separate presentation of the sub component of mean precipitation mp fig 3 middle reveals that many cordex rcms do show a better representation of spatio temporal patterns of monthly precipitation as the best five models in the combined ensemble are cordex models however cordex rcms exhibit a lower performance with respect to mean temperature mt fig 3 bottom with seven of the ten worst models in the combined ensemble as also apparent in the predominant cold bias shown in fig 2 overall the evaluation results for the upper danube basin show no general improvement in the accuracy of representing monthly historical climatic features in cordex data as compared with ensembles despite the increase in spatial model resolution 5 2 climate change projections the projected increase in temperature in the cordex scenarios for the upper danube basin is closely related to the emission scenario fig 4 top rcp4 5 scenarios show lower increases ranging from 2 c to 3 5 c in the basin average until the end of the 21st century projections under rcp8 5 are markedly higher with changes until the end of the century in the range of 3 5 c to 6 2 c interestingly the entire range of temperature change projections of both cordex rcp scenarios is very similar to the range of ensembles projections even though they are based on only one medium sres emission scenario the differences between the two cordex emission scenarios become apparent only after 2050 the median temperature change signal of the period 2021 2050 as compared with 1961 1990 is almost equal for rcp4 5 1 4 c table 2 and for rcp8 5 1 5 c and also for the ensembles median 1 5 c for the period 2071 2100 the ensembles median temperature increase of 3 2 c is midway between the two cordex scenarios of rcp4 5 2 3 c and rcp8 5 4 1 c for different seasons of the year the relations between the cordex projections with different rcps and the ensembles projections are similar to the relations in these annual changes table 2 in the cordex precipitation projections fig 4 bottom no clear difference between the different emission scenarios is found after the middle of the 21st century almost all cordex projections show an increase in precipitation compared to 1961 1990 with values of some models ranging over 20 these projected cordex precipitation increases are higher than the highest projected changes in the ensembles data the ensembles projections also include results with considerably decreasing precipitation so that in general the range of future precipitation with ensembles data is below the cordex range the higher precipitation in cordex data as compared with ensembles is more pronounced towards the end of the century in the period 2071 2100 seasonally cordex precipitation projections are higher than ensembles results in winter and spring for the period of 2021 2050 and in winter and summer for the period of 2071 2100 table 2 this shift towards higher precipitation projections from ensembles to cordex is also clearly visible when change signals of 30 year means of temperature and precipitation are plotted against each other fig 5 especially for the far future period of 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 the gcm grouping in fig 5 also confirms for cordex data the finding by kling et al 2012 for ensembles data that the level of projected temperature change can be related to the driving gcm while precipitation projections vary considerably between rcm simulations with the same driving gcm 5 3 discharge projections scenario simulations driven by climate projections from the cordex ensemble show a clear pattern of change in seasonality of future discharge at vienna albeit with a large range of results with single ensemble members fig 6 winter discharge increases the seasonal discharge peak in spring occurs earlier and summer discharge decreases these elements of change in future seasonal discharge are shown by all or almost all individual projections to different extents with all three effects being more pronounced in a more distant future 2071 2100 than in an earlier period 2021 2050 these findings with the most recent climate modelling data of the cordex initiative generally confirm projected patterns of changes in discharge seasonality found in previous studies both on already observed trends fürst et al 2007 pekarova et al 2008 and on future projections e g stanzel and nachtnebel 2010 koch et al 2011 prasch et al 2011 kling et al 2012 stagl and hattermann 2015 wagner et al 2017 results with ensembles rcms shown as orange shading in fig 6 do not only show a very similar seasonal pattern of change but also exhibit a comparable range of projections despite the differences in assumed greenhouse gas emission scenarios the corresponding distributions of projection results with ensembles and cordex data are even clearer in a comparison of ensemble median values fig 7 and table 2 differences between ensembles and cordex results are discernible for spring and to a lesser extent for winter for the period of 2021 2050 and for winter and summer for the period of 2071 2100 these differences can directly be related to higher precipitation projections for these seasons in the respective periods in the cordex data see section 5 2 and table 2 for the summer season in the far future period 2071 2100 the additional effect of rising temperatures becomes evident rcp8 5 projections of lower precipitation and higher temperature lead to markedly lower discharge than in the rcp4 5 scenario with a median almost as low as in the ensembles results that are related to even lower summer precipitation in the annual mean smaller changes in discharge are projected by the cordex scenarios than by the ensembles scenarios table 2 for the period of 2021 2050 cordex results show almost no change with a median decrease of less than 2 for rcp4 5 scenarios and a median increase below 2 for rcp8 5 scenarios compared to a median decrease of almost 4 for the ensembles scenarios for 2071 2100 cordex projections show decreasing mean annual discharge of 1 4 in the median of rcp4 5 scenarios and 5 1 in the rcp8 5 scenarios both markedly lower than the median decrease in ensembles projections of 12 for the end of the 21st century an analysis of the impact on more extreme hydrological conditions is presented in table 3 specifying changes in low flow values related to an exceedance probability of 90 denominated q90 in table 3 and high flow values related to an exceedance probability of 10 denominated q10 note that all values refer to monthly mean discharges representing low and high flow periods rather than extreme events projections based on ensembles data generally show a decrease in both high flow and low flow values over a large range of model simulations only for q90 and the near future in 2021 2050 the upper quartile value shows a small increase in the cordex projections high flow also tends to decrease with only the upper quartile of the rcm ensemble for q10 showing small increases median q10 decreases are lower than in the ensembles projections which is mainly a result of the higher precipitation in cordex projections for the far future period 2071 2100 the stronger decrease of q10 in the rcp8 5 projections shows combined effects of precipitation and temperature the shift to earlier high flow months from early summer to late spring and the generally lower discharge in the high flow months is related to increasing spring and decreasing summer precipitation in the rcp8 5 simulations and to earlier snow melt and higher evaporation due to a stronger temperature increase than in rcp4 5 in the cordex model median low flow does not change considerably in contrast to the significant decrease in ensembles q90 results for 2071 2100 the generally higher q90 in the cordex projections than with ensembles data results from higher summer precipitation leading to higher discharge levels in autumn the future principal low flow period currently low flow occurs mainly during late autumn and winter but shifts to earlier months due to increasing winter discharge in the future projections compared with rcp4 5 the rcp8 5 scenarios for the far future show more pronounced decreases in low flow discharge due to lower summer precipitation and higher summer temperature the typical change pattern of increasing discharge in winter and decreasing discharge in summer is apparent also in smaller tributary catchments with very distinct hydrological regimes albeit with different magnitudes fig 8 shows projected changes only for the period 2071 2100 with clearer impacts for the upper inn in the highest alpine region the lowland naab and the traun located in the lower alps and alpine foothills see fig 1 seasonal changes are more pronounced in the upper inn and traun catchments with important snow processes in these catchments and particularly for the high alpine upper inn also the differences between the cooler rcp4 5 scenarios and the warmer rcp8 5 scenarios are more distinct with markedly higher winter discharge and lower summer discharge in rcp8 5 in the lowland naab catchment the projected changes are generally less pronounced but here the cordex results show reduced uncertainty compared with ensembles while the ensembles range includes models projecting considerable decreases in winter discharge no such projections are included in the cordex ensemble which can be attributed to higher precipitation projections in the cordex climate model data 6 discussion 6 1 sources of change between scenario generations the presented results show in general a high consistency between the results with the most recent high resolution rcm simulations of the cordex initiative and the results based on the previous generation of rcms of the ensembles initiative but also reveal some specific differences differences in the results of successive climate impact assessments can generally be expected due to development in all three elements of the impact modelling chain at the gcm level at the rcm level and at the impact model level comparison between results can further be complicated by changes in the reference periods or the investigated future periods by exactly replicating a previous hydrological modelling framework including downscaling and bias correction methods and periods of analysis the presented study excludes changes at the impact modelling level the attribution of emerging simulation differences to specific changes at the rcm or gcm level could be investigated in detail if the same rcm were driven by different generations of the same gcm or inversely the same gcm would drive different generations of the same rcm however no such combination is available from the simulation matrices of ensembles and cordex see table 1 the gcms driving cordex rcms are mostly others than the driving gcms in ensembles and the few gcm types included in both regional modelling initiatives have been developed in many aspects from the previous cmip3 generation to the current cmip5 generation knutti et al 2013 the same is true for the development of rcms included in ensembles and cordex which includes changes in coding parameterization and general physical process representation many related to the increase in spatial resolution e g christensen et al 2007 samuelsson et al 2015 possible effects of the changes at the gcm level can be inferred from general comparison studies of cmip3 and cmip5 simulations of historical climate e g kumar et al 2014 koutroulis et al 2016 and future projections e g knutti and sedlacek 2013 woldemeskel et al 2016 evidence for specific influences of changes at the rcm level is found in climatological research comparing ensembles and cordex data kotlarski et al 2014 smiatek et al 2016 and comparing different resolution cordex simulations torma et al 2015 prein et al 2016 relevant aspects of the mentioned studies for the gcm and rcm levels are discussed in the next two chapters 6 2 historical climate in high resolution cordex rcms as discussed in section 4 3 one expected result of increased horizontal resolution of rcms as achieved in the development from ensembles 25 km resolution to cordex eur 11 12 5 km resolution is an improved representation of the historical climate in the climate model simulations especially over complex terrain as in the alpine upper danube basin for monthly temperature however the rcm performance did not improve but rather deteriorate and almost all cordex models exhibit a cold bias the notable cold bias of cordex eur 11 simulations was also shown by kotlarski et al 2014 and smiatek et al 2016 for their larger alpine domains and by romanowicz et al 2016 for poland smiatek et al 2016 argue that the cold bias is not related to the driving gcms but rather with the rcms as reanalysis driven cordex simulations lead to a comparable bias range and that the higher spatial resolution might play a role this could also be inferred from the fact that both ensembles and cordex data sets show increasing cold bias at higher elevations as higher spatial resolution also leads to better topographic representation of the high alpine ridges and therefore higher elevations in the rcm grid cells kotlarski et al 2014 however show that only for some individual rcms by smhi and knmi high resolution eur 11 simulations are colder than the coarse eur 44 simulations and that there is no general systematic decrease of simulated temperature with increased horizontal resolution for precipitation which for the upper danube model domain is represented slightly better in some cordex eur 11 simulations of historical climate than in ensembles simulations several authors describe an increase in simulated rcm precipitation with increasing resolution rauscher et al 2010 van roosmalen et al 2010 kotlarski et al 2014 torma et al 2015 prein et al 2016 prein et al 2016 also relate the higher precipitation along the north western fringe of the alps due to orographic effects induced by a better representation of topography in cordex eur 11 rcms with reduced precipitation bias on a local scale grid cell by grid cell similar improvements in the representation of precipitation characteristics in the alps due to better topographical forcing related to higher precipitation in models with higher resolution on different spatial scales of analysis were reported by torma et al 2015 for an ensemble of euro cordex and med cordex models kotlarski et al 2014 on the other hand also show higher precipitation in the cordex eur 11 than in the eur 44 simulations but relate the higher precipitation with higher precipitation bias higher overestimation in the eur 11 simulations for regional averages clearly detection of added value of increased horizontal resolution for the simulation of historical climate depends on the spatial and temporal scales of the analysis and also on the applied observational data set this is also apparent from diverging results on the development of representation of historical climate in gcms by kumar et al 2014 and koutroulis et al 2016 but the general pattern of moderate improvement in the simulation of precipitation from cmip3 to cmip5 and no relevant improvement in the representation of temperature is shown for europe already at the gcm level for the spatial and temporal scales of the upper danube hydrological model we observed a small improvement in the representation of precipitation by the cordex rcms at the same time air temperature representation deteriorated compared to ensembles therefore we see no overall improvement in the reproduction of observed climate in cordex eur 11 simulations in comparison to ensembles thus agreeing with the conclusions of kotlarski et al 2014 smiatek et al 2016 the fact however that the small advances in the simulation of precipitation can be related to the increase in model resolution suggests possible further progress along this line of climate research in the future 6 3 future projections and projection uncertainty the most notable difference between the cordex and ensembles projections for the 21st century is the higher precipitation and resulting higher discharge in the cordex eur 11 rcms while differences between cordex and ensembles projections can result from general climate model development ylhäisi et al 2015 and also from the differences in underlying concentration pathways between sres and rcp scenarios there is indication that the higher precipitation projections can also be related to the higher spatial model resolution torma et al 2015 show that projected precipitation for the end of the 21st century over the central alpine mountains is higher in the cordex eur 11 rcms than in eur 44 especially in summer as in our comparison with ensembles fischer et al 2015 for ensembles and giorgi et al 2016 for cordex attribute higher precipitation projections over high alpine elevations in summer in rcms as compared to gcms to increased convective rainfall and giorgi et al 2016 find confirmation for the projected changes in this mechanism in convection resolving simulations and in consistency with some observed trends these results suggest that the higher precipitation projections in the high resolution cordex eur 11 data as compared to ensembles data stem from a better process representation indicating improved climate projections for impact research in the alpine domain however the applied rcms of cordex and ensembles are so called ensembles of opportunity assembled based on many un scientific factors funding computational resources dissemination to impact research etc as tebaldi and knutti 2007 point out the distribution of climate models therefore changes from one ensemble to the subsequent leading to changes in the results even if the knowledge of the climate system had not changed changes in the climate model distribution affect the derived ensemble medians and the range of included model projections this can also be one of the reasons for the unreduced uncertainty range of cordex precipitation and discharge projections as compared to ensembles the range of temperature projections for each single rcp scenario is actually smaller than the range in ensembles sres a1b projections for the driving gcms a limited reduction in the projection uncertainty from cmip3 to cmip5 was achieved for precipitation but not for temperature woldemeskel et al 2016 a reduction of the range of uncertainty in climate projections can be regarded as another important and theoretically achievable objective of climate model development hawkins and sutton 2009 that has not yet been achieved for the presented impact modelling application for the upper danube river knutti and sedlacek 2013 do not expect the spread in climate model projections to decrease in the near future but emphasize that the confidence in climate simulations can still grow if more of the relevant processes are captured as described above for convective precipitation over the alpine parts in the upper danube basin 6 4 implications for impact research and water management from the point of view of hydrological impact research the above discussed aspects are important to consider but they require further research in climate modelling the two main questions for hydrology and water management are if the results of the analyses of development from ensembles to cordex 1 indicate a preference for applying one of the two climate data sets in present impact research and 2 imply the need for further impact research with future generations of climate models despite the shortcomings in achieving better representation of historical climate we advocate the use of the more recent cordex climate data for current impact research for europe the cordex initiative accomplished important improvements in the dissemination of standardized data products which facilitates the widespread use of the data and will contribute to making cordex scenarios a general reference in the coming years as cordex rcms are driven by cmip5 gcms and projections are based on the latest rcp emission scenarios results are comparable with current gcm based studies moreover there are indications that precipitation processes are represented better in cordex simulations as discussed above leading to higher confidence in related cordex projections regarding future generations of climate models there is some controversy within the climate research community if models with ever increased horizontal resolution for ultimately seamless weather and climate prediction systems should be aspired or not and under which institutional arrangements e g shukla et al 2009 held 2014 katzav and parker 2015 at the same time new generations of climate model results are being produced e g in the primavera project and the highresmip initiative that aim at high resolution gcms haarsma et al 2016 and new data will become constantly available to the impact community improvement in process representation and thus confidence in projected scenarios can be expected from these initiatives furthermore as human greenhouse gas emissions will change in the future for better or for worse projections of climate change will change as well independent of progress in climate science further advances in the smooth transfer of data and knowledge from climate modelling to impact modelling can be expected from initiatives that include the needs of climate data users in the conception of climate data production such as the ongoing projects copernicus climate change service c3s raoult et al 2017 and primavera palin et al 2017 and will continue to make updates of impact studies more efficient therefore hydrological scenarios should be updated regularly ideally keeping the hydrological framework unchanged as in the study presented here the confirmation of the general pattern of future changes in discharge characteristics however clearly implies that more detailed or less uncertain information on climate impact in the upper danube basin is no prerequisite for the preparation of tangible adaptation pathways uncertainty in climate and climate impact prediction cannot be reduced beyond a certain level despite all efforts in research so that robust adaptation strategies need to be established that promise success for a range of alternative futures dessai et al 2009 as for climate change mitigation wait and see or predict with higher accuracy then act is no option for adaptation in water management as many adaptation measures have long term planning horizons and might not be implemented quickly enough if their preparation starts in a future with better knowledge on climate change impact knutti and rogelji 2015 for the upper danube the main patterns of changes in the discharge regime that can be expected in a warming climate and the related uncertainties are clear as confirmed again by the present study and water management can act accordingly 7 conclusions a large ensemble of latest generation rcm data from the cordex initiative with a horizontal spatial resolution of 12 5 km and based on rcp greenhouse gas emission scenarios was applied in a hydrological impact study of the upper danube basin upstream of vienna the hydrological modelling set up and the downscaling and bias correction of climate model data was replicated from a previous assessment applying a large ensemble of ensembles rcm data with a resolution of 25 km and based on the sres a1b emission scenario maintaining the identical data processing and impact modelling framework allowed systematic analyses of the development of climate change scenarios from one generation of rcms to the next the overall representation of historical climatic features in cordex data shows no relevant improvement compared with ensembles despite the increase in spatial model resolution for the analysed region and spatio temporal scales in several cordex rcms precipitation bias is lower than in ensembles rcms with remaining deficits in the representation of rainfall seasonality temperature representation has deteriorated compared to ensembles in some cordex simulations with a shift towards a generally prevailing cold bias in the cordex ensemble the range of projections of temperature increase in cordex data under rcp emission scenarios is very similar to the range projected by the ensembles rcms under sres a1b emission scenarios with rcp4 5 scenarios in the lower and rcp8 5 scenarios in the upper part of the range the range of precipitation change projections in cordex data is also similar to the range projected by the ensembles rcms but with a stronger tendency towards precipitation increase the higher precipitation in cordex projections might result from better process representation related to higher horizontal rcm resolution suggesting higher confidence in the new climate scenarios due to higher precipitation projections the expected decrease in future mean annual discharge of the danube at vienna is considerably lower with cordex data 3 3 in the median of all analysed scenarios for the period of 2071 2100 than with ensembles data 12 typical patterns of change in discharge seasonality connected with a warming climate that were already identified in previous studies increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge are confirmed again with the new cordex data the analysed specific differences between the results with two consecutive generations of climate model simulations show that regular updates of hydrological impact modelling are productive and should be continued with climate data provided by future climate research initiatives rigorous replication of the hydrological modelling framework as described in the presented study enables detailed analyses of the development of climate change scenarios the general confirmation of expected future tendencies in the discharge regime shows the need for timely formulation of adaptation strategies for water management in the upper danube basin 8 declaration of

7190,regional climate models rcms generate past and future climate simulations that serve as input for subsequent modelling of impact projections the most recent coordinated regional climate modelling initiative cordex provides rcm data for europe with increased spatial resolution 12 5 km for the cordex eur 11 ensemble and based on the new representative concentration pathways rcps rcm data from the previous initiative ensembles had a spatial resolution of 25 km and was based on the sres emission scenarios in this contribution we explore the development from ensembles to cordex in a hydrological impact study for the upper danube focussing on the representation of past climate and projections of the future for climate and resulting river discharge we replicated a hydrological modelling framework including rcm downscaling and bias correction that used data of 21 ensembles rcms under sres a1b emission scenario kling et al 2012 and now applied cordex eur 11 data of 32 rcm simulations under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios results with cordex show a small improvement in the representation of historical precipitation but a decline in the accuracy of historical temperature simulations despite the increase in spatial model resolution the tendency of ensembles climate projections is reproduced with the cordex rcms albeit with slightly higher precipitation in the cordex data yielding a less pronounced reduction in future mean annual discharge for the upper danube at vienna the previously identified change in discharge seasonality increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge is confirmed with the new cordex data updating climate impact simulations in the presented rigorous replication framework allows analysing specific new information in the latest generation climate model data as well as crystallizing essential expectable patterns of change that need to be addressed in adaptation strategies keywords climate change impact cordex ensembles danube 1 introduction the danube river is the second largest and second longest european river crossing 10 countries and draining areas that belong to 19 countries in the historically turbulent and culturally diverse central and southeast european regions the danube is an important inland waterway and provides enormous economic value for diverse sectors as hydropower water supply irrigation and tourism its water and the large variety of habitats along its course sustain an immense ecological diversity the upper danube basin with its mainly alpine catchment area is a water tower for the entire danube providing around 30 of its discharge at the mouth at the black sea from around 13 of the catchment area and seasonally contributing to higher flows through the drier summers in southeast europe for a concise overview of general facts and figures on the danube basin refer to icpdr 2011 comprehensive elaborations on hydrological processes and water management in the danube basin are provided by icpdr 2005 and brilly 2010 due to this manifold importance of the danube river possible changes in its discharge regime triggered by global climate change have been subject of hydrological climate change impact research for many years with several studies focussing on the snow dominated upper danube catchment with its high sensitivity to warming climate impact studies based on global hydrological models and projections from global climate models gcms by arnell 1999 lehner et al 2006 nohara et al 2006 and sperna weiland et al 2012 presented results for the danube gcm data were also applied in a water balance analysis for the danube basin by lucarini et al 2008 and used for stochastic climate generation as input for hydrological modelling by mauser and bach 2009 acknowledging the need of climate simulations at higher spatial resolution than available from gcms for relevant hydrological impact research following studies applied climate data of one or several regional climate models rcms from subsequent model generations hagemann and jacob 2007 stanzel and nachtnebel 2010 prasch et al 2011 koch et al 2011 blöschl et al 2011 wagner et al 2017 applying large ensembles of rcm data kling et al 2012 and stagl and hattermann 2015 also investigated the uncertainty in climate impact scenarios due to the range of potential climate model projections the continuous elaboration of hydrological climate change impact scenarios for the danube river has been stimulated by advances in regional climate modelling updated climate simulations for europe from subsequent rcm generations have been triggered by and coordinated in three large initiatives prudence christensen and christensen 2007 ensembles hewitt and griggs 2004 and cordex giorgi et al 2009 one main development was the ongoing increase in horizontal model resolution from 50 km in prudence to 25 km in ensembles to 12 5 km in the latest generation high resolution rcm simulations of the cordex eur 11 ensemble jacob et al 2014 this paper describes the first application of cordex eur 11 climate data the most advanced rcm ensemble available for europe to update the climate change projections for the upper danube basin the progress in climate modelling from one generation of climate models to the next is regularly investigated e g knutti and sedlacek 2013 ylhäisi et al 2015 for gcms deque et al 2012 kotlarski et al 2014 smiatek et al 2016 for rcms a singular long term chronology of the development of climate projections was presented by whetton et al 2016 for australia different results of hydrological impact based on different assessment methods and generations of climate model data were compiled in review articles e g roudier et al 2014 for west africa di baldassarre et al 2011 for the nile basin but without a focus on the development of knowledge over time the presented study attempts for the first time to our knowledge a detailed exploration of the development of hydrological impact scenarios resulting from the evolution of climate simulations from one generation of climate models to the next in a rigorous replication experiment we applied exactly the same methodology in climate data processing and hydrological modelling as described in kling et al 2012 replacing the data of 21 rcms of the ensembles initiative with simulations of 16 rcms of the cordex initiative development from ensembles to cordex can be expected due to increased spatial resolution from 25 km in ensembles to 12 5 km in the applied cordex eur 11 simulations due to changes in the assumed greenhouse gas emission scenarios from the sres a1b scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 in the applied ensembles data to representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 in the cordex scenarios and due to general climate model development ylhäisi et al 2015 the objectives of this study are 1 to derive updated climate impact scenarios for the upper danube river based on the latest generation of high resolution rcms from the cordex initiative for europe and 2 to investigate the differences compared with previous results with ensembles data the development from ensembles to cordex is analysed with respect to representation of past climate in the upper danube basin focusing on temperature and precipitation as the main drivers of hydrological impact projections for future climate the related impacts on danube river discharge at vienna and at selected tributaries the structure of this paper generally follows the structure of the original ensembles article by kling et al 2012 without repeating details of unchanged methods data and results section 2 outlines the study area section 3 describes the applied climate model data section 4 shortly recapitulates the methods of modelling and analyses section 5 presents the results with the new cordex data and shows comparisons with ensembles results section 6 provides a discussion of the main findings of research questions remaining open and of implications for water management section 7 gives a concise summary of the presented study and proposes some main conclusions 2 study area this study focuses on the danube river at vienna which has an upstream catchment area of 101810 km2 fig 1 the observed mean annual discharge in the period 1961 1990 was 1923 m3 s there is a strong seasonality in discharge due to accumulation and melting of snow in the alpine southern parts of the basin annual precipitation is higher in the alpine parts than in the pre alpine and lowland areas in the northern and eastern parts of the basin precipitation in summer is larger than in winter the basin averaged annual precipitation amounts to approximately 1100 mm which is roughly split equally into runoff and actual evapotranspiration more details about the study area and the water balance of the basin are given in kling et al 2012 specific results are also presented for three smaller tributary catchments that represent different regions and hydrological regimes within the basin the upper inn at kajetansbrücke 2157 km2 in the highest alpine region in switzerland the lowland naab at heitzenhofen 5415 km2 in germany and the traun at wels 3505 km2 located in the austrian lower alps and alpine foothills 3 climate model data the climate model data used for the new analyses presented here are the recent results of the global cordex initiative giorgi et al 2009 for europe euro cordex jacob et al 2014 as available via the data portals of the earth system grid federation esgf in september 2016 euro cordex rcm simulations are provided with a spatial resolution of 50 km corresponding to 0 44 therefore called eur 44 and with a higher spatial resolution of 12 5 km 0 11 therefore called eur 11 for this study only eur 11 cordex simulations were applied listed in the upper part of table 1 as they provide an increased spatial resolution compared with the ensembles data the 21 applied ensembles climate model simulations listed in the lower part of table 1 have a spatial resolution of 25 km for more details on the used ensembles data refer to kling et al 2012 in addition to rcm resolution different greenhouse gas emission scenarios are a major difference between the climate simulations of ensembles and cordex models while the analysed ensembles projections are based on the sres a1b scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 the cordex projections are based on the new representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 with the driving global climate models gcms being part of the cmip5 experiment taylor et al 2012 only cordex rcm data with scenario runs available for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used in the presented analysis the two other of the four rcp scenarios 2 6 and 6 0 are not available for as many cordex simulations as they are not defined as part of the core set of runs in cmip5 the applied 16 cordex rcms with 32 scenario runs as provided for both rcps are the result of a simulation matrix with seven different regional models driven by five different gcms see table 1 rcp4 5 can be regarded as a medium emission scenario and rcp8 5 as a high emission scenario the names of the rcps relate to the radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century a measure of overall change in the earth s energy balance due to external perturbation cubasch et al 2013 rcp8 5 shows a constant rise of radiative forcing in the 21st century to around 8 5 w m2 in 2100 stabilizing only after the year 2200 rcp4 5 stabilizes at around 4 5 w m2 after 2100 with the stabilization process starting around 2070 reaching a value of around 4 w m2 in 2100 radiative forcing of the sres a1b scenario follows a pathway that is roughly midway between the pathways of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios reaching around 6 w m2 in 2100 cubasch et al 2013 despite its name the radiative forcing pathway of rcp6 0 is markedly below the pathway of sres a1b as rcp6 0 stabilizes at 6 w m2 after 2100 and reaches only around 5 3 w m2 in 2100 4 methods 4 1 hydrological modelling framework the hydrological model is described in detail by kling et al 2012 the exact same model is re used in the current study in this section we only give a short summary of the main features of the hydrological modelling framework of kling et al including model structure historical input data calibration approach evaluation approach the applied precipitation runoff model cosero kling et al 2015 uses a simple conceptual model structure which is similar to the well known hbv model bergström 1995 for the application of the cosero model in monthly time steps internal temporal discretization schemes are applied a semi distributed spatial discretization is used the upper danube basin is split into 16 sub basins and further into overall 61 hydrological response units hrus according to elevation bands for each hru the model determines rainfall and snowfall from precipitation and air temperature data snowmelt is simulated with a temperature index approach actual evapotranspiration is determined from soil moisture and potential evapotranspiration runoff generation due to rainfall and melt water is split into a fast component surface flow plus interflow and base flow a simple glacier module is used to simulate the mass balance of major glaciers in the highest parts of the basin furthermore 14 large reservoirs and their basic operation rules are included in the model see fig 1 routing of flow in the river is not considered for monthly time step modelling in the upper danube basin the historical data used for setting up the hydrological model included precipitation data of histalp auer et al 2007 a map showing the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation kling et al 2005 petrovic et al 2006 air temperature data of histalp stations regionalized to hru values by use of linear regression with elevation as well as potential evapotranspiration computed with the turc 1961 method observed discharge data were collected at 16 gauges to enable calibration and evaluation of the model calibration focussed on six key model parameters controlling snow melt soil moisture storage runoff generation and base flow recession automatic parameter optimization was performed with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1992 using a slightly modified version of the kge statistic gupta el al 2009 modified by kling et al 2012 as objective function to minimize the difference between simulated and observed discharge time series at 16 gauges in the period 1961 1990 kling et al 2012 present a detailed evaluation of the hydrological model in independent evaluation periods 1901 1930 1931 1960 and 1991 2007 for various measures of model performance computed at key gauges additional evaluation presents plots of simulated and observed seasonality in discharge for the calibration period and the ten warmest years on record most of them occurred after 1990 as well as the simulated and observed monthly flow duration curve in conclusion the high agreement between the simulated discharge and historical observations over the last 100 years yields a high confidence that the model is suitable for climate change impact assessment in the upper danube basin 4 2 downscaling and bias correction of rcm data for downscaling and bias correction of the cordex rcm data we present results with the well known delta change method see e g hay et al 2000 the same approach was used by kling et al 2012 for ensembles data and therefore the results are directly comparable see kling et al for details about the spatio temporal application of the bias correction in each month and each hru historical observations of precipitation and air temperature of the period 1961 1990 which were also applied for the historical calibration of the hydrological model see chapter 4 1 were used as a reference for the bias correction in addition we also applied four other methods of bias correction with ensembles data including linear scaling quantile mapping a de trended version of quantile mapping and moment scaling adjusting the first and second moments of the rcm data however apart from some minor peculiarities when applying e g quantile mapping the overall results for projected future discharge of the danube river at vienna are very similar to the results obtained with the delta change method therefore the results with the four additional methods are not reported in this paper 4 3 evaluation of historical rcm simulations increased spatial resolution of rcm simulations with the objective of increased representation of regional climate characteristics has been formulated as one major direction of research in regional climate modelling leung et al 2003 2006 consequently it was one of the focuses of the large european regional climate modelling initiatives of the past decades with rcm resolution increasing from 50 km in prudence christensen and christensen 2007 to 25 km in ensembles hewitt and griggs 2004 to 12 5 km in euro cordex jacob et al 2014 increasing performance of historical climate simulations with increasing spatial resolution can be expected due to a better description of orography and land sea contrast and the potential of better representation of physical and dynamical processes christensen and christensen 2007 the extent to which such an improvement is successfully achieved is shown to vary considerably depending on the geographical region the investigated variables and the spatial and temporal scales of the respective study e g wang et al 2004 hohenegger et al 2008 rauscher et al 2010 van roosmalen et al 2010 kotlarski et al 2014 prein et al 2016 in our comparative evaluation of the performance of ensembles and cordex rcms in simulating historical climate features of the upper danube basin we qualitatively analysed the overall mean and seasonal biases in temperature and precipitation in the entire basin and calculated for both variables quantitative performance measures of the reproduction of spatio temporal patterns of mean and inter annual variability the evaluation period was 1961 1990 for the rcms that do not cover the years before 1970 the period of 1971 1990 was used as alternative reference period which is not referred to explicitly in the remainder of this article the equations for the quantitative performance measures which are based on a similar approach by sennikovs and bethers 2009 are described in detail in kling et al 2012 four sub components of model performance smp refer to the representation of mean temperature mt and precipitation mp and the inter annual variability of temperature vt and precipitation vp for each rcm each sub component of model performance was calculated from the root mean square error rmse of one of these four variables over all 61 spatial units of the hydrological model and all 12 months of the year normalized by the median rmse of all rcms one aggregate measure of model performance mp is determined by averaging the values of the four sub components for each sub component smp as well as for the aggregate mp values smaller than one show that an individual rcm performs better than the median of all rcms and values larger than one indicate the opposite 5 results 5 1 representation of historical climate for a straightforward qualitative evaluation of rcm simulations of temperature and precipitation long term mean values for the entire upper danube basin upstream of vienna are compared with observations fig 2 left ensembles rcms right cordex rcms visual comparison of mean monthly precipitation for the period of 1961 1990 upper panel in fig 2 shows that the cordex ensemble does not include rcms with inverse rainfall seasonality anymore lowest instead of highest values in summer as it was the case with some ensembles rcms contrariwise there is one cordex rcm clmcom mpi with an overestimation of summer rainfall in the basin mean that is markedly higher than in any of the ensembles rcms generally representation of seasonal precipitation has improved only marginally and still exhibits significant errors the long term mean precipitation bias over the entire basin ranges from 13 to 33 in the ensembles data with a median value of 8 3 for cordex data the median of overall precipitation biases is 9 5 with a range from 5 to 43 the maximum value resulting again from clmcom mpi the steady increase in observed mean temperature in the historical period is captured well by all climate models lower panel in fig 2 while the bias in long term mean basin temperature for 1961 1990 in the ensembles models ranges from 2 5 c to 2 9 c with a median value of 0 1 c the cordex rcms almost only exhibit underestimation of temperature the deviations from observed mean values range from 3 2 c to 0 5 c with a median cordex value of 1 1 c representation of the seasonal distribution of temperature is generally good in all rcms as already shown for the ensembles data by kling et al 2012 the quantitative evaluation of spatio temporal patterns of mean precipitation and temperature and their inter annual variability in the rcm simulations enable a ranking of the analysed climate models according to their ability to reproduce historical climate in the upper danube basin fig 3 shows the computed model performance with the best to worst performing rcms sorted from left to right for the aggregate measure of model performance mp fig 3 top also listed in table 1 the cordex models filled bars show no relevant improvement as compared to the ensembles models dashed bars cordex rcms are found both among the best and among the worst performing models a separate presentation of the sub component of mean precipitation mp fig 3 middle reveals that many cordex rcms do show a better representation of spatio temporal patterns of monthly precipitation as the best five models in the combined ensemble are cordex models however cordex rcms exhibit a lower performance with respect to mean temperature mt fig 3 bottom with seven of the ten worst models in the combined ensemble as also apparent in the predominant cold bias shown in fig 2 overall the evaluation results for the upper danube basin show no general improvement in the accuracy of representing monthly historical climatic features in cordex data as compared with ensembles despite the increase in spatial model resolution 5 2 climate change projections the projected increase in temperature in the cordex scenarios for the upper danube basin is closely related to the emission scenario fig 4 top rcp4 5 scenarios show lower increases ranging from 2 c to 3 5 c in the basin average until the end of the 21st century projections under rcp8 5 are markedly higher with changes until the end of the century in the range of 3 5 c to 6 2 c interestingly the entire range of temperature change projections of both cordex rcp scenarios is very similar to the range of ensembles projections even though they are based on only one medium sres emission scenario the differences between the two cordex emission scenarios become apparent only after 2050 the median temperature change signal of the period 2021 2050 as compared with 1961 1990 is almost equal for rcp4 5 1 4 c table 2 and for rcp8 5 1 5 c and also for the ensembles median 1 5 c for the period 2071 2100 the ensembles median temperature increase of 3 2 c is midway between the two cordex scenarios of rcp4 5 2 3 c and rcp8 5 4 1 c for different seasons of the year the relations between the cordex projections with different rcps and the ensembles projections are similar to the relations in these annual changes table 2 in the cordex precipitation projections fig 4 bottom no clear difference between the different emission scenarios is found after the middle of the 21st century almost all cordex projections show an increase in precipitation compared to 1961 1990 with values of some models ranging over 20 these projected cordex precipitation increases are higher than the highest projected changes in the ensembles data the ensembles projections also include results with considerably decreasing precipitation so that in general the range of future precipitation with ensembles data is below the cordex range the higher precipitation in cordex data as compared with ensembles is more pronounced towards the end of the century in the period 2071 2100 seasonally cordex precipitation projections are higher than ensembles results in winter and spring for the period of 2021 2050 and in winter and summer for the period of 2071 2100 table 2 this shift towards higher precipitation projections from ensembles to cordex is also clearly visible when change signals of 30 year means of temperature and precipitation are plotted against each other fig 5 especially for the far future period of 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 the gcm grouping in fig 5 also confirms for cordex data the finding by kling et al 2012 for ensembles data that the level of projected temperature change can be related to the driving gcm while precipitation projections vary considerably between rcm simulations with the same driving gcm 5 3 discharge projections scenario simulations driven by climate projections from the cordex ensemble show a clear pattern of change in seasonality of future discharge at vienna albeit with a large range of results with single ensemble members fig 6 winter discharge increases the seasonal discharge peak in spring occurs earlier and summer discharge decreases these elements of change in future seasonal discharge are shown by all or almost all individual projections to different extents with all three effects being more pronounced in a more distant future 2071 2100 than in an earlier period 2021 2050 these findings with the most recent climate modelling data of the cordex initiative generally confirm projected patterns of changes in discharge seasonality found in previous studies both on already observed trends fürst et al 2007 pekarova et al 2008 and on future projections e g stanzel and nachtnebel 2010 koch et al 2011 prasch et al 2011 kling et al 2012 stagl and hattermann 2015 wagner et al 2017 results with ensembles rcms shown as orange shading in fig 6 do not only show a very similar seasonal pattern of change but also exhibit a comparable range of projections despite the differences in assumed greenhouse gas emission scenarios the corresponding distributions of projection results with ensembles and cordex data are even clearer in a comparison of ensemble median values fig 7 and table 2 differences between ensembles and cordex results are discernible for spring and to a lesser extent for winter for the period of 2021 2050 and for winter and summer for the period of 2071 2100 these differences can directly be related to higher precipitation projections for these seasons in the respective periods in the cordex data see section 5 2 and table 2 for the summer season in the far future period 2071 2100 the additional effect of rising temperatures becomes evident rcp8 5 projections of lower precipitation and higher temperature lead to markedly lower discharge than in the rcp4 5 scenario with a median almost as low as in the ensembles results that are related to even lower summer precipitation in the annual mean smaller changes in discharge are projected by the cordex scenarios than by the ensembles scenarios table 2 for the period of 2021 2050 cordex results show almost no change with a median decrease of less than 2 for rcp4 5 scenarios and a median increase below 2 for rcp8 5 scenarios compared to a median decrease of almost 4 for the ensembles scenarios for 2071 2100 cordex projections show decreasing mean annual discharge of 1 4 in the median of rcp4 5 scenarios and 5 1 in the rcp8 5 scenarios both markedly lower than the median decrease in ensembles projections of 12 for the end of the 21st century an analysis of the impact on more extreme hydrological conditions is presented in table 3 specifying changes in low flow values related to an exceedance probability of 90 denominated q90 in table 3 and high flow values related to an exceedance probability of 10 denominated q10 note that all values refer to monthly mean discharges representing low and high flow periods rather than extreme events projections based on ensembles data generally show a decrease in both high flow and low flow values over a large range of model simulations only for q90 and the near future in 2021 2050 the upper quartile value shows a small increase in the cordex projections high flow also tends to decrease with only the upper quartile of the rcm ensemble for q10 showing small increases median q10 decreases are lower than in the ensembles projections which is mainly a result of the higher precipitation in cordex projections for the far future period 2071 2100 the stronger decrease of q10 in the rcp8 5 projections shows combined effects of precipitation and temperature the shift to earlier high flow months from early summer to late spring and the generally lower discharge in the high flow months is related to increasing spring and decreasing summer precipitation in the rcp8 5 simulations and to earlier snow melt and higher evaporation due to a stronger temperature increase than in rcp4 5 in the cordex model median low flow does not change considerably in contrast to the significant decrease in ensembles q90 results for 2071 2100 the generally higher q90 in the cordex projections than with ensembles data results from higher summer precipitation leading to higher discharge levels in autumn the future principal low flow period currently low flow occurs mainly during late autumn and winter but shifts to earlier months due to increasing winter discharge in the future projections compared with rcp4 5 the rcp8 5 scenarios for the far future show more pronounced decreases in low flow discharge due to lower summer precipitation and higher summer temperature the typical change pattern of increasing discharge in winter and decreasing discharge in summer is apparent also in smaller tributary catchments with very distinct hydrological regimes albeit with different magnitudes fig 8 shows projected changes only for the period 2071 2100 with clearer impacts for the upper inn in the highest alpine region the lowland naab and the traun located in the lower alps and alpine foothills see fig 1 seasonal changes are more pronounced in the upper inn and traun catchments with important snow processes in these catchments and particularly for the high alpine upper inn also the differences between the cooler rcp4 5 scenarios and the warmer rcp8 5 scenarios are more distinct with markedly higher winter discharge and lower summer discharge in rcp8 5 in the lowland naab catchment the projected changes are generally less pronounced but here the cordex results show reduced uncertainty compared with ensembles while the ensembles range includes models projecting considerable decreases in winter discharge no such projections are included in the cordex ensemble which can be attributed to higher precipitation projections in the cordex climate model data 6 discussion 6 1 sources of change between scenario generations the presented results show in general a high consistency between the results with the most recent high resolution rcm simulations of the cordex initiative and the results based on the previous generation of rcms of the ensembles initiative but also reveal some specific differences differences in the results of successive climate impact assessments can generally be expected due to development in all three elements of the impact modelling chain at the gcm level at the rcm level and at the impact model level comparison between results can further be complicated by changes in the reference periods or the investigated future periods by exactly replicating a previous hydrological modelling framework including downscaling and bias correction methods and periods of analysis the presented study excludes changes at the impact modelling level the attribution of emerging simulation differences to specific changes at the rcm or gcm level could be investigated in detail if the same rcm were driven by different generations of the same gcm or inversely the same gcm would drive different generations of the same rcm however no such combination is available from the simulation matrices of ensembles and cordex see table 1 the gcms driving cordex rcms are mostly others than the driving gcms in ensembles and the few gcm types included in both regional modelling initiatives have been developed in many aspects from the previous cmip3 generation to the current cmip5 generation knutti et al 2013 the same is true for the development of rcms included in ensembles and cordex which includes changes in coding parameterization and general physical process representation many related to the increase in spatial resolution e g christensen et al 2007 samuelsson et al 2015 possible effects of the changes at the gcm level can be inferred from general comparison studies of cmip3 and cmip5 simulations of historical climate e g kumar et al 2014 koutroulis et al 2016 and future projections e g knutti and sedlacek 2013 woldemeskel et al 2016 evidence for specific influences of changes at the rcm level is found in climatological research comparing ensembles and cordex data kotlarski et al 2014 smiatek et al 2016 and comparing different resolution cordex simulations torma et al 2015 prein et al 2016 relevant aspects of the mentioned studies for the gcm and rcm levels are discussed in the next two chapters 6 2 historical climate in high resolution cordex rcms as discussed in section 4 3 one expected result of increased horizontal resolution of rcms as achieved in the development from ensembles 25 km resolution to cordex eur 11 12 5 km resolution is an improved representation of the historical climate in the climate model simulations especially over complex terrain as in the alpine upper danube basin for monthly temperature however the rcm performance did not improve but rather deteriorate and almost all cordex models exhibit a cold bias the notable cold bias of cordex eur 11 simulations was also shown by kotlarski et al 2014 and smiatek et al 2016 for their larger alpine domains and by romanowicz et al 2016 for poland smiatek et al 2016 argue that the cold bias is not related to the driving gcms but rather with the rcms as reanalysis driven cordex simulations lead to a comparable bias range and that the higher spatial resolution might play a role this could also be inferred from the fact that both ensembles and cordex data sets show increasing cold bias at higher elevations as higher spatial resolution also leads to better topographic representation of the high alpine ridges and therefore higher elevations in the rcm grid cells kotlarski et al 2014 however show that only for some individual rcms by smhi and knmi high resolution eur 11 simulations are colder than the coarse eur 44 simulations and that there is no general systematic decrease of simulated temperature with increased horizontal resolution for precipitation which for the upper danube model domain is represented slightly better in some cordex eur 11 simulations of historical climate than in ensembles simulations several authors describe an increase in simulated rcm precipitation with increasing resolution rauscher et al 2010 van roosmalen et al 2010 kotlarski et al 2014 torma et al 2015 prein et al 2016 prein et al 2016 also relate the higher precipitation along the north western fringe of the alps due to orographic effects induced by a better representation of topography in cordex eur 11 rcms with reduced precipitation bias on a local scale grid cell by grid cell similar improvements in the representation of precipitation characteristics in the alps due to better topographical forcing related to higher precipitation in models with higher resolution on different spatial scales of analysis were reported by torma et al 2015 for an ensemble of euro cordex and med cordex models kotlarski et al 2014 on the other hand also show higher precipitation in the cordex eur 11 than in the eur 44 simulations but relate the higher precipitation with higher precipitation bias higher overestimation in the eur 11 simulations for regional averages clearly detection of added value of increased horizontal resolution for the simulation of historical climate depends on the spatial and temporal scales of the analysis and also on the applied observational data set this is also apparent from diverging results on the development of representation of historical climate in gcms by kumar et al 2014 and koutroulis et al 2016 but the general pattern of moderate improvement in the simulation of precipitation from cmip3 to cmip5 and no relevant improvement in the representation of temperature is shown for europe already at the gcm level for the spatial and temporal scales of the upper danube hydrological model we observed a small improvement in the representation of precipitation by the cordex rcms at the same time air temperature representation deteriorated compared to ensembles therefore we see no overall improvement in the reproduction of observed climate in cordex eur 11 simulations in comparison to ensembles thus agreeing with the conclusions of kotlarski et al 2014 smiatek et al 2016 the fact however that the small advances in the simulation of precipitation can be related to the increase in model resolution suggests possible further progress along this line of climate research in the future 6 3 future projections and projection uncertainty the most notable difference between the cordex and ensembles projections for the 21st century is the higher precipitation and resulting higher discharge in the cordex eur 11 rcms while differences between cordex and ensembles projections can result from general climate model development ylhäisi et al 2015 and also from the differences in underlying concentration pathways between sres and rcp scenarios there is indication that the higher precipitation projections can also be related to the higher spatial model resolution torma et al 2015 show that projected precipitation for the end of the 21st century over the central alpine mountains is higher in the cordex eur 11 rcms than in eur 44 especially in summer as in our comparison with ensembles fischer et al 2015 for ensembles and giorgi et al 2016 for cordex attribute higher precipitation projections over high alpine elevations in summer in rcms as compared to gcms to increased convective rainfall and giorgi et al 2016 find confirmation for the projected changes in this mechanism in convection resolving simulations and in consistency with some observed trends these results suggest that the higher precipitation projections in the high resolution cordex eur 11 data as compared to ensembles data stem from a better process representation indicating improved climate projections for impact research in the alpine domain however the applied rcms of cordex and ensembles are so called ensembles of opportunity assembled based on many un scientific factors funding computational resources dissemination to impact research etc as tebaldi and knutti 2007 point out the distribution of climate models therefore changes from one ensemble to the subsequent leading to changes in the results even if the knowledge of the climate system had not changed changes in the climate model distribution affect the derived ensemble medians and the range of included model projections this can also be one of the reasons for the unreduced uncertainty range of cordex precipitation and discharge projections as compared to ensembles the range of temperature projections for each single rcp scenario is actually smaller than the range in ensembles sres a1b projections for the driving gcms a limited reduction in the projection uncertainty from cmip3 to cmip5 was achieved for precipitation but not for temperature woldemeskel et al 2016 a reduction of the range of uncertainty in climate projections can be regarded as another important and theoretically achievable objective of climate model development hawkins and sutton 2009 that has not yet been achieved for the presented impact modelling application for the upper danube river knutti and sedlacek 2013 do not expect the spread in climate model projections to decrease in the near future but emphasize that the confidence in climate simulations can still grow if more of the relevant processes are captured as described above for convective precipitation over the alpine parts in the upper danube basin 6 4 implications for impact research and water management from the point of view of hydrological impact research the above discussed aspects are important to consider but they require further research in climate modelling the two main questions for hydrology and water management are if the results of the analyses of development from ensembles to cordex 1 indicate a preference for applying one of the two climate data sets in present impact research and 2 imply the need for further impact research with future generations of climate models despite the shortcomings in achieving better representation of historical climate we advocate the use of the more recent cordex climate data for current impact research for europe the cordex initiative accomplished important improvements in the dissemination of standardized data products which facilitates the widespread use of the data and will contribute to making cordex scenarios a general reference in the coming years as cordex rcms are driven by cmip5 gcms and projections are based on the latest rcp emission scenarios results are comparable with current gcm based studies moreover there are indications that precipitation processes are represented better in cordex simulations as discussed above leading to higher confidence in related cordex projections regarding future generations of climate models there is some controversy within the climate research community if models with ever increased horizontal resolution for ultimately seamless weather and climate prediction systems should be aspired or not and under which institutional arrangements e g shukla et al 2009 held 2014 katzav and parker 2015 at the same time new generations of climate model results are being produced e g in the primavera project and the highresmip initiative that aim at high resolution gcms haarsma et al 2016 and new data will become constantly available to the impact community improvement in process representation and thus confidence in projected scenarios can be expected from these initiatives furthermore as human greenhouse gas emissions will change in the future for better or for worse projections of climate change will change as well independent of progress in climate science further advances in the smooth transfer of data and knowledge from climate modelling to impact modelling can be expected from initiatives that include the needs of climate data users in the conception of climate data production such as the ongoing projects copernicus climate change service c3s raoult et al 2017 and primavera palin et al 2017 and will continue to make updates of impact studies more efficient therefore hydrological scenarios should be updated regularly ideally keeping the hydrological framework unchanged as in the study presented here the confirmation of the general pattern of future changes in discharge characteristics however clearly implies that more detailed or less uncertain information on climate impact in the upper danube basin is no prerequisite for the preparation of tangible adaptation pathways uncertainty in climate and climate impact prediction cannot be reduced beyond a certain level despite all efforts in research so that robust adaptation strategies need to be established that promise success for a range of alternative futures dessai et al 2009 as for climate change mitigation wait and see or predict with higher accuracy then act is no option for adaptation in water management as many adaptation measures have long term planning horizons and might not be implemented quickly enough if their preparation starts in a future with better knowledge on climate change impact knutti and rogelji 2015 for the upper danube the main patterns of changes in the discharge regime that can be expected in a warming climate and the related uncertainties are clear as confirmed again by the present study and water management can act accordingly 7 conclusions a large ensemble of latest generation rcm data from the cordex initiative with a horizontal spatial resolution of 12 5 km and based on rcp greenhouse gas emission scenarios was applied in a hydrological impact study of the upper danube basin upstream of vienna the hydrological modelling set up and the downscaling and bias correction of climate model data was replicated from a previous assessment applying a large ensemble of ensembles rcm data with a resolution of 25 km and based on the sres a1b emission scenario maintaining the identical data processing and impact modelling framework allowed systematic analyses of the development of climate change scenarios from one generation of rcms to the next the overall representation of historical climatic features in cordex data shows no relevant improvement compared with ensembles despite the increase in spatial model resolution for the analysed region and spatio temporal scales in several cordex rcms precipitation bias is lower than in ensembles rcms with remaining deficits in the representation of rainfall seasonality temperature representation has deteriorated compared to ensembles in some cordex simulations with a shift towards a generally prevailing cold bias in the cordex ensemble the range of projections of temperature increase in cordex data under rcp emission scenarios is very similar to the range projected by the ensembles rcms under sres a1b emission scenarios with rcp4 5 scenarios in the lower and rcp8 5 scenarios in the upper part of the range the range of precipitation change projections in cordex data is also similar to the range projected by the ensembles rcms but with a stronger tendency towards precipitation increase the higher precipitation in cordex projections might result from better process representation related to higher horizontal rcm resolution suggesting higher confidence in the new climate scenarios due to higher precipitation projections the expected decrease in future mean annual discharge of the danube at vienna is considerably lower with cordex data 3 3 in the median of all analysed scenarios for the period of 2071 2100 than with ensembles data 12 typical patterns of change in discharge seasonality connected with a warming climate that were already identified in previous studies increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge are confirmed again with the new cordex data the analysed specific differences between the results with two consecutive generations of climate model simulations show that regular updates of hydrological impact modelling are productive and should be continued with climate data provided by future climate research initiatives rigorous replication of the hydrological modelling framework as described in the presented study enables detailed analyses of the development of climate change scenarios the general confirmation of expected future tendencies in the discharge regime shows the need for timely formulation of adaptation strategies for water management in the upper danube basin 8 declaration of

7191,to improve microbial water quality and to prevent waterborne disease outbreaks knowledge on the fate and transport of contaminants and on the contributions from different faecal sources to the total contamination is essential the fate and transport of faecal indicators e coli and enterococci within the betna river in bangladesh were simulated using a coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model the hydrodynamic model for the river was set up calibrated and validated with water level and discharge in our earlier study in this study the hydrodynamic model was further validated using measured water temperature and salinity and coupled with the water quality module bacterial load data from various faecal sources were collected and used as input in the water quality model the model output corresponded very well with the measured e coli and enterococci concentrations in the river the root mean square error and the nash sutcliffe efficiency for log10 transformed concentrations were found to be 0 23 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 84 for e coli and 0 19 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 86 for enterococci respectively then the sensitivity of the model was tested by removing one process or forcing at a time these simulations revealed that the microbial decay the upstream concentrations and the discharge of untreated wastewater were the primary factors controlling the concentrations in the river while wind and the contribution from the diffuse sources i e urban and agricultural runoff were unlikely to have a major influence finally the model was applied to investigate the influence of wastewater treatment on the bacteria concentrations this revealed that wastewater treatment would result in a considerable improvement of the microbial water quality of the betna river this paper demonstrates the application of a comprehensive state of art model in a river in a data poor tropical area the model can potentially be applied to other watersheds and can help in formulating solutions to improve the microbial water quality keywords faecal contamination e coli enterococci wastewater water quality modelling mike 21 fm model 1 introduction waterborne diseases caused by faecal contamination of surface waters are a major problem worldwide in particular in developing countries in most developing countries sanitation and sewage treatment systems are underdeveloped and a large portion of the population relies on untreated and highly contaminated surface water kamal et al 2008 this widespread faecal contamination of surface waters often leads to outbreaks of diarrheal diseases wu et al 2016 globally an estimated 1 8 million people die annually from waterborne diseases and most of them are children from developing countries who 2012 surface waters can be contaminated by various faecal sources including untreated wastewater discharges septic leakage agricultural or urban runoff and wildlife populations an et al 2002 knowledge on the dynamic distribution of faecal contamination in water bodies is lacking worldwide especially in developing countries like bangladesh where faecal contamination is not well monitored to mitigate faecal contamination of surface waters knowledge on the microbial fate and transport the influence of different processes and the contribution from different sources to the total contamination is essential rochelle newall et al 2015 sokolova et al 2013 while regular monitoring of microbial water quality of a river is expensive and time consuming process based mathematical modelling can save time and resources modelling is useful to generate spatially and temporally continuous concentrations and helps to better understand the sources fate and transport of the faecal contamination previous studies have shown that concentrations of faecal contaminants in water sources can be described using coupled hydrodynamic and water quality models harwood et al 2005 sokolova et al 2013 ouattara et al 2013 liu et al 2006 these models describe the hydrodynamic situation in the water body and take into account the decay of microorganisms in the water environment sokolova et al 2013 liu et al 2015 these models can be used for scenario analysis in order to provide a basis for water management for example to plan mitigation measures to reduce faecal contamination of a water body however process based modelling of microbial water quality is very sparse worldwide particularly in tropical developing countries where diarrheal diseases are endemic hofstra 2011 most of the recent studies have been conducted in the developed countries e g schijven et al 2015 brauwere et al 2014 sokolova et al 2013 bedri et al 2014 gao et al 2015 and the models mostly exclude contributions from diffuse sources e g sokolova et al 2013 schijven et al 2015 vijay et al 2016 to increase the knowledge base in this study we implement a coupled hydrodynamic and microbial water quality model mike powered by dhi software mike 21 fm and eco lab dhi 2011 to study the faecal contamination in the tidal betna river located in the developing country bangladesh our study provides the first example of modelling the microbial water quality of a surface water source in bangladesh the model effectively takes into account point and diffuse faecal sources of human and animal origin hydro meteorological conditions and microbial decay processes the aim of this study was to better understand the sources fate and transport of the faecal contamination in the betna river to represent the faecal contamination we used the faecal indicator bacteria fib e coli and enterococci which are the two most widely used indicators of microbial water quality lata et al 2009 ouattara et al 2013 in this study the previously developed hydrodynamic model of the betna river islam et al 2017b was further developed and validated with water temperature and salinity distribution in the river the model was then applied to simulate the fate and transport of e coli and enterococci in the river taking into account the bacterial decay the modelling results were compared with the observed fib concentrations in the river next the processes that influence the fib concentrations in the river were discussed and contributions from the different faecal sources were analysed finally the model was applied to predict the effect of different wastewater management scenarios on the microbial water quality in the river this paper thus provides an enhanced understanding on the application of fate and transport modelling of faecal contamination in surface water in a developing country the developed model can potentially be applied to other watersheds in the world with similar characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers an area of approximately 107 km2 in the betna river catchment in the southwest of bangladesh fig 1 this catchment is located in the ganges brahmaputra delta the total length of the betna river is about 192 km the average width is 125 m and the maximum water depth is 9 m the present modelling study focuses on the downstream 30 km of the betna river this river is hydrologically connected with the bhairab river near the jessore district in the north and the kholpetua river near assasuni of the satkhira district in the south the bay of bengal is located approximately 60 km south of the study area the river has a tidal influence that contributes to the river s sustainability because during the dry season the inflow of fresh water from upstream areas becomes very limited tide generates from the bay of bengal and propagates to the north to the upstream boundary of the study area the observed tidal water levels in the betna river vary between 2 10 and 3 50 m the observed maximum discharge in 2012 was 277 and 392 m3 s at the time of ebbing and flooding respectively iwm 2014 the study area has a typical monsoon climate with a hot season march may followed by a rainy season june october and a cool period november february the mean annual rainfall in the area is about 1800 mm of which approximately 70 occurs during the monsoon season this area is affected by flooding during the monsoon in july september and during the cyclone season pre monsoon in april may cegis 2013 relative humidity of the area varies from about 70 in march to 90 in july mean annual air temperature is 26 c with peaks of around 35 c in may june the temperature in winter may fall to 10 c in january wind in the region shows two dominant patterns i e south westerly monsoon wind during july september and north easterly wind during november february the study area consists of flat terrain with low lying depressed areas and many tidal channels and creeks criss crossing the area the soils are mostly clay and loam the land use of the study area is dominated by paddy rice cultivation and integrated paddy rice shrimp culture about 8 of the total area is used for homestead and settlements about 10 is water body 0 5 is forest 61 is used for agriculture paddy rice cultivation and the remaining 20 5 is wetland also used for aquaculture or integrated paddy rice shrimp culture in winter due to a lack of upstream flow salinity increases and as a result agriculture is hindered in this season water salinity reaches the highest level during march april up to 15 parts per thousand ppt and the lowest level near 0 ppt in the rainy season during august september iwm 2014 the study area has a high population density of 1050 people per km2 bbs 2011 wastewater and manure are the main sources of faecal contamination in this catchment wastewater treatment facilities are very limited in bangladesh in the study area domestic municipal and industrial wastewater is discharged into the river without treatment the manure sources include manure applied to the agricultural lands as organic fertilizer and direct deposition of manure in to the river and canals various waterborne diseases including gastrointestinal and skin diseases are observed in this area during and after flooding cegis 2013 the observed fib concentrations in the river were 1 3 4 5 log10 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 2 4 4 8 log10 cfu 100 ml for enterococci islam et al 2017a 2 2 data collection and analysis to validate the microbial water quality model water temperature salinity and fib e coli and enterococci concentrations were measured in samples collected at four sites along the betna river fig 1 the sampling sites were selected to ensure representation of the various wastewater sources including wastewater input from the nearby city satkhira and manure discharge into the river the sampling sites were an upstream site that receives contamination mostly from diffuse sources site 1 a site adjacent to households site 2 a site that receives untreated wastewater discharge from urban and industrial areas site 3 and a site adjacent to a creek that receives stormwater runoff from the nearby town satkhira site 4 the samples were collected on 30 occasions monthly between april 2014 and november 2015 and during heavy rainfall events the sampling methods and data were discussed in detail in islam et al 2017a in brief water temperature and salinity were measured on the spot and the water samples for bacterial analysis were collected into sterile nalgene plastic bottles with the care required for fib analysis all samples were placed in an insulated box filled with ice packs and transported to the laboratory of environmental science discipline khulna university the analyses were started within six hours of collecting the first sample enumeration of e coli and enterococci was performed by the membrane filtration mf technique usepa 2002 usepa 2009 diluted water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter for enumeration of e coli the mtec agar plates were incubated at 35 0 5 c for 2 h followed by further incubation at 44 5 0 2 c for 22 24 h for enumeration of enterococci the me agar plates were incubated at 41 0 5 c for 48 h followed by further incubation on esculin iron agar plate at 41 0 5 c for 20 30 min after incubation black or reddish brown colonies were counted as enterococci the bacteria colonies were expressed as colony forming units cfu per 100 ml water level and discharge data were gathered from the institute of water modelling iwm in bangladesh and precipitation wind speed wind direction air temperature and relative humidity data were collected from the sathkira station of the bangladesh meterological department fig 1 2 3 modelling a coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model mike 21 fm with eco lab dhi 2011 was applied to simulate hydrodynamics and fib concentrations in the betna river the mike 21 fm is a two dimensional hydrodynamic hd model which includes a water quality module eco lab for modelling bacterial spread in surface water from different contamination sources several process based models have been developed to simulate the microbial concentrations or loads for a catchment and water source examples are the soil and water assessment tool swat sadeghi and arnold 2002 ecomsed blumberg and mellor 1987 and seneque billen et al 1994 in this study the mike 21 fm model was chosen because this model is suitable for tidal rivers and produces results with high temporal and spatial resolution 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model the model is based on a 2d numerical solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes equations dhi 2011 in the model the boussinesq simplifying approximation is used and hydrostatic pressure is assumed the 2d model consists of vertically integrated momentum equations a continuity equation advection diffusion equations for temperature and salinity and an equation of state the water density depends on temperature and salinity only dhi 2011 at the onset of the modelling process to describe the bathymetry of the river a digital representation of the modelling domain was created the modelling domain was divided into elements to create the computational mesh the mesh was generated in the mike zero mesh generator tool using a flexible mesh approach with triangular elements in the horizontal plane using delaunay triangulation dhi 2011 the mesh resolution was finer in the areas where the river is narrow the mesh consisted of 4089 nodes and 6628 elements the mesh element area varied from approximately 43 498 m2 the model accounted for wind forces and the net precipitation on the river surface and calculated the heat exchange between the atmosphere and the river a flooding depth of 0 05 m drying depth of 0 005 m and wetting depth of 0 1 m were set in the model the water density was formulated as a function of temperature and salinity the horizontal eddy viscosity was simulated using the smagorinsky formulation the bed resistance was described by a constant manning number of 60 m1 3 s the conditions on the upstream and downstream open boundaries were described using time series for discharge and water level respectively the land boundary was set to zero normal velocity the initial conditions were specified using the measured water level and initial water velocity was set to zero the initial and boundary conditions for the water temperature and salinity were described using measured and interpolated data for heat exchange the measured data for air temperature and relative humidity were used and a constant clearness coefficient 70 was assigned the default parameterisation was used dhi 2011 heat exchange with the atmosphere was applied to simulate the water temperature which determines microbial decay in our previous study the hydrodynamic model for the betna river was set up and then calibrated and validated using the measured data for water level and discharge the calibration and validation were performed for the periods 26 august 15 september 2012 and october 2014 september 2015 respectively the model performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the model performed well both for calibration water level r2 0 92 nse 0 81 discharge r2 0 83 nse 0 66 and validation water level r2 0 89 nse 0 76 discharge r2 0 84 nse 0 72 the good model performance for water level and river discharge signifies the potential of the model to simulate microbial water quality the details regarding the model development input data calibration and validation are described in our previous study islam et al 2017b in the present study the model was further validated using the water temperature and salinity data for the period october 2014 september 2015 because water temperature and salinity have a major influence on microbial processes 2 3 2 microbial water quality model in the present study the transport and fate of fib in the betna river were simulated for the period october 2014 september 2015 the microbial water quality module eco lab utilizes the output e g the velocity field water temperature salinity from the hydrodynamic model to calculate the fate of fib in the river in our study the modified eco lab template contained two state variables e coli and enterococci faecal contamination can enter the river through wastewater discharges from the nearby urban areas and households through sewer drains the wastewater discharges from drains were described as sources of faecal contamination in the model the input flows from the drains were estimated based on the number of people connected to the sewer network and water consumption per person of 90 l day wsp 2009 the e coli concentration in untreated wastewater was set to 1 5 106 cfu 100 ml based on the concentrations reported by payment et al 2001 carlos et al 2013 and sokolova et al 2013 the enterococci concentration in untreated wastewater was set to 1 0 106 cfu 100 ml which is comparable to the value reported by ahmed et al 2008 in addition faecal contamination can enter the river with stormwater runoff from the nearby town satkhira fig 1 the runoff volume was estimated using the curve number method the runoff curve number developed by the us department of agriculture usda 1986 is an empirical hydrological parameter to predict the approximate amount of direct runoff from a rainfall event balvanshi and tiwari 2014 the curve number is based on the soil type land use and hydrologic conditions stormwater is not treated and is likely to carry faecal contamination from cats and dogs that live in the urban area the fib concentration in urban stormwater ranges between 103 and 104 cfu 100 ml marsalek and rochfort 2004 in this study a concentration of 5 103 cfu 100 ml was used for both e coli and enterococci the loadings of bacteria from the paddy fields were estimated based on the estimated discharge from the paddy fields and the fib concentrations in the water of the paddy fields at first the e coli concentration in the paddy fields of the study area was estimated from the manure application rate of 420 kg ha yr hasanuzzaman et al 2011 the e coli concentration in manure of 4 2 105 cfu g coffey et al 2010 and the average water height of the farm of 21 cm all e coli in manure was assumed to enter the water column the resulting theoretically calculated concentration was 4 1 103 cfu 100 ml which was similar to the average e coli concentration of 4 6 103 cfu 100 ml reported by kim et al 2006 for the paddy fields in south korea for confirmation and to get accurate concentrations for both e coli and enterococci sampling was performed in five paddy fields around the betna river in 2016 in august when most discharges from the paddy fields occur the measured average e coli and enterococci concentrations in the paddy fields were 3 6 103 and 7 4 103 cfu 100 ml respectively these values were in the same order of magnitude as the theoretical calculations these measured values were applied in the model another source of faecal contamination is the inflowing bacterial load from the upstream part of the river the daily concentrations at the upstream boundary were estimated by interpolating the concentrations measured at sampling site 1 fig 1 the concentration at the downstream boundary was assumed to be 0 cfu 100 ml due to a limited anthropogenic impact on the water quality since very few people live in this forested area the model sensitivity analysis also showed that the concentration at the downstream boundary does not have an impact on the location of interest because it is far away bedri et al 2014 in their modelling study also used zero concentrations for open boundaries and indicated that the far distance from the shoreline is sufficient to negate the effect of boundary conditions on the location of interest occasional leakage of septic tanks and open defaecation from humans can also contaminate the river water an et al 2002 however the lack of sufficient data e g corresponding amount of faecal matter and bacterial concentrations prevented inclusion of the leakage and open defaecation in the model direct defaecation from cattle was also ignored in this study due to the difficulties in estimation of the coincident amount of deposited manure we have found no correlation between the measured turbidity and the fib concentrations this may indicate that the influence of bacterial resuspension from sediments on the fib concentrations is not strong in case of this river for this reason and the lack of sediment data resuspension of bacteria from sediments was not taken into account in the model fib were assumed to be inactivated in the river water following first order decay kinetics the decay was described as a function of temperature salinity and solar radiation mancini 1978 1 dc dt k 0 θ s sal θ i int θ t t e m p 20 c in eq 1 c is the concentration of bacteria t is the time k0 is the decay rate 1 day at 20 c for a salinity of 0 and in a dark condition θs is the salinity coefficient for the decay rate sal is the salinity θi is the light coefficient for the decay rate int is the light intensity kw m2 θt is the temperature coefficient for the decay rate temp c is the water temperature the temperature θt and the decay rate k0 constants for e coli were set to 1 07 and 0 80 respectively these values are consistent to the values used by hellweger and masopust 2008 mancini 1978 and liu et al 2006 as enterococci survive longer than e coli in natural waters liu et al 2006 the θt and k0 constants for enterococci were set to 1 04 and 0 50 respectively these values are also consistent with the values used by liu et al 2006 the salinity coefficient θs was set to 1 006 for both bacteria based on the values reported in the literature canteras et al 1995 mccorquodale et al 2004 brauwere et al 2014 a constant light intensity of 0 14 kw m2 was assigned in the model this was based on the daily average light intensity and daily sunshine hours data for the study area collected from nasa s satellite derived data centre and the bangladesh meteorological department respectively the light coefficient θi was set to 7 4 which is the default value and is comparable to the value used by gao et al 2015 2 3 3 model performance in this study the previously validated hydrodynamic model was further validated with measured water temperature and salinity for the period october 2014 september 2015 the model was then applied to simulate the fib concentrations for the period october 2014 september 2015 and the results were compared with the measured fib data the model performance was assessed using the following statistical parameters the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse ranges between and 1 0 values between 0 0 and 1 0 are usually viewed as acceptable the closer nse is to 1 0 the more accurate the model is nse 0 90 is excellent 0 75 0 89 is very good and 0 50 0 74 is good moriasi et al 2007 the log10 transformed values of the fib concentrations were used to calculate the rmse and nse because the concentrations were highly variable e g measured e coli 120 3 6 104 cfu 100 ml and other studies also used log10 transformed values e g ouattara et al 2013 thupaki et al 2010 2 3 4 model sensitivity analysis to better understand the influence of the different processes and faecal sources on the fib concentration and its variability in the betna river a sensitivity analysis was performed the model was run to generate the output with 15 min resolution for ten days during the wet season 8 17 july 2015 and ten days during the dry season 21 30 january 2015 the major processes wind decay different faecal sources were removed one at a time for example to evaluate the influence of wind the model was run without the wind force in the model while all other forcings and processes were kept the same in addition to determine the contribution of the different faecal sources to the total concentration the model was run with and without i the concentrations at the upstream boundary ii the wastewater discharges and iii the diffuse faecal sources 2 3 5 scenario analysis the response of the system to the changes in fib loading from the sewer drains was studied during ten days in the dry season 21 30 january 2015 the dry season was studied because during this period the wastewater discharge from the drains is the primary source of faecal contamination in the river we considered a scenario in which a wastewater treatment plants wwtps are constructed with the required capacity b the sewer network is built to collect and transport the entire volume of wastewater to the wwtps and c primary and secondary levels of treatment are applied to treat the entire volume reaching the wwtps we assume that with the application of the primary and secondary levels of treatment the concentration of fib in wastewater will be reduced by two orders of magnitude based on saleem et al 2000 and george et al 2002 3 results the simulated and measured water temperature and salinity were compared for sampling sites 1 2 3 and 4 see an example in fig 2 combined for the four sampling sites the rmse was 0 51 c and 0 38 ppt and the nse was 0 93 and 0 94 respectively suggesting an excellent agreement between the modelling results and the measured data the results show temporal variability of the system due to the seasonal changes in temperature and salinity water temperature remains high around 30 c except for the winter months fig 2 salinity starts reducing at the onset of the rainy season in mid june and reaches near zero ppt during july fig 2 the simulated and measured fib concentrations were compared for sampling sites 2 3 and 4 fig 3 combined for the three sampling sites the rmse and nse for the log10 transformed concentrations of e coli and enterococci were 0 23 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 19 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 84 and 0 86 respectively suggesting a very good model performance the concentrations in the rainy season july september mean concentration 1 2 104 cfu 100 ml were higher than during the dry months november february mean concentration 9 7 102 cfu 100 ml the simulated and measured concentrations of enterococci were most of the time higher on average by 0 5 log10 cfu 100 ml than the concentrations of e coli the sensitivity analysis showed that wind does not have a major impact on the fib concentrations in the river since for the simulations without wind the concentrations were 1 6 3 5 lower than the reference concentrations the mean concentrations for the different studied periods when the model is run with all model inputs table 1 however the results showed that the decay process is very important since for the simulations without the decay process the concentrations were found to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than the reference concentrations table 1 the results revealed that during the wet period the upstream boundary concentrations and the wastewater discharges through drains had the largest contribution to the total concentration up to 55 and 42 respectively while the diffuse sources urban and agricultural runoff contributed less up to 9 3 for e coli and 12 6 for enterococci table 1 and fig 4 during the dry period the wastewater discharges contributed the most up to 89 the contribution from the upstream boundary was lower 11 36 and no contribution from the diffuse sources was observed table 1 and fig 4 the scenario analysis results revealed that the faecal contamination in the river system could largely be reduced by introducing primary and secondary wastewater treatment fig 5 4 discussion this modelling study of the microbial water quality in the betna river provided insights in the faecal contamination sources and the microbial fate and transport processes in the context of a subtropical developing country processed based models can generate useful data for microbial risk assessment and inform mitigation measures to reduce microbial contamination of water sources however the models should be validated using observed microbial data that generally are hardly available particularly in the data poor tropical or developing countries hofstra 2011 the full evaluation of the model performance in this study was limited by the lack of the fib data measured with high temporal resolution comparison with the available data however did show that the model performed well moreover a fundamental problem with bacterial fate and transport modelling is the inherent uncertainty in some essential inputs such as faecal loads from wildlife failing septic tanks livestock waste deposition to streams and fib concentrations in livestock waste and manure niazi et al 2015 although in the current study the model performance was high and the model captured the measured fib variability well it slightly underestimated the concentrations in some of the peaks e g july august this underestimation indicates that there is more contamination entering the river during the high discharge events than we have estimated the underestimation in the peak concentrations can be caused by an underestimation of the load from the identified faecal sources and or contributions from faecal sources that were not included in the model such as septic tank leakage and open defecation since the model is more sensitive to the decay rate than to model inputs such as wastewater drains the influence of in particular the septic tank leakage and open defecation which are relevant for the minority of the population are expected to be of limited importance the major impact of the decay process on the modelling results illustrated in this study is in agreement with the studies by brauwere et al 2014 and ouattara et al 2013 although sunlight and temperature have a great impact on the bacterial decay gao et al 2015 liu et al 2015 ouattara et al 2013 in most studies the decay processes have been modelled using a constant decay rate due to the lack of input data bedri et al 2014 vijay et al 2016 menendez et al 2013 in this study the decay rates of fib were estimated based on three environmental factors i e temperature salinity and sunlight intensity this study showed higher bacterial concentrations during the periods of heavy rainfall and high river flow in comparison to the dry periods other studies e g schilling et al 2009 aragonés et al 2016 ouattara et al 2013 also find this relationship in the present study in the dry period the fib concentrations were lower than in the wet period because in the dry period the river received contamination only from the point sources and the bacterial decay was higher due to higher water temperature salinity and sunlight intensity the comparatively higher concentrations of enterococci which is supported by previous studies e g mishra et al 2015 tiefenthaler et al 2009 can be explained by their slower decay in saline surface water in comparison to e coli liu et al 2006 the untreated wastewater from the sewer drains and the fib inputs from the upstream boundary were the major contamination sources in the betna river fig 4 table 1 while the contribution from the diffuse sources was comparatively lower which is in agreement with most other studies e g ouattara et al 2013 sokolova et al 2013 gao et al 2015 vijay et al 2016 in contrast few studies e g brauwere et al 2014 servais et al 2007 found that the diffuse sources were predominant compared to the point sources this can be the case for catchments with low population density and improved sanitation and wastewater treatment the high input from the upstream open boundary is due to untreated discharges from point sources in upstream urban areas and accumulation of small amounts from diffuse sources in the large upstream areas this study underlines the need for establishment of wastewater treatment plants both in the studied basin and upstream urban areas for the betna river catchment the modelling results highlighted the negative impact of untreated wastewater mostly from the satkhira town on the microbial water quality the fib concentrations were found to be higher than the us epa bathing water quality standards 235 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 104 cfu 100 ml for enterococci most of the time even during the dry periods fig 3 the modelling results showed that introduction of primary and secondary level of wastewater treatment would result in considerable improvement of microbial water quality of the river this is also supported by other studies vijay et al 2016 liu et al 2015 ouattara et al 2013 no tertiary level of treatment was considered due to the exorbitant cost implication where all facilities would have to be newly constructed with the introduction of wastewater treatment a major improvement of the water quality would be achieved in the dry season however noncompliance of the water quality would prevail during the wet season due to the contribution from the upstream boundary and the diffuse sources treatment of wastewater from the upstream urban areas will reduce the concentrations at the upstream boundary and further improve the water quality of the betna river during the wet season this study confirms the applicability of the model to assess bacterial dynamics and impact of different processes and wastewater treatment on the microbial water quality in surface waters although the effectiveness of wastewater treatment is known the tendency has been to actually provide sewers sanitation with no focus on treatment for example millennium development goals focused on sanitation without linking it to the extent of treatment therefore this paper includes a wastewater treatment scenario analysis to highlight the importance of wastewater treatment in a developing country the presented model and approach can be applied for more complex scenario analysis such as to determine the microbial log10 reduction target values in designing wwtps and to assess future microbial water quality under climate and socio economic change the developed methodology will likely be useful for water managers in mitigating faecal contamination based on local situations in this study as in most studies fib have been used to represent faecal contamination but fib may not reflect the presence and behaviour of waterborne pathogens for example the absence of fib does not exclude the presence of enteric viruses which are generally more resistant to wastewater treatment than bacteria prez et al 2015 the limitation of modelling pathogens is that even fewer measured data are available for pathogens than for fib an interesting next step would be to apply the developed model to simulate the fate and transport of waterborne pathogens and to perform quantitative microbial risk assessment sokolova et al 2015 eregno et al 2016 bergion et al 2018 also an advanced next step could be to explicitly model the combined exposure of surface waters to multiple contaminants nutrients microplastics chemicals and pathogens as proposed by kroeze et al 2016 in the betna river the fib concentrations become very high after a heavy rainfall event and decrease after three to four days although still remain noncompliant with the bathing water quality standards see our previous study islam et al 2017a and fig 3 since some people still want to bathe and fish in the river despite the poor water quality we suggest that these activities are avoided for at least three to four days after a heavy rainfall event as long as major improvements of wastewater treatment are not ensured in the surrounding river catchment and upstream areas the government of bangladesh has already made it mandatory for industries to establish effluent treatment plants however there is a lack of strict regulation and initiative to implement domestic wastewater treatment before disposal of wastewater into rivers this modelling study hopefully creates awareness and provides policy support information for the government in reducing the widespread faecal contamination of the surface waters of bangladesh the implementation of wastewater treatment would also contribute to reaching the sustainable development goal sdg 6 target 3 to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater un water 2017 5 conclusions this modelling study provides enhanced understanding on the fate and transport of fib and the contribution of different sources to the total faecal contamination and constitutes an example of scenario analysis for a subtropical river in a developing country the results revealed that bacterial decay upstream concentrations and untreated wastewater discharges were the dominant factors controlling the fib concentrations in the river while wind and contamination from the diffuse sources did not have a significant influence introduction of primary and secondary level of wastewater treatment would decrease the contamination of the river during the dry season considerably however due to the contribution from the upstream boundary noncompliance of the water quality would prevail during the wet season treatment of wastewater from the upstream urban areas would further improve the water quality during the wet season although the model captured the measured fib variability well some of the peaks were underestimated due to the lack of data on septic tank leakage open defaecation and sediment resuspension in future modelling studies particularly in the context of developing countries it is important to carefully consider the contributions from the diffuse sources this study is one of the first to model fib in developing countries and shows that even with limited data availability this modelling approach can generate useful data to support implementation of mitigation measures to reduce faecal contamination of surface waters this study serves as a test case for other river basins with similar conditions and this modelling approach can be applied in other watersheds the developed model can be used to provide input data for microbial risk assessment and to forecast future impacts of climate change and socio economic development on the microbial water quality this modelling study provides information to support decisions by water managers in the context of reducing the widespread faecal contamination and the risks of waterborne disease outbreaks which are the leading cause of death in developing countries the study emphasises the need for treatment of wastewater before it is discharged into the rivers and canals and underlines the importance for countries to achieve sdg 6 3 acknowledgements we thank the ministry of science and technology of the

7191,to improve microbial water quality and to prevent waterborne disease outbreaks knowledge on the fate and transport of contaminants and on the contributions from different faecal sources to the total contamination is essential the fate and transport of faecal indicators e coli and enterococci within the betna river in bangladesh were simulated using a coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model the hydrodynamic model for the river was set up calibrated and validated with water level and discharge in our earlier study in this study the hydrodynamic model was further validated using measured water temperature and salinity and coupled with the water quality module bacterial load data from various faecal sources were collected and used as input in the water quality model the model output corresponded very well with the measured e coli and enterococci concentrations in the river the root mean square error and the nash sutcliffe efficiency for log10 transformed concentrations were found to be 0 23 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 84 for e coli and 0 19 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 86 for enterococci respectively then the sensitivity of the model was tested by removing one process or forcing at a time these simulations revealed that the microbial decay the upstream concentrations and the discharge of untreated wastewater were the primary factors controlling the concentrations in the river while wind and the contribution from the diffuse sources i e urban and agricultural runoff were unlikely to have a major influence finally the model was applied to investigate the influence of wastewater treatment on the bacteria concentrations this revealed that wastewater treatment would result in a considerable improvement of the microbial water quality of the betna river this paper demonstrates the application of a comprehensive state of art model in a river in a data poor tropical area the model can potentially be applied to other watersheds and can help in formulating solutions to improve the microbial water quality keywords faecal contamination e coli enterococci wastewater water quality modelling mike 21 fm model 1 introduction waterborne diseases caused by faecal contamination of surface waters are a major problem worldwide in particular in developing countries in most developing countries sanitation and sewage treatment systems are underdeveloped and a large portion of the population relies on untreated and highly contaminated surface water kamal et al 2008 this widespread faecal contamination of surface waters often leads to outbreaks of diarrheal diseases wu et al 2016 globally an estimated 1 8 million people die annually from waterborne diseases and most of them are children from developing countries who 2012 surface waters can be contaminated by various faecal sources including untreated wastewater discharges septic leakage agricultural or urban runoff and wildlife populations an et al 2002 knowledge on the dynamic distribution of faecal contamination in water bodies is lacking worldwide especially in developing countries like bangladesh where faecal contamination is not well monitored to mitigate faecal contamination of surface waters knowledge on the microbial fate and transport the influence of different processes and the contribution from different sources to the total contamination is essential rochelle newall et al 2015 sokolova et al 2013 while regular monitoring of microbial water quality of a river is expensive and time consuming process based mathematical modelling can save time and resources modelling is useful to generate spatially and temporally continuous concentrations and helps to better understand the sources fate and transport of the faecal contamination previous studies have shown that concentrations of faecal contaminants in water sources can be described using coupled hydrodynamic and water quality models harwood et al 2005 sokolova et al 2013 ouattara et al 2013 liu et al 2006 these models describe the hydrodynamic situation in the water body and take into account the decay of microorganisms in the water environment sokolova et al 2013 liu et al 2015 these models can be used for scenario analysis in order to provide a basis for water management for example to plan mitigation measures to reduce faecal contamination of a water body however process based modelling of microbial water quality is very sparse worldwide particularly in tropical developing countries where diarrheal diseases are endemic hofstra 2011 most of the recent studies have been conducted in the developed countries e g schijven et al 2015 brauwere et al 2014 sokolova et al 2013 bedri et al 2014 gao et al 2015 and the models mostly exclude contributions from diffuse sources e g sokolova et al 2013 schijven et al 2015 vijay et al 2016 to increase the knowledge base in this study we implement a coupled hydrodynamic and microbial water quality model mike powered by dhi software mike 21 fm and eco lab dhi 2011 to study the faecal contamination in the tidal betna river located in the developing country bangladesh our study provides the first example of modelling the microbial water quality of a surface water source in bangladesh the model effectively takes into account point and diffuse faecal sources of human and animal origin hydro meteorological conditions and microbial decay processes the aim of this study was to better understand the sources fate and transport of the faecal contamination in the betna river to represent the faecal contamination we used the faecal indicator bacteria fib e coli and enterococci which are the two most widely used indicators of microbial water quality lata et al 2009 ouattara et al 2013 in this study the previously developed hydrodynamic model of the betna river islam et al 2017b was further developed and validated with water temperature and salinity distribution in the river the model was then applied to simulate the fate and transport of e coli and enterococci in the river taking into account the bacterial decay the modelling results were compared with the observed fib concentrations in the river next the processes that influence the fib concentrations in the river were discussed and contributions from the different faecal sources were analysed finally the model was applied to predict the effect of different wastewater management scenarios on the microbial water quality in the river this paper thus provides an enhanced understanding on the application of fate and transport modelling of faecal contamination in surface water in a developing country the developed model can potentially be applied to other watersheds in the world with similar characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers an area of approximately 107 km2 in the betna river catchment in the southwest of bangladesh fig 1 this catchment is located in the ganges brahmaputra delta the total length of the betna river is about 192 km the average width is 125 m and the maximum water depth is 9 m the present modelling study focuses on the downstream 30 km of the betna river this river is hydrologically connected with the bhairab river near the jessore district in the north and the kholpetua river near assasuni of the satkhira district in the south the bay of bengal is located approximately 60 km south of the study area the river has a tidal influence that contributes to the river s sustainability because during the dry season the inflow of fresh water from upstream areas becomes very limited tide generates from the bay of bengal and propagates to the north to the upstream boundary of the study area the observed tidal water levels in the betna river vary between 2 10 and 3 50 m the observed maximum discharge in 2012 was 277 and 392 m3 s at the time of ebbing and flooding respectively iwm 2014 the study area has a typical monsoon climate with a hot season march may followed by a rainy season june october and a cool period november february the mean annual rainfall in the area is about 1800 mm of which approximately 70 occurs during the monsoon season this area is affected by flooding during the monsoon in july september and during the cyclone season pre monsoon in april may cegis 2013 relative humidity of the area varies from about 70 in march to 90 in july mean annual air temperature is 26 c with peaks of around 35 c in may june the temperature in winter may fall to 10 c in january wind in the region shows two dominant patterns i e south westerly monsoon wind during july september and north easterly wind during november february the study area consists of flat terrain with low lying depressed areas and many tidal channels and creeks criss crossing the area the soils are mostly clay and loam the land use of the study area is dominated by paddy rice cultivation and integrated paddy rice shrimp culture about 8 of the total area is used for homestead and settlements about 10 is water body 0 5 is forest 61 is used for agriculture paddy rice cultivation and the remaining 20 5 is wetland also used for aquaculture or integrated paddy rice shrimp culture in winter due to a lack of upstream flow salinity increases and as a result agriculture is hindered in this season water salinity reaches the highest level during march april up to 15 parts per thousand ppt and the lowest level near 0 ppt in the rainy season during august september iwm 2014 the study area has a high population density of 1050 people per km2 bbs 2011 wastewater and manure are the main sources of faecal contamination in this catchment wastewater treatment facilities are very limited in bangladesh in the study area domestic municipal and industrial wastewater is discharged into the river without treatment the manure sources include manure applied to the agricultural lands as organic fertilizer and direct deposition of manure in to the river and canals various waterborne diseases including gastrointestinal and skin diseases are observed in this area during and after flooding cegis 2013 the observed fib concentrations in the river were 1 3 4 5 log10 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 2 4 4 8 log10 cfu 100 ml for enterococci islam et al 2017a 2 2 data collection and analysis to validate the microbial water quality model water temperature salinity and fib e coli and enterococci concentrations were measured in samples collected at four sites along the betna river fig 1 the sampling sites were selected to ensure representation of the various wastewater sources including wastewater input from the nearby city satkhira and manure discharge into the river the sampling sites were an upstream site that receives contamination mostly from diffuse sources site 1 a site adjacent to households site 2 a site that receives untreated wastewater discharge from urban and industrial areas site 3 and a site adjacent to a creek that receives stormwater runoff from the nearby town satkhira site 4 the samples were collected on 30 occasions monthly between april 2014 and november 2015 and during heavy rainfall events the sampling methods and data were discussed in detail in islam et al 2017a in brief water temperature and salinity were measured on the spot and the water samples for bacterial analysis were collected into sterile nalgene plastic bottles with the care required for fib analysis all samples were placed in an insulated box filled with ice packs and transported to the laboratory of environmental science discipline khulna university the analyses were started within six hours of collecting the first sample enumeration of e coli and enterococci was performed by the membrane filtration mf technique usepa 2002 usepa 2009 diluted water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter for enumeration of e coli the mtec agar plates were incubated at 35 0 5 c for 2 h followed by further incubation at 44 5 0 2 c for 22 24 h for enumeration of enterococci the me agar plates were incubated at 41 0 5 c for 48 h followed by further incubation on esculin iron agar plate at 41 0 5 c for 20 30 min after incubation black or reddish brown colonies were counted as enterococci the bacteria colonies were expressed as colony forming units cfu per 100 ml water level and discharge data were gathered from the institute of water modelling iwm in bangladesh and precipitation wind speed wind direction air temperature and relative humidity data were collected from the sathkira station of the bangladesh meterological department fig 1 2 3 modelling a coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model mike 21 fm with eco lab dhi 2011 was applied to simulate hydrodynamics and fib concentrations in the betna river the mike 21 fm is a two dimensional hydrodynamic hd model which includes a water quality module eco lab for modelling bacterial spread in surface water from different contamination sources several process based models have been developed to simulate the microbial concentrations or loads for a catchment and water source examples are the soil and water assessment tool swat sadeghi and arnold 2002 ecomsed blumberg and mellor 1987 and seneque billen et al 1994 in this study the mike 21 fm model was chosen because this model is suitable for tidal rivers and produces results with high temporal and spatial resolution 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model the model is based on a 2d numerical solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes equations dhi 2011 in the model the boussinesq simplifying approximation is used and hydrostatic pressure is assumed the 2d model consists of vertically integrated momentum equations a continuity equation advection diffusion equations for temperature and salinity and an equation of state the water density depends on temperature and salinity only dhi 2011 at the onset of the modelling process to describe the bathymetry of the river a digital representation of the modelling domain was created the modelling domain was divided into elements to create the computational mesh the mesh was generated in the mike zero mesh generator tool using a flexible mesh approach with triangular elements in the horizontal plane using delaunay triangulation dhi 2011 the mesh resolution was finer in the areas where the river is narrow the mesh consisted of 4089 nodes and 6628 elements the mesh element area varied from approximately 43 498 m2 the model accounted for wind forces and the net precipitation on the river surface and calculated the heat exchange between the atmosphere and the river a flooding depth of 0 05 m drying depth of 0 005 m and wetting depth of 0 1 m were set in the model the water density was formulated as a function of temperature and salinity the horizontal eddy viscosity was simulated using the smagorinsky formulation the bed resistance was described by a constant manning number of 60 m1 3 s the conditions on the upstream and downstream open boundaries were described using time series for discharge and water level respectively the land boundary was set to zero normal velocity the initial conditions were specified using the measured water level and initial water velocity was set to zero the initial and boundary conditions for the water temperature and salinity were described using measured and interpolated data for heat exchange the measured data for air temperature and relative humidity were used and a constant clearness coefficient 70 was assigned the default parameterisation was used dhi 2011 heat exchange with the atmosphere was applied to simulate the water temperature which determines microbial decay in our previous study the hydrodynamic model for the betna river was set up and then calibrated and validated using the measured data for water level and discharge the calibration and validation were performed for the periods 26 august 15 september 2012 and october 2014 september 2015 respectively the model performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the model performed well both for calibration water level r2 0 92 nse 0 81 discharge r2 0 83 nse 0 66 and validation water level r2 0 89 nse 0 76 discharge r2 0 84 nse 0 72 the good model performance for water level and river discharge signifies the potential of the model to simulate microbial water quality the details regarding the model development input data calibration and validation are described in our previous study islam et al 2017b in the present study the model was further validated using the water temperature and salinity data for the period october 2014 september 2015 because water temperature and salinity have a major influence on microbial processes 2 3 2 microbial water quality model in the present study the transport and fate of fib in the betna river were simulated for the period october 2014 september 2015 the microbial water quality module eco lab utilizes the output e g the velocity field water temperature salinity from the hydrodynamic model to calculate the fate of fib in the river in our study the modified eco lab template contained two state variables e coli and enterococci faecal contamination can enter the river through wastewater discharges from the nearby urban areas and households through sewer drains the wastewater discharges from drains were described as sources of faecal contamination in the model the input flows from the drains were estimated based on the number of people connected to the sewer network and water consumption per person of 90 l day wsp 2009 the e coli concentration in untreated wastewater was set to 1 5 106 cfu 100 ml based on the concentrations reported by payment et al 2001 carlos et al 2013 and sokolova et al 2013 the enterococci concentration in untreated wastewater was set to 1 0 106 cfu 100 ml which is comparable to the value reported by ahmed et al 2008 in addition faecal contamination can enter the river with stormwater runoff from the nearby town satkhira fig 1 the runoff volume was estimated using the curve number method the runoff curve number developed by the us department of agriculture usda 1986 is an empirical hydrological parameter to predict the approximate amount of direct runoff from a rainfall event balvanshi and tiwari 2014 the curve number is based on the soil type land use and hydrologic conditions stormwater is not treated and is likely to carry faecal contamination from cats and dogs that live in the urban area the fib concentration in urban stormwater ranges between 103 and 104 cfu 100 ml marsalek and rochfort 2004 in this study a concentration of 5 103 cfu 100 ml was used for both e coli and enterococci the loadings of bacteria from the paddy fields were estimated based on the estimated discharge from the paddy fields and the fib concentrations in the water of the paddy fields at first the e coli concentration in the paddy fields of the study area was estimated from the manure application rate of 420 kg ha yr hasanuzzaman et al 2011 the e coli concentration in manure of 4 2 105 cfu g coffey et al 2010 and the average water height of the farm of 21 cm all e coli in manure was assumed to enter the water column the resulting theoretically calculated concentration was 4 1 103 cfu 100 ml which was similar to the average e coli concentration of 4 6 103 cfu 100 ml reported by kim et al 2006 for the paddy fields in south korea for confirmation and to get accurate concentrations for both e coli and enterococci sampling was performed in five paddy fields around the betna river in 2016 in august when most discharges from the paddy fields occur the measured average e coli and enterococci concentrations in the paddy fields were 3 6 103 and 7 4 103 cfu 100 ml respectively these values were in the same order of magnitude as the theoretical calculations these measured values were applied in the model another source of faecal contamination is the inflowing bacterial load from the upstream part of the river the daily concentrations at the upstream boundary were estimated by interpolating the concentrations measured at sampling site 1 fig 1 the concentration at the downstream boundary was assumed to be 0 cfu 100 ml due to a limited anthropogenic impact on the water quality since very few people live in this forested area the model sensitivity analysis also showed that the concentration at the downstream boundary does not have an impact on the location of interest because it is far away bedri et al 2014 in their modelling study also used zero concentrations for open boundaries and indicated that the far distance from the shoreline is sufficient to negate the effect of boundary conditions on the location of interest occasional leakage of septic tanks and open defaecation from humans can also contaminate the river water an et al 2002 however the lack of sufficient data e g corresponding amount of faecal matter and bacterial concentrations prevented inclusion of the leakage and open defaecation in the model direct defaecation from cattle was also ignored in this study due to the difficulties in estimation of the coincident amount of deposited manure we have found no correlation between the measured turbidity and the fib concentrations this may indicate that the influence of bacterial resuspension from sediments on the fib concentrations is not strong in case of this river for this reason and the lack of sediment data resuspension of bacteria from sediments was not taken into account in the model fib were assumed to be inactivated in the river water following first order decay kinetics the decay was described as a function of temperature salinity and solar radiation mancini 1978 1 dc dt k 0 θ s sal θ i int θ t t e m p 20 c in eq 1 c is the concentration of bacteria t is the time k0 is the decay rate 1 day at 20 c for a salinity of 0 and in a dark condition θs is the salinity coefficient for the decay rate sal is the salinity θi is the light coefficient for the decay rate int is the light intensity kw m2 θt is the temperature coefficient for the decay rate temp c is the water temperature the temperature θt and the decay rate k0 constants for e coli were set to 1 07 and 0 80 respectively these values are consistent to the values used by hellweger and masopust 2008 mancini 1978 and liu et al 2006 as enterococci survive longer than e coli in natural waters liu et al 2006 the θt and k0 constants for enterococci were set to 1 04 and 0 50 respectively these values are also consistent with the values used by liu et al 2006 the salinity coefficient θs was set to 1 006 for both bacteria based on the values reported in the literature canteras et al 1995 mccorquodale et al 2004 brauwere et al 2014 a constant light intensity of 0 14 kw m2 was assigned in the model this was based on the daily average light intensity and daily sunshine hours data for the study area collected from nasa s satellite derived data centre and the bangladesh meteorological department respectively the light coefficient θi was set to 7 4 which is the default value and is comparable to the value used by gao et al 2015 2 3 3 model performance in this study the previously validated hydrodynamic model was further validated with measured water temperature and salinity for the period october 2014 september 2015 the model was then applied to simulate the fib concentrations for the period october 2014 september 2015 and the results were compared with the measured fib data the model performance was assessed using the following statistical parameters the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse ranges between and 1 0 values between 0 0 and 1 0 are usually viewed as acceptable the closer nse is to 1 0 the more accurate the model is nse 0 90 is excellent 0 75 0 89 is very good and 0 50 0 74 is good moriasi et al 2007 the log10 transformed values of the fib concentrations were used to calculate the rmse and nse because the concentrations were highly variable e g measured e coli 120 3 6 104 cfu 100 ml and other studies also used log10 transformed values e g ouattara et al 2013 thupaki et al 2010 2 3 4 model sensitivity analysis to better understand the influence of the different processes and faecal sources on the fib concentration and its variability in the betna river a sensitivity analysis was performed the model was run to generate the output with 15 min resolution for ten days during the wet season 8 17 july 2015 and ten days during the dry season 21 30 january 2015 the major processes wind decay different faecal sources were removed one at a time for example to evaluate the influence of wind the model was run without the wind force in the model while all other forcings and processes were kept the same in addition to determine the contribution of the different faecal sources to the total concentration the model was run with and without i the concentrations at the upstream boundary ii the wastewater discharges and iii the diffuse faecal sources 2 3 5 scenario analysis the response of the system to the changes in fib loading from the sewer drains was studied during ten days in the dry season 21 30 january 2015 the dry season was studied because during this period the wastewater discharge from the drains is the primary source of faecal contamination in the river we considered a scenario in which a wastewater treatment plants wwtps are constructed with the required capacity b the sewer network is built to collect and transport the entire volume of wastewater to the wwtps and c primary and secondary levels of treatment are applied to treat the entire volume reaching the wwtps we assume that with the application of the primary and secondary levels of treatment the concentration of fib in wastewater will be reduced by two orders of magnitude based on saleem et al 2000 and george et al 2002 3 results the simulated and measured water temperature and salinity were compared for sampling sites 1 2 3 and 4 see an example in fig 2 combined for the four sampling sites the rmse was 0 51 c and 0 38 ppt and the nse was 0 93 and 0 94 respectively suggesting an excellent agreement between the modelling results and the measured data the results show temporal variability of the system due to the seasonal changes in temperature and salinity water temperature remains high around 30 c except for the winter months fig 2 salinity starts reducing at the onset of the rainy season in mid june and reaches near zero ppt during july fig 2 the simulated and measured fib concentrations were compared for sampling sites 2 3 and 4 fig 3 combined for the three sampling sites the rmse and nse for the log10 transformed concentrations of e coli and enterococci were 0 23 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 19 log10 cfu 100 ml and 0 84 and 0 86 respectively suggesting a very good model performance the concentrations in the rainy season july september mean concentration 1 2 104 cfu 100 ml were higher than during the dry months november february mean concentration 9 7 102 cfu 100 ml the simulated and measured concentrations of enterococci were most of the time higher on average by 0 5 log10 cfu 100 ml than the concentrations of e coli the sensitivity analysis showed that wind does not have a major impact on the fib concentrations in the river since for the simulations without wind the concentrations were 1 6 3 5 lower than the reference concentrations the mean concentrations for the different studied periods when the model is run with all model inputs table 1 however the results showed that the decay process is very important since for the simulations without the decay process the concentrations were found to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than the reference concentrations table 1 the results revealed that during the wet period the upstream boundary concentrations and the wastewater discharges through drains had the largest contribution to the total concentration up to 55 and 42 respectively while the diffuse sources urban and agricultural runoff contributed less up to 9 3 for e coli and 12 6 for enterococci table 1 and fig 4 during the dry period the wastewater discharges contributed the most up to 89 the contribution from the upstream boundary was lower 11 36 and no contribution from the diffuse sources was observed table 1 and fig 4 the scenario analysis results revealed that the faecal contamination in the river system could largely be reduced by introducing primary and secondary wastewater treatment fig 5 4 discussion this modelling study of the microbial water quality in the betna river provided insights in the faecal contamination sources and the microbial fate and transport processes in the context of a subtropical developing country processed based models can generate useful data for microbial risk assessment and inform mitigation measures to reduce microbial contamination of water sources however the models should be validated using observed microbial data that generally are hardly available particularly in the data poor tropical or developing countries hofstra 2011 the full evaluation of the model performance in this study was limited by the lack of the fib data measured with high temporal resolution comparison with the available data however did show that the model performed well moreover a fundamental problem with bacterial fate and transport modelling is the inherent uncertainty in some essential inputs such as faecal loads from wildlife failing septic tanks livestock waste deposition to streams and fib concentrations in livestock waste and manure niazi et al 2015 although in the current study the model performance was high and the model captured the measured fib variability well it slightly underestimated the concentrations in some of the peaks e g july august this underestimation indicates that there is more contamination entering the river during the high discharge events than we have estimated the underestimation in the peak concentrations can be caused by an underestimation of the load from the identified faecal sources and or contributions from faecal sources that were not included in the model such as septic tank leakage and open defecation since the model is more sensitive to the decay rate than to model inputs such as wastewater drains the influence of in particular the septic tank leakage and open defecation which are relevant for the minority of the population are expected to be of limited importance the major impact of the decay process on the modelling results illustrated in this study is in agreement with the studies by brauwere et al 2014 and ouattara et al 2013 although sunlight and temperature have a great impact on the bacterial decay gao et al 2015 liu et al 2015 ouattara et al 2013 in most studies the decay processes have been modelled using a constant decay rate due to the lack of input data bedri et al 2014 vijay et al 2016 menendez et al 2013 in this study the decay rates of fib were estimated based on three environmental factors i e temperature salinity and sunlight intensity this study showed higher bacterial concentrations during the periods of heavy rainfall and high river flow in comparison to the dry periods other studies e g schilling et al 2009 aragonés et al 2016 ouattara et al 2013 also find this relationship in the present study in the dry period the fib concentrations were lower than in the wet period because in the dry period the river received contamination only from the point sources and the bacterial decay was higher due to higher water temperature salinity and sunlight intensity the comparatively higher concentrations of enterococci which is supported by previous studies e g mishra et al 2015 tiefenthaler et al 2009 can be explained by their slower decay in saline surface water in comparison to e coli liu et al 2006 the untreated wastewater from the sewer drains and the fib inputs from the upstream boundary were the major contamination sources in the betna river fig 4 table 1 while the contribution from the diffuse sources was comparatively lower which is in agreement with most other studies e g ouattara et al 2013 sokolova et al 2013 gao et al 2015 vijay et al 2016 in contrast few studies e g brauwere et al 2014 servais et al 2007 found that the diffuse sources were predominant compared to the point sources this can be the case for catchments with low population density and improved sanitation and wastewater treatment the high input from the upstream open boundary is due to untreated discharges from point sources in upstream urban areas and accumulation of small amounts from diffuse sources in the large upstream areas this study underlines the need for establishment of wastewater treatment plants both in the studied basin and upstream urban areas for the betna river catchment the modelling results highlighted the negative impact of untreated wastewater mostly from the satkhira town on the microbial water quality the fib concentrations were found to be higher than the us epa bathing water quality standards 235 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 104 cfu 100 ml for enterococci most of the time even during the dry periods fig 3 the modelling results showed that introduction of primary and secondary level of wastewater treatment would result in considerable improvement of microbial water quality of the river this is also supported by other studies vijay et al 2016 liu et al 2015 ouattara et al 2013 no tertiary level of treatment was considered due to the exorbitant cost implication where all facilities would have to be newly constructed with the introduction of wastewater treatment a major improvement of the water quality would be achieved in the dry season however noncompliance of the water quality would prevail during the wet season due to the contribution from the upstream boundary and the diffuse sources treatment of wastewater from the upstream urban areas will reduce the concentrations at the upstream boundary and further improve the water quality of the betna river during the wet season this study confirms the applicability of the model to assess bacterial dynamics and impact of different processes and wastewater treatment on the microbial water quality in surface waters although the effectiveness of wastewater treatment is known the tendency has been to actually provide sewers sanitation with no focus on treatment for example millennium development goals focused on sanitation without linking it to the extent of treatment therefore this paper includes a wastewater treatment scenario analysis to highlight the importance of wastewater treatment in a developing country the presented model and approach can be applied for more complex scenario analysis such as to determine the microbial log10 reduction target values in designing wwtps and to assess future microbial water quality under climate and socio economic change the developed methodology will likely be useful for water managers in mitigating faecal contamination based on local situations in this study as in most studies fib have been used to represent faecal contamination but fib may not reflect the presence and behaviour of waterborne pathogens for example the absence of fib does not exclude the presence of enteric viruses which are generally more resistant to wastewater treatment than bacteria prez et al 2015 the limitation of modelling pathogens is that even fewer measured data are available for pathogens than for fib an interesting next step would be to apply the developed model to simulate the fate and transport of waterborne pathogens and to perform quantitative microbial risk assessment sokolova et al 2015 eregno et al 2016 bergion et al 2018 also an advanced next step could be to explicitly model the combined exposure of surface waters to multiple contaminants nutrients microplastics chemicals and pathogens as proposed by kroeze et al 2016 in the betna river the fib concentrations become very high after a heavy rainfall event and decrease after three to four days although still remain noncompliant with the bathing water quality standards see our previous study islam et al 2017a and fig 3 since some people still want to bathe and fish in the river despite the poor water quality we suggest that these activities are avoided for at least three to four days after a heavy rainfall event as long as major improvements of wastewater treatment are not ensured in the surrounding river catchment and upstream areas the government of bangladesh has already made it mandatory for industries to establish effluent treatment plants however there is a lack of strict regulation and initiative to implement domestic wastewater treatment before disposal of wastewater into rivers this modelling study hopefully creates awareness and provides policy support information for the government in reducing the widespread faecal contamination of the surface waters of bangladesh the implementation of wastewater treatment would also contribute to reaching the sustainable development goal sdg 6 target 3 to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater un water 2017 5 conclusions this modelling study provides enhanced understanding on the fate and transport of fib and the contribution of different sources to the total faecal contamination and constitutes an example of scenario analysis for a subtropical river in a developing country the results revealed that bacterial decay upstream concentrations and untreated wastewater discharges were the dominant factors controlling the fib concentrations in the river while wind and contamination from the diffuse sources did not have a significant influence introduction of primary and secondary level of wastewater treatment would decrease the contamination of the river during the dry season considerably however due to the contribution from the upstream boundary noncompliance of the water quality would prevail during the wet season treatment of wastewater from the upstream urban areas would further improve the water quality during the wet season although the model captured the measured fib variability well some of the peaks were underestimated due to the lack of data on septic tank leakage open defaecation and sediment resuspension in future modelling studies particularly in the context of developing countries it is important to carefully consider the contributions from the diffuse sources this study is one of the first to model fib in developing countries and shows that even with limited data availability this modelling approach can generate useful data to support implementation of mitigation measures to reduce faecal contamination of surface waters this study serves as a test case for other river basins with similar conditions and this modelling approach can be applied in other watersheds the developed model can be used to provide input data for microbial risk assessment and to forecast future impacts of climate change and socio economic development on the microbial water quality this modelling study provides information to support decisions by water managers in the context of reducing the widespread faecal contamination and the risks of waterborne disease outbreaks which are the leading cause of death in developing countries the study emphasises the need for treatment of wastewater before it is discharged into the rivers and canals and underlines the importance for countries to achieve sdg 6 3 acknowledgements we thank the ministry of science and technology of the

7192,the low resolution characteristic of passive microwave surface soil moisture ssm products greatly limits their application in many fields at regional or local scale aiming to overcome this limitation a random forest rf based downscaling approach was proposed in this study to disaggregate the soil moisture active and passive smap ssm product with the synergistic use of the optical thermal infrared tir observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis onboard the terra and aqua satellites the iberian peninsula was selected as the study area during the period from 2015 to 2016 first the performance of the rf based approach in building the ssm relationship model with surface variables surface temperature vegetation index leaf area index albedo water index solar factor and elevation was compared with that resulting from a widely used polynomial based relationship model good agreement was achieved for the rf based method with a correlation coefficient r above 0 95 and a mean root mean square deviation rmsd of 0 009 m3 m3 next four data combinations am terra am aqua pm terra and pm aqua were generated according to the different overpass times of the smap and modis observations and they were separately used to derive the spatially downscaled ssm with the proposed rf based downscaling method validation was performed with the in situ measurements from the remedhus network of the university of salamanca in spain the results indicated that all combinations have similar good performances with an unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd of 0 022 m3 m3 and the downscaled ssm at 1 km spatial resolution presented better accuracy while showing higher spatial heterogeneity and more detailed temporal pattern finally the temporal changing pattern of the downscaled ssm was assessed with the precipitation time series from eight meteorological stations in the study area and the rainfall effect on the variation of ssm was well tracked from its temporal changes overall this study suggests that the proposed rf based downscaling method is able to capture the variation of ssm well and it should be helpful to improve the resolution of passive microwave soil moisture data and facilitate their applications at small scales keywords downscaling smap modis surface soil moisture random forest validation 1 introduction as a key parameter in controlling the water cycle and energy budgets of land ecosystem brocca et al 2010 crow et al 2012 petropoulos et al 2015 land surface soil moisture ssm has potential value for the environmental studies and applications in a wide range including drought detection bolten et al 2010 wang et al 2016 water resource assessment dobriyal et al 2012 renzullo et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 weather prediction dirmeyer et al 2016 tuttle and salvucci 2016 and geohazard modeling and monitoring ponziani et al 2012 ray et al 2010 therefore it is of great importance to derive accurate information on ssm not only with high accuracy but also with wide spatial coverage for many studies concerning major land surface processes dorigo et al 2017 jaeger and seneviratne 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 however ssm usually presents high spatio temporal variability due to the complex interactions among topographic pedologic vegetative and meteorological factors crow et al 2012 peng et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 although many conventional ground based measurements of ssm such as capacitance probe time domain reflectometry gravimetric measurement and neutron probe can provide reliable soil water content at different depths the observations suffer a lot from the poor spatial representativeness of the discrete information at particular points consequently it is not realistic to get spatially and temporally continuous coverage of ssm at different spatial scales based on ground measurement due to its limitation of high cost and labor intensity rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 comparatively remote sensing technique offers an alternative to ground based ssm measurements and shows promise in mapping ssm from regional to global scale with different frequency the technical progress achieved in microwave remote sensing accelerates the development of ssm products of global availability due to the direct connection between the electromagnetic radiation and ssm meanwhile microwave remote sensing presents a big advantage in its all weather and all time capability when compared with optical thermal infrared tir remote sensing therefore efforts have been devoted to derive ssm including the l band missions the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 aquarius bindlish et al 2015 and the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010b additionally there are also many other global ssm products provided by shorter wavelength c and x band missions such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e njoku et al 2003 the metop a advanced scatterometer bartalis et al 2007 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 parinussa et al 2015 however the ssm retrievals of most missions mentioned above are characterized by low spatial resolution several tens of kilometers which greatly limits the applications at regional and local scales normally 1 10 km therefore to get the sub pixel ssm information from low resolution microwave sensors several downscaling approaches were studied in most of the proposed methods the finer resolution remote sensing data from the optical tir sensors were commonly used to provide complementary information to the ssm the theoretical foundation within the synergistic use of optical tir remote sensing data and microwave products during the downscaling process relies on the correlation among ssm land surface temperature lst and vegetation parameters many empirical regression methods chauhan et al 2003 fang et al 2013 kim and hogue 2012 piles et al 2016 piles et al 2014 zhao and li 2013 and physically based models merlin et al 2013 merlin et al 2008 peng et al 2016 have been proposed to construct the relationship model between optical tir observations and ssm the so called polynomial fitting approach is developed on the basis of a universal triangle space between lst and vegetation index and alternatively the evaporation based approach is based on the correlation between ssm and soil water condition index however the numerical expression cannot fully represent the complex nonlinear relationship between ssm and other surface variables zhao and li 2015 and zhao et al 2017 examined the performance of the polynomial fitting approach by analyzing the regression results of surface variables from optical tir observations against amsr e ssm data and the in situ ssm measurements respectively the fitting results indicated that the performance of the model showed relatively high variations with the coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 2 to 0 9 and that generally worse results can be found from the regression with microwave remote sensing derived ssm data similarly peng et al 2015 conducted a correlation analysis between the in situ ssm measurements and the vegetation temperature condition index vtci constructed from moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis and meteosat second generation msg observations and found a big range in terms of the correlation coefficients r it partly indicated that the simple use of vtci as a proxy of ssm was hard to represent soil moisture changes with a high accuracy level inspired by the uncertainty related to the relationship construction the derivation of the accuracy acceptant model was still a major task in most downscaling schemes and this issue was usually ignored the errors associated with the relationship model construction would propagate into the derivation of the final downscaling ssm at the higher resolution scale therefore a robust approach to improve current downscaling methods should be rather easy to handle while being able to well describe the nonlinear relationship between ssm and a larger set of surface variables across a variety of land surface conditions to capture the nonlinear relationship instead of the commonly used methods in previous studies im et al 2016 inaugurated a research line in downscaling by introducing machine learning approaches to build the complex relationship between ssm data from amsr e and other surface variables from modis products the random forest rf approach showed good potential to describe this relationship with an r value of 0 95 and root mean squared error rmse of 0 024 m3 m3 the capability of this approach was also proven in surface temperature downscaling studies with modis lst products hutengs and vohland 2016 sismanidis et al 2017 yang et al 2017 on the basis of the above insights the present study aims at evaluating the performance of rf regression method in constructing the nonlinear relationship between ssm and other surface variables and downscaling passive microwave ssm product from tens of kilometers to 1 km spatial resolution time series of smap passive microwave ssm products and modis products were collected during a 2 year period from 2015 to 2016 at the iberian peninsula a comparison study was first conducted to test the ssm relationship model constructed by the rf regression method vs a polynomial fitting based method to highlight the advantages of the rf based method then the proposed rf based downscaling approach was applied to obtain high resolution ssm data and the downscaled results were evaluated by two field datasets in this region in situ soil moisture measurements from a dense observational network remedhus of the university of salamanca and daily precipitation of eight metrological stations from the european climate assessment dataset http www ecad eu on this basis some general findings for low resolution passive microwave soil moisture product downscaling were inferred which may also be useful to generate high resolution soil moisture data for study and application at regional or local scale 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area and ground based observations considering its usual clear sky conditions almost all the iberian peninsula was selected as the study area denoted as the red rectangle in fig 1 this area is large enough to cover a sufficient number of coarse resolution smap ssm pixels while excluding the influence of the ocean in general according to the modis land cover product this area has mixed landscapes but is dominated by the major land cover types of croplands open shrublands and woody savannas with partial forests located in the central mountain areas the mean elevation is approximately 650 m above sea level with the range from 4 m to 2418 m it mostly belongs to the mediterranean region with a semi arid climate characterized by warm to hot summers with a lengthy period of drought and cool to mild and wet winters therefore the soil moisture condition usually keeps to a relatively low level during the dry seasons in this study area there is a dense soil moisture observation network remedhus https ismn geo tuwien ac at networks remedhus in the central sector of the duero basin spain 41 1 to 41 5 n and 5 2 to 5 6 w the network has provided intensive hourly measurements of ssm at the top 5 cm with hydra probes stevens water monitoring system inc since march 2003 its relatively flat surface with similar land cover conditions makes it an ideal site for many soil moisture validation studies al yaari et al 2017 parinussa et al 2015 peng et al 2015 piles et al 2014 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 zhao and li 2013 sanchez et al 2012 presented a more detailed information about the area and the network therefore the network should be a good choice to evaluate the performance of the proposed downscaling method and the in situ measurements form 18 sites in 2015 and 2016 were chosen according to the availability of the smap soil moisture products in this study in addition to the in situ ssm measurements the daily precipitation of eight meteorological stations were collected from the european climate assessment dataset eca d klein tank et al 2002 for the study period the stations are located in separated parts of the study area fig 1 to represent different surface and climate conditions the changes in daily precipitation reflect the wetting drying cycle of ssm and are therefore useful to test the reliability of the downscaling results 2 2 data 2 2 1 smap soil moisture the smap satellite is one of the latest l band missions launched on january 31 2015 and aiming to generate global ssm map at different resolution levels with an l band radar active and radiometer passive it is operated in a near polar orbit with the ascending and descending overpass times of 6 00 pm and 6 00 am at local time the satellite was meant to provide soil moisture products with three spatial resolutions 36 km passive o neill et al 2016 9 km active passive entekhabi et al 2010a and 3 km active radar however the radar failure that occurred on july 7 2015 limited the generation of the active and active passive soil moisture data and it is expected to use the sentinel 1 mission as a replacement of the radar to achieve a 1 km resolution now the smap sentinel 1 level 2 l2 radiometer radar 3 km ease grid soil moisture spl2smap s version 1 is available at the national aeronautics and space administration nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac with the 1 km resolution data under scientific analysis narendra et al 2017 therefore the smap passive soil moisture product plays an important role to monitoring global soil moisture conditions and recent validation studies have confirmed its good potential in capturing the dynamics of ssm with an accuracy that met the mission requirement chen et al 2017 colliander et al 2017 pan et al 2016 in this study the smap level 3 l3 passive soil moisture product spl3smp version 4 distributed with 36 km equal area scalable earth ease grid was used this product is a daily product generated by compositing the l2 half orbit granules o neill et al 2015 and provides a composite of daily ssm estimates at global level since march 31 2015 which include the estimates of the ascending and descending half orbits it is available from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org data smap for the whole dataset in 2015 and 2016 2 2 2 modis products in any downscaling scheme it is important to establish the relationship between ssm and the rest of surface variables previous downscaling studies have demonstrated the potential of land

relationship with ssm chauhan et al 2003 peng et al 2015 piles et al 2010 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 zhao and li 2013 therefore all these variables were obtained from the corresponding modis products including the 1 km resolution daily surface temperature mod11a1 and myd11a1 modis terra 1 km resolution 16 day vegetation index mod13a2 modis terra aqua 1 km resolution 16 day albedo mcd43b3 modis terra aqua 1 km resolution 8 day leaf area index lai mcd15a2 and modis terra 500 m resolution 8 day surface reflectance mod09a1 they were acquired from the u s land processes distributed active archive center lpdaac usgs gov for the lst products both modis terra and aqua lst products were chosen however only daytime lst was introduced in this study considering its common use in previous downscaling studies and its relatively high sensitivity to ssm due to its large variation in the daytime in addition the sensitivity analysis conducted by peng et al 2015 indicated the priority of daytime lst in expressing the connection with ssm pablos et al 2016 also found that the downscaling results using modis daytime lst had better performances than nighttime lst because of the synergistic use of modis and smap in the downscaling study their temporal differences in local equatorial crossing times should be considered similar as the overpass characteristic of smos for the use of smap ssm products the regional ssm distribution can be assumed to be spatially persistent from the modis overpass and smap overpass piles et al 2014 moreover to ensure the robustness of the constructed relationship between ssm and other surface variables a cloud free scenery for the modis terra and aqua lst products over the study area was required 2 2 3 topographic data in addition to the above satellite data the nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 30 arcsec resolution 1 km version 2 1 obtained from the land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov was used to provide topographic factors elevation slope and aspect for the downscaling study in order to summarize all the dataset included in the proposed model table 1 depicts an overview of the major spatial datasets the description about the corresponding variable and the number of granules of each dataset in this study it should be noted here that the ndwi was first derived based on the mod09a1 at 500 m resolution then a spatial aggregation was performed to get the same resolution 1 km as lst and the other variables 2 3 rf based downscaling approach 2 3 1 random forest method the rf method proposed by breiman 2001 is a popularly used machine learning method which can be applied in classification regression and other tasks for regression task a number of decision trees are first built during the training time and the mean prediction of the individual trees is generated as the output of this method in general according to the adaptive nature of the decision rules involved in it rf has the advantage in modeling the complex nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the response variable instead of detailed numerical expressions hutengs and vohland 2016 in detail the input data acts as the training data in the rf method and rf divides them into many regression trees making up the forest where each tree is built from a bootstrap sample which contains about two thirds of the input data each split is selected from a random subset of a given number m of the p variables during this process the number of trees ntree is also a key parameter in the forest for each bootstrap sampling process the left samples will be not included in the model construction and they act as the out of bag samples or oob which is an important feature of rf the oob can be used to validate the performance of the constructed model and the mean squared error mse based on oob samples are a reliable test error estimate which is almost identical to that obtained by k fold cross validation in this study the number of variables selected at each split was set to 3 based on a number of testing results and the number of trees was set to 1000 according to the stabilizing feature of the oob error 2 3 2 predictors selection and rf based downscaling procedure as introduced in section 2 2 2 lst ndvi evi alb lai and ndwi were used as predictors in the rf based ssm relationship model in addition as an important predictor of ssm it should be noted that lst shows a relevant relationship with surface elevation and incident solar radiation which is the key energy source to heat the land surface as a result in some cases the changes in lst are not only related to surface soil water conditions but also connected with the variations in these topography related variables and this effect should be considered for the study area the elevation map shown in fig 1indicates that the study area has a wide range of surface elevations therefore surface elevation was also introduced as a predictor in the rf based ssm relationship model construction to present its interactions with lst and ssm the incident solar radiation was represented by the cumulative incident solar radiation r c by integrating the instantaneous incident solar radiation r s from sunrise t 0 to the satellite overpass time t s considering the dominant effect of the direct solar radiation r b on r s r c is approximated by the following expression 1 r c t t 0 t s r b t in which 2 r b t s 0 1 0 0344 cos 2 π doy 365 τ b cos θ t where s0 is the solar irradiance 1367 w m2 doy is the day of year and τ b is the beam radiative transmittance under a clear sky the local solar zenith angle θt varies with the change of the solar illumination angle and it can be defined as the angle between the solar incident vector and the line perpendicular to the surface dozier and frew 1990 3 cos θ t cos z sun t cos s sin z sun t sin s cos a sun t a where z sun t and a sun t are the solar angles zenith and azimuth at time t respectively and a and s are the surface angles aspect and slope under the assumption that there is a clear sky condition during this period and the transmittance is a constant value in the study area r b t only changes with the variation of θt as shown in 4 4 r c k t t 0 t s θ t k f a where 5 k s 0 1 0 0344 cos 2 π doy 365 τ b f a t t 0 t s θ t where k is assumed to be a constant term for a certain day and fa is the integration of θt from sunrise to the satellite overpass therefore r c can be simply approximated by fa to represent the differences in the cumulative incident solar radiation among different pixels and fa was chosen as a proxy of r c to be a predictor in the rf based ssm relationship model finally the interrelationship between the above selected predictors and ssm was developed with a nonlinear function f r using the rf regression method 6 ssm f r t s ndvi evi alb lai ndwi f a elevation where t s is lst with the constructed ssm relationship model between the smap ssm data and the rest of the surface proxy variables at the coarse resolution scale in 6 it was assumed that the relationship model was spatial scale independent and the model was directly applied to the fine resolution modis data to get the final high resolution ssm data fig 2 shows the downscaling process as well as the evaluation of the procedure the following steps explain the flowchart step 1 the surface variables from modis observations at the 1 km resolution scale were first aggregated into the 36 km grid with a simple average function to match the coarse resolution of the smap ssm data step 2 the ssm relationship model was constructed with the rf based regression method to compare the performance of the rf based method a polynomial fitting regression method widely used in previous downscaling studies was introduced as reference in this polynomial fitting method ssm was depicted as a polynomial form of lst ndvi and other surface parameters based on their explored relationship with optical tir remote sensing based soil moisture estimations carlson 2007 sun et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 the form of the method proposed by chauhan et al 2003 was chosen and it was expressed as 7 7 ssm f p t s ndvi alb a 000 a 100 t s a 010 ndvi a 001 alb a 200 t s 2 a 020 ndv i 2 a 002 al b 2 a 110 t s ndvi a 101 t s alb a 011 alb ndvi where a ijk are the regression coefficients during the regression because of the different overpass times in daytime for modis terra approximately 10 30 am local time modis aqua approximately 1 30 pm local time smap descending 6 00 am local time and smap ascending 6 00 pm local time four different combinations were considered to investigate the performance of the models built with different daytime surface temperature terra and aqua and soil moisture proxies am and pm and other variables kept to the same dataset on each day the four combinations were simplified as am terra am aqua pm terra and pm aqua when both the smap ssm data and the modis products are available for the whole study there will be 270 smap cells and 346634 modis pixels involved in the downscaling study however due to the scanning gap of smap and the cloud cover in the modis observations the availability of both datasets is hard to satisfy for each day in this study only days when more than 100 coarse resolution cells having effective values in ssm and other surface variables were selected and the number of the qualified days for each combination during the study period is listed in table 2 step 3 a preliminary assessment was then conducted to compare the accuracy of the regression results with the rf based model and those of the polynomial fitting model for the four different combinations for this purpose daily values of the correlation coefficient r and root mean square deviation rmsd m3 m3 between the smap ssm and the estimated ssm at the smap grid scale with the two regression models were obtained and compared step 4 the ssm relationship model constructed by the proposed rf based method was applied to the variables at 1 km resolution to obtain high resolution ssm data at the modis pixel resolution then the downscaled ssm data was validated with the in situ soil moisture from the remedhus network and the precipitation measurements at the eight selected meteorological stations 3 results 3 1 model comparison fig 3 shows the r and rmsd values derived from the polynomial fitting regression model for the four combinations on the selected days during the two year period obviously there is a good agreement between the estimated ssm and the smap ssm for most days however poor correlation can be still found for some days with r 0 5 denoted with red color in fig 3 the pm terra and pm aqua generally had higher r values than those of am terra and am aqua the mean r values of the above two combinations pm terra and pm aqua were 0 840 and 0 844 respectively the mean r values of am terra and am aqua combinations were 0 791 and 0 796 respectively the comparison in terms of rmsd under different combinations also confirmed the results concluded as mentioned above the mean rmsd values of am terra and am aqua combinations were slightly bigger than those of pm terra and pm aqua combinations the performance differences among different combinations can be partly explained by the different sensitivity of the ssm to lst during the daytime the solar illumination induced the changes in lst which showed high correlation with ssm in contrast the surface temperature and moisture profile tended to be uniform at an equilibrium station in the early morning or nighttime wu et al 2016 which showed low sensitivity to lst in the daytime therefore the regression model had slightly better performances for the pm terra and pm aqua combinations than those of the am terra and am aqua combinations however the regression model did not show an obvious influence on the use of terra lst data or aqua lst data the metrics shown in fig 3 suggest that the model performances for the same ssm product with different lst datasets exhibited a similar accuracy level comparatively fig 4 displays the statistics derived from the ssm estimates with the rf based regression model it seems clear that there is a good correlation between the estimates and the smap ssm data with r values more than 0 95 for all cases the rmsd values also show great improvements decreasing from the mean value approximately 0 025 m3 m3 in fig 3 to the mean value of 0 009 m3 m3 regarding the combinations the result was similar as those found with the polynomial fitting regression model i e the pm terra and pm aqua combinations had a slightly better performance than the am terra and am aqua combinations but with very small differences meanwhile the difference in the regression with terra lst data or aqua lst data was also quite small with respect to the model performance among the different days the changes in terms of the r and rmsd values were smaller than 0 05 and 0 015 m3 m3 respectively suggesting the stable performance of the rf based regression model in general the relationship model comparison results indicated the strength of the rf based regression model in representing the complex relationship between ssm and other surface variables the good consistency between the estimated ssm and the smap ssm confirmed its good ability to depict ssm spatial variations 3 2 downscaling results with rf based approach considering the good performance of the quantitative relationship model between ssm and the other surface variables built by the rf based regression method the model was then applied to the high resolution variables to obtain high resolution ssm data from smap to evaluate the quality of the downscaling approach a visual comparison was conducted between the downscaled ssm maps at the modis pixel scale and the original coarse resolution from smap ssm data fig 5 a and b show the spatial distribution of the downscaled ssm data for the am terra combination and am aqua combination on a given day of year doy 136 2015 the corresponding smap am ssm data is presented in fig 5c from the effective ssm value coverage it can be found that both the smap ssm data and the downscaled ssm data cannot fully cover the study area which is attributed to the smap scanning gap and the cloud cover in the case of modis observation therefore the rf based regression model was established with the data available from smap ssm data and modis products however the downscaled ssm data can effectively fill the scanning gap of smap observations and generate high resolution ssm maps if modis observations are available in the gap region from a visual perspective both the high and coarse resolution ssm maps showed similar spatial distribution patterns over the study area moreover the downscaled high resolution ssm data within each smap cell fall into a reasonable range coinciding with the smap ssm value at the given cell no underestimation nor overestimation exist in the downscaled results similar spatial patterns of the fine scale ssm maps were generated with the two combinations am terra and am aqua the difference map between these two combinations shown in fig 6 indicates that there are very small differences with maximum and minimum differences of 0 015 m3 m3 and 0 020 m3 m3 respectively according to the histogram of the differences the mean difference value is 0 m3 m3 with a standard deviation of 0 003 m3 m3 these statistics suggest that the selection of terra or aqua lst data has a small impact on the final downscaling results as found in the visual comparison the results from the second combination pm terra and pm aqua for the given day of doy 318 2015 together with the corresponding smap pm ssm are shown in fig 7 although there are few gaps in the downscaling results the downscaled ssm data with the pm terra combination fig 7a and the pm aqua combination fig 7b present quite similar distribution and values over the study area also in good consistency with the original smap pm ssm fig 7c the small differences between the downscaled ssm of these two combinations can be reflected by the differences map fig 8 a and the histogram fig 8b the difference ranges from 0 025 m3 m3 to 0 040 m3 m3 with a mean difference of 0 001 m3 m3 and a standard deviation of 0 005 m3 m3 although figs 5 and 7 only present the ssm downscaling results on two specific days it seems that the rf based downscaling approach is able to generate high resolution ssm maps with different dataset combinations with consistent distribution according to the similar performance of the rf based regression model shown in fig 4 among all the selected days due to the different observation systems of the smap and modis sensors the scanning gap of the smap observation can be partly filled if the modis observations are available as shown in fig 5 however the cloud cover contamination in the modis observation is hard to remove in the downscaled ssm with a single combination fortunately the small difference in the downscaling results for the same smap ssm with different modis observations as shown in figs 6 and 8 suggests the use of composite products merging terra and aqua to mitigate the influence of cloud cover in a single combination regarding the composite method a simple solution was applied so that the blank pixel in the downscaled ssm data of one combination was filled with the available value from another combination for example fig 9 shows the composite ssm map with the downscaled ssm from the pm terra and pm aqua combinations shown in fig 7 this spatial distribution of ssm is consistent with those of the separated results but with fewer blank values the filling effect is obvious for the pm terra downscaling results and the blank pixels of the pm aqua downscaling results within the red ellipse in fig 9 is also filled with the downscaling results from the pm terra combination therefore the use of composite products will be helpful to improve the data coverage in the high resolution ssm data 3 3 validation 3 3 1 validation with the in situ ssm measurements from the remedhus network to ensure a fair comparison between the coarse resolution of smap the finer scale of the downscaled results and the point measurements the validation of the original smap ssm product and the downscaling results using the in situ measurements was conducted at the network level the smap ssm value over the network scale was represented by the averaged value of the smap cells covering the network while the downscaled ssm data over the network was averaged to represent the regional value the validation results of the smap am ssm data and their corresponding downscaled ssm data with terra lst and aqua lst are shown in fig 10 each point corresponds to the day when both the coarse and fine resolution ssm were available although fig 10a and c present the same comparison between the in situ measurements and the smap am ssm data there is a slightly difference in the days involved in the validation due to the availability of the modis lst products from terra and aqua however the performances are quite similar in terms of rmsd regarding the performance of the downscaled ssm data of the first two combinations am terra and am aqua an obvious improvement in the coefficient of determination r2 and rmsd was found for both when compared with the validation for the coarse resolution smap am ssm data the improvement in r2 for the am terra combination and the am aqua combination are 0 031 and 0 071 respectively the decrease in rmsd is also more significant for the second combination additionally fig 11 illustrates the validation results for the pm terra and pm aqua combinations similar performance can be found as in fig 10 the downscaled ssm data fig 11b and d has a better agreement with the in situ measurements over the network scale than the original smap ssm data fig 11a and c the improvement in rmsd is close to 0 01 m3 m3 for both combinations comparatively the comparison between metrics derived from the validation results of the downscaled ssm following four combinations indicated the relatively good accuracy of the downscaled ssm with smap am ssm product the better agreement can be highlighted by an increase in r2 0 11 on average and a decrease in rmsd 0 026 m3 m3 this finding confirmed the conclusion drawn by some evaluation studies that the smap am ssm retrievals were more reliable than the pm retrievals chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 in addition as also found in the study conducted by chen et al 2017 there was a systematic dry bias during the validation this underestimation should be partly attributed to the underestimation of smap surface temperature 3 3 2 temporal validation with precipitation data the temporal behavior of the downscaled ssm data was also evaluated with the daily precipitation collected from meteorological stations during the period of study since full maps of the downscaled ssm data calculated with the single combination are scarce and considering the good agreement between the downscaling results with terra lst and aqua lst a composite of the four combinations was used for this analysis as shown is section 3 2 fig 12 shows the time series of the downscaled ssm data the smap ssm data and daily precipitation of eight selected stations from the time series comparisons although there were large scale differences between the downscaled ssm data and the smap ssm data they showed good temporal consistency especially for stations 416 424 3921 and 3944 this suggests that the downscaled ssm largely maintains the temporal changing feature of the smap ssm regarding the temporal behavior against daily precipitation the plots show that the temporal variation of the ssm can be captured well according to its good response to the rainfall event no matter for the downscaled ssm data or the smap ssm data for each station the soil moisture condition during the dry periods denoted by the orange box in the figure remained low due to a strong evapotranspiration effect obvious upward and downward trends can be observed after the scarce rainfall events during the dry seasons in all stations however the ssm changing magnitude of both datasets responding to different certain rainfall events are quite different for example the downscaled ssm data in the blue ellipse for stations 233 and 3945 presented more reasonable values with a larger increase in ssm than the smap ssm data due to the heavy precipitation in previous days in contrast the downscaled ssm data restrained the overestimation when the smap ssm data showed a great increase in the soil moisture condition even for a relatively small rainfall event according to the estimates in the blue ellipse for stations 336 and 416 similar phenomena can be found for other days in the selected meteorological stations this partially confirmed the reliability of the downscaled ssm data in addition to the dry period according to the relatively high value for the downscaled ssm data and smap ssm data the surface of all stations usually maintains a relatively wet condition during the period from october 2015 to may 2016 and the period from october 2016 to december 2016 due to the cool climate and frequent rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 regression variable importance the assessment of the ssm relationship model indicated the big advantage of the rf based regression method in expressing the complex interactions between the ssm and other surface variables an overall improvement in the correlation coefficient can be observed for the ssm estimates using the rf based regression compared with those from the polynomial regression with an average increment in r of 0 16 and an average decrease in rmsd of 0 011 m3 m3 more importantly regarding the time series performance of the rf based regression model the model was capable of providing a robust and stable relationship between ssm and other surface variables as was also found in im et al 2016 using amsr e soil moisture and modis products during the nonlinear relationship construction the rf method is able to provide the importance of each variable based on the randomized variable selection process used in building the rf the importance scores are presented by incmse which indicates how much mse increases when that variable is randomly permuted the larger the value of incmse of a variable the more important that variable is to the model fig 13 shows the averaged variable importance scores derived from all available days of the four combinations and their corresponding standard deviations higher scores can be found for lst due to the controlling effect of ssm on surface energy exchange and partition similar to the results of im et al 2016 in addition as the commonly used variables to represent ssm variation in the triangle based methods krapez and olioso 2011 leng et al 2016 yang et al 2015 surface albedo and ndvi also exhibited high importance on the ssm the lai had a similar importance to ndvi because of its good ability to represent vegetation cover peng et al 2015 however evi was less important as also found in the regression results with the in situ measurements in zhao et al 2017 the solar factor f a also showed a significant influence on ssm prediction as a proxy for the cumulative solar radiation it not only reflected the impact on the evolution of lst but also represented the aspect information of surface topography south facing slopes have bigger f a but lower ssm according to the theory that south facing slopes usually receive more solar radiation with more xeric and warmer condition while north facing slopes is easy to retain moisture due to relatively weak evapotranspiration måren et al 2015 in contrast the effect of the dem taken separately is weak finally the importance of ndwi was similar to those of ndvi and lai in addition to the averaged values the vertical error bars illustrate the standard deviation of the importance scores of each variable the error bars indicates that the variable importance score has high variability and it can be attributed to the number of the samples involved in the regression and the temporal changes in surface variables moreover the inter correlation among the variables also influences the scores the lst has the biggest variation followed by albedo and f a it suggests that the contributions of these three variables to ssm changes show high temporal variability due to their variable responses to ssm for instance lst shows low sensitivity to ssm during the winter season and f a has a relatively small difference in summer than winter resulting in a low correlation with ssm in general the variable importance analysis suggests the appropriate selection of the eight variables in the prediction model construction which supports the findings of the optical tir based ssm estimation studies carlson 2007 krapez and olioso 2011 leng et al 2016 sun et al 2012 that the commonly used variables in the triangle space are good proxies to estimate ssm the addition of ndwi and the solar factor also improved the downscaling results due to the relatively high importance in the variable importance ranking which underpinned their use as key factors related to ssm in the algorithm 4 2 impacts from spatial scale differences to construct the relationship model the selected surface predictors at high resolution should be aggregated to the low resolution of the smap ssm product however the aggregation from 1 km to 36 km greatly smoothed the spatial changes of the involved surface variables and resulted in a regression model construction with few extreme values in the training data taking the surface elevation as an example the maximum and minimum values at the 1 km scale were 2418 m and 4 m respectively however during the rf based regression model training with variables at 36 km the value range of the surface elevation changed from 152 m to 1507 m because of this smoothing effect a similar effect should exist for other variables on the other hand the scale difference between the optical tir remote sensing data and smap product partly constrained the availability of selecting enough observation data to construct the regression model consequently it was necessary to select an area large enough to support the amount of the training samples required and to ensure real changes in surface soil wetness therefore almost the entire peninsula was selected as the study area however its size made it difficult to maintain the assumption that the study area had uniform atmospheric forcings which is a key theoretical basis for the triangle based ssm retrieval algorithm mallick et al 2009 consequently the results of the polynomial regression had a relatively poor effect in describing the spatial variations of ssm in contrast the rf based approach introduced the solar and topographic factors to depict the climatic changes impacted by these two key factors meanwhile similar to the results indicated by hutengs and vohland 2016 the predictive range of ssm at the fine scale is restricted to the ranges of the coarse resolution ssm covered by the training data in other words the ranges in the downscaled ssm are highly connected with the surface soil wetness differences in the training samples therefore the size of the training sample and its representativeness greatly impact the final downscaling results during this study days with less than 100 training samples were excluded in the regression however the cloud cover in the optical tir remote sensing data and the scanning gap of smap observation blocked the flow of enough training samples for the selected study area therefore hampering the generation of the time series of fine scale ssm data as a possible solution the use of the composite product aqua terra was proposed to improve the full coverage of the fine scale ssm map 4 3 regression residual correction although good agreement was achieved for the estimates with the rf based regression model and the rmsds were relatively small for most cases as shown in fig 4 the residuals between the estimates and the original smap ssm values were ignored during the downscaling process in turn it was certain that the integration of the downscaled ssm data were hard to achieve the value consistency across scales when comparing the corresponding smap ssm cell value to ensure the equality of ssm at different scales the residual correction should be performed in future studies a uniform weight residual correction method was applied in previous lst downscaling studies hutengs and vohland 2016 yang et al 2017 by adding the residual to each fine resolution prediction but notable box shaped artifacts will be introduced into the downscaled results under poor prediction cases therefore a nonuniform weight residual correction method is a better way to omit this influence such as the atprk algorithm proposed by wang et al 2015 4 4 systematic bias correction in the experiments four combinations of lst aqua terra with smap ascending descending were made it is worthwhile to conclude that the use of smap am or pm ssm product with modis terra or aqua lst can generate a similar fine resolution ssm with close accuracy however the systematic errors of smap soil moisture products were propagated to them especially for the low ssm conditions to reduce this impact a linear relationship was derived between the smap ssm data and the in situ measurements of each combination and acted as the bias correction form of the smap ssm data then it was applied to the downscaled ssm data resulting in a bias corrected downscaled ssm data as shown in fig 14 the recalibrated downscaled ssm data had better correlation with the in situ measurements than the results shown in figs 10 and 11 and the fitted lines are closer to the 1 1 line the underestimation problem at the low value regime is greatly improved with an unbiased rmsd ubrmsd of 0 022 m3 m3 5 conclusions a new method is proposed in this study for downscaling passive microwave low resolution ssm product using remote sensing data from optical tir observations based on the rf method the ssm relationship constructed by the proposed rf based approach outperforms the traditional polynomial fitting polynomial regression in addition four data combinations between smap ssm products ascending and descending and modis lst products terra and aqua were introduced in this study to compare the effectiveness of the downscaling results the comparison results based on statistical measures and visual analyses show that the four combinations achieved similar performances with satisfactory accuracy when validated with the in situ ssm measurements and time series of precipitation data from individual stations the validation results with the averaged in situ measurements indicate well the improvement of the downscaled ssm data as comparison to the original smap ssm product with a general improvement in the rmsd of 0 01 m3 m3 and the accuracy of the downscaled ssm data can achieve a high level with an rmsd of 0 022 m3 m3 when the systematic error of the smap ssm product is corrected in general the downscaling results not only show better spatial heterogeneity but also present good temporal consistency in terms of time series precipitation from ground meteorological stations the changes between dry and wet season and the effect of rainfall event can be well reflected by the downscaled ssm data moreover the similar downscaling accuracy of the four combinations suggests that the downscaled ssm data of each combination can be used to generate a composite high resolution ssm data to partly reduce the impact on the data availability due to the smap scanning and cloud cover with more frequent temporal coverage and larger spatial availability acknowledgments we acknowledge

7192,the low resolution characteristic of passive microwave surface soil moisture ssm products greatly limits their application in many fields at regional or local scale aiming to overcome this limitation a random forest rf based downscaling approach was proposed in this study to disaggregate the soil moisture active and passive smap ssm product with the synergistic use of the optical thermal infrared tir observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis onboard the terra and aqua satellites the iberian peninsula was selected as the study area during the period from 2015 to 2016 first the performance of the rf based approach in building the ssm relationship model with surface variables surface temperature vegetation index leaf area index albedo water index solar factor and elevation was compared with that resulting from a widely used polynomial based relationship model good agreement was achieved for the rf based method with a correlation coefficient r above 0 95 and a mean root mean square deviation rmsd of 0 009 m3 m3 next four data combinations am terra am aqua pm terra and pm aqua were generated according to the different overpass times of the smap and modis observations and they were separately used to derive the spatially downscaled ssm with the proposed rf based downscaling method validation was performed with the in situ measurements from the remedhus network of the university of salamanca in spain the results indicated that all combinations have similar good performances with an unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd of 0 022 m3 m3 and the downscaled ssm at 1 km spatial resolution presented better accuracy while showing higher spatial heterogeneity and more detailed temporal pattern finally the temporal changing pattern of the downscaled ssm was assessed with the precipitation time series from eight meteorological stations in the study area and the rainfall effect on the variation of ssm was well tracked from its temporal changes overall this study suggests that the proposed rf based downscaling method is able to capture the variation of ssm well and it should be helpful to improve the resolution of passive microwave soil moisture data and facilitate their applications at small scales keywords downscaling smap modis surface soil moisture random forest validation 1 introduction as a

al 2010 however ssm usually presents high spatio temporal variability due to the complex interactions among topographic pedologic vegetative and meteorological factors crow et al 2012 peng et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 although many conventional ground based measurements of ssm such as capacitance probe time domain reflectometry gravimetric measurement and neutron probe can provide reliable soil water content at different depths the observations suffer a lot from the poor spatial representativeness of the discrete information at particular points consequently it is not realistic to get spatially and temporally continuous coverage of ssm at different spatial scales based on ground measurement due to its limitation of high cost and labor intensity rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 comparatively remote sensing technique offers an alternative to ground based ssm measurements and shows promise in mapping ssm from regional to global scale with different frequency the technical progress achieved in microwave remote sensing accelerates the development of ssm products of global availability due to the direct connection between the electromagnetic radiation and ssm meanwhile microwave remote sensing presents a big advantage in its all weather and all time capability when compared with optical thermal infrared tir remote sensing therefore efforts have been devoted to derive ssm including the l band missions the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 aquarius bindlish et al 2015 and the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010b additionally there are also many other global ssm products provided by shorter wavelength c and x band missions such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e njoku et al 2003 the metop a advanced scatterometer bartalis et al 2007 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 parinussa et al 2015 however the ssm retrievals of most missions mentioned above are characterized by low spatial resolution several tens of kilometers which greatly limits the applications at regional and local scales normally 1 10 km therefore to get the sub pixel ssm information from low resolution microwave sensors several downscaling approaches were studied in most of the proposed methods the finer resolution remote sensing data from the optical tir sensors were commonly used to provide complementary information to the ssm the theoretical foundation within the synergistic use of optical tir remote sensing data and microwave products during the downscaling process relies on the correlation among ssm land surface temperature lst and vegetation parameters many empirical regression methods chauhan et al 2003 fang et al 2013 kim and hogue 2012 piles et al 2016 piles et al 2014 zhao and li 2013 and physically based models merlin et al 2013 merlin et al 2008 peng et al 2016 have been proposed to construct the relationship model between optical tir observations and ssm the so called polynomial fitting approach is developed on the basis of a universal triangle space between lst and vegetation index and alternatively the evaporation based approach is based on the correlation between ssm and soil water condition index however the numerical expression cannot fully represent the complex nonlinear relationship between ssm and other surface variables zhao and li 2015 and zhao et al 2017 examined the performance of the polynomial fitting approach by analyzing the regression results of surface variables from optical tir observations against amsr e ssm data and the in situ ssm measurements respectively the fitting results indicated that the performance of the model showed relatively high variations with the coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 2 to 0 9 and that generally worse results can be found from the regression with microwave remote sensing derived ssm data similarly peng et al 2015 conducted a correlation analysis between the in situ ssm measurements and the vegetation temperature condition index vtci constructed from moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis and meteosat second generation msg observations and found a big range in terms of the correlation coefficients r it partly indicated that the simple use of vtci as a proxy of ssm was hard to represent soil moisture changes with a high accuracy level inspired by the uncertainty related to the relationship construction the derivation of the accuracy acceptant model was still a major task in most downscaling schemes and this issue was usually ignored the errors associated with the relationship model construction would propagate into the derivation of the final downscaling ssm at the higher resolution scale therefore a robust approach to improve current downscaling methods should be rather easy to handle while being able to well describe the nonlinear relationship between ssm and a larger set of surface variables across a variety of land surface conditions to capture the nonlinear relationship instead of the commonly used methods in previous studies im et al 2016 inaugurated a research line in downscaling by introducing machine learning approaches to build the complex relationship between ssm data from amsr e and other surface variables from modis products the random forest rf approach showed good potential to describe this relationship with an r value of 0 95 and root mean squared error rmse of 0 024 m3 m3 the capability of this approach was also proven in surface temperature downscaling studies with modis lst products hutengs and vohland 2016 sismanidis et al 2017 yang et al 2017 on the basis of the above insights the present study aims at evaluating the performance of rf regression method in constructing the nonlinear relationship between ssm and other surface variables and downscaling passive microwave ssm product from tens of kilometers to 1 km spatial resolution time series of smap passive microwave ssm products and modis products were collected during a 2 year period from 2015 to 2016 at the iberian peninsula a comparison study was first conducted to test the ssm relationship model constructed by the rf regression method vs a polynomial fitting based method to highlight the advantages of the rf based method then the proposed rf based downscaling approach was applied to obtain high resolution ssm data and the downscaled results were evaluated by two field datasets in this region in situ soil moisture measurements from a dense observational network remedhus of the university of salamanca and daily precipitation of eight metrological stations from the european climate assessment dataset http www ecad eu on this basis some general findings for low resolution passive microwave soil moisture product downscaling were inferred which may also be useful to generate high resolution soil moisture data for study and application at regional or local scale 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area and ground based observations considering its usual clear sky conditions almost all the iberian peninsula was selected as the study area denoted as the red rectangle in fig 1 this area is large enough to cover a sufficient number of coarse resolution smap ssm pixels while excluding the influence of the ocean in general according to the modis land cover product this area has mixed landscapes but is dominated by the major land cover types of croplands open shrublands and woody savannas with partial forests located in the central mountain areas the mean elevation is approximately 650 m above sea level with the range from 4 m to 2418 m it mostly belongs to the mediterranean region with a semi arid climate characterized by warm to hot summers with a lengthy period of drought and cool to mild and wet winters therefore the soil moisture condition usually keeps to a relatively low level during the dry seasons in this study area there is a dense soil moisture observation network remedhus https ismn geo tuwien ac at networks remedhus in the central sector of the duero basin spain 41 1 to 41 5 n and 5 2 to 5 6 w the network has provided intensive hourly measurements of ssm at the top 5 cm with hydra probes stevens water monitoring system inc since march 2003 its relatively flat surface with similar land cover conditions makes it an ideal site for many soil moisture validation studies al yaari et al 2017 parinussa et al 2015 peng et al 2015 piles et al 2014 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 zhao and li 2013 sanchez et al 2012 presented a more detailed information about the area and the network therefore the network should be a good choice to evaluate the performance of the proposed downscaling method and the in situ measurements form 18 sites in 2015 and 2016 were chosen according to the availability of the smap soil moisture products in this study in addition to the in situ ssm measurements the daily precipitation of eight meteorological stations were collected from the european climate assessment dataset eca d klein tank et al 2002 for the study period the stations are located in separated parts of the study area fig 1 to represent different surface and climate conditions the changes in daily precipitation reflect the wetting drying cycle of ssm and are therefore useful to test the reliability of the downscaling results 2 2 data 2 2 1 smap soil moisture the smap satellite is one of the latest l band missions launched on january 31 2015 and aiming to generate global ssm map at different resolution levels with an l band radar active and radiometer passive it is operated in a near polar orbit with the ascending and descending overpass times of 6 00 pm and 6 00 am at local time the satellite was meant to provide soil moisture products with three spatial resolutions 36 km passive o neill et al 2016 9 km active passive entekhabi et al 2010a and 3 km active radar however the radar failure that occurred on july 7 2015 limited the generation of the active and active passive soil moisture data and it is expected to use the sentinel 1 mission as a replacement of the radar to achieve a 1 km resolution now the smap sentinel 1 level 2 l2 radiometer radar 3 km ease grid soil moisture spl2smap s version 1 is available at the national aeronautics and space administration nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac with the 1 km resolution data under scientific analysis narendra et al 2017 therefore the smap passive soil moisture product plays an important role to monitoring global soil moisture conditions and recent validation studies have confirmed its good potential in capturing the dynamics of ssm with an accuracy that met the mission requirement chen et al 2017 colliander et al 2017 pan et al 2016 in this study the smap level 3 l3 passive soil moisture product spl3smp version 4 distributed with 36 km equal area scalable earth ease grid was used this product is a daily product generated by compositing the l2 half orbit granules o neill et al 2015 and provides a composite of daily ssm estimates at global level since march 31 2015 which include the estimates of the ascending and descending half orbits it is available from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org data smap for the whole dataset in 2015 and 2016 2 2 2 modis products in any downscaling scheme it is important to establish the relationship between ssm and the rest of surface variables previous downscaling studies have demonstrated the potential of land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi enhanced vegetation index evi surface albedo alb leaf area index lai and normalized difference water index ndwi in expressing their relationship with ssm chauhan et al 2003 peng et al 2015 piles et al 2010 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 zhao and li 2013 therefore all these variables were obtained from the corresponding modis products including the 1 km resolution daily surface temperature mod11a1 and myd11a1 modis terra 1 km resolution 16 day vegetation index mod13a2 modis terra aqua 1 km resolution 16 day albedo mcd43b3 modis terra aqua 1 km resolution 8 day leaf area index lai mcd15a2 and modis terra 500 m resolution 8 day surface reflectance mod09a1 they were acquired from the u s land processes distributed active archive center lpdaac usgs gov for the lst products both modis terra and aqua lst products were chosen however only daytime lst was introduced in this study considering its common use in previous downscaling studies and its relatively high sensitivity to ssm due to its large variation in the daytime in addition the sensitivity analysis conducted by peng et al 2015 indicated the priority of daytime lst in expressing the connection with ssm pablos et al 2016 also found that the downscaling results using modis daytime lst had better performances than nighttime lst because of the synergistic use of modis and smap in the downscaling study their temporal differences in local equatorial crossing times should be considered similar as the overpass characteristic of smos for the use of smap ssm products the regional ssm distribution can be assumed to be spatially persistent from the modis overpass and smap overpass piles et al 2014 moreover to ensure the robustness of the constructed relationship between ssm and other surface variables a cloud free scenery for the modis terra and aqua lst products over the study area was required 2 2 3 topographic data in addition to the above satellite data the nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 30 arcsec resolution 1 km version 2 1 obtained from the land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov was used to provide topographic factors elevation slope and aspect for the downscaling study in order to summarize all the dataset included in the proposed model table 1 depicts an overview of the major spatial datasets the description about the corresponding variable and the number of granules of each dataset in this study it should be noted here that the ndwi was first derived based on the mod09a1 at 500 m resolution then a spatial aggregation was performed to get the same resolution 1 km as lst and the other variables 2 3 rf based downscaling approach 2 3 1 random forest method the rf method proposed by breiman 2001 is a popularly used machine learning method which can be applied in classification regression and other tasks for regression task a number of decision trees are first built during the training time and the mean prediction of the individual trees is generated as the output of this method in general according to the adaptive nature of the decision rules involved in it rf has the advantage in modeling the complex nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the response variable instead of detailed numerical expressions hutengs and vohland 2016 in detail the input data acts as the training data in the rf method and rf divides them into many regression trees making up the forest where each tree is built from a bootstrap sample which contains about two thirds of the input data each split is selected from a random subset of a given number m of the p variables during this process the number of trees ntree is also a key parameter in the forest for each bootstrap sampling process the left samples will be not included in the model construction and they act as the out of bag samples or oob which is an important feature of rf the oob can be used to validate the performance of the constructed model and the mean squared error mse based on oob samples are a reliable test error estimate which is almost identical to that obtained by k fold cross validation in this study the number of variables selected at each split was set to 3 based on a number of testing results and the number of trees was set to 1000 according to the stabilizing feature of the oob error 2 3 2 predictors selection and rf based downscaling procedure as introduced in section 2 2 2 lst ndvi evi alb lai and ndwi were used as predictors in the rf based ssm relationship model in addition as an important predictor of ssm it should be noted that lst shows a relevant relationship with surface elevation and incident solar radiation which is the key energy source to heat the land surface as a result in some cases the changes in lst are not only related to surface soil water conditions but also connected with the variations in these topography related variables and this effect should be considered for the study area the elevation map shown in fig 1indicates that the study area has a wide range of surface elevations therefore surface elevation was also introduced as a predictor in the rf based ssm relationship model construction to present its interactions with lst and ssm the incident solar radiation was represented by the cumulative incident solar radiation r c by integrating the instantaneous incident solar radiation r s from sunrise t 0 to the satellite overpass time t s considering the dominant effect of the direct solar radiation r b on r s r c is approximated by the following expression 1 r c t t 0 t s r b t in which 2 r b t s 0 1 0 0344 cos 2 π doy 365 τ b cos θ t where s0 is the solar irradiance 1367 w m2 doy is the day of year and τ b is the beam radiative transmittance under a clear sky the local solar zenith angle θt varies with the change of the solar illumination angle and it can be defined as the angle between the solar incident vector and the line perpendicular to the surface dozier and frew 1990 3 cos θ t cos z sun t cos s sin z sun t sin s cos a sun t a where z sun t and a sun t are the solar angles zenith and azimuth at time t respectively and a and s are the surface angles aspect and slope under the assumption that there is a clear sky condition during this period and the transmittance is a constant value in the study area r b t only changes with the variation of θt as shown in 4 4 r c k t t 0 t s θ t k f a where 5 k s 0 1 0 0344 cos 2 π doy 365 τ b f a t t 0 t s θ t where k is assumed to be a constant term for a certain day and fa is the integration of θt from sunrise to the satellite overpass therefore r c can be simply approximated by fa to represent the differences in the cumulative incident solar radiation among different pixels and fa was chosen as a proxy of r c to be a predictor in the rf based ssm relationship model finally the interrelationship between the above selected predictors and ssm was developed with a nonlinear function f r using the rf regression method 6 ssm f r t s ndvi evi alb lai ndwi f a elevation where t s is lst with the constructed ssm relationship model between the smap ssm data and the rest of the surface proxy variables at the coarse resolution scale in 6 it was assumed that the relationship model was spatial scale independent and the model was directly applied to the fine resolution modis data to get the final high resolution ssm data fig 2 shows the downscaling process as well as the evaluation of the procedure the following steps explain the flowchart step 1 the surface variables from modis observations at the 1 km resolution scale were first aggregated into the 36 km grid with a simple average function to match the coarse resolution of the smap ssm data step 2 the ssm relationship model was constructed with the rf based regression method to compare the performance of the rf based method a polynomial fitting regression method widely used in previous downscaling studies was introduced as reference in this polynomial fitting method ssm was depicted as a polynomial form of lst ndvi and other surface parameters based on their explored relationship with optical tir remote sensing based soil moisture estimations carlson 2007 sun et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 the form of the method proposed by chauhan et al 2003 was chosen and it was expressed as 7 7 ssm f p t s ndvi alb a 000 a 100 t s a 010 ndvi a 001 alb a 200 t s 2 a 020 ndv i 2 a 002 al b 2 a 110 t s ndvi a 101 t s alb a 011 alb ndvi where a ijk are the regression coefficients during the regression because of the different overpass times in daytime for modis terra approximately 10 30 am local time modis aqua approximately 1 30 pm local time smap descending 6 00 am local time and smap ascending 6 00 pm local time four different combinations were considered to investigate the performance of the models built with different daytime surface temperature terra and aqua and soil moisture proxies am and pm and other variables kept to the same dataset on each day the four combinations were simplified as am terra am aqua pm terra and pm aqua when both the smap ssm data and the modis products are available for the whole study there will be 270 smap cells and 346634 modis pixels involved in the downscaling study however due to the scanning gap of smap and the cloud cover in the modis observations the availability of both datasets is hard to satisfy for each day in this study only days when more than 100 coarse resolution cells having effective values in ssm and other surface variables were selected and the number of the qualified days for each combination during the study period is listed in table 2 step 3 a preliminary assessment was then conducted to compare the accuracy of the regression results with the rf based model and those of the polynomial fitting model for the four different combinations for this purpose daily values of the correlation coefficient r and root mean square deviation rmsd m3 m3 between the smap ssm and the estimated ssm at the smap grid scale with the two regression models were obtained and compared step 4 the ssm relationship model constructed by the proposed rf based method was applied to the variables at 1 km resolution to obtain high resolution ssm data at the modis pixel resolution then the downscaled ssm data was validated with the in situ soil moisture from the remedhus network and the precipitation measurements at the eight selected meteorological stations 3 results 3 1 model comparison fig 3 shows the r and rmsd values derived from the polynomial fitting regression model for the four combinations on the selected days during the two year period obviously there is a good agreement between the estimated ssm and the smap ssm for most days however poor correlation can be still found for some days with r 0 5 denoted with red color in fig 3 the pm terra and pm aqua generally had higher r values than those of am terra and am aqua the mean r values of the above two combinations pm terra and pm aqua were 0 840 and 0 844 respectively the mean r values of am terra and am aqua combinations were 0 791 and 0 796 respectively the comparison in terms of rmsd under different combinations also confirmed the results concluded as mentioned above the mean rmsd values of am terra and am aqua combinations were slightly bigger than those of pm terra and pm aqua combinations the performance differences among different combinations can be partly explained by the different sensitivity of the ssm to lst during the daytime the solar illumination induced the changes in lst which showed high correlation with ssm in contrast the surface temperature and moisture profile tended to be uniform at an equilibrium station in the early morning or nighttime wu et al 2016 which showed low sensitivity to lst in the daytime therefore the regression model had slightly better performances for the pm terra and pm aqua combinations than those of the am terra and am aqua combinations however the regression model did not show an obvious influence on the use of terra lst data or aqua lst data the metrics shown in fig 3 suggest that the model performances for the same ssm product with different lst datasets exhibited a similar accuracy level comparatively fig 4 displays the statistics derived from the ssm estimates with the rf based regression model it seems clear that there is a good correlation between the estimates and the smap ssm data with r values more than 0 95 for all cases the rmsd values also show great improvements decreasing from the mean value approximately 0 025 m3 m3 in fig 3 to the mean value of 0 009 m3 m3 regarding the combinations the result was similar as those found with the polynomial fitting regression model i e the pm terra and pm aqua combinations had a slightly better performance than the am terra and am aqua combinations but with very small differences meanwhile the difference in the regression with terra lst data or aqua lst data was also quite small with respect to the model performance among the different days the changes in terms of the r and rmsd values were smaller than 0 05 and 0 015 m3 m3 respectively suggesting the stable performance of the rf based regression model in general the relationship model comparison results indicated the strength of the rf based regression model in representing the complex relationship between ssm and other surface variables the good consistency between the estimated ssm and the smap ssm confirmed its good ability to depict ssm spatial variations 3 2 downscaling results with rf based approach considering the good performance of the quantitative relationship model between ssm and the other surface variables built by the rf based regression method the model was then applied to the high resolution variables to obtain high resolution ssm data from smap to evaluate the quality of the downscaling approach a visual comparison was conducted between the downscaled ssm maps at the modis pixel scale and the original coarse resolution from smap ssm data fig 5 a and b show the spatial distribution of the downscaled ssm data for the am terra combination and am aqua combination on a given day of year doy 136 2015 the corresponding smap am ssm data is presented in fig 5c from the effective ssm value coverage it can be found that both the smap ssm data and the downscaled ssm data cannot fully cover the study area which is attributed to the smap scanning gap and the cloud cover in the case of modis observation therefore the rf based regression model was established with the data available from smap ssm data and modis products however the downscaled ssm data can effectively fill the scanning gap of smap observations and generate high resolution ssm maps if modis observations are available in the gap region from a visual perspective both the high and coarse resolution ssm maps showed similar spatial distribution patterns over the study area moreover the downscaled high resolution ssm data within each smap cell fall into a reasonable range coinciding with the smap ssm value at the given cell no underestimation nor overestimation exist in the downscaled results similar spatial patterns of the fine scale ssm maps were generated with the two combinations am terra and am aqua the difference map between these two combinations shown in fig 6 indicates that there are very small differences with maximum and minimum differences of 0 015 m3 m3 and 0 020 m3 m3 respectively according to the histogram of the differences the mean difference value is 0 m3 m3 with a standard deviation of 0 003 m3 m3 these statistics suggest that the selection of terra or aqua lst data has a small impact on the final downscaling results as found in the visual comparison the results from the second combination pm terra and pm aqua for the given day of doy 318 2015 together with the corresponding smap pm ssm are shown in fig 7 although there are few gaps in the downscaling results the downscaled ssm data with the pm terra combination fig 7a and the pm aqua combination fig 7b present quite similar distribution and values over the study area also in good consistency with the original smap pm ssm fig 7c the small differences between the downscaled ssm of these two combinations can be reflected by the differences map fig 8 a and the histogram fig 8b the difference ranges from 0 025 m3 m3 to 0 040 m3 m3 with a mean difference of 0 001 m3 m3 and a standard deviation of 0 005 m3 m3 although figs 5 and 7 only present the ssm downscaling results on two specific days it seems that the rf based downscaling approach is able to generate high resolution ssm maps with different dataset combinations with consistent distribution according to the similar performance of the rf based regression model shown in fig 4 among all the selected days due to the different observation systems of the smap and modis sensors the scanning gap of the smap observation can be partly filled if the modis observations are available as shown in fig 5 however the cloud cover contamination in the modis observation is hard to remove in the downscaled ssm with a single combination fortunately the small difference in the downscaling results for the same smap ssm with different modis observations as shown in figs 6 and 8 suggests the use of composite products merging terra and aqua to mitigate the influence of cloud cover in a single combination regarding the composite method a simple solution was applied so that the blank pixel in the downscaled ssm data of one combination was filled with the available value from another combination for example fig 9 shows the composite ssm map with the downscaled ssm from the pm terra and pm aqua combinations shown in fig 7 this spatial distribution of ssm is consistent with those of the separated results but with fewer blank values the filling effect is obvious for the pm terra downscaling results and the blank pixels of the pm aqua downscaling results within the red ellipse in fig 9 is also filled with the downscaling results from the pm terra combination therefore the use of composite products will be helpful to improve the data coverage in the high resolution ssm data 3 3 validation 3 3 1 validation with the in situ ssm measurements from the remedhus network to ensure a fair comparison between the coarse resolution of smap the finer scale of the downscaled results and the point measurements the validation of the original smap ssm product and the downscaling results using the in situ measurements was conducted at the network level the smap ssm value over the network scale was represented by the averaged value of the smap cells covering the network while the downscaled ssm data over the network was averaged to represent the regional value the validation results of the smap am ssm data and their corresponding downscaled ssm data with terra lst and aqua lst are shown in fig 10 each point corresponds to the day when both the coarse and fine resolution ssm were available although fig 10a and c present the same comparison between the in situ measurements and the smap am ssm data there is a slightly difference in the days involved in the validation due to the availability of the modis lst products from terra and aqua however the performances are quite similar in terms of rmsd regarding the performance of the downscaled ssm data of the first two combinations am terra and am aqua an obvious improvement in the coefficient of determination r2 and rmsd was found for both when compared with the validation for the coarse resolution smap am ssm data the improvement in r2 for the am terra combination and the am aqua combination are 0 031 and 0 071 respectively the decrease in rmsd is also more significant for the second combination additionally fig 11 illustrates the validation results for the pm terra and pm aqua combinations similar performance can be found as in fig 10 the downscaled ssm data fig 11b and d has a better agreement with the in situ measurements over the network scale than the original smap ssm data fig 11a and c the improvement in rmsd is close to 0 01 m3 m3 for both combinations comparatively the comparison between metrics derived from the validation results of the downscaled ssm following four combinations indicated the relatively good accuracy of the downscaled ssm with smap am ssm product the better agreement can be highlighted by an increase in r2 0 11 on average and a decrease in rmsd 0 026 m3 m3 this finding confirmed the conclusion drawn by some evaluation studies that the smap am ssm retrievals were more reliable than the pm retrievals chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 in addition as also found in the study conducted by chen et al 2017 there was a systematic dry bias during the validation this underestimation should be partly attributed to the underestimation of smap surface temperature 3 3 2 temporal validation with precipitation data the temporal behavior of the downscaled ssm data was also evaluated with the daily precipitation collected from meteorological stations during the period of study since full maps of the downscaled ssm data calculated with the single combination are scarce and considering the good agreement between the downscaling results with terra lst and aqua lst a composite of the four combinations was used for this analysis as shown is section 3 2 fig 12 shows the time series of the downscaled ssm data the smap ssm data and daily precipitation of eight selected stations from the time series comparisons although there were large scale differences between the downscaled ssm data and the smap ssm data they showed good temporal consistency especially for stations 416 424 3921 and 3944 this suggests that the downscaled ssm largely maintains the temporal changing feature of the smap ssm regarding the temporal behavior against daily precipitation the plots show that the temporal variation of the ssm can be captured well according to its good response to the rainfall event no matter for the downscaled ssm data or the smap ssm data for each station the soil moisture condition during the dry periods denoted by the orange box in the figure remained low due to a strong evapotranspiration effect obvious upward and downward trends can be observed after the scarce rainfall events during the dry seasons in all stations however the ssm changing magnitude of both datasets responding to different certain rainfall events are quite different for example the downscaled ssm data in the blue ellipse for stations 233 and 3945 presented more reasonable values with a larger increase in ssm than the smap ssm data due to the heavy precipitation in previous days in contrast the downscaled ssm data restrained the overestimation when the smap ssm data showed a great increase in the soil moisture condition even for a relatively small rainfall event according to the estimates in the blue ellipse for stations 336 and 416 similar phenomena can be found for other days in the selected meteorological stations this partially confirmed the reliability of the downscaled ssm data in addition to the dry period according to the relatively high value for the downscaled ssm data and smap ssm data the surface of all stations usually maintains a relatively wet condition during the period from october 2015 to may 2016 and the period from october 2016 to december 2016 due to the cool climate and frequent rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 regression variable importance the assessment of the ssm relationship model indicated the big advantage of the rf based regression method in expressing the complex interactions between the ssm and other surface variables an overall improvement in the correlation coefficient can be observed for the ssm estimates using the rf based regression compared with those from the polynomial regression with an average increment in r of 0 16 and an average decrease in rmsd of 0 011 m3 m3 more importantly regarding the time series performance of the rf based regression model the model was capable of providing a robust and stable relationship between ssm and other surface variables as was also found in im et al 2016 using amsr e soil moisture and modis products during the nonlinear relationship construction the rf method is able to provide the importance of each variable based on the randomized variable selection process used in building the rf the importance scores are presented by incmse which indicates how much mse increases when that variable is randomly permuted the larger the value of incmse of a variable the more important that variable is to the model fig 13 shows the averaged variable importance scores derived from all available days of the four combinations and their corresponding standard deviations higher scores can be found for lst due to the controlling effect of ssm on surface energy exchange and partition similar to the results of im et al 2016 in addition as the commonly used variables to represent ssm variation in the triangle based methods krapez and olioso 2011 leng et al 2016 yang et al 2015 surface albedo and ndvi also exhibited high importance on the ssm the lai had a similar importance to ndvi because of its good ability to represent vegetation cover peng et al 2015 however evi was less important as also found in the regression results with the in situ measurements in zhao et al 2017 the solar factor f a also showed a significant influence on ssm prediction as a proxy for the cumulative solar radiation it not only reflected the impact on the evolution of lst but also represented the aspect information of surface topography south facing slopes have bigger f a but lower ssm according to the theory that south facing slopes usually receive more solar radiation with more xeric and warmer condition while north facing slopes is easy to retain moisture due to relatively weak evapotranspiration måren et al 2015 in contrast the effect of the dem taken separately is weak finally the importance of ndwi was similar to those of ndvi and lai in addition to the averaged values the vertical error bars illustrate the standard deviation of the importance scores of each variable the error bars indicates that the variable importance score has high variability and it can be attributed to the number of the samples involved in the regression and the temporal changes in surface variables moreover the inter correlation among the variables also influences the scores the lst has the biggest variation followed by albedo and f a it suggests that the contributions of these three variables to ssm changes show high temporal variability due to their variable responses to ssm for instance lst shows low sensitivity to ssm during the winter season and f a has a relatively small difference in summer than winter resulting in a low correlation with ssm in general the variable importance analysis suggests the appropriate selection of the eight variables in the prediction model construction which supports the findings of the optical tir based ssm estimation studies carlson 2007 krapez and olioso 2011 leng et al 2016 sun et al 2012 that the commonly used variables in the triangle space are good proxies to estimate ssm the addition of ndwi and the solar factor also improved the downscaling results due to the relatively high importance in the variable importance ranking which underpinned their use as key factors related to ssm in the algorithm 4 2 impacts from spatial scale differences to construct the relationship model the selected surface predictors at high resolution should be aggregated to the low resolution of the smap ssm product however the aggregation from 1 km to 36 km greatly smoothed the spatial changes of the involved surface variables and resulted in a regression model construction with few extreme values in the training data taking the surface elevation as an example the maximum and minimum values at the 1 km scale were 2418 m and 4 m respectively however during the rf based regression model training with variables at 36 km the value range of the surface elevation changed from 152 m to 1507 m because of this smoothing effect a similar effect should exist for other variables on the other hand the scale difference between the optical tir remote sensing data and smap product partly constrained the availability of selecting enough observation data to construct the regression model consequently it was necessary to select an area large enough to support the amount of the training samples required and to ensure real changes in surface soil wetness therefore almost the entire peninsula was selected as the study area however its size made it difficult to maintain the assumption that the study area had uniform atmospheric forcings which is a key theoretical basis for the triangle based ssm retrieval algorithm mallick et al 2009 consequently the results of the polynomial regression had a relatively poor effect in describing the spatial variations of ssm in contrast the rf based approach introduced the solar and topographic factors to depict the climatic changes impacted by these two key factors meanwhile similar to the results indicated by hutengs and vohland 2016 the predictive range of ssm at the fine scale is restricted to the ranges of the coarse resolution ssm covered by the training data in other words the ranges in the downscaled ssm are highly connected with the surface soil wetness differences in the training samples therefore the size of the training sample and its representativeness greatly impact the final downscaling results during this study days with less than 100 training samples were excluded in the regression however the cloud cover in the optical tir remote sensing data and the scanning gap of smap observation blocked the flow of enough training samples for the selected study area therefore hampering the generation of the time series of fine scale ssm data as a possible solution the use of the composite product aqua terra was proposed to improve the full coverage of the fine scale ssm map 4 3 regression residual correction although good agreement was achieved for the estimates with the rf based regression model and the rmsds were relatively small for most cases as shown in fig 4 the residuals between the estimates and the original smap ssm values were ignored during the downscaling process in turn it was certain that the integration of the downscaled ssm data were hard to achieve the value consistency across scales when comparing the corresponding smap ssm cell value to ensure the equality of ssm at different scales the residual correction should be performed in future studies a uniform weight residual correction method was applied in previous lst downscaling studies hutengs and vohland 2016 yang et al 2017 by adding the residual to each fine resolution prediction but notable box shaped artifacts will be introduced into the downscaled results under poor prediction cases therefore a nonuniform weight residual correction method is a better way to omit this influence such as the atprk algorithm proposed by wang et al 2015 4 4 systematic bias correction in the experiments four combinations of lst aqua terra with smap ascending descending were made it is worthwhile to conclude that the use of smap am or pm ssm product with modis terra or aqua lst can generate a similar fine resolution ssm with close accuracy however the systematic errors of smap soil moisture products were propagated to them especially for the low ssm conditions to reduce this impact a linear relationship was derived between the smap ssm data and the in situ measurements of each combination and acted as the bias correction form of the smap ssm data then it was applied to the downscaled ssm data resulting in a bias corrected downscaled ssm data as shown in fig 14 the recalibrated downscaled ssm data had better correlation with the in situ measurements than the results shown in figs 10 and 11 and the fitted lines are closer to the 1 1 line the underestimation problem at the low value regime is greatly improved with an unbiased rmsd ubrmsd of 0 022 m3 m3 5 conclusions a new method is proposed in this study for downscaling passive microwave low resolution ssm product using remote sensing data from optical tir observations based on the rf method the ssm relationship constructed by the proposed rf based approach outperforms the traditional polynomial fitting polynomial regression in addition four data combinations between smap ssm products ascending and descending and modis lst products terra and aqua were introduced in this study to compare the effectiveness of the downscaling results the comparison results based on statistical measures and visual analyses show that the four combinations achieved similar performances with satisfactory accuracy when validated with the in situ ssm measurements and time series of precipitation data from individual stations the validation results with the averaged in situ measurements indicate well the improvement of the downscaled ssm data as comparison to the original smap ssm product with a general improvement in the rmsd of 0 01 m3 m3 and the accuracy of the downscaled ssm data can achieve a high level with an rmsd of 0 022 m3 m3 when the systematic error of the smap ssm product is corrected in general the downscaling results not only show better spatial heterogeneity but also present good temporal consistency in terms of time series precipitation from ground meteorological stations the changes between dry and wet season and the effect of rainfall event can be well reflected by the downscaled ssm data moreover the similar downscaling accuracy of the four combinations suggests that the downscaled ssm data of each combination can be used to generate a composite high resolution ssm data to partly reduce the impact on the data availability due to the smap scanning and cloud cover with more frequent temporal coverage and larger spatial availability acknowledgments we acknowledge

combination of surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge while green water is the summation of evapotranspiration and soil water content i e mediated by plants due to the tight coupling between land use and the partitioning of blue and green water within a watershed an integrated geospatial modeling framework that links land use and watershed hydrological processes is needed to predict the

consequences of present trends of urban growth to identify potential future hotspots of hydrological change across a watershed in central new jersey undergoing suburbanization the agent based probabilistic model working at the scale of land ownership parcels predicted that future urban development would be the result of forest rather than farm land conversion using existing zoning maps the housing unit density and human population of the urban growth areas was estimated a consequence of the loss of forest land and increasing impervious surface leading was higher blue water but lower

water assessment tool agent based modeling hydrological hotspot zoning 1 introduction availability of freshwater is critical to provide food security as well as safe drinking water to a rapidly growing population schuol et al 2008 adequate amounts of freshwater are also vital for supporting aquatic biodiversity harrison et al 2016 however freshwater is often limited in quantity and is vulnerable to human activities such as urbanization agriculture reservoir formation irrigation and inter basin transfer vorosmarty et al 2010 ensuring the availability of freshwater is complicated by changing precipitation patterns longer dry spells higher evapotranspiration and increased frequency of extreme events such as droughts and floods bogardi et al 2012 water scarcity defined as the ratio of water demand over water availability provides an indicator of the water stress within a system the present water scarcity that is prevalent in many parts of the globe is expected to increase in the coming years due to population growth and climate change water security is referred as an acceptable level of water related risks to humans and ecosystems coupled with the availability of water of sufficient quantity and quality to support livelihoods national security human health and ecosystem services bakker 2012 water security for humans addresses multi faceted requirements starting from domestic water to maintenance of ecosystems and biodiversity water security assessment based on the concept of blue versus green water is becoming widely accepted globally veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 schuol et al 2008 blue water flows over or under the soil surface and is generally stored in rivers lakes aquifers reservoirs and wetlands green water derives from precipitation and is stored in the upper layers of the soil or vegetation and returns to atmosphere through evapotranspiration rodrigues et al 2014 zang et al 2012 green water can be further divided into green water flow and green water storage green water storage is the amount of soil moisture whereas green water flow is the sum of actual evapotranspiration schuol et al 2008 in other words blue water is the combination of surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge while green water is the summation of evapotranspiration and soil water content i e mediated by plants faramarzi et al 2008 the differentiation of blue versus green water in the assessment of water security reflects the growing recognition for the explicit consideration of the water required for biomass production such as food and timber the water requirement for biomass production surpasses all other water dependent processes falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 both blue and green water are directly or indirectly related to human consumption for example water withdrawal from a river for drinking purposes is the direct use of blue water for human consumption while use of soil water for crop production represents use of green water for human consumption consequently management of both blue and green water is helpful in identifying the geographic hotspots in the watershed with limited freshwater availability to help balance competing demands such as maintaining environmental flows satisfying water requirements for agriculture and water withdrawal for drinking and other purposes water resource managers often rely on spatially distributed dynamic process models many approaches such as crop wat decision support tool allen et al 1998 data generalization shiklomanov and rodda 2003 general circulation models oki and kanae 2006 wasmod m a conceptual water budgeting model widen nilsson et al 2007 lpjml model global vegetation and water balance model rost et al 2008 are available in the public domain to quantify blue and green water in particular the soil and water assessment tool swat due to its process based structure and spatially distributed implementation has found widespread application in the evaluation of the spatiotemporal variation of blue and green water in various river basins across the globe faramarzi et al 2008 schuol et al 2008 zang et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2014 zuo et al 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 swat has the ability to model hydrology plant growth related processes and incorporate different agricultural management practices which are essential from water balance prospective giri et al 2014 it can also be used to model nutrient runoff and water quality impacts from both agricultural and urban land uses qiu and wang 2014 panagopoulos et al 2015 giri et al 2016a the availability of both blue and green water are directly or indirectly affected by how humans are using the land the latter half of the 20th into the first decade of the 21st century exhibited dramatic population growth and suburbanization in exurban areas across the united states adjacent to but outside of traditionally defined metropolitan areas qian 2010 white et al 2009 alig 2010 in these non metro counties as well as the outer counties within metro regions forest and agricultural lands were converted into residential and commercial land uses while this rapid growth cooled during the recession recent annual population estimates 2015 2016 suggest that this period may simply be a short term interruption in suburbanization with outlying counties in metro areas once again growing faster than central urban counties us economic research service 2017 stated differently while suburban sprawl and rural land conversion may have slowed it isn t dead yet more importantly the legacy of past land use change continues to have implications for blue and green water resources in these exurban suburban areas urban development leads to increasing impervious surface as a result of increase in streets parking lots sidewalk driveways and rooftop consequently the watershed surface runoff is increased by increasing curve number cn streamflow flood volume and having shorter time of concentration in contrast groundwater recharge is decreased due to lesser infiltration as a result of increasing impervious surface the change in both surface runoff and infiltration affects both blue and green water components therefore understanding the consequences of past urbanization and the potential future land use conversion on blue and green water is requisite for better water resources management to analyze past land use conversion and to project the pace and pattern of future change land use researchers and planners have turned to a variety of modelling approaches including spatial econometric cellular automata and agent based models bockstael 1996 parker and meretsky 2004 polhill et al 2008 an agent based model abm is a simulation modeling framework where various behaviors of individuals or agents are programmed through their interactions and choice principles gimblett et al 2002 o sullivan et al 2012 abms are used to predict land use pattern by incorporating spatial variations and interactions among different components or agents of the system heppenstall et al 2012 as well as the inherent properties of the land i e slope soil type productivity property parcel size accessibility and buildable structures abms can incorporate spatial context as well as the stochasticity and uncertainty in generating land use patterns to help mimic the complexity of coupled land use watershed systems as many land use decisions are made at the level of the individual ownership parcel property parcels are suitably regarded as agents le et al 2010 applying an abm framework within geographical information system gis greatly facilitates the modeling of spatially explicit land use decision making at property parcel or plot scale najlis and north 2004 johnston 2013 and linking land use policies to potential land use patterns d aquino et al 2015 additionally abm can also provide means to link changing land use to changes in water quality at a watershed scale arbab et al 2016 due to the tight coupling between land use and the partitioning of blue and green water within a watershed an integrated geospatial modeling framework that links land use and watershed hydrological processes is needed to predict the consequences of future land use change on water security such a framework would also enable a more thorough investigation of the spatio temporal variation of blue and green water by incorporating both current and future land uses in swat model along with abm modeling framework this study addresses following key questions i how does the spatial distribution of blue and green water vary across a central new jersey watershed under current and projected land use and ii how does the water security situation potentially change under future land use and population 2 methodology 2 1 study area the raritan basin located in central new jersey fig 1 has increased population and urban land by 25 6 percent and 35 8 percent respectively since 1990 2010 giri et al 2016b the neshanic river watershed nrw is the headwater to raritan basin hydrologic unit code is huc 02030105030 while the nrw is currently less developed regional development and population growth trends suggest that this area will be subject to increasing development pressures in the coming years this increasing population and development trend combined with sporadic drought warning category based on water supply by the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep prompted us to select nrw as study area for water security analysis out of total nrw watershed area 142 km2 39 percent consists of agricultural lands 32 percent contains forest 28 percent comprises of urban lands and remainder are wetlands barren land and water the elevation of the nrw ranges from 20 m to 201 m above mean sea level the nrw belongs to piedmont physiographic region where the topography is primarily low rolling plains divided by higher ridges underlain by folded and faulted sedimentary and igneous rocks the soils are well drained silty soil where major crops including hay pasture corn and soybean are observed minor crops grown in the watershed are winter wheat rye and oats the climate in the watershed varies from hot and humid summer to cold winter representing humid climate 2 2 integrated modeling framework the integrated modeling framework for this water security study consists of three primary components 1 hydrological modeling framework 2 agent based modeling framework and 3 spatial data analysis framework fig 2 the following section describes in detail of each modeling framework data requirement data source and procedure 2 2 1 hydrologic modeling framework the swat model was used to simulate the hydrologic processes in the study area and calculated different components of blue and green water swat is a physically based spatially distributed watershed scale model that simulates continuous daily time step streamflow sediment nutrients chemicals and pathogens transport in a watershed after incorporating different input data such as digital elevation model land use land cover soil and meteorological data arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2004 swat divides the whole watershed into smaller units known as subbasin and it is based on the topography so that flow within each subbasin can direct to a single point called subbasin outlet subbasins are further partitioned into smaller unit known as hydrologic response unit hru which has unique land use soil slope and management the major components of swat model are hydrology soil plant growth weather nutrients pesticides and land management practices gassman et al 2007 simulated processes include runoff infiltration evaporation plant uptake lateral flow and percolation to shallow and deep aquifer in this study arcswat version 2012 10 3 18 was used in arcgis 10 3 environment and nrw was divided into 115 subbasins and 9291 hrus 2 2 1 1 data sources swat model requires different types of data such as physiographic data streamflow and meteorological data for hydrology simulation in the watershed a detail description of all the data and their sources used in the swat model can be found in table 1 the land use of the study area was represented by njdep 2012 land use land cover data njdep 2012 the njdep land use data was categorized into six broader categories such as urban wetlands agricultural lands water and barren land while it has 51 subcategories based on modified anderson classification system njdep 2012 the 16 subcategories of urban land were assigned to the swat urban land category based on the percent of impervious surface to identify specific cropping pattern within agricultural land 2015 crop data layer from usda national agricultural statistics service was used nass 2015 both land uses were combined in arcgis environment to process the data meteorological data consisted of precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed daily precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the national climatic data center for 16 year time period 2000 2015 for three weather stations one station was inside the study area while other two stations were located closer to the nrw edge fig 1 the remaining meteorological data were estimated using swat weather generator daily streamflow data for usgs gauging station 01398000 was obtained and converted into monthly basis to calibrate and validate the streamflow in the watershed fig 1 to process the hydrology correctly different management operations for different crops such as corn soybean winter wheat hay pasture rye and oats were developed the management operation includes date and types of tillage equipment used amount and date of fertilization planting and harvesting these information were collected after series of interview with nrcs personnel and local stakeholders in the study area in swat model urban land has two parts 1 impervious and 2 pervious part in the pervious part lawn management consists of mowing and fertilizer application were incorporated and these information was obtained from landscape professionals and residents inside the study area 2 2 1 2 sensitivity analysis and model calibration sensitivity analysis performed by two prior studies giri et al 2016a qiu and wang 2014 was conducted to identify the most influential parameters with respect to model output calibration was performed using manual calibration helper in swat model using the sensitive parameters as well as understanding of the hydrologic characteristics of the study watershed the calibration parameters used for streamflow were baseflow alpha factor deep aquifer percolation fraction surface runoff lag coefficient hydraulic conductivity in the main channel groundwater delay time groundwater revap coefficient soil evaporation compensation factor curve number available water capacity of the soil layer maximum canopy storage manning s n for overland flow manning s n for main channel threshold depth of shallow aquifer threshold depth for revap snowmelt base temperature and snowpack temperature lag factor these parameters were manually adjusted within the lower and upper bounds the calibrated value of these parameters are presented in supplementary material table s1 validation was performed followed by model calibration to establish model reliability a two years 2002 and 2003 warm up period was used to initialize the model parameters model calibration was performed on a monthly time step between 2004 and 2009 and validation was conducted between 2010 and 2014 three model evaluation parameters nash sutcliff efficiency nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse observations standard ratio rsr were used to evaluate model prediction the nse compares the observed and predicted data in terms of residual variance to measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 pbias measures the quantitative difference of simulated data in terms of smaller or larger compared to observed value gupta et al 1999 where rsr is the ratio between rmse and standard deviation of measured data moriasi et al 2007 the detail about nse pbias and rsr can be found from giri et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2007 2 2 2 spatial data analysis framework spatial data analysis framework was used to calculate both blue and green water scarcity in the study area all the processes were performed in arcgis environment the following section describes the calculation of blue and green water scarcity associated with other components 2 2 2 1 analysis of blue and green water blue water was calculated as the summation of water yield and groundwater storage fig 2 water yield is the total amount of water leaving the hru and entering the main channel as streamflow and swat output file wyld was used groundwater was calculated as the difference between amount of water entering to both shallow and deep aquifer and the groundwater discharge into stream veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 the swat output file used for water entering to both shallow and deep aquifer and the groundwater discharge into stream are gw rchg and gw q respectively green water was estimated as the summation of soil moisture and evapotranspiration fig 2 veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 schuol et al 2008 2 2 2 2 blue water scarcity blue water scarcity is the ratio of the blue water required or withdrawn over the amount available veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 1 bluewater scarcity bluewater requirement or withdrawal bluewater availability a blue water scarcity values of less than one indicates no water scarcity blue water scarcity values of greater than one can be further categorized into mild or moderate or severe water scarcity based on the particular circumstances of the watershed blue water withdrawal for this study was obtained from the usgs in the form of county level total water surface and groundwater withdrawal usgs 2017 the most recent 2010 total water withdrawal as well as total population for hunterdon county the county in which our study basin is located the total water withdrawal was the summation of surface and groundwater withdrawal for different sectors such as public supply domestic use industrial purpose irrigation livestock aquaculture mining and thermoelectric out of total water withdrawal surface water contributed 86 percent while groundwater consisted of 14 percent among different sectors of water withdrawal public supply and domestic use were the highest recipient of water from surface water and groundwater respectively crop irrigation does not represent a significant use in this watershed total water withdrawal per person was achieved by dividing total water withdrawal to total population to obtain the total water withdrawal within each subbasin the most recent 2010 population data was obtained in the form of census tracts from the united states census bureau uscb 2017 the census tract was intersected by the study area boundary however the census tract boundaries did not exactly match with the subbasin boundaries therefore percent of different census tract contributing to each subbasin was calculated to estimate the total population within each subbasin the total water withdrawal within each subbasin was estimated by multiplying the total population within each subbasin with total water withdrawal per person blue water availability for withdrawal should include environmental flow requirement blue water availability in stream is calculated based on the following equation veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2011 2 blue water availability stream streamflow environmentalflowrequirment where environmental flow requirement refers to minimum amount of streamflow required to maintain the downstream ecological integrity of most rivers or streams and is equal to 0 8 times of streamflow richter et al 2012 developed this 80 percent stream flow protection standards to maintain ecological integrity of downstream aquatic ecosystems this benchmark is also consistent with other studies such as by brizga et al 2002 in queensland australia as well as carlisle et al 2010 in the united states a similar environmental flow requirement concept was also applied to groundwater to protect the potential impact of over exploitation of groundwater to many aquatic and riparian ecosystems gleeson and richter 2017 the blue water availability in groundwater was calculated based on the following equation 3 blue wateravailability groundwater groundwater environmentalflowrequirement where environmental flow requirement is equal to 0 8 times of groundwater the groundwater was calculated as the summation of area of each hru within subbasin times the difference between amount of water entering to both shallow and deep aquifer and the groundwater discharge into stream the blue water availability was the summation of blue water in stream and groundwater calculated using equation 2 and 3 annual streamflow and groundwater of 2010 predicted by swat model for each subbasin was used for blue water availability calculation streamflow and groundwater of 2010 was used for blue water availability calculation to maintain consistency with available total water withdrawal and population data 2 2 2 3 green water scarcity green water scarcity is an indicator which evaluates water security in a region it is calculated using the following equation veettil and mishra 2016 hoekstra et al 2011 4 green water scarcity green water requirement orwithdrawal green water availability the green water scarcity values can be interpreted in a similar way as described for blue water scarcity green water requirement or withdrawal is the actual evapotranspiration which was obtained from the hru output of the simulated swat model green water availability is the initial soil water content available for plant and soil evapotranspiration and it is calculated as the difference between soil moisture at the root zone and wilting point rodrigues et al 2014 initial soil water content was also obtained from hru out of the simulated swat model and used for the green water scarcity calculation temporal variation of precipitation blue water green water flow and green water storage were generated using r platform from monthly swat output during 2000 2015 2 2 3 agent based modeling framework the abm is based on two modules spatial logistics regression slr and agent based probabilistic model abpm to illustrate the driving factors of land use change and land use conversions 2 2 3 1 spatial logistic regression model abms have incorporated values for neighboring land use impacts and these relative values are based on researcher postulated estimates parker and meretsky 2004 brown et al 2005 polhill et al 2008 one way to improve these abm parameter estimates of neighborhood impacts is through an empirical parameterization using spatial land use change data this empirical approach has the capability to quantify spatial externalities of neighborhood land uses and locational features using observed land use conversions arbab 2014 arbab et al 2016 the slr model is often used to provide spatially explicit empirical estimates of these neighborhood and proximate economic externalities arbab et al 2016 the empirical structure of the logistic regression function describes a functional relationship between land use conversion and a set of explanatory factors that influence conversion probability for non residential land xie et al 2005 this empirical structure is used in characterizing the land use conversion decision for each property parcel in abm the slr coefficients are derived from raster based data and these coefficients can be regarded as weights to produce the probability of conversion to developed land use shirzadi et al 2012 the future land use patterns generated in abm are conditional to the sequential land use conversions resulting in variation in neighboring land uses this sequential process can best be defined by updating the probability of land use conversion influencing by proximity effect of neighboring features wu 2002 the agents in abm can be passive and social agents walsh et al 2013 in land use conversion modeling property parcels have been defined as passive agents and the type of each property parcel provides the further classification of these agents such as parcels that are available for residential conversions can be choice making unit for developers in abm such system in this integrated framework provides the impact of land use conversion stemming from the local level conversion choice making of individuals both slr and abm models account conversion in one way from agricultural and forest properties to residential properties a necessary condition in the abm model for land use conversion from agricultural or forest land into residential land use is that land values for residential use is higher than values for agricultural or forest use this condition is set due to urbanization being the most important factor influencing farmland conversion olson and olson 1999 rosenberger et al 2002 having this necessary condition our research is grounded in two strands of theoretical approaches to explain residential land value 1 land value as a function of proximity to economic locations and 2 land value as a function of surrounding location specific attributes to predict land use conversion probabilities from 2012 to 2022 a slr model was used to calculate the probability of land use conversion from 2002 to 2012 a slr model is developed in terrset software of terrset clarks labs 2016 the slr model implementation in terrset requires spatial data in raster format therefore raster cell is considered as a unit of observation in slr the empirically estimated relationship between the non residential land use conversion and the factors influencing the probability of conversion is expressed as the following functional form 5 p y 1 x exp β i x i 1 exp β i x i where p y 1 x the predicted probability value of the binary or dichotomous dependent variable y and y 1 means a cell in raster map changes from a non residential land use in 2002 to residential land use in 2012 otherwise y 0 xi independent variables including xo for the constant term βi coefficients of variables parameters the logistic function takes into account the linear probability in a set of parameters by having the range of probability between zero and one the following linear logit transformation on both sides of eq 5 was used to estimate the coefficients menard 1995 6 y logit p ln p k 1 p k β 0 β 1 x 1 k β 2 x 2 k β 3 x 3 k β 4 x 4 k β 5 x 5 k β 6 x 6 k where y is the probability that the dependent variable is 1 pk is the predicted probability of dependent variable of agricultural and forest land use conversion into residential land use β0 is the intercept and β1 β2 β3 β4 β5 and β6 are coefficients for variables which reflect distance to the nearest agricultural land use x1 forest x2 residential land use x3 stream x4 major highway x5 and distance to train station x6 respectively the sign of the parameter indicates the direction of the influence of each explanatory variable on conversion probability a negative coefficient sign shows that an increase in distance between a cell and the neighborhood externality would decrease the probability of conversion conversely a positive sign shows that as the distance of the cell to a land use or location feature increases the probability of conversion would increase following bid rent theory alonso 1964 mills 1967 muth 1969 the present abpm modeling approach is based upon the assumption that each land parcel is allocated to the use that maximizes the utility of its owner in the model distance to urban center represents proximity to economic activity centers schools shopping centers railway station and public services kitamura et al 1997 distances to the major highways and urban center are conceptualized using von thünen and the bid rent theory of urban economics where distance to the urban center and roads explains the land rent and transportation cost respectively under the relaxed assumptions of spatial variation in the landscape von thünen 1826 alonso 1964 mills 1967 muth 1969 distance to urban center is the major factor accounted in monocentric bid rent theory alonso 1964 as the distance from the urban center increases accessibility decreases which results in higher transportation costs distance to roads represents accessibility to metropolitan and urban areas workplace shopping and schools serneels and lambin 2001 spatial features surrounding property parcel impact the parcel value which is followed from the economic theory of hedonic property values wu 2006 distance to streams and forest are regarded as a relative measures for aesthetic amenities where closeness to streams and forests determines the value of parcel level neighboring characteristics since streams and forest represent amenities therefore they are expected to positively influence the probabilities of land use conversions irwin et al 2014 the distance to agricultural and residential land use accounts for neighboring externalities 2 2 3 2 slr model evaluation the slr model was validated using the quantitative measurement of receiver operator characteristic roc statistic which has been used as a reliable approach for model validation pontius and schneider 2001 arsanjani et al 2013 the roc predicts the location of conversion by comparing the actual change between 2002 and 2012 in a boolean raster data and the suitability fitted change between 2002 and 2012 several studies considered roc as reliable statistic to measure the goodness of fit for a logistic regression swets 1986 pontius and schneider 2001 verburg et al 2002 tayyebi et al 2010 the roc varies between 0 and 1 where 1 shows a perfect fit and 0 5 shows a random fit overall larger roc values show a better association between explanatory variables and the dependent variable a chi square distribution of likelihood ratio statistics was used to test the null hypothesis that all variables in the model measuring distances from surrounding land uses or amenities have no impact on whether a cell will be converted from non residential to residential land use since ordinary least square ols is not applicable due to the nonlinear functional form of logistic model wooldridge 2002 therefore maximum likelihood estimator mle was used mle estimator is suitable for the distribution of y given x this estimator includes heteroscedasticity in var y x and is consistent asymptotically normal and asymptotically efficient wooldridge 2002 2 2 3 3 agent based probabilistic model abpm abpm is programmed in a gis environment using python programming property parcels are assigned with land use conversion rule based upon empirical parameters from slr model agents in abpm are defined as the developable parcel including forest and agricultural non protected properties representing land owners choice making units or passive parcel agents based upon the majority of rural residential properties in 2012 the assumption in the model implies that developable parcels i e upland forest and agricultural land can only convert into rural residential parcels each agent parcel is autonomous by being owned and controlled by a single owner in reality a single owner may have multiple properties but the same property owner may convert the property parcel in one location without converting a property parcel owned at a different location in abpm an agent s decision rule is formulated based on empirical rules of land use conversion a similar framework where agents are characterized within a bounded rationality framework has been used in studies such as benenson and torrens 2004 and valbuena et al 2010 in abpm neighboring externalities are used as proxy for implicit spatial interactions and interdependencies neighborhood externalities were the estimated influence of each land use on surrounding parcels the agents conversion decisions is conditional upon the spatial distances from each neighboring land use over a period of 10 iterations a 10 year time period where each iteration is assumed to be a land use conversion event possibility initial conversions influences future conversions within each model run due to path dependent influence in decision making with modification of benenson and torrens 2004 approach parcel agent s probability prob of conversion from developable state m to residential state r in each iteration is programmed similar to arbab et al 2016 7 pr ob i s m s r s n i where n i represents parcel agent i s neighbors and s represents state of parcel i monte carlo process hagerstrand 1965 wu 2002 was employed to generate the results of a stochastic abpm simulation model to incorporate uncertainty and stochasticity in the abpm a probability function was used to condition the residential conversions utilizing a random number generator batty 2012 the conversion decision of agent in converting parcel into residential use was based upon a comparison between the random number generated and the probability value computed from eq 5 for each parcel as below eq 8 in eq 8 the random number generator rand αi has a random distribution that is uniform between 0 and 1 8 if rand α i p it thena it 1 r where r represents the land use class of residential development p is the probability of conversion to residential development for each parcel i a is the conversion event and t is iteration agents assess the probability of conversion by comparing it with a random number agents use if and then rule in parcel conversion the agent converts the parcel into a residentially developed parcel if the probability is higher than the random number if not then the parcel remains in its current undeveloped state this shows that probability which is driven by neighboring lands is indicator of parcels conversion the model runs in discrete event steps and generates spatial output of projected residential converted parcels and non converted parcels a total of 10 iteration steps were included in each model run within abpm the number of iterations steps was matched with training land use data set used in the slr model the raster data in slr consisted of 10 years of land use change from 2002 to 2012 the landscape was initialized as the actual land use in shape file for the year 2012 in arcpy program of python first agents identify whether the land parcel is developable or not then agents compute the mean euclidean distances from nearest agricultural forest and residential lands from their property parcel after the distances are calculated agents identify the coefficient values for these spatial externalities and identify the distances from roads train station and streams the coefficients of spatial externalities are imported in abm from slr model results parcel agents use the estimated slr coefficients in their conversion decision and for each iteration they calculate new values for the spatial externalities of neighboring lands due to changes in updated spatial patterns of land use parcel data in each iteration thus as the parcel landscape changes explanatory variables are recalculated by each parcel agent in the abpm agents incorporate assessed land uses in its type neighboring land uses and features distances into conversion of land use in each iteration the conversion decision due to uncertainty is probabilistic in abpm another factor in the residential land use conversions is generated probability value ranging from 0 pit 1 where i represents each parcel agent in each event t the agents make their conversion decisions based on constant information feedback of distances and quantified spatial externalities in each model run in a continuously iterative fashion liu et al 2013 arbab et al 2016 the conversion decision in abpm is not only influenced by the neighboring land use conversion but by the assigned coefficient values which exhibit the influence of each proximity factor spatial externalities on the probability of land use conversion the probability of conversion is further converted into stepwise probability for 10 iterations the relationship between pi computed with slr equation in abpm and pa a probability of conversion for each iteration is formulated as 9 p i 1 1 p a 10 10 p a 1 1 p i 0 1 pa is the average probability per iteration over the ten iterations and its value changes with each iteration due to changes in land use conversions the stepwise probability ensures the final conversion probability for all 10 steps will match the 10 steps 10 year time period of conversion probability from the slr the interaction among agents is implicitly defined by how changes in the neighboring land use affects land use conversion decisions in terms of probability the sign of coefficients from slr represent the type negative or positive of spatial externality for each parcel agent to account for the probabilistic nature of conversions a monte carlo process of the abpm model was used by simulating 100 model runs each model run generated a different set of spatial land use conversion distribution due to the defined empirical structure of local probability model results showed fluctuations at consistent rate with 100 model runs therefore the choice of 100 model runs is judged to be adequate for testing the path dependency and stochastic processes in abpm projections of land use conversions for 100 model runs are mapped and probabilities are assigned to all developable parcels the probability of each parcel within 100 model runs where each model has 10 iterations is calculated as 11 p j x 1 100 c x 100 where pj is the probability of conversion for parcel j x is the number of model runs c is the boolean conversion in each model run results in either one or zero where one indicates conversion and zero represents no conversion these probabilities are the monte carlo probabilities once the monte carlo probabilities are mapped the threshold for probability is set to generate projected residential land use conversion data fragkias and seto 2007 based upon several studies thresholds for probability cut off points have ranged between 0 50 and 1 00 zeeb and burns 1998 louis and raines 2003 sohn and park 2008 fragkias and seto 2007 this shows that the parcels which have at least a 0 50 probability of land use conversion are assumed as residentially developed parcels value 1 while projected parcels with 0 50 probability are assumed as not converted parcels value 0 a data generator step and a land use conversion step are performed in each iteration in abpm the projected spatial land use patterns from abpm are further used as land use data layer for the swat model the swat model was simulated with projected land use scenario for spatial analysis of blue and green water using previously calibrated model parameters 2 2 3 4 population projection using zoning in usa the spatial land development is regulated through municipal zoning which depicts the acceptable types of future development consequently the spatial map of zoning for hunterdon and somerset counties were collected from north jersey transportation planning authority njtpa 2018 this zoning layer was used to estimate the available housing units that can be developed inside the study area data on housing units and population was extracted from u s census data for the year 2010 we found 1 housing unit per acre and 3 person per housing unit based upon current zoning and population data respectively the zoning map was overlaid with projected 2022 new residential land use based on the housing unit density for different zoning categories numbers of housing units hu were estimated from per hu mean population we estimated the additional population for the year 2022 the new population for each subbasin which was the summation of the 2010 population of each subbasin and new projected population based on combination of zoning and projected residential land from abpm model was used to estimate the water scarcity for the year 2022 3 results and discussions 3 1 swat model calibration and validation model evaluation parameters nse pbias and rsr are presented for monthly streamflow calibration and validation in the nrw for the water security analysis table 2 the overall modeling period was from 2004 to 2014 while the calibration period was between 2004 and 2009 and the validation period was between 2010 and 2014 overall the model is performing good for streamflow due to 0 69 nse 5 60 pbias and 0 56 rsr based on the guideline developed by moriasi et al 2007 the streamflow hydrographs of observed and simulated data is presented during calibration and validation period fig 3 in most cases the observed streamflow is slightly higher than the simulated streamflow which suggests that swat model underestimates streamflow these results may be due to higher percentage of urban area in the watershed that increases the impervious surface making the watershed flashier a similar result was also observed by giri et al 2016a and qiu and wang 2014 in the same watershed 3 2 future land use conversion based on agent based probabilistic model 3 2 1 spatial logistic regression model statistics for the slr analysis are summarized in table 3 there were 569 212 cells sample observations in raster map used in slr out of which 12 474 cells were converted from non residential to residentially developed cells between 2002 and 2012 statistical significance for the slr model was found with a p value substantially less than 0 01 roc was performed by comparing the fitted cells projected to convert with actual cells that did convert during 2002 2012 roc represents the model s ability to predict the conversion probability at various locations in the study area tayyebi et al 2010 the resultant roc for the slr model shows a high value of 0 7135 table 4 the slr coefficient are based upon the raster data and they can be regarded as weights to produce the global probability of change shirzadi et al 2012 as the results in table 4 indicate the closer a developable parcel is to surrounding agricultural and forest land the higher the probability of conversion positive coefficient signs were estimated for distances to residential parcels streams highways and train stations which suggest that further the parcel is from these location features higher the probability of conversion 3 2 2 agent based probabilistic model results the monte carlo projection in darker red color shows the area that are potential residential area during 2022 fig 4 the land use conversion projection from abm shows that most projected land converted from forest compared to agricultural land which may be due to forest being dominant land in the area the total developable land in the study area consisted of 2465 ha forest and 3007 ha of agricultural land out of total 5472 ha of developable land approximately 1766 ha were converted into residential area from the total newly developed residential area 727 ha converted from agricultural land and the remaining 1039 ha converted from forest table 5 most of the predicted conversions captured in the model are close to the existing forest properties this is the most predictable type of leapfrog residential growth pattern with current calibration from slr model 3 3 water security analysis based on current land use and population spatial variation of blue and green water in nrw is calculated based on the 16 years 2000 2015 of annual swat model output the spatial distribution of blue water green water flow and green water storage follow expected patterns in relation to precipitation and land use figs 5 and 6 overall blue water in the watershed varies between 35 and 48 percent of precipitation green water flow ranges from 60 to 65 percent of precipitation and green water storage varies between 8 and 17 percent of precipitation the temporal variation of blue water green water flow and green water storage was primarily dependent on the evaporation more detail description on temporal variation of blue water green water flow and green water storage is provided in the supplimentary material a water scarcity score of less than one indicates no water scarcity scores greater than one were classed as mild or moderate or severe water scarcity based on the circumstances of the watershed the spatial distribution of blue water scarcity varies from 0 to 5 fig 7 the maximum blue water scarcity was predicted to occur on the north east edge of the watershed along with some central subbasins associated with the most urbanized areas the lower blue water scarcity was found in the central subbasins which are dominated by crop lands and pasture or hay fig 6 the spatial distribution of green water scarcity varies from 3 to 15 fig 8 the maximum green water scarcity was associated with areas of urban land use and higher intensity agricultural cropping in urban areas the rate of infiltration is less than other land uses due to presence of higher percentage of impervious cover leading to lower initial soil moisture and consequently higher green water scarcity the evapotranspiration in the crop land hay or pasture land is likely to be higher leading to higher green water scarcity the lowest green water scarcity is observed along the southeast edge of the watershed associated with the highest green water storage fig 5d 3 4 water security analysis based on projected land use and population based on the agent based modelled land use as of 2022 the spatial distribution of blue water green water flow and green water storage was modelled fig 9 overall an increase in blue water was estimated for 2022 land use scenario compared to 2012 land use which may be due to increase in urban area residential rea leading to increased impervious surface and greater surface runoff a decrease in green water flow and green water storage was predicted for the 2022 land use scenario compared to the 2012 land use this may be due to lesser soil moisture availability due to lesser infiltration as a result of urbanization even though increasing blue water was estimated in the projected land use and population scenario blue water scarcity was predicted to increase slightly over the current situation fig 10 this result may be due to increasing water demand in the residential areas due to a projected increase in population by nearly 100 percent the projected population pattern follows the spatial distribution of land use conversion from the abpm resulting into nearly doubling of population in the study area the spatial distribution of increasing population is presented in the supplementary material fig s5 green water scarcity ranges from 2 to 10 fig 11 though green water flow and green water storage are expected to decrease somewhat under future conditions increasing green water scarcity was observed in only a small number of study area sub basins however if the increase in urban land trend continues that may create problems for agricultural activities such as growing corn soybean and wheat in the watershed due to decreased green water storage 4 conclusions the integrated modeling framework we have developed consisting of a physically based spatially distributed hydrological model swat loosely coupled with an agent based probabilistic land use conversion model permitted an analysis of the how the factors affecting blue versus green water security vary both spatially and temporally in our study central new jersey watershed the subbasins with the highest blue water scarcity were associated with higher amounts of urban land and higher water demand by residents green water scarcity was associated with urban land use and agricultural dominated areas of lowest initial soil moisture and higher evapotranspiration the agent based probabilistic model working at the scale of land ownership parcels predicted that future urban development would be the result of forest rather than farm land conversion a consequence of the loss of forest land and increasing impervious surface were lower infiltration rates leading to higher blue water but lower green water however a slight increase in blue water scarcity is expected compared to current scenario due to increase in urban land as a result of nearly 100percent increase in population in the study area though green water flow and green water storage are expected to decrease somewhat under future conditions increasing green water scarcity was observed in only a small number of study area sub basins the integrated modeling framework we have employed here could be improved by i a better representationof interbasin transfers by incorporating the actual source of water used by individual parcels i e imported surface water vs on sitewell water and the export via sewage treatment plants outside the basin ii incorporation of actual soil moisture and evapotranspiration data for calibration and validation of green water components and iii use of more than one land use conversion threshold to capture more possible land transformation scenarios freshwater is widely regarded as critical to provide food security as well as safe drinking water to human society however the question remains with the increasing population growth climate change and land cover transformation whether the limited amount of freshwater is sustainable to all parts of the globe if not then how do we identify the locations where the availability of freshwater is inadequate considering the hydrological climatic condition ecological and human consumption factors simultaneously for current as well as future land use development the integrated modeling framework we have developed informs policymakers and watershed managers a better understanding of how interaction or change of different physical parameters in the watershed where hotspots and when which time period in year water scarcity may occur across the landscape the framework also allows changing future conditions whether due to climate change or land use conversion to be more readily analyzed framing this placed based decision making in the context of blue versus green water concepts shifts the focus of water resources planners and managers from traditional runoff management more towards a more rainwater management falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 such a shift in focus will bring the critical role of land use activities on managing the various components of green

growing population schuol et al 2008 adequate amounts of freshwater are also vital for supporting aquatic biodiversity harrison et al 2016 however freshwater is often limited in quantity and is vulnerable to human activities such as urbanization agriculture reservoir formation irrigation and inter basin transfer vorosmarty et al 2010 ensuring the availability of freshwater is complicated by changing precipitation patterns longer dry spells higher evapotranspiration and increased frequency of extreme events such as droughts and floods bogardi et al 2012 water scarcity defined as the ratio of water demand over water availability provides an indicator of the water stress within a system the present water scarcity that is prevalent in many parts of the globe is expected to increase in the coming years due to population growth and climate change water security is referred as an acceptable level of water related risks to humans and ecosystems coupled with the availability of water of sufficient quantity and quality to support livelihoods national security human health and ecosystem services bakker 2012 water security for humans addresses multi faceted requirements starting from domestic water to maintenance of ecosystems and biodiversity water security assessment based on the concept of blue versus green water is becoming widely accepted globally veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 schuol et al 2008 blue water flows over or under the soil surface and is generally stored in rivers lakes aquifers reservoirs and wetlands green water derives from precipitation and is stored in the upper layers of the soil or vegetation and returns to atmosphere through evapotranspiration rodrigues et al 2014 zang et al 2012 green water can be further divided into green water flow and green water storage green water storage is the amount of soil moisture whereas green water flow is the sum of actual evapotranspiration schuol et al 2008 in other words blue water is the combination of surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge while green water is the summation of evapotranspiration and soil water content i e mediated by plants faramarzi et al 2008 the differentiation of blue versus green water in the assessment of water security reflects the growing recognition for the explicit consideration of the water required for biomass production such as food and timber the water requirement for biomass production surpasses all other water dependent processes falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 both blue and green water are directly or indirectly related to human consumption for example water withdrawal from a river for drinking purposes is the direct use of blue water for human consumption while use of soil water for crop production represents use of green water for human consumption consequently management of both blue and green water is helpful in identifying the geographic hotspots in the watershed with limited freshwater availability to help balance competing demands such as maintaining environmental flows satisfying water requirements for agriculture and water withdrawal for drinking and other purposes water resource managers often rely on spatially distributed dynamic process models many approaches such as crop wat decision support tool allen et al 1998 data generalization shiklomanov and rodda 2003 general circulation models oki and kanae 2006 wasmod m a conceptual water budgeting model widen nilsson et al 2007 lpjml model global vegetation and water balance model rost et al 2008 are available in the public domain to quantify blue and green water in particular the soil and water assessment tool swat due to its process based structure and spatially distributed implementation has found widespread application in the evaluation of the spatiotemporal variation of blue and green water in various river basins across the globe faramarzi et al 2008 schuol et al 2008 zang et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2014 zuo et al 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 swat has the ability to model hydrology plant growth related processes and incorporate different agricultural management practices which are essential from water balance prospective giri et al 2014 it can also be used to model nutrient runoff and water quality impacts from both agricultural and urban land uses qiu and wang 2014 panagopoulos et al 2015 giri et al 2016a the availability of both blue and green water are directly or indirectly affected by how humans are using the land the latter half of the 20th into the first decade of the 21st century exhibited dramatic population growth and suburbanization in exurban areas across the united states adjacent to but outside of traditionally defined metropolitan areas qian 2010 white et al 2009 alig 2010 in these non metro counties as well as the outer counties within metro regions forest and agricultural lands were converted into residential and commercial land uses while this rapid growth cooled during the recession recent annual population estimates 2015 2016 suggest that this period may simply be a short term interruption in suburbanization with outlying counties in metro areas once again growing faster than central urban counties us economic research service 2017 stated differently while suburban sprawl and rural land conversion may have slowed it isn t dead yet more importantly the legacy of past land use change continues to have implications for blue and green water resources in these exurban suburban areas urban development leads to increasing impervious surface as a result of increase in streets parking lots sidewalk driveways and rooftop consequently the watershed surface runoff is increased by increasing curve number cn streamflow flood volume and having shorter time of concentration in contrast groundwater recharge is decreased due to lesser infiltration as a result of increasing impervious surface the change in both surface runoff and infiltration affects both blue and green water components therefore understanding the consequences of past urbanization and the potential future land use conversion on blue and green water is requisite for better water resources management to analyze past land use conversion and to project the pace and pattern of future change land use researchers and planners have turned to a variety of modelling approaches including spatial econometric cellular automata and agent based models bockstael 1996 parker and meretsky 2004 polhill et al 2008 an agent based model abm is a simulation modeling framework where various behaviors of individuals or agents are programmed through their interactions and choice principles gimblett et al 2002 o sullivan et al 2012 abms are used to predict land use pattern by incorporating spatial variations and interactions among different components or agents of the system heppenstall et al 2012 as well as the inherent properties of the land i e slope soil type productivity property parcel size accessibility and buildable structures abms can incorporate spatial context as well as the stochasticity and uncertainty in generating land use patterns to help mimic the complexity of coupled land use watershed systems as many land use decisions are made at the level of the individual ownership parcel property parcels are suitably regarded as agents le et al 2010 applying an abm framework within geographical information system gis greatly facilitates the modeling of spatially explicit land use decision making at property parcel or plot scale najlis and north 2004 johnston 2013 and linking land use policies to potential land use patterns d aquino et al 2015 additionally abm can also provide means to link changing land use to changes in water quality at a watershed scale arbab et al 2016 due to the tight coupling between land use and the partitioning of blue and green water within a watershed an integrated geospatial modeling framework that links land use and watershed hydrological processes is needed to predict the consequences of future land use change on water security such a framework would also enable a more thorough investigation of the spatio temporal variation of blue and green water by incorporating both current and future land uses in swat model along with abm modeling framework this study addresses following key questions i how does the spatial distribution of blue and green water vary across a central new jersey watershed under current and projected land use and ii how does the water security situation potentially change under future land use and population 2 methodology 2 1 study area the raritan basin located in central new jersey fig 1 has increased population and urban land by 25 6 percent and 35 8 percent respectively since 1990 2010 giri et al 2016b the neshanic river watershed nrw is the headwater to raritan basin hydrologic unit code is huc 02030105030 while the nrw is currently less developed regional development and population growth trends suggest that this area will be subject to increasing development pressures in the coming years this increasing population and development trend combined with sporadic drought warning category based on water supply by the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep prompted us to select nrw as study area for water security analysis out of total nrw watershed area 142 km2 39 percent consists of agricultural lands 32 percent contains forest 28 percent comprises of urban lands and remainder are wetlands barren land and water the elevation of the nrw ranges from 20 m to 201 m above mean sea level the nrw belongs to piedmont physiographic region where the topography is primarily low rolling plains divided by higher ridges underlain by folded and faulted sedimentary and igneous rocks the soils are well drained silty soil where major crops including hay pasture corn and soybean are observed minor crops grown in the watershed are winter wheat rye and oats the climate in the watershed varies from hot and humid summer to cold winter representing humid climate 2 2 integrated modeling framework the integrated modeling framework for this water security study consists of three primary components 1 hydrological modeling framework 2 agent based modeling framework and 3 spatial data analysis framework fig 2 the following section describes in detail of each modeling framework data requirement data source and procedure 2 2 1 hydrologic modeling framework the swat model was used to simulate the hydrologic processes in the study area and calculated different components of blue and green water swat is a physically based spatially distributed watershed scale model that simulates continuous daily time step streamflow sediment nutrients chemicals and pathogens transport in a watershed after incorporating different input data such as digital elevation model land use land cover soil and meteorological data arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2004 swat divides the whole watershed into smaller units known as subbasin and it is based on the topography so that flow within each subbasin can direct to a single point called subbasin outlet subbasins are further partitioned into smaller unit known as hydrologic response unit hru which has unique land use soil slope and management the major components of swat model are hydrology soil plant growth weather nutrients pesticides and land management practices gassman et al 2007 simulated processes include runoff infiltration evaporation plant uptake lateral flow and percolation to shallow and deep aquifer in this study arcswat version 2012 10 3 18 was used in arcgis 10 3 environment and nrw was divided into 115 subbasins and 9291 hrus 2 2 1 1 data sources swat model requires different types of data such as physiographic data streamflow and meteorological data for hydrology simulation in the watershed a detail description of all the data and their sources used in the swat model can be found in table 1 the land use of the study area was represented by njdep 2012 land use land cover data njdep 2012 the njdep land use data was categorized into six broader categories such as urban wetlands agricultural lands water and barren land while it has 51 subcategories based on modified anderson classification system njdep 2012 the 16 subcategories of urban land were assigned to the swat urban land category based on the percent of impervious surface to identify specific cropping pattern within agricultural land 2015 crop data layer from usda national agricultural statistics service was used nass 2015 both land uses were combined in arcgis environment to process the data meteorological data consisted of precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed daily precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the national climatic data center for 16 year time period 2000 2015 for three weather stations one station was inside the study area while other two stations were located closer to the nrw edge fig 1 the remaining meteorological data were estimated using swat weather generator daily streamflow data for usgs gauging station 01398000 was obtained and converted into monthly basis to calibrate and validate the streamflow in the watershed fig 1 to process the hydrology correctly different management operations for different crops such as corn soybean winter wheat hay pasture rye and oats were developed the management operation includes date and types of tillage equipment used amount and date of fertilization planting and harvesting these information were collected after series of interview with nrcs personnel and local stakeholders in the study area in swat model urban land has two parts 1 impervious and 2 pervious part in the pervious part lawn management consists of mowing and fertilizer application were incorporated and these information was obtained from landscape professionals and residents inside the study area 2 2 1 2 sensitivity analysis and model calibration sensitivity analysis performed by two prior studies giri et al 2016a qiu and wang 2014 was conducted to identify the most influential parameters with respect to model output calibration was performed using manual calibration helper in swat model using the sensitive parameters as well as understanding of the hydrologic characteristics of the study watershed the calibration parameters used for streamflow were baseflow alpha factor deep aquifer percolation fraction surface runoff lag coefficient hydraulic conductivity in the main channel groundwater delay time groundwater revap coefficient soil evaporation compensation factor curve number available water capacity of the soil layer maximum canopy storage manning s n for overland flow manning s n for main channel threshold depth of shallow aquifer threshold depth for revap snowmelt base temperature and snowpack temperature lag factor these parameters were manually adjusted within the lower and upper bounds the calibrated value of these parameters are presented in supplementary material table s1 validation was performed followed by model calibration to establish model reliability a two years 2002 and 2003 warm up period was used to initialize the model parameters model calibration was performed on a monthly time step between 2004 and 2009 and validation was

nse pbias and rsr can be found from giri et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2007 2 2 2 spatial data analysis framework spatial data analysis framework was used to calculate both blue and green water scarcity in the study area all the processes were performed in arcgis environment the following section describes the calculation of blue and green water scarcity associated with other components 2 2 2 1 analysis of blue and green water blue water was calculated as the summation of water yield and groundwater storage fig 2 water yield is the total amount of water leaving the hru and entering the main channel as streamflow and swat output file wyld was used groundwater was calculated as the difference between amount of water entering to both shallow and deep aquifer and the groundwater discharge into stream veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 the swat output file used for water entering to both shallow and deep aquifer and the groundwater discharge into stream are gw rchg and gw q respectively green water was estimated as the summation of soil moisture and evapotranspiration fig 2 veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 schuol et al 2008 2 2 2 2 blue water scarcity blue water scarcity is the ratio of the blue water required or withdrawn over the amount available veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 1 bluewater scarcity bluewater requirement or withdrawal bluewater availability a blue water scarcity values of less than one indicates no water scarcity blue water scarcity values of greater than one can be further categorized into mild or moderate or severe water scarcity based on the particular circumstances of the watershed blue water withdrawal for this study was obtained from the usgs in the form of county level total water surface and groundwater withdrawal usgs 2017 the most recent 2010 total water withdrawal as well as total population for hunterdon county the county in which our study basin is located the total water withdrawal was the summation of surface and groundwater withdrawal for different sectors such as public supply domestic use industrial purpose irrigation livestock aquaculture mining and thermoelectric out of total water withdrawal surface water contributed 86 percent while groundwater consisted of 14 percent among different sectors of water withdrawal public supply and domestic use were the highest recipient of water from surface water and groundwater respectively crop irrigation does not represent a significant use in this watershed total water withdrawal per person was achieved by dividing total water withdrawal to total population to obtain the total water withdrawal within each subbasin the most recent 2010 population data was obtained in the form of census tracts from the united states census bureau uscb 2017 the census tract was intersected by the study area boundary however the census tract boundaries did not exactly match with the subbasin boundaries therefore percent of different census tract contributing to each subbasin was calculated to estimate the total population within each subbasin the total water withdrawal within each subbasin was estimated by multiplying the total population within each subbasin with total water withdrawal per person blue water availability for withdrawal should include environmental flow requirement blue water availability in stream is calculated based on the following equation veettil and mishra 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2011 2 blue water availability stream streamflow environmentalflowrequirment where environmental flow requirement refers to minimum amount of streamflow required to maintain the downstream ecological integrity of most rivers or streams and is equal to 0 8 times of streamflow richter et al 2012 developed this 80 percent stream flow protection standards to maintain ecological integrity of downstream aquatic ecosystems this benchmark is also consistent with other studies such as by brizga et al 2002 in queensland australia as well as carlisle et al 2010 in the united states a similar environmental flow requirement concept was also applied to groundwater to protect the potential impact of over exploitation of groundwater to many aquatic and riparian ecosystems gleeson and richter 2017 the blue water availability in groundwater was calculated based on the following equation 3 blue wateravailability groundwater groundwater environmentalflowrequirement where environmental flow requirement is equal to 0 8 times of groundwater the groundwater was calculated as the summation of area of each hru within subbasin times the difference between amount of water entering to both shallow and deep aquifer and the groundwater discharge into stream the blue water availability was the summation of blue water in stream and groundwater calculated using equation 2 and 3 annual streamflow and groundwater of 2010 predicted by swat model for each subbasin was used for blue water availability calculation streamflow and groundwater of 2010 was used for blue water availability calculation to maintain consistency with available total water withdrawal and population data 2 2 2 3 green water scarcity green water scarcity is an indicator which evaluates water security in a region it is calculated using the following equation veettil and mishra 2016 hoekstra et al 2011 4 green water scarcity green water requirement orwithdrawal green water availability the green water scarcity values can be interpreted in a similar way as described for blue water scarcity green water requirement or withdrawal is the actual evapotranspiration which was obtained from the hru output of the simulated swat model green water availability is the initial soil water content available for plant and soil evapotranspiration and it is calculated as the difference between soil moisture at the root zone and wilting point rodrigues et al 2014 initial soil water content was also obtained from hru out of the simulated swat model and used for the green water scarcity calculation temporal variation of precipitation blue water green water flow and green water storage were generated using r platform from monthly swat output during 2000 2015 2 2 3 agent based modeling framework the abm is based on two modules spatial logistics regression slr and agent based probabilistic model abpm to illustrate the driving factors of land use change and land use conversions 2 2 3 1 spatial logistic regression model abms have incorporated values for neighboring land use impacts and these relative values are based on researcher postulated estimates parker and meretsky 2004 brown et al 2005 polhill et al 2008 one way to improve these abm parameter estimates of neighborhood impacts is through an empirical parameterization using spatial land use change data this empirical approach has the capability to quantify spatial externalities of neighborhood land uses and locational features using observed land use conversions arbab 2014 arbab et al 2016 the slr model is often used to provide spatially explicit empirical estimates of these neighborhood and proximate economic externalities arbab et al 2016 the empirical structure of the logistic regression function describes a functional relationship between land use conversion and a set of explanatory factors that influence conversion probability for non residential land xie et al 2005 this empirical structure is used in characterizing the land use conversion decision for each property parcel in abm the slr coefficients are derived from raster based data and these coefficients can be regarded as weights to produce the probability of conversion to developed land use shirzadi et al 2012 the future land use patterns generated in abm are conditional to the sequential land use conversions resulting in variation in neighboring land uses this sequential process can best be defined by updating the probability of land use conversion influencing by proximity effect of neighboring features wu 2002 the agents in abm can be passive and social agents walsh et al 2013 in land use conversion modeling property parcels have been defined as passive agents and the type of each property parcel provides the further classification of these agents such as parcels that are available for residential conversions can be choice making unit for developers in abm such system in this integrated framework provides the impact of land use conversion stemming from the local level conversion choice making of individuals both slr and abm models account conversion in one way from agricultural and forest properties to residential properties a necessary condition in the abm model for land use conversion from agricultural or forest land into residential land use is that land values for residential use is higher than values for agricultural or forest use this condition is set due to urbanization being the most important factor influencing farmland conversion olson and olson 1999 rosenberger et al 2002 having this necessary condition our research is grounded in two strands of theoretical approaches to explain residential land value 1 land value as a function of proximity to economic locations and 2 land value as a function of surrounding location specific attributes to predict land use conversion probabilities from 2012 to 2022 a slr model was used to calculate the probability of land use conversion from 2002 to 2012 a slr model is developed in terrset software of terrset clarks labs 2016 the slr model implementation in terrset requires spatial data in raster format therefore raster cell is considered as a unit of observation in slr the empirically estimated relationship between the non residential land use conversion and the factors influencing the probability of conversion is expressed as the following functional form 5 p y 1 x exp β i x i 1 exp β i x i where p y 1 x the predicted probability value of the binary or dichotomous dependent variable y and y 1 means a cell in raster map changes from a non residential land use in 2002 to residential land use in 2012 otherwise y 0 xi independent variables including xo for the constant term βi coefficients of variables parameters the logistic function takes into account the linear probability in a set of parameters by having the range of probability between zero and one the following linear logit transformation on both sides of eq 5 was used to estimate the coefficients menard 1995 6 y logit p ln p k 1 p k β 0 β 1 x 1 k β 2 x 2 k β 3 x 3 k β 4 x 4 k β 5 x 5 k β 6 x 6 k where y is the probability that the dependent variable is 1 pk is the predicted probability of dependent variable of agricultural and forest land use conversion into residential land use β0 is the intercept and β1 β2 β3 β4 β5 and β6 are coefficients for variables which reflect distance to the nearest agricultural land use x1 forest x2 residential land use x3 stream x4 major highway x5 and distance to train station x6 respectively the sign of the parameter indicates the direction of the influence of each explanatory variable on conversion probability a negative coefficient sign shows that an increase in distance between a cell and the neighborhood externality would decrease the probability of conversion conversely a positive sign shows that as the distance of the cell to a land use or location feature increases the probability of conversion would increase following bid rent theory alonso 1964 mills 1967 muth 1969 the present abpm modeling approach is based upon the assumption that each land parcel is allocated to the use that maximizes the utility of its owner in the model distance to urban center represents proximity to economic activity centers schools shopping centers railway station and public services kitamura et al 1997 distances to the major highways and urban center are conceptualized using von thünen and the bid rent theory of urban economics where distance to the urban center and roads explains the land rent and transportation cost respectively under the relaxed assumptions of spatial variation in the landscape von thünen 1826 alonso 1964 mills 1967 muth 1969 distance to urban center is the major factor accounted in monocentric bid rent theory alonso 1964 as the distance from the urban center increases accessibility decreases which results in higher transportation costs distance to roads represents accessibility to metropolitan and urban areas workplace shopping and schools serneels and lambin 2001 spatial features surrounding property parcel impact the parcel value which is followed from the economic theory of hedonic property values wu 2006 distance to streams and forest are regarded as a relative measures for aesthetic amenities where closeness to streams and forests determines the value of parcel level neighboring characteristics since streams and forest represent amenities therefore they are expected to positively influence the probabilities of land use conversions irwin et al 2014 the distance to agricultural and residential land use accounts for neighboring externalities 2 2 3 2 slr model evaluation the slr model was validated using the quantitative measurement of receiver operator characteristic roc statistic which has been used as a reliable approach for model validation pontius and schneider 2001 arsanjani et al 2013 the roc predicts the location of conversion by comparing the actual change between 2002 and 2012 in a boolean raster data and the suitability fitted change between 2002 and 2012 several studies considered roc as reliable statistic to measure the goodness of fit for a logistic regression swets 1986 pontius and schneider 2001 verburg et al 2002 tayyebi et al 2010 the roc varies between 0 and 1 where 1 shows a perfect fit and 0 5 shows a random fit overall larger roc values show a better association between explanatory variables and the dependent variable a chi square distribution of likelihood ratio statistics was used to test the null hypothesis that all variables in the model measuring distances from surrounding land uses or amenities have no impact on whether a cell will be converted from non residential to residential land use since ordinary least square ols is not applicable due to the nonlinear functional form of logistic model wooldridge 2002 therefore maximum likelihood estimator mle was used mle estimator is suitable for the distribution of y given x this estimator includes heteroscedasticity in var y x and is consistent asymptotically normal and asymptotically efficient wooldridge 2002 2 2 3 3 agent based probabilistic model abpm abpm is programmed in a gis environment using python programming property parcels are assigned with land use conversion rule based upon empirical parameters from slr model agents in abpm are defined as the developable parcel including forest and agricultural non protected properties representing land owners choice making units or passive parcel agents based upon the majority of rural residential properties in 2012 the assumption in the model implies that developable parcels i e upland forest and agricultural land can only convert into rural residential parcels each agent parcel is autonomous by being owned and controlled by a single owner in reality a single owner may have multiple properties but the same property owner may convert the property parcel in one location without converting a property parcel owned at a different location in abpm an agent s decision rule is formulated based on empirical rules of land use conversion a similar framework where agents are characterized within a bounded rationality framework has been used in studies such as benenson and torrens 2004 and valbuena et al 2010 in abpm neighboring externalities are used as proxy for implicit spatial interactions and interdependencies neighborhood externalities were the estimated influence of each land use on surrounding parcels the agents conversion decisions is conditional upon the spatial distances from each neighboring land use over a period of 10 iterations a 10 year time period where each iteration is assumed to be a land use conversion event possibility initial conversions influences future conversions within each model run due to path dependent influence in decision making with modification of benenson and torrens 2004 approach parcel agent s probability prob of conversion from developable state m to residential state r in each iteration is programmed similar to arbab et al 2016 7 pr ob i s m s r s n i where n i represents parcel agent i s neighbors and s represents state of parcel i monte carlo process hagerstrand 1965 wu 2002 was employed to generate the results of a stochastic abpm simulation model to incorporate uncertainty and stochasticity in the abpm a probability function was used to condition the residential conversions utilizing a random number generator batty 2012 the conversion decision of agent in converting parcel into residential use was based upon a comparison between the random number generated and the probability value computed from eq 5 for each parcel as below eq 8 in eq 8 the random number generator rand αi has a random distribution that is uniform between 0 and 1 8 if rand α i p it thena it 1 r where r represents the land use class of residential development p is the probability of conversion to residential development for each parcel i a is the conversion event and t is iteration agents assess the probability of conversion by comparing it with a random number agents use if and then rule in parcel conversion the agent converts the parcel into a residentially developed parcel if the probability is higher than the random number if not then the parcel remains in its current undeveloped state this shows that probability which is driven by neighboring lands is indicator of parcels conversion the model runs in discrete event steps and generates spatial output of projected residential converted parcels and non converted parcels a total of 10 iteration steps were included in each model run within abpm the number of iterations steps was matched with training land use data set used in the slr model the raster data in slr consisted of 10 years of land use change from 2002 to 2012 the landscape was initialized as the actual land use in shape file for the year 2012 in arcpy program of python first agents identify whether the land parcel is developable or not then agents compute the mean euclidean distances from nearest agricultural forest and residential lands from their property parcel after the distances are calculated agents identify the coefficient values for these spatial externalities and identify the distances from roads train station and streams the coefficients of spatial externalities are imported in abm from slr model results parcel agents use the estimated slr coefficients in their conversion decision and for each iteration they calculate new values for the spatial externalities of neighboring lands due to changes in updated spatial patterns of land use parcel data in each iteration thus as the parcel landscape changes explanatory variables are recalculated by each parcel agent in the abpm agents incorporate assessed land uses in its type neighboring land uses and features distances into conversion of land use in each iteration the conversion decision due to uncertainty is probabilistic in abpm another factor in the residential land use conversions is generated probability value ranging from 0 pit 1 where i represents each parcel agent in each event t the agents make their conversion decisions based on constant information feedback of distances and quantified spatial externalities in each model run in a continuously iterative fashion liu et al 2013 arbab et al 2016 the conversion decision in abpm is not only influenced by the neighboring land use conversion but by the assigned coefficient values which exhibit the influence of each proximity factor spatial externalities on the probability of land use conversion the probability of conversion is further converted into stepwise probability for 10 iterations the relationship between pi computed with slr equation in abpm and pa a probability of conversion for each iteration is formulated as 9 p i 1 1 p a 10 10 p a 1 1 p i 0 1 pa is the average probability per iteration over the ten iterations and its value changes with each iteration due to changes in land use conversions the stepwise probability ensures the final conversion probability for all 10 steps will match the 10 steps 10 year time period of conversion probability from the slr the interaction among agents is implicitly defined by how changes in the neighboring land use affects land use conversion decisions in terms of probability the sign of coefficients from slr represent the type negative or positive of spatial externality for each parcel agent to account for the probabilistic nature of conversions a monte carlo process of the abpm model was used by simulating 100 model runs each model run generated a different set of spatial land use conversion distribution due to the defined empirical structure of local probability model results showed fluctuations at consistent rate with 100 model runs therefore the choice of 100 model runs is judged to be adequate for testing the path dependency and stochastic processes in abpm projections of land use conversions for 100 model runs are mapped and probabilities are assigned to all developable parcels the probability of each parcel within 100 model runs where each model has 10 iterations is calculated as 11 p j x 1 100 c x 100 where pj is the probability of conversion for parcel j x is the number of model runs c is the boolean conversion in each model run results in either one or zero where one indicates conversion and zero represents no conversion these probabilities are the monte carlo probabilities once the monte carlo probabilities are mapped the threshold for probability is set to generate projected residential land use conversion data fragkias and seto 2007 based upon several studies thresholds for probability cut off points have ranged between 0 50 and 1 00 zeeb and burns 1998 louis and raines 2003 sohn and park 2008 fragkias and seto 2007 this shows that the parcels which have at least a 0 50 probability of land use conversion are assumed as residentially developed parcels value 1 while projected parcels with 0 50 probability are assumed as not converted parcels value 0 a data generator step and a land use conversion step are performed in each iteration in abpm the projected spatial land use patterns from abpm are further used as land use data layer for the swat model the swat model was simulated with projected land use scenario for spatial analysis of blue and green water using previously calibrated model parameters 2 2 3 4 population projection using zoning in usa the spatial land development is regulated through municipal zoning which depicts the acceptable types of future development consequently the spatial map of zoning for hunterdon and somerset counties were collected from north jersey transportation planning authority njtpa 2018 this zoning layer was used to estimate the available housing units that can be developed inside the study area data on housing units and population was extracted from u s census data for the year 2010 we found 1 housing unit per acre and 3 person per housing unit based upon current zoning and population data respectively the zoning map was overlaid with projected 2022 new residential land use based on the housing unit density for different zoning categories numbers of housing units hu were estimated from per hu mean population we estimated the additional population for the year 2022 the new population for each subbasin which was the summation of the 2010 population of each subbasin and new projected population based on combination of zoning and projected residential land from abpm model was used to estimate the water scarcity for the year 2022 3 results and discussions 3 1 swat model calibration and validation model evaluation parameters nse pbias and rsr are presented for monthly streamflow calibration and validation in the nrw for the water security analysis table 2 the overall modeling period was from 2004 to 2014 while the calibration period was between 2004 and 2009 and the validation period was between 2010 and 2014 overall the model is performing good for streamflow due to 0 69 nse 5 60 pbias and 0 56 rsr based on the guideline developed by moriasi et al 2007 the streamflow hydrographs of observed and simulated data is presented during calibration and validation period fig 3 in most cases the observed streamflow is slightly higher than the simulated streamflow which suggests that swat model underestimates streamflow these results may be due to higher percentage of urban area in the watershed that increases the impervious surface making the watershed flashier a similar result was also observed by giri et al 2016a and qiu and wang 2014 in the same watershed 3 2 future land use conversion based on agent based probabilistic model 3 2 1 spatial logistic regression model statistics for the slr analysis are summarized in table 3 there were 569 212 cells sample observations in raster map used in slr out of which 12 474 cells were converted from non residential to residentially developed cells between 2002 and 2012 statistical significance for the slr model was found with a p value substantially less than 0 01 roc was performed by comparing the fitted cells projected to convert with actual cells that did convert during 2002 2012 roc represents the model s ability to predict the conversion probability at various locations in the study area tayyebi et al 2010 the resultant roc for the slr model shows a high value of 0 7135 table 4 the slr coefficient are based upon the raster data and they can be regarded as weights to produce the global probability of change shirzadi et al 2012 as the results in table 4 indicate the closer a developable parcel is to surrounding agricultural and forest land the higher the probability of conversion positive coefficient signs were estimated for distances to residential parcels streams highways and train stations which suggest that further the parcel is from these location features higher the probability of conversion 3 2 2 agent based probabilistic model results the monte carlo projection in darker red color shows the area that are potential residential area during 2022 fig 4 the land use conversion projection from abm shows that most projected land converted from forest compared to agricultural land which may be due to forest being dominant land in the area the total developable land in the study area consisted of 2465 ha forest and 3007 ha of agricultural land out of total 5472 ha of developable land approximately 1766 ha were converted into residential area from the total newly developed residential area 727 ha converted from agricultural land and the remaining 1039 ha converted from forest table 5 most of the predicted conversions captured in the model are close to the existing forest properties this is the most predictable type of leapfrog residential growth pattern with current calibration from slr model 3 3 water security analysis based on current land use and population spatial variation of blue and green water in nrw is calculated based on the 16 years 2000 2015 of annual swat model output the spatial distribution of blue water green water flow and green water storage follow expected patterns in relation to precipitation and land use figs 5 and 6 overall blue water in the watershed varies between 35 and 48 percent of precipitation green water flow ranges from 60 to 65 percent of precipitation and green water storage varies between 8 and 17 percent of precipitation the temporal variation of blue water green water flow and green water storage was primarily dependent on the evaporation more detail description on temporal variation of blue water green water flow and green water storage is provided in the supplimentary material a water scarcity score of less than one indicates no water scarcity scores greater than one were classed as mild or moderate or severe water scarcity based on the circumstances of the watershed the spatial distribution of blue water scarcity varies from 0 to 5 fig 7 the maximum blue water scarcity was predicted to occur on the north east edge of the watershed along with some central subbasins associated with the most urbanized areas the lower blue water scarcity was found in the central subbasins which are dominated by crop lands and pasture or hay fig 6 the spatial distribution of green water scarcity varies from 3 to 15 fig 8 the maximum green water scarcity was associated with areas of urban land use and higher intensity agricultural cropping in urban areas the rate of infiltration is less than other land uses due to presence of higher percentage of impervious cover leading to lower initial soil moisture and consequently higher green water scarcity the evapotranspiration in the crop land hay or pasture land is likely to be higher leading to higher green water scarcity the lowest green water scarcity is observed along the southeast edge of the watershed associated with the highest green water storage fig 5d 3 4 water security analysis based on projected land use and population based on the agent based modelled land use as of 2022 the spatial distribution of blue water green water flow and green water storage was modelled fig 9 overall an increase in blue water was estimated for 2022 land use scenario compared to 2012 land use which may be due to increase in urban area residential rea leading to increased impervious surface and greater surface runoff a decrease in green water flow and green water storage was predicted for the 2022 land use scenario compared to the 2012 land use this may be due to lesser soil moisture availability due to lesser infiltration as a result of urbanization even though increasing blue water was estimated in the projected land use and population scenario blue water scarcity was predicted to increase slightly over the current situation fig 10 this result may be due to increasing water demand in the residential areas due to a projected increase in population by nearly 100 percent the projected population pattern follows the spatial distribution of land use conversion from the abpm resulting into nearly doubling of population in the study area the spatial distribution of increasing population is presented in the supplementary material fig s5 green water scarcity ranges from 2 to 10 fig 11 though green water flow and green water storage are expected to decrease somewhat under future conditions increasing green water scarcity was observed in only a small number of study area sub basins however if the increase in urban land trend continues that may create problems for agricultural activities such as growing corn soybean and wheat in the watershed due to decreased green water storage 4 conclusions the integrated modeling framework we have developed consisting of a physically based spatially distributed hydrological model swat loosely coupled with an agent based probabilistic land use conversion model permitted an analysis of the how the factors affecting blue versus green water security vary both spatially and temporally in our study central new jersey watershed the subbasins with the highest blue water scarcity were associated with higher amounts of urban land and higher water demand by residents green water scarcity was associated with urban land use and agricultural dominated areas of lowest initial soil moisture and higher evapotranspiration the agent based probabilistic model working at the scale of land ownership parcels predicted that future urban development would be the result of forest rather than farm land conversion a consequence of the loss of forest land and increasing impervious surface were lower infiltration rates leading to higher blue water but lower green water however a slight increase in blue water scarcity is expected compared to current scenario due to increase in urban land as a result of nearly 100percent increase in population in the study area though green water flow and green water storage are expected to decrease somewhat under future conditions increasing green water scarcity was observed in only a small number of study area sub basins the integrated modeling framework we have employed here could be improved by i a better representationof interbasin transfers by incorporating the actual source of water used by individual parcels i e imported surface water vs on sitewell water and the export via sewage treatment plants outside the basin ii incorporation of actual soil moisture and evapotranspiration data for calibration and validation of green water components and iii use of more than one land use conversion threshold to capture more possible land transformation scenarios freshwater is widely regarded as critical to provide food security as well as safe drinking water to human society however the question remains with the increasing population growth climate change and land cover transformation whether the limited amount of freshwater is sustainable to all parts of the globe if not then how do we identify the locations where the availability of freshwater is inadequate considering the hydrological climatic condition ecological and human consumption factors simultaneously for current as well as future land use development the integrated modeling framework we have developed informs policymakers and watershed managers a better understanding of how interaction or change of different physical parameters in the watershed where hotspots and when which time period in year water scarcity may occur across the landscape the framework also allows changing future conditions whether due to climate change or land use conversion to be more readily analyzed framing this placed based decision making in the context of blue versus green water concepts shifts the focus of water resources planners and managers from traditional runoff management more towards a more rainwater management falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 such a shift in focus will bring the critical role of land use activities on managing the various components of green

7194,karst landforms account for 10 of the earths land surface and it is well known that water is a limiting factor for karst ecosystems because numerous underground fractures and conduits induce rapid drainage therefore an understanding of ecosystem water consumptions evapotranspiration and environmental controls is particularly important for land management on karst landforms this study compared the actual evapotranspiration aet characteristics and analyzed the controls of three agroforestry ecosystems by field observations using a refitted ventilated chamber thermal dissipation probes and micro lysimeters in a subtropical humid karst catchment from 12th march 2015 to 26th may 2016 results show that 1 the diurnal transpiration curves of trees plateau at noon with low fluctuations at a high level while evapotranspiration curves of grass and crop ecosystems present single peaks 2 aet of the forest grass mixed ecosystem 7 64 5 75 mm day 1 was significantly higher than crop 4 24 3 35 mm day 1 and grass ecosystems 5 78 3 53 mm day 1 3 aet of grass and crop ecosystems were most sensitive to temperature while the forest grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to leaf area index lai than other factors 4 aet of the forest grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to deep soil moisture 30 cm while grass and crop ecosystems were more sensitive to shallow soil moisture 10 cm and 20 cm this study suggests that soil water content was not key limit factors to aet in humid karst landscapes however lai which can be controlled by land management heavily influenced aet rates and e aet e evaporation ratio through changing water demand keywords karst landscape sap flow evapotranspiration environmental controls agroforestry ecosystems ventilated chamber 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a central process for ecosystems that returns approximately 67 of annual precipitation onto land back to the atmosphere zhang et al 2016 evapotranspiration uniquely links the water cycle energy cycle and carbon cycle it is a key climatic predictor of agroforestry ecosystem health and is the predominant variable needed for water management in agroforestry production allen and breshears 1998 anderson et al 2012 fisher et al 2017 jung et al 2010 koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2006 therefore various et processes in different agroforestry ecosystems have been studied alkaisi et al 1989 dickinson et al 1991 ding et al 2013 fisher et al 2017 kite 2000 kite and droogers 2000 kool et al 2014 tanaka et al 2008 however previous studies have mainly focused on tropical rain forests subalpine forest and plain croplands and no studies have compared the et processes between agricultural and forestry systems in karst landscapes karst landforms represent approximately 10 of the earth s land surface and play and important role in water supply especially in southwest china which has one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world yang et al 2017 however this region is generally underdeveloped overpopulated and is characterized by severe rocky desertification hartmann et al 2014b nie et al 2012 yang et al 2017 though the climate is humid with abundant precipitation water stress frequently occurs since the water holding capacity of the thin soil layer is low liu et al 2016 to restore ecological systems and improve their functions the water consumption processes of grass trees and traditional crops maize soybean and sweet potato should be understood in detail some previous studies have focused on et of some special species for example swaffer and holland 2015 compared ecophysiological traits and et of pinus halepensis overlying a karst aquifer however no studies have compared et

a aet v where t sum kg day 1 is the sum of six zenia insignis trees transpiration a m2 is the cover area of the six trees and aet v is the aet measured by ventilated chamber in the understory of this ecosystem soil evaporation e was measured using micro lysimeters made of 10 cm outer diameter 20 cm depth pvc cylinders the inner diameter of the pvc cylinders were 9 5 cm boast and robertson 1982 the pvc cylinders were encased by pvc outer cylinders of slightly larger diameter but of the same depth as the inner cylinders balwinder singh et al 2014 every cylinder held a soil core that was obtained using a wooden hammer driving it into the soil this was done causing minimum soil disturbance so that the obtained soil core remained as much as possible in the same condition as the surrounding soil allen 1990 three cylinders were set in every ecosystem under grass or crops near the ventilated chamber congruent with the ventilated chamber operation the cylinders were weighed every two hours from 6 00 am to 20 00 pm to determine water loss 2 4 sensitivity analysis partial derivatives were used to analyze the sensitivity of aet to different factors the dimensionless relative sensitivity coefficient was first proposed by mccuen and decoursey has been widely employed in hydrology literature for quantitative sensitivity analysis the equation is expressed as coleman and decoursey 1976 hill et al 1986 nouri et al 2017 4 sc x i lim δ x i 0 δ l t 0 l t 0 δ x i x i l t 0 x i x i l t 0 where scx i is the sensitivity coefficient of lt 0 a variable to x i and where x i is an independent factor a positive magnitude of scx i implies an increase in lt 0 as x i increases likewise a negative magnitude of scx i implies a decrease in lt 0 as x i decreases the greater the scx i the higher the expected sensitivity of lt 0 to x i to ensure plant accept water unrestrictedly the ventilated chambers were not used on rainy days therefore only 65 sunny days were selected to compare et dynamics and environmental controls 3 results 3 1 dynamics of the meteorological factors the meteorological factors ta rh vpd and wind speed ws measured inside the forest grass mixed ecosystem were similar to those outside the forest in the crop ecosystem except for par and precipitation prcp fig 2 as shown in fig 2a ta exhibited obvious seasonal variation and was generally higher than 10 c the rh was generally higher than 80 fig 2c except for some days in the winter the ws fig 2e showed seasonal variation and was highest between january and april the par fig 2b exhibited great differences between inside the forest and outside the forest measuring 121 2 53 9 μe and 200 1 77 9 μe respectively note that are the mean and standard deviation between 12 march 2015 and 26 may 2016 mean prcp fig 2f intensity was 4 78 6 73 mm day 1 within forest grass ecosystem and 5 62 7 86 mm day 1 in the crop ecosystem respectively 3 2 evapotranspiration dynamics of three agroforestry ecosystems as shown in fig 3 a e the dynamics of diurnal aet from five representative days exhibited noticeable seasonal variation the aet was clearly related to vegetation type and the aet of forest grass mixed ecosystem was the highest overall the diurnal aet for the three ecosystems showed similar patterns aet generally increased at approximately 7 00 a m reached a peak value at noon and then decreased gradually however the transpiration values fig 3b and c for trees stayed at peak level with small fluctuations for several hours the daily aet fig 3f exhibited noticeable seasonal variation but the magnitude of seasonal variation varied by ecosystems specifically aet in the winter november march was low 2 05 1 16 mm day 1 1 65 1 17 mm day 1and 3 06 1 38 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively mean one standard deviation began to increase in late march reached a peak in june and august 14 85 3 82 mm day 1 7 72 3 38 mm day 1 and 9 22 3 44 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively and then decreased gradually during the study period the overall average aet of the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem were 7 64 5 75 mm day 1 4 24 3 35 mm day 1 and 5 78 3 53 mm day 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 the e aet evaporation actual evapotranspiration ratios exhibited noticeable seasonality for all three ecosystems and were related to vegetation type overall the ratios were lower in the growing season apr oct 0 60 for the crop ecosystem and forest grass mixed ecosystem and 0 30 for the grass ecosystem than in the non growing season the exception was the ratio of e aet for the crop ecosystem which was high during the rotation period between maize and soybean but was low in the winter when sweet potato was still growing additionally the ratios of growing seasons e aet for the forest grass mixed ecosystem 0 33 0 20 and grass ecosystem 0 36 0 18 were noticeably lower than in the crop ecosystems 0 56 0 13 3 3 sensitivity analysis of meteorological controls as shown in table 3 the sensitivity coefficients of meteorological controls on aet ranked differently for the different ecosystems generally positive coefficients imply positive correlation between the variables and aet whereas negative coefficients indicate an inverse correlation of aet with parameter changes only rh was negatively correlated to aet the ta was the variable most strongly correlated to daily aet in the grass ecosystem under forest crop and grass ecosystem but the most sensitive factor was lai for trees and forest grass mixed ecosystems for all ecosystems the least sensitive factor was θ the sensitivity coefficients of ta prcp lai par and vpd 0 35 were significantly higher than those of ws rh and θ 0 23 for all ecosystems which suggests that soil water may not be an important limiting factor in this area 3 4 soil water content and its impact on aet soil water content of the three ecosystems fig 5 b d was generally relatively high 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and was sensitive to dry weather for example in 2015 θ decreased sharply from 0 33 cm3 cm 3 in late march to 0 21 cm3 cm 3 in mid april similar variation was also found in other periods the sensitivity of aet to θ is different between the three ecosystems and it also varied at different soil layers within same ecosystem the θ in the forest grass mixed ecosystem was lowest at 10 cm soil depth and increased in order of 10 30 20 40 60 cm in the crop ecosystems θ was also lowest in the 10 cm soil layer and increased in order of 10 30 20 60 40 cm in the grass ecosystem the lowest θ was in the 20 cm soil layer and increased in order of 20 30 10 60 40 cm the responses of θ to drought stress were noticeably different for the three ecosystems for example in the period between 1 apr 2015 and 26 apr 2015 θ at 20 cm and 60 cm layers decreased more sharply than other soil layers in the forest grass mixed ecosystem in response to drought but the sharpest decreases in θ in response to drought stress were observed in the 10 cm soil layer in the crop ecosystem and in the 10 20 and 30 cm soil layers for grass ecosystem as shown in table 4 it was clear that θ at 10 cm had the largest impact on et for the grass ecosystem under the forests but that the 20 cm soil layer was most important for both crop and grass ecosystems the largest difference in θ between the forest grass mixed ecosystem and other two ecosystems occurred in the 60 cm soil layer though the sensitivity coefficients of θ at each layer were small 0 19 they rank differently for the different ecosystems which suggests that the depth of the water source may be different for may be different for grass crops and trees overall the et of the forest grass mixed ecosystem or trees was more sensitive to deep θ 40 cm and 60 cm while grass and crop ecosystems were more sensitive to shallow θ 10 cm and 20 cm 4 discussion some previous studies have compared et characteristics and environmental controls for different agroforestry ecosystems in various landscapes nouri et al 2017 tanaka et al 2008 however no previous studies have reported this information from subtropical humid karst areas our data suggest that the trees exhibit diurnal transpiration curves that plateau at noon with low fluctuations in dirunal cycles while et curves of grass and crop ecosystems present single peaks daily aet rates and e aet ratios fig 4 were different for different ecosystems fig 3f for all three ecosystems ta prcp par lai and vpd had the greatest influence on aet but the effects of ws rh and θ were limited table 2 on the diurnal scale transpiration was limited by soil water trunk water and the plant water transport mechanisms schulze et al 1985 plant water uptake is limited by the soil hydraulic conductivity and trunk resistance therefore water uptake cannot keep pace with potential water reduction zhou et al 2013 as a result peak transpiration appears earlier than evaporation which is likely caused by physioecological responses e g stomata closure of plants to high temperature and dry air to avoid excessive water loss du et al 2011 fiora and cescatti 2006 ford et al 2004 kool et al 2014 paudel et al 2013 the difference of daily aet rates for the three agroecosystems was mainly caused by different plant species and densities lai dickinson et al 1991 ge et al 2011 kite 2000 kite and droogers 2000 tanaka et al 2008 under the same environmental conditions the space between crops mainly for maize and soybean is greater as it is managed by famers than grass to ensure high crop production this leads to relatively smaller lai and less water consumption from crops compared to grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems alkaisi et al 1989 soegaard and boegh 1995 steduto and hsiao 1998 with higher lai biomass forest grass mixed ecosystems have higher water demand than grass and crop ecosystems bernhofer 1992 bernhofer and gay 1989 cornish and vertessy 2001 cristiano et al 2015 kumagai et al 2014 sun et al 2008 swift et al 1975 vourlitis et al 2002 though the plant density is managed by humans lai of the three ecosystems was still consistent with temperature and precipitation in our study the ta par and vpd have been found to increase water demand coleman and decoursey 1976 nouri et al 2017 sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 while lai has great influnce on aet by increasing water demand and means of water transport in contrast rh and θ maintained high values during the study period figs 2 and 5 and were not limiting factors to aet in our study the fluctuation of these two factors were small during the growing seasons on the contrary a previous study showed that rh had great influence on et coleman and decoursey 1976 however that study was conducted in a drier area than our study therefore we conclude that rh and θ have a greater influnce on aet in arid semiarid areas than in himid areas it needs to be emphasized that precipitation has great effect on et and zeppel et al 2008 has shown that transpiration of plants increases significantly after rainfall prcp 20 mm day 1 however springs and aquifers typically show marked and rapid reactions to precipitation events in karst areas hartmann et al 2014a the epikarst zone water which may flow backward from other catchments is also an important resource for karst plants because of these other water sources the effect of θ on et was not apparent the θ in different layers played different roles in the three agroforestry ecosystems table 4 which is similar to previous studies for example wang et al 2015 found that surface θ 0 20 cm had the greatest effect on aet of spring wheat in northwest china this is likely because physiological water absorption is mainly conducted through fibrous roots polverigiani et al 2011 silvius and snyder 1979 zadworny and eissenstat 2011 fibrous roots of grass and crop ecosystems are mainly in shallower soil layers 30 cm however fibrous roots are located in deep soil layers 30 cm for trees in forest grass mixed ecosystems generally speaking wind makes some contributions to evaporation lenters et al 2005 however ws was low throughout the experiment fig 2 and small fluctuations were observed during the plant growing seasons in the karst peak cluster depression area in our study the surrounding peaks kept the wind out of the peak cluster depressions and the dense vegetation slowed the ws therefore wind did not influnce soil e in the peak cluster depression area the change of e aet ratios fig 4 for the three ecosystems was mainly in agreement with ta and prcp davidson 1933 davidson 1935 simpson et al 1992 wilcox and sly 1974 zhou et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 found that the e et ratio of maize was 36 7 from july to september and 47 over the whole growth period the results showed that the relationship of e et and lai was linearly negative zhu et al 2015 found that the mean values of e et at three eastern china forests were below 40 and the seasonal dynamics of e et were mainly affected by ta net radiation vpd and θ in our study the e aet ratios were noticeably different for the three ecosystems and the e aet ratio of crop ecosystem was mainly controlled by management practices famers had to keep crops space large to ensure high yield production which led to smaller lai and bigger bare soil ratio in crop ecosystem than in grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems alkaisi et al 1989 dermody et al 2007 soegaard and boegh 1995 steduto and hsiao 1998 the abrupt increases of e aet ratio that occurred twice in the crop ecosystem was consistent with maize and soybean harvests date therefore high e aet ratios followed crop harvest salado navarro et al 2013 simpson et al 1992 5 conclusions this study compared aet variation and its controlling factors for three agroforestry ecosystems in a subtropical humid area the main results showed that transpiration from trees differed from evapotranspiration from the three ecosystems that s because stomata might close to avoid excessive water loss under high temperature and dry air stress the relatively low daily aet rates from the crop ecosystems were strongly influenced by human management through decreasing plant densities of maize and soybean this decreased water demand in crop ecosystems by lowering lai more than in grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems the rh θ and ws were not key limiting factors to daily aet the reasons might be that water supply was sufficient in humid karst depression and surrounding peaks keep the plants unaffected by seasonal wind an abrupt increase of e aet ratio in crop ecosystems was mainly caused by harvest and soil surface tillage effects of soil water content on aet are determined by vegetation rooting depths specifically fibrous roots of grass and crop ecosystems are mainly situated in shallower soil layers 30 cm while they occur in deep soil layers 30 cm for trees for forest grass mixed ecosystems acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41571130073 41501042 youth

7194,karst landforms account for 10 of the earths land surface and it is well known that water is a limiting factor for karst ecosystems because numerous underground fractures and conduits induce rapid drainage therefore an understanding of ecosystem water consumptions evapotranspiration and environmental controls is particularly important for land management on karst landforms this study compared the actual evapotranspiration aet characteristics and analyzed the controls of three agroforestry ecosystems by field observations using a refitted ventilated chamber thermal dissipation probes and micro lysimeters in a subtropical humid karst catchment from 12th march 2015 to 26th may 2016 results show that 1 the diurnal transpiration curves of trees plateau at noon with low fluctuations at a high level while evapotranspiration curves of grass and crop ecosystems present single peaks 2 aet of the forest grass mixed ecosystem 7 64 5 75 mm day 1 was significantly higher than crop 4 24 3 35 mm day 1 and grass ecosystems 5 78 3 53 mm day 1 3 aet of grass and crop ecosystems were most sensitive to temperature while the forest grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to leaf area index lai than other factors 4 aet of the forest grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to deep soil moisture 30 cm while grass and crop ecosystems were more sensitive to shallow soil moisture 10 cm and 20 cm this study suggests that soil water content was not key limit factors to aet in humid karst landscapes however lai which can be controlled by land management heavily

1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a central process for ecosystems that returns approximately 67 of annual precipitation onto land back to the atmosphere zhang et al 2016 evapotranspiration uniquely links the water cycle energy cycle and carbon cycle it is a key climatic predictor of agroforestry ecosystem health and is the predominant variable needed for water management in agroforestry production allen and breshears 1998 anderson et al 2012 fisher et al 2017 jung et al 2010 koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2006 therefore various et processes in

systems and improve their functions the water consumption processes of grass trees and traditional crops maize soybean and sweet potato should be understood in detail some previous studies have

maximum tdm bosch et al 2014 the sap flux was estimated by granier et al 2000 3 sf s a 0 119 t d t dm 1 231 3600 c m 3 c m 2 h r 1 where tdm was assumed to be the mean value of td between 23 00 pm and 3 00 am in a day cramer et al 1999 and sa was the sapwood area of a plant the relationship between sapwood area and diameter at breast height dbh was first determined based on the data of another 18 trees in the ecosystem area sa 11 9 d b h 82 4 the determination coefficient r 2 0 94 n 18 the sapwood width was measured by drilling through tree trunks and distinguished with heartwood by color difference fiora and cescatti 2006 forrester et al 2010 in addition to the aet measurements described above the daily 24 hour period aet mm day 1 of forest grass ecosystem was estimated as 4 aet t sum a aet v where t sum kg day 1 is the sum of six zenia insignis trees transpiration a m2 is the cover area of the six trees and aet v is the aet measured by ventilated chamber in the understory of this ecosystem soil evaporation e was measured using micro lysimeters made of 10 cm outer diameter 20 cm depth pvc cylinders the inner diameter of the pvc cylinders were 9 5 cm boast and robertson 1982 the pvc cylinders were encased by pvc outer cylinders of slightly larger diameter but of the same depth as the inner cylinders balwinder singh et al 2014 every cylinder held a soil core that was obtained using a wooden hammer driving it into the soil this was done causing minimum soil disturbance so that the obtained soil core remained as much as possible in the same condition as the surrounding soil allen 1990 three cylinders were set in every ecosystem under grass or crops near the ventilated chamber congruent with the ventilated chamber operation the cylinders were weighed every two hours from 6 00 am to 20 00 pm to determine water loss 2 4 sensitivity analysis partial derivatives were used to analyze the sensitivity of aet to different factors the dimensionless relative sensitivity coefficient was first proposed by mccuen and decoursey has been widely employed in hydrology literature for quantitative sensitivity analysis the equation is expressed as coleman and decoursey 1976 hill et al 1986 nouri et al 2017 4 sc x i lim δ x i 0 δ l t 0 l t 0 δ x i x i l t 0 x i x i l t 0 where scx i is the sensitivity coefficient of lt 0 a variable to x i and where x i is an independent factor a positive magnitude of scx i implies an increase in lt 0 as x i increases likewise a negative magnitude of scx i implies a decrease in lt 0 as x i decreases the greater the scx i the higher the expected sensitivity of lt 0 to x i to ensure plant accept water unrestrictedly the ventilated chambers were not used on rainy days therefore only 65 sunny days were selected to compare et dynamics and environmental controls 3 results 3 1 dynamics of the meteorological factors the meteorological factors ta rh vpd and wind speed ws measured inside the forest grass mixed ecosystem were similar to those outside the forest in the crop ecosystem except for par and precipitation prcp fig 2 as shown in fig 2a ta exhibited obvious seasonal variation and was generally higher than 10 c the rh was generally higher than 80 fig 2c except for some days in the winter the ws fig 2e showed seasonal variation and was highest between january and april the par fig 2b exhibited great differences between inside the forest and outside the forest measuring 121 2 53 9 μe and 200 1 77 9 μe respectively note that are the mean and standard deviation between 12 march 2015 and 26 may 2016 mean prcp fig 2f intensity was 4 78 6 73 mm day 1 within forest grass ecosystem and 5 62 7 86 mm day 1 in the crop ecosystem respectively 3 2 evapotranspiration dynamics of three agroforestry ecosystems as shown in fig 3 a e the dynamics of diurnal aet from five representative days exhibited noticeable seasonal variation the aet was clearly related to vegetation type and the aet of forest grass mixed ecosystem was the highest overall the diurnal aet for the three ecosystems showed similar patterns aet generally increased at approximately 7 00 a m reached a peak value at noon and then decreased gradually however the transpiration values fig 3b and c for trees stayed at peak level with small fluctuations for several hours the daily aet fig 3f exhibited noticeable seasonal variation but the magnitude of seasonal variation varied by ecosystems specifically aet in the winter november march was low 2 05 1 16 mm day 1 1 65 1 17 mm day 1and 3 06 1 38 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively mean one standard deviation began to increase in late march reached a peak in june and august 14 85 3 82 mm day 1 7 72 3 38 mm day 1 and 9 22 3 44 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively and then decreased gradually during the study period the overall average aet of the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem were 7 64 5 75 mm day 1 4 24 3 35 mm day 1 and 5 78 3 53 mm day 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 the e aet evaporation actual evapotranspiration ratios exhibited noticeable seasonality for all three ecosystems and were related to vegetation type overall the ratios were lower in the growing season apr oct 0 60 for the crop ecosystem and forest grass mixed ecosystem and 0 30 for the grass ecosystem than in the non growing season the exception was the ratio of e aet for the crop ecosystem which was high during the rotation period between maize and soybean but was low in the winter when sweet potato was still growing additionally the ratios of growing seasons e aet for the forest grass mixed ecosystem 0 33 0 20 and grass ecosystem 0 36 0 18 were noticeably lower than in the crop ecosystems 0 56 0 13 3 3 sensitivity analysis of meteorological controls as shown in table 3 the sensitivity coefficients of meteorological controls on aet ranked differently for the different ecosystems generally positive coefficients imply positive correlation between the variables and aet whereas negative coefficients indicate an inverse correlation of aet with parameter changes only rh was negatively correlated to aet the ta was the variable most strongly correlated to daily aet in the grass ecosystem under forest crop and grass ecosystem but the most sensitive factor was lai for trees and forest grass mixed ecosystems for all ecosystems the least sensitive factor was θ the sensitivity coefficients of ta prcp lai par and vpd 0 35 were significantly higher than those of ws rh and θ 0 23 for all ecosystems which suggests that soil water may not be an important limiting factor in this area 3 4 soil water content and its impact on aet soil water content of the three ecosystems fig 5 b d was generally relatively high 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and was sensitive to dry weather for example in 2015 θ decreased sharply from 0 33 cm3 cm 3 in late march to 0 21 cm3 cm 3 in mid april similar variation was also found in other periods the sensitivity of aet to θ is different between the three ecosystems and it also varied at different soil layers within same ecosystem the θ in the forest grass mixed ecosystem was lowest at 10 cm soil depth and increased in order of 10 30 20 40 60 cm in the crop ecosystems θ was also lowest in the 10 cm soil layer and increased in order of 10 30 20 60 40 cm in the grass ecosystem the lowest θ was in the 20 cm soil layer and increased in order of 20 30 10 60 40 cm the responses of θ to drought stress were noticeably different for the three ecosystems for example in the period between 1 apr 2015 and 26 apr 2015 θ at 20 cm and 60 cm layers decreased more sharply than other soil layers in the forest grass mixed ecosystem in response to drought but the sharpest decreases in θ in response to drought stress were observed in the 10 cm soil layer in the crop ecosystem and in the 10 20 and 30 cm soil layers for grass ecosystem as shown in table 4 it was clear that θ at 10 cm had the largest impact on et for the grass ecosystem under the forests but that the 20 cm soil layer was most important for both crop and grass ecosystems the largest difference in θ between the forest grass mixed ecosystem and other two ecosystems occurred in the 60 cm soil layer though the sensitivity coefficients of θ at each layer were small 0 19 they rank differently for the different ecosystems which suggests that the depth of the water source may be different for may be different for grass crops and trees overall the et of the forest grass mixed ecosystem or trees was more sensitive to deep θ 40 cm and 60 cm while grass and crop ecosystems were more sensitive to shallow θ 10 cm and 20 cm 4 discussion some previous studies have compared et characteristics and environmental controls for different agroforestry ecosystems in various landscapes nouri et al 2017 tanaka et al 2008 however no previous studies have reported this information from subtropical humid karst areas our data suggest that the trees exhibit diurnal transpiration curves that plateau at noon with low fluctuations in dirunal cycles while et curves of grass and crop ecosystems present single peaks daily aet rates and e aet ratios fig 4 were different for different ecosystems fig 3f for all three ecosystems ta prcp par lai and vpd had the greatest influence on aet but the effects of ws rh and θ were limited table 2 on the diurnal scale transpiration was limited by soil water trunk water and the plant water transport mechanisms schulze et al 1985 plant water uptake is limited by the soil hydraulic conductivity and trunk resistance therefore water uptake cannot keep pace with potential water reduction zhou et al 2013 as a result peak transpiration appears earlier than evaporation which is likely caused by physioecological responses e g stomata closure of plants to high temperature and dry air to avoid excessive water loss du et al 2011 fiora and cescatti 2006 ford et al 2004 kool et al 2014 paudel et al 2013 the difference of daily aet rates for the three agroecosystems was mainly caused by different plant species and densities lai dickinson et al 1991 ge et al 2011 kite 2000 kite and droogers 2000 tanaka et al 2008 under the same environmental conditions the space between crops mainly for maize and soybean is greater as it is managed by famers than grass to ensure high crop production this leads to relatively smaller lai and less water consumption from crops compared to grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems alkaisi et al 1989 soegaard and boegh 1995 steduto and hsiao 1998 with higher lai biomass forest grass mixed ecosystems have higher water demand than grass and crop ecosystems bernhofer 1992 bernhofer and gay 1989 cornish and vertessy 2001 cristiano et al 2015 kumagai et al 2014 sun et al 2008 swift et al 1975 vourlitis et al 2002 though the plant density is managed by humans lai of the three ecosystems was still consistent with temperature and precipitation in our study the ta par and vpd have been found to increase water demand coleman and decoursey 1976 nouri et al 2017 sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 while lai has great influnce on aet by increasing water demand and means of water transport in contrast rh and θ maintained high values during the study period figs 2 and 5 and were not limiting factors to aet in our study the fluctuation of these two factors were small during the growing seasons on the contrary a previous study showed that rh had great influence on et coleman and decoursey 1976 however that study was conducted in a drier area than our study therefore we conclude that rh and θ have a greater influnce on aet in arid semiarid areas than in himid areas it needs to be emphasized that precipitation has great effect on et and zeppel et al 2008 has shown that transpiration of plants increases significantly after rainfall prcp 20 mm day 1 however springs and aquifers typically show marked and rapid reactions to precipitation events in karst areas hartmann et al 2014a the epikarst zone water which may flow backward from other catchments is also an important resource for karst plants because of these other water sources the effect of θ on et was not apparent the θ in different layers played different roles in the three agroforestry ecosystems table 4 which is similar to previous studies for example wang et al 2015 found that surface θ 0 20 cm had the greatest effect on aet of spring wheat in northwest china this is likely because physiological water absorption is mainly conducted through fibrous roots polverigiani et al 2011 silvius and snyder 1979 zadworny and eissenstat 2011 fibrous roots of grass and crop ecosystems are mainly in shallower soil layers 30 cm however fibrous roots are located in deep soil layers 30 cm for trees in forest grass mixed ecosystems generally speaking wind makes some contributions to evaporation lenters et al 2005 however ws was low throughout the experiment fig 2 and small fluctuations were observed during the plant growing seasons in the karst peak cluster depression area in our study the surrounding peaks kept the wind out of the peak cluster depressions and the dense vegetation slowed the ws therefore wind did not influnce soil e in the peak cluster depression area the change of e aet ratios fig 4 for the three ecosystems was mainly in agreement with ta and prcp davidson 1933 davidson 1935 simpson et al 1992 wilcox and sly 1974 zhou et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 found that the e et ratio of maize was 36 7 from july to september and 47 over the whole growth period the results showed that the relationship of e et and lai was linearly negative zhu et al 2015 found that the mean values of e et at three eastern china forests were below 40 and the seasonal dynamics of e et were mainly affected by ta net radiation vpd and θ in our study the e aet ratios were noticeably different for the three ecosystems and the e aet ratio of crop ecosystem was mainly controlled by management practices famers had to keep crops space large to ensure high yield production which led to smaller lai and bigger bare soil ratio in crop ecosystem than in grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems alkaisi et al 1989 dermody et al 2007 soegaard and boegh 1995 steduto and hsiao 1998 the abrupt increases of e aet ratio that occurred twice in the crop ecosystem was consistent with maize and soybean harvests date therefore high e aet ratios followed crop harvest salado navarro et al 2013 simpson et al 1992 5 conclusions this study compared aet variation and its controlling factors for three agroforestry ecosystems in a subtropical humid area the main results showed that transpiration from trees differed from evapotranspiration from the three ecosystems that s because stomata might close to avoid excessive water loss under high temperature and dry air stress the relatively low daily aet rates from the crop ecosystems were strongly influenced by human management through decreasing plant densities of maize and soybean this decreased water demand in crop ecosystems by lowering lai more than in grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems the rh θ and ws were not key limiting factors to daily aet the reasons might be that water supply was sufficient in humid karst depression and surrounding peaks keep the plants unaffected by seasonal wind an abrupt increase of e aet ratio in crop ecosystems was mainly caused by harvest and soil surface tillage effects of soil water content on aet are determined by vegetation rooting depths specifically fibrous roots of grass and crop ecosystems are mainly situated in shallower soil layers 30 cm while they occur in deep soil layers 30 cm for trees for forest grass mixed ecosystems acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41571130073 41501042 youth
