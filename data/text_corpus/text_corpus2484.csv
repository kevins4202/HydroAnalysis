12420,pharmaceuticals in the concentration range of hundreds of ng l to Î¼g l occur in wastewater and end up in surface water groundwater and agricultural land where they cause various health risks these pollutants are classified as emerging and cannot be efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes the use of nano enabled photocatalysts in the removal of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems has recently received research attention owing to their enhanced properties and effectiveness the industrial scale application of photocatalytic technology is still limited a comprehensive review on the removal of pharmaceuticals from real wastewater using the photocatalysts is therefore necessary this paper reviews literature on the occurrence fate and nano sized photocatalytic removal strategies of pharmaceuticals from wastewater modifications of nano enabled photocatalysts through doping deposition on various supports and introducing magnetic character to enhance their photocatalytic efficiency and recyclability were discussed the synthetic routes of photocatalysts influence the physical and chemical properties which can either enhance or inhibit their effectiveness the benefits of photocatalytic degradation include easy recycling as they exhibit excellent stability and can be used for several cycles going forward research should focus on 1 elucidation of photodegradation mechanisms 2 real wastewater treatment at industrial scale to remove multiple pharmaceutical compounds 3 regeneration and disposal particularly towards large scale application 4 life cycle assessment of the photocatalysts from synthesis to application 5 lowering the cost and improving photodegradation efficiency and 6 investigating the toxicity of intermediates to the photocatalyst and the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords effluent emerging pollutants micropollutants nanocomposites photodegradation remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the demand for clean water is expected to increase because of a rise in the world population while the availability of freshwater is projected to decrease to half by the year 2050 255 the quality of water is adversely impacted by increased human activities that generate organic inorganic and microbial contaminants which are subsequently discharged into water sources 1 2 sources of water pollution include effluent discharges from pharmaceuticals textile industry municipal wastewater households agricultural chemicals manufacturers food and drink manufacturers hospitals electroplating and oil processors 3 pharmaceuticals and personal care productions ppcps are emerging pollutants with toxicological effects even at minute concentrations 4 some ppcps have pharmacological effect and are found in over the counter drugs and prescription and veterinary drugs as a result of their extensive use in human and animal healthcare pharmaceuticals are discharged into the environment in the unutilized form or as metabolites most pharmaceuticals are highly polar and less volatile hence they are more likely to be retained in water bodies 257 hence pharmaceuticals are usually found in wastewater treatment effluents where some compounds are incompletely removed for instance previous studies reported that up to 90 of drug residues can be found in wastewater treatment plant effluents 5 6 unfortunately pharmaceuticals persist in water bodies posing health risks to aquatic life through the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria and disruption of the endocrine system 7 9 258 pharmaceutical compounds are structurally diverse and have been detected in groundwater drinking water surface water and wastewater these compounds normally enter the environment via treated and untreated industrial wastewater urban agricultural runoff and hospital effluent 10 11 hospitals are a major source of pharmaceutical discharge into the environment through excretion by patients and the inappropriate disposal of unused drugs 12 moreover uncontrolled disposal of industrial pharmaceutical waste is also a major contributor to environmental pollution 257 the occurrence of various pharmaceuticals in water causes a range of health impacts to humans and animals for instance antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole induce genetic mutations and chronic effects even at low concentrations 13 14 while analgesics such as paracetamol increase the risk of kidney cancer liver damage and asthma 15 16 overall adverse effects of pharmaceuticals include the disruption of the endocrine system and induction of antimicrobial resistance in environmental systems 17 a detailed discussion of the different adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on different organisms is presented elsewhere 18 various pharmaceuticals are commonly present in water bodies at very low concentrations hence their analysis detection and subsequent removal from aquatic systems is challenging 259 the major setback in studying the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals is the complexity of detection and quantitative analysis due to lack of sensitive and robust methods 19 hence most previous studies mainly focused on degradation processes on a laboratory scale sometimes using environmentally unrealistic concentrations and matrices 7 20 21 pharmaceutical compounds are inherently bioactive and persistent thus they maintain their therapeutic activity on discharge into the environment some pharmaceuticals are readily degradable while others persist unchanged 8 260 although biodegradation reduces the concentrations in the receiving waters their metabolites persist and cannot be easily removed by conventional biological and chemical treatment processes 261 a number of treatment methods have been used to remove pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems these include conventional treatment advanced oxidation processes activated carbon filtration advanced ozonation biodegradation adsorption electrochemical degradation microfiltration uv radiation phytoremediation and peroxi photo electrocoagulation 22 23 262 adsorbents have also been used to remove various pollutants from wastewater however conventional adsorbents are limited by inadequate adsorption capacity slow kinetics and insufficient potential for recycling 24 environmentally friendly adsorbent dendrimers provided a large adsorption capacity 263 metal organic frameworks and polyacylonitrile were used to remove pollutants in multicomponent wastewater systems 25 27 in one study conventional treatment of pharmaceutical contaminated wastewater removed 50 of antibiotics 20 30 beta blockers analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs 264 carbon activated by phosphorus oxyacids was found to have a high adsorption capacity of 345 mg g for pharmaceuticals while gamma radiation had a 70 100 ozonation had 40 99 and uv radiation had 20 100 removal efficiencies for pharmaceuticals in water 22 23 analgesic and anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals have been removed successfully using electrochemical oxidation 28 drugs such as diclofenac and carbamazepine were successfully removed using ozonation and fenton and photo fenton based advanced oxidation has been used to remove ibuprofen and diazepam in water heterogeneous semi conductor photocatalysis is the most promising effective and unique approach for treating wastewater contaminants including recalcitrant and persistent micropollutants 29 30 this is because it has high efficiency is environmentally friendly and it uses strongly oxidizing species like the hydroxyl radicals oh 265 the oxidizing species decompose organic compounds into less toxic substances namely water carbon dioxide and short chain organics 31 32 compared to similar processes such as the fenton process and ozonation photocatalysis mineralizes organic compounds without the need of adding chemicals 33 in the past decade different nano enabled photocatalysts have been used to degrade various pharmaceuticals under ultraviolet uv and visible irradiation the key factors that affect the photocatalytic treatment and performance include light source ph dosage or concentration of photocatalyst optimum reaction time for degradation and concentration of pollutant 34 35 examples of well known nanophotocatalyst which have been reported to be effective in the removal of pharmaceuticals from synthetic wastewater include tio2 zno cu2o nio mgo fe2o3 wo3 bi2wo6 bioi cus zns pbs sns c3n4 tio2 and bivo4 few reports on photocatalyst using real wastewater samples have found deactivation of the nanophotocatalyst to be a concern as the minimum and maximum efficiency of use was reported for 1 h and 25 days respectively 36 however the deactivation mechanism of nanophotocatalyst in real water systems is little known although there is a substantial amount of literature on the occurrence fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater e g 37 39 there is relatively less literature on removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater using low cost nano enabled photocatalysts low cost water treatment materials are important especially in low income countries where cost is the major factor in water and wastewater treatment besides the performance and regeneration disposal of photocatalyst have not been extensively investigated especially the ternary and quaternary photocatalysts such as cu2znsns4 cus agvo3 fe0 2co0 1zn0 6s lafeo3 lanio3 and lacoo3 40 43 in addition most photocatalysis studies are laboratory based using synthetic water that does not have interfering compounds such as microorganisms inorganic ions natural organic matter and biological macromolecules which play a role in the treatment of real wastewater systems there is limited practical application of photocatalytic technology at industrial scale a comprehensive review on the removal of pharmaceuticals from real wastewater using the photocatalysts is therefore necessary the present review discusses the synthesis properties application of various photocatalysts used to degrade different pharmaceuticals and the mechanism of the photocatalytic processes the objectives were 1 to review literature on the occurrence fate and removal strategies used for pharmaceuticals 2 to evaluate nano enabled photocatalysts for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater 3 to explore removal mechanisms regeneration disposal of spent photocatalysts and 4 to identify research gaps and recommend future research directions 2 methodology this review is based on scientific articles letters editorials reviews short surveys conference proceedings and research papers mainly drawn from sciencedirect wiley and sons mdpi american chemical society scopus and springer nature and published between 2010 and 2022 the literature was retrieved using the keywords occurrence of pharmaceutical photocatalysis micropollutant adsorption pharmaceuticals wastewater micropollutant removal pharmaceuticals removal source of pharmaceuticals fate of pharmaceuticals and nanosized photocatalysts synthesis of photocatalysts applications and performance removal mechanism and regeneration disposal of photocatalysts for illustration bibliometric data from scopus within the period of interest were plotted fig 1 the literature survey was performed on papers obtained for the data related to removal of pharmaceuticals by photocatalysis and pharmaceuticals mainly occurring in wastewater treatment plants the inclusion criteria were based on the year of publication journal type relevant area e interest subject appropriateness setting citations and reported outcomes the reported outcomes were based on the removal efficiencies recyclability and regeneration of photocatalysts with english being the official language of communication of the research most of the publications focused mainly on the photodegradation of dyes and there was limited information on removal of pharmaceuticals by photocatalysis studies on micropollutant adsorption micropollutant removal nanosized photocatalyst and photocatalysis were considerably lower than other fields such as pharmaceutical removal fig 1 the bibliometric analysis revealed the top four areas of research includes pharmaceuticals fate sources and occurrence of pharmaceuticals under article category in addition there is a lot of research on photocatalyst synthesis of photocatalyst application and performance of photocatalyst with less consideration for its removal mechanism and regeneration disposal of photocatalysts 3 the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater 3 1 sources of pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals enter water bodies from various sources such as agricultural runoff disposals from hospitals and households post production waste of pharmaceutical industries urban runoff pharmaceutical products in as well as their metabolites and excretions by humans and animals fig 2 44 47 other sources include direct discharge of untreated wastewater into the environment through the leakage of septic tanks and application of contaminated animal manure or wastewater treatment plant sludge as fertilizer in agricultural fields 48 49 3 2 occurrence of pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals have been detected in influent and effluents of wastewater treatment plants surface waters groundwater and raw drinking water 50 51 266 since it is difficult to remove these pharmaceuticals from contaminated groundwater it is necessary to identify their sources and control the release at source 52 pharmaceutical concentrations in most downstream samples relative to wastewater systems are higher than in upstream samples suggesting wastewater treatment plant discharges as a major source of pharmaceuticals in surface waters 6 53 besides pharmaceutical products with concentrations of up to 10 ng l enter the environment and groundwater via land application of municipal wastewater onto permitted land 54 266 the inability of wastewater treatment plants wwtps to completely remove pharmaceuticals results in them reaching surface and groundwater sources 55 56 from agricultural fields where sludge and municipal wastewater are applied 48 pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater influents and effluents in the range of hundreds of ng l to Î¼g l 57 for example gemfibrozil a drug used for the treatment of abnormal blood lipid levels was detected in the influent and effluent of wwtps and in groundwater in the range of 3 47 63 8 mg l but it can be reduced by 25 4 and 11 3 through biodegradation from the soil over 14 days when the treated effluent is applied to land 267 however a separate study showed gemifibrozil had high removal rates 73 100 whereas carbamazepine showed lower removals 6 aspirin was found to be the most abundant pharmaceutical in wwtp influent 1180 82 mg l and nalidixic acid was the most prevalent antibiotic 25 2 29 9 mg l 38 a different study found ciproxacin and sulfamethoxazole as the most dominant antibiotics in the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants 58 antiretroviral drugs arvs such as zidovudine and nevirapine have been detected in the concentration range of 3214 3336 ng l 0 9 to 2 1 ng l and 95 to 510 Î¼g kg in wwtp effluent surface water and river sediments respectively 59 the presence of arvs in water bodies particularly river water is a concern for african countries as most communities depend on untreated river water for drinking purposes in this regard southern africa is a hotspot for arvs in surface water for instance in south africa and zambia efavirenz concentration of 140 Î¼g l and 119 Î¼g l has been reported 60 enalapril irbesartan losartan valsartan and metoprolol which are antihypertensive drugs are frequently detected in aquatic systems 61 for instance antihypertensive drugs were found to acount for 20 of the pharmaceuticals detected in river water in spain 62 metformin the most consumed anti diabetic drug globally has been detected in the range of 158 2100 Î¼g l in germany 63 3 585 9 228 Î¼g l in south africa 64 70 325 Î¼g l in portugal 65 1 79 59 Î¼g l in iceland 66 and 702 Î¼g l in the usa 67 the high concentration of metformin in water bodies globally could be attributed to the use of biological degradation process which has proved to be ineffective in the removal of metformin more examples of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems are shown in table 1 3 3 fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants numerous studies demonstrate the limited capacity of wwtps to remove most pharmaceuticals 50 51 54 56 76 82 the physico chemical and microbiological features of the influent and effluent wastewater of a wwtp determine its effectiveness and efficiency in removing contaminants operational parameters like homogenization sludge age temperature ph hydraulic retention time of wwtps influence its efficiency 83 thus water characteristics such as electrical conductivity chemical oxygen demand turbidity coliforms suspended solids total phosphorus inorganic carbon total nitrogen total carbon and total organic carbon influence the behavior of pharmaceuticals in wastewater 84 acetaminophen and carbamazepine were found in wwtp effluents and were further detected in surface water and groundwater 85 furthermore ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole were found to persist in raw drinking water 82 a recent study showed that sulfamethoxazole was partly oxidized during wastewater treatment and the bacterial community in the constructed wetland columns exposed to sulfamethoxazole degraded it to four potential transformation products which were detected in the effluents 86 a separate study reported that sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine were resistant to degradation during wastewater treatment 6 two of the transformation products conjugated with glutathione hydroxyglutathionyl sulfamethoxazole and glutathionyl sulfamethoxazole can attest to the adverse effects of this pollutant on microorganisms and plants a study on the removal of pharmaceuticals from water using subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands observed carbamazepine was recalcitrant to degradation 76 most researchers reported carbamazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide to be persistent in wwtp effluents surface water and groundwater 6 56 68 82 85 the removal efficiencies for carbamazepine were below 10 and it remained recalcitrant 76 recently carbamazepine was reported to have a negative biodegradation removal from wwtps using double step activated sludge 83 in another study gemfibrozil was not completely removed during wastewater treatment and under low evapotranspiration conditions it can migrate through the soil to groundwater and sorb onto silt loam soil 54 metabolites of pharmaceutical compounds can be more toxic and recalcitrant to treatment than their parent compounds for instance acetaminophen thyroxine propranolol and their corresponding metabolites acetaminophen sulfate thyroxine glucuronide and propranolol sulfate were reported to undergo treatment with no significant reduction in concentration 87 previous studies have shown that the concentrations of pharmaceuticals exhibit seasonal variation where concentrations in winter are generally higher than in summer due to decreased temperature and solar irradiation 57 84 accordingly another study reported that sulfamethoxazole removal was higher during the summer than the winter season 6 in a separate study triclosan in wwtps effluent was detected in summer with a concentration of 0 56 Î¼g l while maximum concentrations of carbamazepine were observed in autumn ibuprofen and triclosan in winter paracetamol in spring and diclofenac in summer 68 solar penetration and change in temperature resulted in a distinct difference of redox conditions and the attenuation of pharmaceuticals 52 because pharmaceuticals are recalcitrant to removal from the aquatic environment they can potentially bioaccumulate and consequently affect public health hence it is important to review and identify methods that are not working and those that need scaling up for removal of the pharmaceuticals 3 4 removal methods conventional wwtps which consist of pretreatment primary settling and biological treatment using activated sludge fig 3 are incapable of completely removing pharmaceuticals 88 261 5 89 in conventional treatment plants biological treatment units play an important role in the elimination of pharmaceuticals via adsorption and biodegradation as a result biological transformation is the most likely mechanism responsible for pharmaceutical elimination in wwtps using activated sludge treatment gave much higher removal efficiencies compared to trickling filter beds 6 37 90 in another study most organics were effectively degraded while linear compounds with short side chains unsaturated aliphatic compounds and compounds possessing electron donating functional groups were easily degradable 91 activated carbon was also used to immobilize and overcome coagulation of tio2 in the removal of textile dyes with complete mineralization of the dyes 92 this suggests immobilized tio2 can be used as a photocatalyst for the removal of pharmaceuticals powdered activated carbon pac and ozonation have been used to remove micropollutants in wastewater 268 however pac has the disadvantage of becoming less efficient over time as the adsorption bed ages and adsorption sites become less and less regenerable 282 organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals can be effectively degraded by ozone which serves as an oxidant by the generation of hydroxyl radicals 269 however ozonation generates disinfectant by products such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles bromate and chlorites which are potential carcinogens 93 94 in addition carboxylic acids and aldehydes are produced which inhibit the mineralization of pharmaceuticals advanced oxidation processes aops have proved to be the most promising of all water treatment technologies for the removal of pharmaceuticals since they are fast acting with indiscriminate degradation and make use of uv light or visible light induced photocatalysis and strongly oxidizing species like oh radicals which degrade organic compounds into less toxic substances 31 32 methods that fall into the aops category include photolysis photocatalysis ozonation fenton and photo fenton ultrasound radiation sonolysis electrochemical oxidation and wet air oxidation and uv h2o2 among others fig 3 95 96 however ozonation and fenton oxidation require expensive equipment addition of chemical reagents and are energy intensive 33 97 98 4 photocatalytic methods heterogenous semi conductor photocatalysis is a promising effective and distinctive technology for the treatment of micropollutants in wastewater 29 30 the technology makes use of nanoparticle semiconductors which can be synthesized through a range of methods including bottom up and top down methods fig 4 4 1 synthesis of nano sized photocatalysts during the last decade a wide range of photocatalysts have been synthesized and used for the degradation of different pharmaceutical compounds most research data reported are based on tio2 nanocomposites 18 20 21 99 101 zno nanocomposites 102 105 ag nanocomposites 106 and a few others on biochar graphene and other supports 107 108 tio2 is mostly used in the degradation of pharmaceuticals because it is highly photostable nontoxic inexpensive photoreactive and chemically and biologically inert 109 110 the synthesis methods such as the sol gel hydrothermal solvothermal microwave sol gel assisted methods chemical bath deposition methods sonochemical hydrolysis solution combustion synthesis and microwave irradiation have been covered extensively elsewhere 111 4 1 1 sol gel synthesis the sol gel method is commonly used because it is low cost uses low temperatures and allows control of the resulting nanoparticles 112 further the method takes less time is reproducible and offers an environmentally friendly route with high up scaling potential 113 besides the sol gel method is a very successful technique to prepare doped tio2 nanoparticles because it affords simplicity in controlling the doping level particle size and morphology 114 this method is also suitable for the synthesis of nanostructures containing more than one component since the slow reaction kinetics allow good structural engineering of the final product in addition it results in the formation of a three dimensional molecular network and permits coating of substrates such as colloidal particles fibers and nanotubes forming nanosized complex shapes which some commonly used coating procedures cannot achieve 115 consequently the sol gel method has been used to synthesize a range of nanomaterials including mg doped poly scales 34 tio2 nanocomposites 116 and doped photocatalysts 21 99 253 the major disadvantage of the sol gel method is the formation of conglomerates that subsequently reduce the surface area of nanoparticles further studies should thus seek to improve this method to improve nanocatalyst properties and performance 4 1 2 solvo hydrothermal synthesis the hydrothermal synthesis technique has the advantage of synthesizing various inorganics with different morphologies e g nanofibrous materials which have good recyclability 112 hydrothermal synthesis creates larger sized and high quality crystals with increased degradation efficiency 112 although hydrothermal techniques have relatively low yield of products compared to other methods 259 they grow materials with higher vapor pressure as their melting points gets closer different solvents have been reported to affect the morphology and surface area of synthesized nanophotocatalysts for example cubic morphology was obtained with the use of water while ethylene glycol results in nanosheets and glycerol yielded 3d flower spheres 117 4 1 3 microwave synthesis microwave irradiation is an environmentally friendly and rapid surface modification method which produces uniform particles 269 although this method is more efficient compared to conventional methods it has a high energy demand to generated collisions and frictions 118 119 spherical shaped nanoparticles in the size range of 90 110 nm for big sizes and small size of average size distribution of 19 nm have been reported 118 119 overall microwave irradiation is more favourable as the synthesis time is reduced from hours to minutes and minutes to seconds other methods of nanocomposite synthesis along with the merits and demerits are summarized in table 2 4 2 band gap reduction nanocomposites that can either be doped by a single metal or non metal 20 39 99 103 270 co doped 100 123 130 131 z scheme catalysts 132 133 and those that have graphene oxide carbon quantum dots carbon nanotubes and nanorods 104 121 134 135 showed a reduction in the band gap and promoted the light absorption capacity in the visible region the band gap of the different synthesized nanocomposites ranged from 0 77 ev to 3 14 ev 136 4 3 doping doping of semi conductor nanoparticles reduces the band gap and enhances the photocatalytic activity by shifting the absorption band into the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum this can be achieved by metal doping nonmetal doping or co doping 4 3 1 metal doping several studies have shown that metal doping effectively reduces the band gap of the photocatalysts for example mg on tio2 had the largest decrease to the band gap and took lesser time to degrade the pollutant 100 compared to bi3 tio2 ag zno and ag2co3 99 106 bi3 reduced the band gap and took longer to degrade the pollutant mg doped tio2 had the largest reduction in band gap because the ionic radius of mg 160 pm is comparable to that of ti 140 pm and mg doping can be predictably substituted into the ti host lattice resulting in a decrease in the band gap 100 however increasing the dopant content has been reported to reduce the thermal stability of tio2 and cause phase transformation from anatase to rutile 271 4 3 2 non metal doping non metals such as n f s and c can narrow the band gap of photocatalysts significantly augment adsorption in the visible region and improve the degradation of dyes under visible light irradiation especially under natural solar light irradiation 137 compared to metal doping n doped photocatalysts reduced the band gap to a larger extent 103 in another study n doping enhanced visible and not uv photocatalytic activity 21 4 3 3 co doping reduction of the band gap is further enhanced by co doping this approach diminishes the band gap without any formation of charge carrier recombination centers 272 compared to single metal doping co doping with a metal and non metal results in a more reduced band gap for example the non metal dopant n introduced new energy states in n cu co doped tio2 above the valence band of tio2 whereas the cu dopant created a new energy state near the conduction band of tio2 and ti o cu bonds narrowing of the band gap and extending the visible light and efficacy of the photocatalysts 131 similarly the synergetic effect between metal and non metal co doped tio2 and sn4 acting as an electron trap effectively improved the photoactivity via the suppression of the electron hole coupling 130 furthermore other studies reported that doping with fe gave four fold and double activity than n doped tio2 101 121 co doping with sn n had the largest reduction in band gap 0 77 ev followed by n fe co doped nanocomposites which had a larger band gap reduction 2 5 ev this could be due to n fe co doping although they had different parents n fetio2 films and the other n fe cds wo3 in addition several studies showed that photocatalysts made by heterojunctions reduced the band gap to a lesser extent compared to the metal non metal or co doped nanocomposites 104 105 132 133 a photocatalyst that works in the visible light and uses solar energy is best obtained through doping and the z scheme effect 271 the heterojunction between sno2 g c3n4 improves the surface area and optical properties by decreasing the recombination rate 273 4 4 properties of nano sized photocatalysts 4 4 1 surface area generally the properties and performance of nanomaterials are better understood with surface area measurement 138 high surface area is achieved by the synthesis of nanomaterials from bulk materials through increased aspect ratio 139 140 inherent properties such as specific size photo charge carrier separation shape and purity influences their application as catalysts 139 large surface area increases the photocatalytic activity and this depends on the method of synthesis for instance the sol gel method produces nanomaterials with high surface area previous studies which used this method obtained surface areas of 151 147 6 and 153 65 m2 g 18 21 131 moreover the sol gel synthesis avoids aggregation effectively increasing the surface area 141 lattice defects are usually observed in nanophotocatalyst synthesized by sol gel method and these influence the photodegradation efficiency 142 another interesting defect which enhances photodegradation is the production of reactive oxidative specie is oxygen vacancies 143 a z scheme photocatalyst bi2wo6 cds tio2 was synthesized via a facile surfactant free hydrothermal method for the degradation of fluroquinoline and levofloxacin from aqueous medium under solar light 132 another study synthesized bi2o3pac ternary nanoparticles by the hydrothermal method to enhance sulfamerazine removal 133 and used the same method was used to synthesize n zno mos2 for tetracycline reduction 104 the solvothermal method was used to synthesize b tio2 for photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen and flurobiprofen under visible light irradiation 270 table 2 shows the surface areas of photocatalysts resulting from different synthesis methods 4 4 2 morphology the morphology of nanoparticles is important for its photocatalytic application as it provides greater versatility of tuning particles properties 144 morphological properties can be tuned through variation of heating and stirring time surfactant ph and particle synthetic method 13 14 nanoparticles with fibrous morphology have been reported to have high photocatalytic efficiency due to open pore channels high surface area high accessibility of active sites and high crystallinity 145 photodegradation efficiency have been compared between spherical and flowerlike morphology the former had better efficiency due to higher surface area and pore volume which enhance the adsorption thereby increasing the oxidation and reduction rate 146 nanofibers can easily be removed from solution thus the photocatalyst will be reusable 25 26 4 4 3 particle size the size of nanoparticles has an impact on the photodegradation efficiency interaction of crystal lattice between two metal oxide is important for effective charge transfer and this is influenced by particle size 147 the bigger the particle size the smaller the surface area and vice versa an increased diffusion occurs at higher surface area resulting in improved overall kinetics 148 nanosized photocatalyst have higher reactivity sensitivity and fast kinetics compared to microsized photocatalysts however the disadvantage of nanosized photocatalysts is the fast recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs and activation by uv light only 149 4 4 4 bandgap photocatalyst properties such as surface solvent and electronic structure greatly influence pharmaceuticals photodegradation table 3 photocatalyst of low bandgap 0 8 2 86 ev are photoactive under visible light while particles with a higher bandgap 3 0 4 52 ev are photoactive under ultraviolet light catalysts with a high bandgap have limited efficiency under solar radiation as only 4 of the spectrum can be utilized 150 it is important that the bandgap exceeds irradiated photon energy as this assists in the generation of electron hole pairs and limits their rate of recombination 151 152 photogenerated electrons degrade pharmaceuticals through reduction reaction with oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide hydroperoxide and superoxide anions 153 while photogenerated holes oxidize the pharmaceuticals or hydroxyl ions and water molecules absorbed on the catalyst surface to generate organic cation and hydroxylic radicals 154 combining different nanoparticles results in a synergistic heterojunction which improves charge carrier separation and generates photoinduced electron hole pairs with high redox abilities and increased photocatalytic activity 265 doping of catalyst reduces the band gap by creating a heterojunction consequently improving the absorption of pharmaceuticals on catalyst surface under visible light which results in efficient degradation 147 nonetheless there are setbacks that hinder the application of photocatalysts 111 and these include 1 wide band gap implies the use of ultraviolet light which limits the use of visible light that makes up about 43 of the solar spectrum 2 high recombination rates of photogenerated charge carrier and 3 instability of photocatalyst which results in photocorrosivity 5 photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceuticals different nanophotocatalysts for the degradation of pharmaceuticals using visible and ultra visible light sources are summarized in table 4 high efficiency can be obtained in either acidic or alkaline medium depending on the type of pharmaceuticals or nanophotocatalysts overall photocatalysts displayed high degradation efficiency under visible light source due to their band gap which was tuned based on the synthetic route utilized furthermore most of the photocatalysts exhibited high photostability as they were reused for a minimum of 3 cycles 5 1 operational conditions in order to attain high photocatalytic degradation performance there are key experimental parameters that require optimization fig 5 a discussion of these parameters follows 5 1 1 light sources in photocatalytic experiments convectional lamps are expensive and have high electricity consumption 166 although solar photoreactors are more widely used they require a large area and do not work efficiently during cloudy days and nighttime 167 168 thus solar simulated light sources are commonly used despite being less expensive led light sources have not been commonly used xe lamps are the most commonly used light sources used to simulate visible light followed by hg lamps the other light sources are uv lamps and germicidal lamps it has been reported that sometimes higher light intensity causes much more energy waste instead of degradation 274 and this needs optimizing along with all the other parameters 5 1 2 solution ph the ph of the aqueous medium is a significant parameter in photocatalytic reaction since it regulates the photocatalyst attributes such as surface charge and size agglomeration most previous studies reported optimum solution ph ranges from 2 85 to 7 for the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals 164 169 171 this suggests the degradation of most pharmaceuticals by the different nanocomposites were favourable under neutral and acidic conditions the impact of ph on reaction conditions is determined by interactions between the catalyst and the pharmaceutical compounds under investigation solution ph which determines the functional groups on the catalyst surface affects both the adsorption and photocatalytic processes 133 the electric charge property of the pharmaceutical pollutants is another important parameter to be considered pharmaceuticals are in their molecular form when their ph is less than pka while at pka greater than ph they become negatively charged therefore it is important to know the charge of the pharmaceuticals and the photocatalyst because if they have the same charge there will be repulsion between the catalysts and the pollutant thereby reducing the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst a study showed that ph accounted for factors like electrostatic contact between the photocatalyst surface and the pollutant molecule and the interactions between solvent molecules and charged radicals formed during the photocatalytic process 132 the maximum degradation was achieved at ph 7 and in alkaline solution more oh radicals were generated while increasing the ph resulted in lower degradation due to the repulsion effect the effect of ph on photocatalytic process is complex due to the involvement of interactive parameters such as dissociation species charged radicals catalyst and pollutant surface charges furthermore different reaction mechanisms play different roles on degradation at different ph 5 1 3 photocatalyst load and pollutant concentration it is necessary to optimize the photocatalyst concentrations to maximize photodegradation performance and minimize costs as photocatalyst efficiency is affected by its quantity a previous study reported that the amount of catalyst used in the degradation processes ranged from 0 02 to 1 g l 172 in general an increase in catalyst dosage results in a rise in the available active sites on the photocatalytic surface subsequently increasing the yield of oh o2 radicals which expedite pharmaceuticals degradation until optimum dosage is reached however after the optimum dosage degradation rate decrease due to light scattering 173 excess photocatalyst results in an increase in turbidity limited light penetration higher light scattering low generation of electron hole pairs and increased particle agglomeration 174 thus shielding the contaminants from direct light irradiation the quantity of photons on the catalytic surface is reduced at high initial concentrations of the photocatalyst resulting in lowering of the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band 274 the photocatalyst load is related to the pollutant concentration as the photocatalyst efficiency removal kinetics is affected by the concentration of the contaminants high pollutant concentrations require more oh radicals to avoid the production of large amounts of intermediate compounds which would compete for the oh radicals and reduce the photocatalytic degradation efficiency 175 176 as pharmaceuticals concentration increases more molecules are absorbed on the photocatalyst surface thereby reducing the availability of the active sites to facilitate the absorption of light for degradation in addition the photons generated are absorbed by the pollutants before reaching the surface of the catalyst which results in easy catalyst deactivation 177 the use of photocatalysts in high flow water is limited due to its high cost low regeneration ability and recovery of catalyst hence photocatalyst are commonly used on matrices support 5 1 4 photocatalysts on supports most research on nanomaterials formed from a catalyst on a support such as alumina chitosan and carbon does not provide data on the band gap since the supports are not expected to shift the band gap e g 18 104 141 178 180 the supports instead influence the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst because they serve as electron mediators and photosensitizers extending the radiation absorption into the visible range 132 in addition they play a role as electron acceptors impeding electron hole recombination 181 besides supports enhance pollutant adsorption by creating more adsorption sites due to their large surface area 80 81 as a result photocatalysts on supports have a larger surface area allowing for higher pollutant adsorption and faster degradation times immobilization of photocatalysts on supports reduces leaching of the active species thereby stabilizing the photocatalyst 182 monitoring the systematic loss in photocatalytic activity after some cycles of use and determining the stability of a photocatalyst can be achieved using inductively coupled plasma icp analysis 183 for instance icp was used to study the leaching of cobalt ions in the co3o4 go catalyst which exhibited stable performance on several cycles of regeneration 184 nitrogen doped tio2 has high activity but exhibits relatively low stability due to degradation of nitrogen species under highly powerful radiation 185 because of their ease of synthesis and nontoxicity and photodegradation efficiency tio2 based photocatalyst have been studied even recently table 4 current studies are exploring improved ways of synthesizing ecofriendly tio2 based photocatalysts with a narrower particle distribution and improved photocatalytic activity yet other studies are investigating ways of improving recyclability and reusability of the photocatalysts 5 2 kinetic studies kinetic studies give important information that includes prediction of the rates of degradation and information for designing and modeling the degradation processes 186 besides kinetics data dictate the residence time of the pollutant and dimensions of the reactor and also give insights into reaction pathways 24 overall it helps understand the catalytic function and aids in materials design the degradation kinetics of organic compounds depend on the synergy between adsorption and photodegradation 275 this is elucidated by carrying out the experiments in the dark and comparing them with experiments under light irradiation 276 the photocatalytic and adsorption properties of nanomaterials emanate from high surface area resulting in faster kinetics suitable for treating wastewater even at very low pollutant concentrations 275 277 surface area can be enhanced by introducing tio2 nanoparticles into a carbonaceous matrix a process that also improves the stability of the photocatalyst for example the surface area of tio2 modified g c3n4 was 1 6 fold larger than that of pristine 3d g c3n4 and this had a phenol removal rate of 16 278 in the case of carbon based photocatalysts the size and morphology directly govern the efficiency of electron hole pairs and consequently the photocatalytic kinetics and efficiency 277 most studies on the adsorptive removal of micropollutants from wastewater have followed pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir isotherm 24 27 186 for instance the photodegradation of potassium hydrogenphthalate using tio2 photocatalyst followed first order kinetics as indicated by the langmuir hinshelwood model 279 the langmuir model assumes monolayer coverage where adsorption occurs on specific homogeneous sites it also assumes there is no interaction between the adsorbed pollutant molecules and the adjacent sites on the adsorbent surface 25 27 detailed kinetic studies for pharmaceuticals removals through photocatalysis is an area deserves further research 6 recyclability regeneration and disposal of spent photocatalysts to reduce the cost of the photodegradation process the photocatalyst should be easily recovered and recycled for multiple reuse table 5 nanocomposites can undergo deterioration after consecutive cycles hence the necessity to evaluate the stability of the nanocomposites system s efficacy in pollutant degradation and the economic feasibility 280 due to their powdery nature most nanophotocatalyst are easily dispersed in a flow reactor which enhances their degradation efficiency however this attribute increases catalyst losses because of dynamic flow which reduces the recovery the stability of photocatalysts after use can be assessed by x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd if it maintains its crystalline composition after exposure to chemicals with different functional groups 187 studies on the crystallinity of photocatalysts after use are limited therefore future research should investigate this area previous studies report reusability in the range of 3 10 cycles 106 131 165 the photocatalysts with supports and magnetic character had more cycles and could thus be re used more often for example photocatalyst such as magnetic chitosan nanoparticles 186 chitosan wrapped multiwalled carbon nanotube with polyether block amide 281 ag cufe2o4 wo3 123 n tio2 sio2 fe2o4 253 tio2 znfe2o4 pd 20 have magnetic character this property facilitated the separation and easy recovery of the photocatalysts there are however limited studies and discussion on post recovery of the spent photocatalysts after recovery the nanophotocatalyst is regenerated to its initial state and this can be achieved by 1 solvent wash 2 thermal treatment and 3 peroxide treatment 188 189 titanium dioxide photocatalysts were regenerated by uv exposure under humid conditions and samples were analyze by ir and xps to investigate the mechanism 190 192 although there are studies on recyclability and regeneration of photocatalyst the safe disposal of photocatalyst and its impact on the ecosystem requires further research 7 mechanisms of photocatalysis the photodegradation mechanisms of pharmaceutical compounds can be determined by identifying the intermediate species formed from the reaction active species such as superoxide radicals hydroxyl radicals and holes participate in the photocatalytic reactions only one or two active species may dominate the degrading process in some cases with the others playing a minor role 104 the active species act differently in how they degrade the pollutants for instance hydroxyl radicals attack the benzene ring of the pharmaceutical 206 while holes can directly oxidize the pollutant 196 deactivation of catalyst is also due to the adsorption of pollutant intermediates on the active sites and this is better understood through mechanistic studies 36 the process for the generation of active species occurs on irradiation of the photocatalyst surface where electrons are excited and transferred from the valence band to the conduction band this results in photogenerated holes which oxidizes h2o to produce oh while the electron reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide radicals o2 111 for this to occur effectively it is important to improve the high charge carrier separation property of the photocatalyst mostly the electron on photocatalyst surface activates molecular oxygen to generate o2 oh and h2o2 if the pollutants have specific oxygen vacancies more electrons can be generated from the photocatalyst rather than recombining with holes h in the valence band fig 6a thereby modulating the range of light absorption a previous study reported how heterojunctions play a critical role in reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs 165 electron acceptors such as metals e g pd reduce electron hole recombination and prolong the lifetime of the electron hole pairs 20 the electron acceptors also increase the production of hydroxyl radicals 207 matrices such as graphene oxide act as electron transporters for suppressing photogenerated recombination 135 while carbon nanotubes act as photosensitizers or electron acceptors and increase the lifetime of the photo induced electrons 131 carbon quantum dots produce more electrons and electron hole pairs for the degradation of the pollutants 141 combining a semiconductor or two semiconductors of similar or different band structures produces a heterojunction which improves the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor the types of heterojunctions are i s scheme ii p n iii type ii and iv type ii and they all have different mechanisms to degrade pharmaceuticals fig 6b e table 6 shows the different nanocomposites and discusses the different mechanisms in the photocatalytic processes most studies explain mineralization or degradation as removal efficiencies which only compare the initial and final concentrations of the pollutants and do not give information on intermediate products 283 overall mineralization is important for the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals but complete mineralization is yet to be achieved and this is a threat for the aquatic ecosystem as generation of intermediates could be more toxic as the initial parent compounds therefore it is important for researchers to study the toxicity of the intermediates generated on photocatalysis reaction degradation mechanisms were also studied in terms of ring opening bond cleavage rearrangement into stabilized aromatic rings and subsequent cleavage and hydroxylation reactions 208 for example the degradation steps of ranitidine were through hydroxylation alkylation deamination and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and oxygen hydroxylation demethylation and cleavage of the pentacyclic ring were involved in the mechanisms 208 being a surface phenomenon photocatalysis governed by the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of the catalyst 279 thus the adsorption characteristics of the pharmaceutical compounds can be used to conjecture the photodegradation mechanism 8 future research directions despite the substantial amount of literature on the occurrence fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater literature on removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater using low cost nano enabled photocatalysts is relatively less besides the regeneration and disposal of spent photocatalysts has not been extensively studied especially ternary and quaternary photocatalysts in addition most photocatalysis studies are laboratory based using synthetic water that does not closely resemble real water systems most research on photocatalysts gives less consideration to removal mechanisms and regeneration disposal of photocatalysts reports on photocatalyst using real water samples have found deactivation of the nanophotocatalyst concerning however the deactivation mechanism of photocatalysts in real water systems is little known the sol gel method is a commonly used bottom up synthesis for nanophotocatalysts however this method is limited by the formation of conglomerates that subsequently reduce the surface area and efficiency of the nanoparticles further studies should thus seek to improve this method to improve nanocatalyst properties and performance complete mineralization of pharmaceutical pollutants is yet to be achieved and this is a threat for the aquatic ecosystem as generation of intermediates could be more toxic than the parent compounds therefore the toxicity of the intermediates generated from photocatalysis deserve further investigation following exhaustion photocatalyst can be recycled or regenerated although there are studies on recyclability and regeneration of photocatalyst the safe disposal of photocatalyst and its impact on the ecosystem requires further research 9 conclusion this review examined literature on the occurrence fate and photodegradation removal strategies for pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals occur in wastewater treatment plants surface water ground water drinking water and agricultural fields and their removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies is limited an evaluation of nano enabled photocatalysts for removal of pharmaceuticals gave an indication that tio2 is the most popular but requires modification to improve its catalytic performance nitrogen remains the most effective dopant and results suggest that co doping of nitrogen with a non metal greatly reduces the band gap of the photocatalysts the presence of an additional dopant allows for more nitrogen atoms to be incorporated into the lattice modification of photocatalysts on supports enhances the catalytic performance of the photocatalysts by increasing the surface area and adsorption as well as serving as electron acceptors nano enabled photocatalysts with magnetic character are beneficial with regard to recycling and recovery of the photocatalyst the sol gel technique remains the most popular method of synthesizing nano enabled photocatalysts because it is simple and ensures low production costs furthermore the technique enables fabrication of nanostructures with improved morphology and surface area resulting in enhanced selectivity and photocatalytic efficiency optimization of experimental parameters such as ph catalyst load and pollutant concentration is an important step to reduce limitations of overdose shielding of the radiation and reduced active sites the source of light for the photocatalytic process is an area that deserves further investigation in developing efficient and cost effective processes recyclability studies have been reported but more work is required on post treatment recovery especially at commercial scale application in terms of the duration of photocatalytic degradation processes more work is required to make the process cost effective and there is need to consider the irradiation time for complete degradation of the pollutants the determination of intermediates from the catalytic process requires further investigation since other by products might be poisonous to the catalyst and the environment addressing these issues will improve on the industrial application of photocatalysis to remove pharmaceuticals in wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors affirm that they are free of any known financial conflicts of interest or close personal ties that might have looked to have affected the research presented in this study the apc for this article was covered by sol plaatje university through sanlic 
12420,pharmaceuticals in the concentration range of hundreds of ng l to Î¼g l occur in wastewater and end up in surface water groundwater and agricultural land where they cause various health risks these pollutants are classified as emerging and cannot be efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes the use of nano enabled photocatalysts in the removal of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems has recently received research attention owing to their enhanced properties and effectiveness the industrial scale application of photocatalytic technology is still limited a comprehensive review on the removal of pharmaceuticals from real wastewater using the photocatalysts is therefore necessary this paper reviews literature on the occurrence fate and nano sized photocatalytic removal strategies of pharmaceuticals from wastewater modifications of nano enabled photocatalysts through doping deposition on various supports and introducing magnetic character to enhance their photocatalytic efficiency and recyclability were discussed the synthetic routes of photocatalysts influence the physical and chemical properties which can either enhance or inhibit their effectiveness the benefits of photocatalytic degradation include easy recycling as they exhibit excellent stability and can be used for several cycles going forward research should focus on 1 elucidation of photodegradation mechanisms 2 real wastewater treatment at industrial scale to remove multiple pharmaceutical compounds 3 regeneration and disposal particularly towards large scale application 4 life cycle assessment of the photocatalysts from synthesis to application 5 lowering the cost and improving photodegradation efficiency and 6 investigating the toxicity of intermediates to the photocatalyst and the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords effluent emerging pollutants micropollutants nanocomposites photodegradation remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the demand for clean water is expected to increase because of a rise in the world population while the availability of freshwater is projected to decrease to half by the year 2050 255 the quality of water is adversely impacted by increased human activities that generate organic inorganic and microbial contaminants which are subsequently discharged into water sources 1 2 sources of water pollution include effluent discharges from pharmaceuticals textile industry municipal wastewater households agricultural chemicals manufacturers food and drink manufacturers hospitals electroplating and oil processors 3 pharmaceuticals and personal care productions ppcps are emerging pollutants with toxicological effects even at minute concentrations 4 some ppcps have pharmacological effect and are found in over the counter drugs and prescription and veterinary drugs as a result of their extensive use in human and animal healthcare pharmaceuticals are discharged into the environment in the unutilized form or as metabolites most pharmaceuticals are highly polar and less volatile hence they are more likely to be retained in water bodies 257 hence pharmaceuticals are usually found in wastewater treatment effluents where some compounds are incompletely removed for instance previous studies reported that up to 90 of drug residues can be found in wastewater treatment plant effluents 5 6 unfortunately pharmaceuticals persist in water bodies posing health risks to aquatic life through the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria and disruption of the endocrine system 7 9 258 pharmaceutical compounds are structurally diverse and have been detected in groundwater drinking water surface water and wastewater these compounds normally enter the environment via treated and untreated industrial wastewater urban agricultural runoff and hospital effluent 10 11 hospitals are a major source of pharmaceutical discharge into the environment through excretion by patients and the inappropriate disposal of unused drugs 12 moreover uncontrolled disposal of industrial pharmaceutical waste is also a major contributor to environmental pollution 257 the occurrence of various pharmaceuticals in water causes a range of health impacts to humans and animals for instance antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole induce genetic mutations and chronic effects even at low concentrations 13 14 while analgesics such as paracetamol increase the risk of kidney cancer liver damage and asthma 15 16 overall adverse effects of pharmaceuticals include the disruption of the endocrine system and induction of antimicrobial resistance in environmental systems 17 a detailed discussion of the different adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on different organisms is presented elsewhere 18 various pharmaceuticals are commonly present in water bodies at very low concentrations hence their analysis detection and subsequent removal from aquatic systems is challenging 259 the major setback in studying the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals is the complexity of detection and quantitative analysis due to lack of sensitive and robust methods 19 hence most previous studies mainly focused on degradation processes on a laboratory scale sometimes using environmentally unrealistic concentrations and matrices 7 20 21 pharmaceutical compounds are inherently bioactive and persistent thus they maintain their therapeutic activity on discharge into the environment some pharmaceuticals are readily degradable while others persist unchanged 8 260 although biodegradation reduces the concentrations in the receiving waters their metabolites persist and cannot be easily removed by conventional biological and chemical treatment processes 261 a number of treatment methods have been used to remove pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems these include conventional treatment advanced oxidation processes activated carbon filtration advanced ozonation biodegradation adsorption electrochemical degradation microfiltration uv radiation phytoremediation and peroxi photo electrocoagulation 22 23 262 adsorbents have also been used to remove various pollutants from wastewater however conventional adsorbents are limited by inadequate adsorption capacity slow kinetics and insufficient potential for recycling 24 environmentally friendly adsorbent dendrimers provided a large adsorption capacity 263 metal organic frameworks and polyacylonitrile were used to remove pollutants in multicomponent wastewater systems 25 27 in one study conventional treatment of pharmaceutical contaminated wastewater removed 50 of antibiotics 20 30 beta blockers analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs 264 carbon activated by phosphorus oxyacids was found to have a high adsorption capacity of 345 mg g for pharmaceuticals while gamma radiation had a 70 100 ozonation had 40 99 and uv radiation had 20 100 removal efficiencies for pharmaceuticals in water 22 23 analgesic and anti inflammatory pharmaceuticals have been removed successfully using electrochemical oxidation 28 drugs such as diclofenac and carbamazepine were successfully removed using ozonation and fenton and photo fenton based advanced oxidation has been used to remove ibuprofen and diazepam in water heterogeneous semi conductor photocatalysis is the most promising effective and unique approach for treating wastewater contaminants including recalcitrant and persistent micropollutants 29 30 this is because it has high efficiency is environmentally friendly and it uses strongly oxidizing species like the hydroxyl radicals oh 265 the oxidizing species decompose organic compounds into less toxic substances namely water carbon dioxide and short chain organics 31 32 compared to similar processes such as the fenton process and ozonation photocatalysis mineralizes organic compounds without the need of adding chemicals 33 in the past decade different nano enabled photocatalysts have been used to degrade various pharmaceuticals under ultraviolet uv and visible irradiation the key factors that affect the photocatalytic treatment and performance include light source ph dosage or concentration of photocatalyst optimum reaction time for degradation and concentration of pollutant 34 35 examples of well known nanophotocatalyst which have been reported to be effective in the removal of pharmaceuticals from synthetic wastewater include tio2 zno cu2o nio mgo fe2o3 wo3 bi2wo6 bioi cus zns pbs sns c3n4 tio2 and bivo4 few reports on photocatalyst using real wastewater samples have found deactivation of the nanophotocatalyst to be a concern as the minimum and maximum efficiency of use was reported for 1 h and 25 days respectively 36 however the deactivation mechanism of nanophotocatalyst in real water systems is little known although there is a substantial amount of literature on the occurrence fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater e g 37 39 there is relatively less literature on removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater using low cost nano enabled photocatalysts low cost water treatment materials are important especially in low income countries where cost is the major factor in water and wastewater treatment besides the performance and regeneration disposal of photocatalyst have not been extensively investigated especially the ternary and quaternary photocatalysts such as cu2znsns4 cus agvo3 fe0 2co0 1zn0 6s lafeo3 lanio3 and lacoo3 40 43 in addition most photocatalysis studies are laboratory based using synthetic water that does not have interfering compounds such as microorganisms inorganic ions natural organic matter and biological macromolecules which play a role in the treatment of real wastewater systems there is limited practical application of photocatalytic technology at industrial scale a comprehensive review on the removal of pharmaceuticals from real wastewater using the photocatalysts is therefore necessary the present review discusses the synthesis properties application of various photocatalysts used to degrade different pharmaceuticals and the mechanism of the photocatalytic processes the objectives were 1 to review literature on the occurrence fate and removal strategies used for pharmaceuticals 2 to evaluate nano enabled photocatalysts for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater 3 to explore removal mechanisms regeneration disposal of spent photocatalysts and 4 to identify research gaps and recommend future research directions 2 methodology this review is based on scientific articles letters editorials reviews short surveys conference proceedings and research papers mainly drawn from sciencedirect wiley and sons mdpi american chemical society scopus and springer nature and published between 2010 and 2022 the literature was retrieved using the keywords occurrence of pharmaceutical photocatalysis micropollutant adsorption pharmaceuticals wastewater micropollutant removal pharmaceuticals removal source of pharmaceuticals fate of pharmaceuticals and nanosized photocatalysts synthesis of photocatalysts applications and performance removal mechanism and regeneration disposal of photocatalysts for illustration bibliometric data from scopus within the period of interest were plotted fig 1 the literature survey was performed on papers obtained for the data related to removal of pharmaceuticals by photocatalysis and pharmaceuticals mainly occurring in wastewater treatment plants the inclusion criteria were based on the year of publication journal type relevant area e interest subject appropriateness setting citations and reported outcomes the reported outcomes were based on the removal efficiencies recyclability and regeneration of photocatalysts with english being the official language of communication of the research most of the publications focused mainly on the photodegradation of dyes and there was limited information on removal of pharmaceuticals by photocatalysis studies on micropollutant adsorption micropollutant removal nanosized photocatalyst and photocatalysis were considerably lower than other fields such as pharmaceutical removal fig 1 the bibliometric analysis revealed the top four areas of research includes pharmaceuticals fate sources and occurrence of pharmaceuticals under article category in addition there is a lot of research on photocatalyst synthesis of photocatalyst application and performance of photocatalyst with less consideration for its removal mechanism and regeneration disposal of photocatalysts 3 the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater 3 1 sources of pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals enter water bodies from various sources such as agricultural runoff disposals from hospitals and households post production waste of pharmaceutical industries urban runoff pharmaceutical products in as well as their metabolites and excretions by humans and animals fig 2 44 47 other sources include direct discharge of untreated wastewater into the environment through the leakage of septic tanks and application of contaminated animal manure or wastewater treatment plant sludge as fertilizer in agricultural fields 48 49 3 2 occurrence of pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals have been detected in influent and effluents of wastewater treatment plants surface waters groundwater and raw drinking water 50 51 266 since it is difficult to remove these pharmaceuticals from contaminated groundwater it is necessary to identify their sources and control the release at source 52 pharmaceutical concentrations in most downstream samples relative to wastewater systems are higher than in upstream samples suggesting wastewater treatment plant discharges as a major source of pharmaceuticals in surface waters 6 53 besides pharmaceutical products with concentrations of up to 10 ng l enter the environment and groundwater via land application of municipal wastewater onto permitted land 54 266 the inability of wastewater treatment plants wwtps to completely remove pharmaceuticals results in them reaching surface and groundwater sources 55 56 from agricultural fields where sludge and municipal wastewater are applied 48 pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater influents and effluents in the range of hundreds of ng l to Î¼g l 57 for example gemfibrozil a drug used for the treatment of abnormal blood lipid levels was detected in the influent and effluent of wwtps and in groundwater in the range of 3 47 63 8 mg l but it can be reduced by 25 4 and 11 3 through biodegradation from the soil over 14 days when the treated effluent is applied to land 267 however a separate study showed gemifibrozil had high removal rates 73 100 whereas carbamazepine showed lower removals 6 aspirin was found to be the most abundant pharmaceutical in wwtp influent 1180 82 mg l and nalidixic acid was the most prevalent antibiotic 25 2 29 9 mg l 38 a different study found ciproxacin and sulfamethoxazole as the most dominant antibiotics in the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants 58 antiretroviral drugs arvs such as zidovudine and nevirapine have been detected in the concentration range of 3214 3336 ng l 0 9 to 2 1 ng l and 95 to 510 Î¼g kg in wwtp effluent surface water and river sediments respectively 59 the presence of arvs in water bodies particularly river water is a concern for african countries as most communities depend on untreated river water for drinking purposes in this regard southern africa is a hotspot for arvs in surface water for instance in south africa and zambia efavirenz concentration of 140 Î¼g l and 119 Î¼g l has been reported 60 enalapril irbesartan losartan valsartan and metoprolol which are antihypertensive drugs are frequently detected in aquatic systems 61 for instance antihypertensive drugs were found to acount for 20 of the pharmaceuticals detected in river water in spain 62 metformin the most consumed anti diabetic drug globally has been detected in the range of 158 2100 Î¼g l in germany 63 3 585 9 228 Î¼g l in south africa 64 70 325 Î¼g l in portugal 65 1 79 59 Î¼g l in iceland 66 and 702 Î¼g l in the usa 67 the high concentration of metformin in water bodies globally could be attributed to the use of biological degradation process which has proved to be ineffective in the removal of metformin more examples of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems are shown in table 1 3 3 fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants numerous studies demonstrate the limited capacity of wwtps to remove most pharmaceuticals 50 51 54 56 76 82 the physico chemical and microbiological features of the influent and effluent wastewater of a wwtp determine its effectiveness and efficiency in removing contaminants operational parameters like homogenization sludge age temperature ph hydraulic retention time of wwtps influence its efficiency 83 thus water characteristics such as electrical conductivity chemical oxygen demand turbidity coliforms suspended solids total phosphorus inorganic carbon total nitrogen total carbon and total organic carbon influence the behavior of pharmaceuticals in wastewater 84 acetaminophen and carbamazepine were found in wwtp effluents and were further detected in surface water and groundwater 85 furthermore ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole were found to persist in raw drinking water 82 a recent study showed that sulfamethoxazole was partly oxidized during wastewater treatment and the bacterial community in the constructed wetland columns exposed to sulfamethoxazole degraded it to four potential transformation products which were detected in the effluents 86 a separate study reported that sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine were resistant to degradation during wastewater treatment 6 two of the transformation products conjugated with glutathione hydroxyglutathionyl sulfamethoxazole and glutathionyl sulfamethoxazole can attest to the adverse effects of this pollutant on microorganisms and plants a study on the removal of pharmaceuticals from water using subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands observed carbamazepine was recalcitrant to degradation 76 most researchers reported carbamazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide to be persistent in wwtp effluents surface water and groundwater 6 56 68 82 85 the removal efficiencies for carbamazepine were below 10 and it remained recalcitrant 76 recently carbamazepine was reported to have a negative biodegradation removal from wwtps using double step activated sludge 83 in another study gemfibrozil was not completely removed during wastewater treatment and under low evapotranspiration conditions it can migrate through the soil to groundwater and sorb onto silt loam soil 54 metabolites of pharmaceutical compounds can be more toxic and recalcitrant to treatment than their parent compounds for instance acetaminophen thyroxine propranolol and their corresponding metabolites acetaminophen sulfate thyroxine glucuronide and propranolol sulfate were reported to undergo treatment with no significant reduction in concentration 87 previous studies have shown that the concentrations of pharmaceuticals exhibit seasonal variation where concentrations in winter are generally higher than in summer due to decreased temperature and solar irradiation 57 84 accordingly another study reported that sulfamethoxazole removal was higher during the summer than the winter season 6 in a separate study triclosan in wwtps effluent was detected in summer with a concentration of 0 56 Î¼g l while maximum concentrations of carbamazepine were observed in autumn ibuprofen and triclosan in winter paracetamol in spring and diclofenac in summer 68 solar penetration and change in temperature resulted in a distinct difference of redox conditions and the attenuation of pharmaceuticals 52 because pharmaceuticals are recalcitrant to removal from the aquatic environment they can potentially bioaccumulate and consequently affect public health hence it is important to review and identify methods that are not working and those that need scaling up for removal of the pharmaceuticals 3 4 removal methods conventional wwtps which consist of pretreatment primary settling and biological treatment using activated sludge fig 3 are incapable of completely removing pharmaceuticals 88 261 5 89 in conventional treatment plants biological treatment units play an important role in the elimination of pharmaceuticals via adsorption and biodegradation as a result biological transformation is the most likely mechanism responsible for pharmaceutical elimination in wwtps using activated sludge treatment gave much higher removal efficiencies compared to trickling filter beds 6 37 90 in another study most organics were effectively degraded while linear compounds with short side chains unsaturated aliphatic compounds and compounds possessing electron donating functional groups were easily degradable 91 activated carbon was also used to immobilize and overcome coagulation of tio2 in the removal of textile dyes with complete mineralization of the dyes 92 this suggests immobilized tio2 can be used as a photocatalyst for the removal of pharmaceuticals powdered activated carbon pac and ozonation have been used to remove micropollutants in wastewater 268 however pac has the disadvantage of becoming less efficient over time as the adsorption bed ages and adsorption sites become less and less regenerable 282 organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals can be effectively degraded by ozone which serves as an oxidant by the generation of hydroxyl radicals 269 however ozonation generates disinfectant by products such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles bromate and chlorites which are potential carcinogens 93 94 in addition carboxylic acids and aldehydes are produced which inhibit the mineralization of pharmaceuticals advanced oxidation processes aops have proved to be the most promising of all water treatment technologies for the removal of pharmaceuticals since they are fast acting with indiscriminate degradation and make use of uv light or visible light induced photocatalysis and strongly oxidizing species like oh radicals which degrade organic compounds into less toxic substances 31 32 methods that fall into the aops category include photolysis photocatalysis ozonation fenton and photo fenton ultrasound radiation sonolysis electrochemical oxidation and wet air oxidation and uv h2o2 among others fig 3 95 96 however ozonation and fenton oxidation require expensive equipment addition of chemical reagents and are energy intensive 33 97 98 4 photocatalytic methods heterogenous semi conductor photocatalysis is a promising effective and distinctive technology for the treatment of micropollutants in wastewater 29 30 the technology makes use of nanoparticle semiconductors which can be synthesized through a range of methods including bottom up and top down methods fig 4 4 1 synthesis of nano sized photocatalysts during the last decade a wide range of photocatalysts have been synthesized and used for the degradation of different pharmaceutical compounds most research data reported are based on tio2 nanocomposites 18 20 21 99 101 zno nanocomposites 102 105 ag nanocomposites 106 and a few others on biochar graphene and other supports 107 108 tio2 is mostly used in the degradation of pharmaceuticals because it is highly photostable nontoxic inexpensive photoreactive and chemically and biologically inert 109 110 the synthesis methods such as the sol gel hydrothermal solvothermal microwave sol gel assisted methods chemical bath deposition methods sonochemical hydrolysis solution combustion synthesis and microwave irradiation have been covered extensively elsewhere 111 4 1 1 sol gel synthesis the sol gel method is commonly used because it is low cost uses low temperatures and allows control of the resulting nanoparticles 112 further the method takes less time is reproducible and offers an environmentally friendly route with high up scaling potential 113 besides the sol gel method is a very successful technique to prepare doped tio2 nanoparticles because it affords simplicity in controlling the doping level particle size and morphology 114 this method is also suitable for the synthesis of nanostructures containing more than one component since the slow reaction kinetics allow good structural engineering of the final product in addition it results in the formation of a three dimensional molecular network and permits coating of substrates such as colloidal particles fibers and nanotubes forming nanosized complex shapes which some commonly used coating procedures cannot achieve 115 consequently the sol gel method has been used to synthesize a range of nanomaterials including mg doped poly scales 34 tio2 nanocomposites 116 and doped photocatalysts 21 99 253 the major disadvantage of the sol gel method is the formation of conglomerates that subsequently reduce the surface area of nanoparticles further studies should thus seek to improve this method to improve nanocatalyst properties and performance 4 1 2 solvo hydrothermal synthesis the hydrothermal synthesis technique has the advantage of synthesizing various inorganics with different morphologies e g nanofibrous materials which have good recyclability 112 hydrothermal synthesis creates larger sized and high quality crystals with increased degradation efficiency 112 although hydrothermal techniques have relatively low yield of products compared to other methods 259 they grow materials with higher vapor pressure as their melting points gets closer different solvents have been reported to affect the morphology and surface area of synthesized nanophotocatalysts for example cubic morphology was obtained with the use of water while ethylene glycol results in nanosheets and glycerol yielded 3d flower spheres 117 4 1 3 microwave synthesis microwave irradiation is an environmentally friendly and rapid surface modification method which produces uniform particles 269 although this method is more efficient compared to conventional methods it has a high energy demand to generated collisions and frictions 118 119 spherical shaped nanoparticles in the size range of 90 110 nm for big sizes and small size of average size distribution of 19 nm have been reported 118 119 overall microwave irradiation is more favourable as the synthesis time is reduced from hours to minutes and minutes to seconds other methods of nanocomposite synthesis along with the merits and demerits are summarized in table 2 4 2 band gap reduction nanocomposites that can either be doped by a single metal or non metal 20 39 99 103 270 co doped 100 123 130 131 z scheme catalysts 132 133 and those that have graphene oxide carbon quantum dots carbon nanotubes and nanorods 104 121 134 135 showed a reduction in the band gap and promoted the light absorption capacity in the visible region the band gap of the different synthesized nanocomposites ranged from 0 77 ev to 3 14 ev 136 4 3 doping doping of semi conductor nanoparticles reduces the band gap and enhances the photocatalytic activity by shifting the absorption band into the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum this can be achieved by metal doping nonmetal doping or co doping 4 3 1 metal doping several studies have shown that metal doping effectively reduces the band gap of the photocatalysts for example mg on tio2 had the largest decrease to the band gap and took lesser time to degrade the pollutant 100 compared to bi3 tio2 ag zno and ag2co3 99 106 bi3 reduced the band gap and took longer to degrade the pollutant mg doped tio2 had the largest reduction in band gap because the ionic radius of mg 160 pm is comparable to that of ti 140 pm and mg doping can be predictably substituted into the ti host lattice resulting in a decrease in the band gap 100 however increasing the dopant content has been reported to reduce the thermal stability of tio2 and cause phase transformation from anatase to rutile 271 4 3 2 non metal doping non metals such as n f s and c can narrow the band gap of photocatalysts significantly augment adsorption in the visible region and improve the degradation of dyes under visible light irradiation especially under natural solar light irradiation 137 compared to metal doping n doped photocatalysts reduced the band gap to a larger extent 103 in another study n doping enhanced visible and not uv photocatalytic activity 21 4 3 3 co doping reduction of the band gap is further enhanced by co doping this approach diminishes the band gap without any formation of charge carrier recombination centers 272 compared to single metal doping co doping with a metal and non metal results in a more reduced band gap for example the non metal dopant n introduced new energy states in n cu co doped tio2 above the valence band of tio2 whereas the cu dopant created a new energy state near the conduction band of tio2 and ti o cu bonds narrowing of the band gap and extending the visible light and efficacy of the photocatalysts 131 similarly the synergetic effect between metal and non metal co doped tio2 and sn4 acting as an electron trap effectively improved the photoactivity via the suppression of the electron hole coupling 130 furthermore other studies reported that doping with fe gave four fold and double activity than n doped tio2 101 121 co doping with sn n had the largest reduction in band gap 0 77 ev followed by n fe co doped nanocomposites which had a larger band gap reduction 2 5 ev this could be due to n fe co doping although they had different parents n fetio2 films and the other n fe cds wo3 in addition several studies showed that photocatalysts made by heterojunctions reduced the band gap to a lesser extent compared to the metal non metal or co doped nanocomposites 104 105 132 133 a photocatalyst that works in the visible light and uses solar energy is best obtained through doping and the z scheme effect 271 the heterojunction between sno2 g c3n4 improves the surface area and optical properties by decreasing the recombination rate 273 4 4 properties of nano sized photocatalysts 4 4 1 surface area generally the properties and performance of nanomaterials are better understood with surface area measurement 138 high surface area is achieved by the synthesis of nanomaterials from bulk materials through increased aspect ratio 139 140 inherent properties such as specific size photo charge carrier separation shape and purity influences their application as catalysts 139 large surface area increases the photocatalytic activity and this depends on the method of synthesis for instance the sol gel method produces nanomaterials with high surface area previous studies which used this method obtained surface areas of 151 147 6 and 153 65 m2 g 18 21 131 moreover the sol gel synthesis avoids aggregation effectively increasing the surface area 141 lattice defects are usually observed in nanophotocatalyst synthesized by sol gel method and these influence the photodegradation efficiency 142 another interesting defect which enhances photodegradation is the production of reactive oxidative specie is oxygen vacancies 143 a z scheme photocatalyst bi2wo6 cds tio2 was synthesized via a facile surfactant free hydrothermal method for the degradation of fluroquinoline and levofloxacin from aqueous medium under solar light 132 another study synthesized bi2o3pac ternary nanoparticles by the hydrothermal method to enhance sulfamerazine removal 133 and used the same method was used to synthesize n zno mos2 for tetracycline reduction 104 the solvothermal method was used to synthesize b tio2 for photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen and flurobiprofen under visible light irradiation 270 table 2 shows the surface areas of photocatalysts resulting from different synthesis methods 4 4 2 morphology the morphology of nanoparticles is important for its photocatalytic application as it provides greater versatility of tuning particles properties 144 morphological properties can be tuned through variation of heating and stirring time surfactant ph and particle synthetic method 13 14 nanoparticles with fibrous morphology have been reported to have high photocatalytic efficiency due to open pore channels high surface area high accessibility of active sites and high crystallinity 145 photodegradation efficiency have been compared between spherical and flowerlike morphology the former had better efficiency due to higher surface area and pore volume which enhance the adsorption thereby increasing the oxidation and reduction rate 146 nanofibers can easily be removed from solution thus the photocatalyst will be reusable 25 26 4 4 3 particle size the size of nanoparticles has an impact on the photodegradation efficiency interaction of crystal lattice between two metal oxide is important for effective charge transfer and this is influenced by particle size 147 the bigger the particle size the smaller the surface area and vice versa an increased diffusion occurs at higher surface area resulting in improved overall kinetics 148 nanosized photocatalyst have higher reactivity sensitivity and fast kinetics compared to microsized photocatalysts however the disadvantage of nanosized photocatalysts is the fast recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs and activation by uv light only 149 4 4 4 bandgap photocatalyst properties such as surface solvent and electronic structure greatly influence pharmaceuticals photodegradation table 3 photocatalyst of low bandgap 0 8 2 86 ev are photoactive under visible light while particles with a higher bandgap 3 0 4 52 ev are photoactive under ultraviolet light catalysts with a high bandgap have limited efficiency under solar radiation as only 4 of the spectrum can be utilized 150 it is important that the bandgap exceeds irradiated photon energy as this assists in the generation of electron hole pairs and limits their rate of recombination 151 152 photogenerated electrons degrade pharmaceuticals through reduction reaction with oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide hydroperoxide and superoxide anions 153 while photogenerated holes oxidize the pharmaceuticals or hydroxyl ions and water molecules absorbed on the catalyst surface to generate organic cation and hydroxylic radicals 154 combining different nanoparticles results in a synergistic heterojunction which improves charge carrier separation and generates photoinduced electron hole pairs with high redox abilities and increased photocatalytic activity 265 doping of catalyst reduces the band gap by creating a heterojunction consequently improving the absorption of pharmaceuticals on catalyst surface under visible light which results in efficient degradation 147 nonetheless there are setbacks that hinder the application of photocatalysts 111 and these include 1 wide band gap implies the use of ultraviolet light which limits the use of visible light that makes up about 43 of the solar spectrum 2 high recombination rates of photogenerated charge carrier and 3 instability of photocatalyst which results in photocorrosivity 5 photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceuticals different nanophotocatalysts for the degradation of pharmaceuticals using visible and ultra visible light sources are summarized in table 4 high efficiency can be obtained in either acidic or alkaline medium depending on the type of pharmaceuticals or nanophotocatalysts overall photocatalysts displayed high degradation efficiency under visible light source due to their band gap which was tuned based on the synthetic route utilized furthermore most of the photocatalysts exhibited high photostability as they were reused for a minimum of 3 cycles 5 1 operational conditions in order to attain high photocatalytic degradation performance there are key experimental parameters that require optimization fig 5 a discussion of these parameters follows 5 1 1 light sources in photocatalytic experiments convectional lamps are expensive and have high electricity consumption 166 although solar photoreactors are more widely used they require a large area and do not work efficiently during cloudy days and nighttime 167 168 thus solar simulated light sources are commonly used despite being less expensive led light sources have not been commonly used xe lamps are the most commonly used light sources used to simulate visible light followed by hg lamps the other light sources are uv lamps and germicidal lamps it has been reported that sometimes higher light intensity causes much more energy waste instead of degradation 274 and this needs optimizing along with all the other parameters 5 1 2 solution ph the ph of the aqueous medium is a significant parameter in photocatalytic reaction since it regulates the photocatalyst attributes such as surface charge and size agglomeration most previous studies reported optimum solution ph ranges from 2 85 to 7 for the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals 164 169 171 this suggests the degradation of most pharmaceuticals by the different nanocomposites were favourable under neutral and acidic conditions the impact of ph on reaction conditions is determined by interactions between the catalyst and the pharmaceutical compounds under investigation solution ph which determines the functional groups on the catalyst surface affects both the adsorption and photocatalytic processes 133 the electric charge property of the pharmaceutical pollutants is another important parameter to be considered pharmaceuticals are in their molecular form when their ph is less than pka while at pka greater than ph they become negatively charged therefore it is important to know the charge of the pharmaceuticals and the photocatalyst because if they have the same charge there will be repulsion between the catalysts and the pollutant thereby reducing the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst a study showed that ph accounted for factors like electrostatic contact between the photocatalyst surface and the pollutant molecule and the interactions between solvent molecules and charged radicals formed during the photocatalytic process 132 the maximum degradation was achieved at ph 7 and in alkaline solution more oh radicals were generated while increasing the ph resulted in lower degradation due to the repulsion effect the effect of ph on photocatalytic process is complex due to the involvement of interactive parameters such as dissociation species charged radicals catalyst and pollutant surface charges furthermore different reaction mechanisms play different roles on degradation at different ph 5 1 3 photocatalyst load and pollutant concentration it is necessary to optimize the photocatalyst concentrations to maximize photodegradation performance and minimize costs as photocatalyst efficiency is affected by its quantity a previous study reported that the amount of catalyst used in the degradation processes ranged from 0 02 to 1 g l 172 in general an increase in catalyst dosage results in a rise in the available active sites on the photocatalytic surface subsequently increasing the yield of oh o2 radicals which expedite pharmaceuticals degradation until optimum dosage is reached however after the optimum dosage degradation rate decrease due to light scattering 173 excess photocatalyst results in an increase in turbidity limited light penetration higher light scattering low generation of electron hole pairs and increased particle agglomeration 174 thus shielding the contaminants from direct light irradiation the quantity of photons on the catalytic surface is reduced at high initial concentrations of the photocatalyst resulting in lowering of the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band 274 the photocatalyst load is related to the pollutant concentration as the photocatalyst efficiency removal kinetics is affected by the concentration of the contaminants high pollutant concentrations require more oh radicals to avoid the production of large amounts of intermediate compounds which would compete for the oh radicals and reduce the photocatalytic degradation efficiency 175 176 as pharmaceuticals concentration increases more molecules are absorbed on the photocatalyst surface thereby reducing the availability of the active sites to facilitate the absorption of light for degradation in addition the photons generated are absorbed by the pollutants before reaching the surface of the catalyst which results in easy catalyst deactivation 177 the use of photocatalysts in high flow water is limited due to its high cost low regeneration ability and recovery of catalyst hence photocatalyst are commonly used on matrices support 5 1 4 photocatalysts on supports most research on nanomaterials formed from a catalyst on a support such as alumina chitosan and carbon does not provide data on the band gap since the supports are not expected to shift the band gap e g 18 104 141 178 180 the supports instead influence the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst because they serve as electron mediators and photosensitizers extending the radiation absorption into the visible range 132 in addition they play a role as electron acceptors impeding electron hole recombination 181 besides supports enhance pollutant adsorption by creating more adsorption sites due to their large surface area 80 81 as a result photocatalysts on supports have a larger surface area allowing for higher pollutant adsorption and faster degradation times immobilization of photocatalysts on supports reduces leaching of the active species thereby stabilizing the photocatalyst 182 monitoring the systematic loss in photocatalytic activity after some cycles of use and determining the stability of a photocatalyst can be achieved using inductively coupled plasma icp analysis 183 for instance icp was used to study the leaching of cobalt ions in the co3o4 go catalyst which exhibited stable performance on several cycles of regeneration 184 nitrogen doped tio2 has high activity but exhibits relatively low stability due to degradation of nitrogen species under highly powerful radiation 185 because of their ease of synthesis and nontoxicity and photodegradation efficiency tio2 based photocatalyst have been studied even recently table 4 current studies are exploring improved ways of synthesizing ecofriendly tio2 based photocatalysts with a narrower particle distribution and improved photocatalytic activity yet other studies are investigating ways of improving recyclability and reusability of the photocatalysts 5 2 kinetic studies kinetic studies give important information that includes prediction of the rates of degradation and information for designing and modeling the degradation processes 186 besides kinetics data dictate the residence time of the pollutant and dimensions of the reactor and also give insights into reaction pathways 24 overall it helps understand the catalytic function and aids in materials design the degradation kinetics of organic compounds depend on the synergy between adsorption and photodegradation 275 this is elucidated by carrying out the experiments in the dark and comparing them with experiments under light irradiation 276 the photocatalytic and adsorption properties of nanomaterials emanate from high surface area resulting in faster kinetics suitable for treating wastewater even at very low pollutant concentrations 275 277 surface area can be enhanced by introducing tio2 nanoparticles into a carbonaceous matrix a process that also improves the stability of the photocatalyst for example the surface area of tio2 modified g c3n4 was 1 6 fold larger than that of pristine 3d g c3n4 and this had a phenol removal rate of 16 278 in the case of carbon based photocatalysts the size and morphology directly govern the efficiency of electron hole pairs and consequently the photocatalytic kinetics and efficiency 277 most studies on the adsorptive removal of micropollutants from wastewater have followed pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir isotherm 24 27 186 for instance the photodegradation of potassium hydrogenphthalate using tio2 photocatalyst followed first order kinetics as indicated by the langmuir hinshelwood model 279 the langmuir model assumes monolayer coverage where adsorption occurs on specific homogeneous sites it also assumes there is no interaction between the adsorbed pollutant molecules and the adjacent sites on the adsorbent surface 25 27 detailed kinetic studies for pharmaceuticals removals through photocatalysis is an area deserves further research 6 recyclability regeneration and disposal of spent photocatalysts to reduce the cost of the photodegradation process the photocatalyst should be easily recovered and recycled for multiple reuse table 5 nanocomposites can undergo deterioration after consecutive cycles hence the necessity to evaluate the stability of the nanocomposites system s efficacy in pollutant degradation and the economic feasibility 280 due to their powdery nature most nanophotocatalyst are easily dispersed in a flow reactor which enhances their degradation efficiency however this attribute increases catalyst losses because of dynamic flow which reduces the recovery the stability of photocatalysts after use can be assessed by x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd if it maintains its crystalline composition after exposure to chemicals with different functional groups 187 studies on the crystallinity of photocatalysts after use are limited therefore future research should investigate this area previous studies report reusability in the range of 3 10 cycles 106 131 165 the photocatalysts with supports and magnetic character had more cycles and could thus be re used more often for example photocatalyst such as magnetic chitosan nanoparticles 186 chitosan wrapped multiwalled carbon nanotube with polyether block amide 281 ag cufe2o4 wo3 123 n tio2 sio2 fe2o4 253 tio2 znfe2o4 pd 20 have magnetic character this property facilitated the separation and easy recovery of the photocatalysts there are however limited studies and discussion on post recovery of the spent photocatalysts after recovery the nanophotocatalyst is regenerated to its initial state and this can be achieved by 1 solvent wash 2 thermal treatment and 3 peroxide treatment 188 189 titanium dioxide photocatalysts were regenerated by uv exposure under humid conditions and samples were analyze by ir and xps to investigate the mechanism 190 192 although there are studies on recyclability and regeneration of photocatalyst the safe disposal of photocatalyst and its impact on the ecosystem requires further research 7 mechanisms of photocatalysis the photodegradation mechanisms of pharmaceutical compounds can be determined by identifying the intermediate species formed from the reaction active species such as superoxide radicals hydroxyl radicals and holes participate in the photocatalytic reactions only one or two active species may dominate the degrading process in some cases with the others playing a minor role 104 the active species act differently in how they degrade the pollutants for instance hydroxyl radicals attack the benzene ring of the pharmaceutical 206 while holes can directly oxidize the pollutant 196 deactivation of catalyst is also due to the adsorption of pollutant intermediates on the active sites and this is better understood through mechanistic studies 36 the process for the generation of active species occurs on irradiation of the photocatalyst surface where electrons are excited and transferred from the valence band to the conduction band this results in photogenerated holes which oxidizes h2o to produce oh while the electron reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide radicals o2 111 for this to occur effectively it is important to improve the high charge carrier separation property of the photocatalyst mostly the electron on photocatalyst surface activates molecular oxygen to generate o2 oh and h2o2 if the pollutants have specific oxygen vacancies more electrons can be generated from the photocatalyst rather than recombining with holes h in the valence band fig 6a thereby modulating the range of light absorption a previous study reported how heterojunctions play a critical role in reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs 165 electron acceptors such as metals e g pd reduce electron hole recombination and prolong the lifetime of the electron hole pairs 20 the electron acceptors also increase the production of hydroxyl radicals 207 matrices such as graphene oxide act as electron transporters for suppressing photogenerated recombination 135 while carbon nanotubes act as photosensitizers or electron acceptors and increase the lifetime of the photo induced electrons 131 carbon quantum dots produce more electrons and electron hole pairs for the degradation of the pollutants 141 combining a semiconductor or two semiconductors of similar or different band structures produces a heterojunction which improves the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor the types of heterojunctions are i s scheme ii p n iii type ii and iv type ii and they all have different mechanisms to degrade pharmaceuticals fig 6b e table 6 shows the different nanocomposites and discusses the different mechanisms in the photocatalytic processes most studies explain mineralization or degradation as removal efficiencies which only compare the initial and final concentrations of the pollutants and do not give information on intermediate products 283 overall mineralization is important for the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals but complete mineralization is yet to be achieved and this is a threat for the aquatic ecosystem as generation of intermediates could be more toxic as the initial parent compounds therefore it is important for researchers to study the toxicity of the intermediates generated on photocatalysis reaction degradation mechanisms were also studied in terms of ring opening bond cleavage rearrangement into stabilized aromatic rings and subsequent cleavage and hydroxylation reactions 208 for example the degradation steps of ranitidine were through hydroxylation alkylation deamination and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and oxygen hydroxylation demethylation and cleavage of the pentacyclic ring were involved in the mechanisms 208 being a surface phenomenon photocatalysis governed by the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of the catalyst 279 thus the adsorption characteristics of the pharmaceutical compounds can be used to conjecture the photodegradation mechanism 8 future research directions despite the substantial amount of literature on the occurrence fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater literature on removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater using low cost nano enabled photocatalysts is relatively less besides the regeneration and disposal of spent photocatalysts has not been extensively studied especially ternary and quaternary photocatalysts in addition most photocatalysis studies are laboratory based using synthetic water that does not closely resemble real water systems most research on photocatalysts gives less consideration to removal mechanisms and regeneration disposal of photocatalysts reports on photocatalyst using real water samples have found deactivation of the nanophotocatalyst concerning however the deactivation mechanism of photocatalysts in real water systems is little known the sol gel method is a commonly used bottom up synthesis for nanophotocatalysts however this method is limited by the formation of conglomerates that subsequently reduce the surface area and efficiency of the nanoparticles further studies should thus seek to improve this method to improve nanocatalyst properties and performance complete mineralization of pharmaceutical pollutants is yet to be achieved and this is a threat for the aquatic ecosystem as generation of intermediates could be more toxic than the parent compounds therefore the toxicity of the intermediates generated from photocatalysis deserve further investigation following exhaustion photocatalyst can be recycled or regenerated although there are studies on recyclability and regeneration of photocatalyst the safe disposal of photocatalyst and its impact on the ecosystem requires further research 9 conclusion this review examined literature on the occurrence fate and photodegradation removal strategies for pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals occur in wastewater treatment plants surface water ground water drinking water and agricultural fields and their removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies is limited an evaluation of nano enabled photocatalysts for removal of pharmaceuticals gave an indication that tio2 is the most popular but requires modification to improve its catalytic performance nitrogen remains the most effective dopant and results suggest that co doping of nitrogen with a non metal greatly reduces the band gap of the photocatalysts the presence of an additional dopant allows for more nitrogen atoms to be incorporated into the lattice modification of photocatalysts on supports enhances the catalytic performance of the photocatalysts by increasing the surface area and adsorption as well as serving as electron acceptors nano enabled photocatalysts with magnetic character are beneficial with regard to recycling and recovery of the photocatalyst the sol gel technique remains the most popular method of synthesizing nano enabled photocatalysts because it is simple and ensures low production costs furthermore the technique enables fabrication of nanostructures with improved morphology and surface area resulting in enhanced selectivity and photocatalytic efficiency optimization of experimental parameters such as ph catalyst load and pollutant concentration is an important step to reduce limitations of overdose shielding of the radiation and reduced active sites the source of light for the photocatalytic process is an area that deserves further investigation in developing efficient and cost effective processes recyclability studies have been reported but more work is required on post treatment recovery especially at commercial scale application in terms of the duration of photocatalytic degradation processes more work is required to make the process cost effective and there is need to consider the irradiation time for complete degradation of the pollutants the determination of intermediates from the catalytic process requires further investigation since other by products might be poisonous to the catalyst and the environment addressing these issues will improve on the industrial application of photocatalysis to remove pharmaceuticals in wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors affirm that they are free of any known financial conflicts of interest or close personal ties that might have looked to have affected the research presented in this study the apc for this article was covered by sol plaatje university through sanlic 
12421,the consumption of the antidiabetic drug metformin mtfn has escalated over the last years due to the worrisome modern sedentary lifestyle since mtfn is not metabolized it reaches several environmental compartments imposing risks to aquatic organisms and possible future public health issues therefore the use of adsorption as a low cost and highly versatile mass transfer process has been proposed for its remediation and environmental control this review presents discusses and compares the efficiencies reached by all adsorbents prepared and employed in mtfn adsorption we carefully addressed the interaction mechanisms adsorption kinetics equilibrium modeling and the most relevant thermodynamic parameters creating a guide of solutions to practical problems by comparing the data on its toxicity and controversial endocrine disrupting effects reported in the literature with self performed quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis it was possible to see that mtfn is indeed adequately classified under the highest toxicity class contrarily to the claims of various studies thus according to the research gaps possibilities and challenges in the field there is much yet to be understood and developed toward mtfn thorough removal by adsorption such as i the need for studies under continuous systems ii mechanism elucidation employing computational tools and

wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction over the last decades the modern sedentary lifestyle is making increasingly usual the consumption of lots of highly processed food high in salt fat and sugar by our society consequently the cases of diseases linked to obesity and bad eating habits such as type ii diabetes have skyrocketed in 2016 for example the world health organization who estimated that 350 million people would be diagnosed with diabetes by 2030 1 however this prediction has already been surpassed by a surplus of almost 112 million people in 2020 2 4 automatically an increase in the consumption of pharmaceutical compounds used for controlling blood sugar levels and diabetes treatment has become inevitable raising public health and environmental concerns about the fate and amounts of such substances after ingestion 5 amongst the many available substances metformin mtfn c4h11n5 has been the most used drug since the late 1950s in the first line treatment of type ii diabetes popularly known as diabetes mellitus 6 its dominance in the market is mainly attributed to its high efficacy and low cost and in addition its use has been reported as an antiviral and anticancer stimulator which is particularly important when treating patients with comorbidities 7 8 moreover recent studies have also found that mtfn attenuates experimental autoimmune arthritis through reciprocal regulation of th17 treg balance and osteoclastogenesis 9 still up to this date mtfn consumption is primarily associated with treating diabetes type ii because over 150 million people consume it annually mtfn is one of the most detected drugs in sewage effluents 10 11 contrarily to several other pharmaceutical compounds mtfn metabolism is not hepatic and over 90 of the original compound is excreted after 24 h 12 still even though the drug is not metabolized by the human body after excretion it undergoes aerobic bacterial degradation and becomes the metabolite guanylurea 13 14 guanylurea is considered highly recalcitrant a problematic compound to degrade 15 both mtfn and guanylurea persist in the aqueous medium and are highly harmful to aquatic and animal organisms as endocrine disruptors 16 especially due to their polarity and high water mobility with low values of the octanol water partition coefficient kow 17 18 given that the us environmental protection agency epa defines endocrine disruptors as agents that interfere with natural hormones responsible for homeostasis reproduction and development behavior in different ways 19 20 mtfn is also included in the list of non traditional endocrine disruptors in the environment ever since several studies have proven the endocrine disrupting effect that mtfn causes in organisms and the environment 21 22 this occurred because in 2012 it was proved that mtfn could be used in treating polycystic ovaries concluding that mtfn can alter self regulating processes and hormonal effects 23 therefore as time goes by more and more problems that can be caused by mtfn and guanylurea presence in the environment are being known and reported raising even more concerns and discussions even though mtfn pollution is heavily associated with its already high and rising consumption the low efficiencies obtained by outdated treatments used in wastewater treatment plants wwtp also contribute to the current and future public health challenges related to its use given the relevance of these potential health risks and the diverse environmental fates of mtfn and its metabolite guanylurea the scientific community has focused on improving several modern remediation techniques aiming at greater efficiency and lower costs 24 25 amongst the successfully proven methods adsorption is the most readily applicable versatile and low cost technique of all 26 27 furthermore adsorption has even been recommended as the most viable and environmentally friendly alternative for mtfn remediation since it has been demonstrated that conventional degradation methods such as chlorination form highly toxic byproducts 28 30 in addition to these advantages varied waste materials can be converted to powerful adsorbents for mtfn and guanylurea removal employing processes with high efficiency and simple design 28 31 which solves two environmental problems at the same time 32 34 however up to this date very few studies on this topic have been conducted despite the significant problem of environmental mtfn pollution in light of these findings we reviewed all reported advances in adsorption technology for effectively removing mtfn and guanylurea from aqueous systems then with the help of an extensively published database we painted a panorama with the studies that detected mtfn in the environment stressing its increased presence in environmental compartments worldwide then we described the damage these substances can cause to the environment and all life forms next we discussed the interaction mechanisms involved and how these processes circle back to each other then after clarifying some controversial effects regarding its toxicity and endocrine disrupting effects we thoroughly presented and analyzed the adsorption data reported for all the adsorbents fabricated and tested for mtfn and guanylurea remediation we especially dedicated entire sections to discussing the main interaction mechanisms observed the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium modeling and the most relevant thermodynamic parameters for each type of process creating a direct guide of solutions to possibly encountered practical problems at last we critically discussed the research gaps possibilities and challenges in the field 2 presence of mtfn in the environment around the world due to the alarming increase in the number of diabetic patients and the inefficiency of wastewater management mtfn has become an emerging pollutant found in water resources in several countries and wwtps effluents 22 for example in the city of enschede holland mtfn was the drug found in the highest concentration in wastewater 64 98 Î¼g l 1 whereas its metabolite guanylurea was detected in effluents at concentrations from 39 to 56 Î¼g l 1 and in surface water at a concentration of 1 8 to 3 9 Î¼g l 1 35 in wwtps in the united states mtfn is amongst the most commonly found drugs which corroborates data from 2013 where mtfn was the 7th most prescribed drug with 72 8 million prescriptions 36 37 as one of the drugs most commonly found in wwtps and surface water mtfn means concentration typically varies from 0 1 to 10 Î¼g l 1 in these compartments 16 35 38 40 however these values can be much higher depending on the region detected in surface water at high concentrations of up to 100 Î¼g l 1 41 for example in effluents from stations located in malaysia the average concentration detected was 34 228 ng l 1 42 6111 ng l 1 in the united kingdom 43 and at concentrations of 58 and 149 Î¼g kg 1 in 6 treatment plants in the united states puget sound 44 the maximum mtfn limits detected in canada were 10 100 ng l 1 in the study by de solla et al 2016 in a river that received sewage effluent 45 while in the united states a concentration of 4308 ng l 1 was found in a river that receives discharges from wwtps 46 in the study by scheurer et al mtfn was detected in higher concentrations than other drugs in several rivers in germany 40 these results agree with data from 2011 where germany alone prescribed 601 million daily doses of mtfn an increase of 3 9 compared to the 578 million prescriptions in 2010 the german rivers elbe and weser accounted for 15 2 kg day 1 and 6 4 kg day 1 daily mtfn loads respectively in the german lake constance used as a source of potable water about 61 ng l 1 of mtfn was detected 16 moreover even higher mtfn concentrations have also been reported in the dutch meuse river basin 600 300 ng l 1 47 in malaysian rivers 42 in subterranean and surface water samples in switzerland 48 and in affluent receiving waters in canada 49 in sweden 50 and austria 51 in conclusion the presence of mtfn in surface water wastewater and drinking water samples makes clear the absence of any degradation and removal process already implemented in typical wwtps that is 100 efficient in table 1 all the data reported by the studies discussed above are presented and summarized between 2012 and 2022 425 research articles were published discussing mtfn occurrence in aquatic environments according to a search performed in the web of science database shown in fig 1 a significant growth in the reports has taken place going from 14 papers in 2012 to 70 papers during the same yearly counting period after 10 years which highlights the relevance that this subject has been gaining also we cannot ignore that in 10 years analytical procedures have been optimized and the knowledge regarding sampling methods heavily influences the final result obtained thus all the details for sample preparation and sampling locations point to contamination tendencies and are also discussed in the follow up paragraphs the earliest report considered in this study was from 2009 by scheurer and co workers whom analyzed the concentration of mtfn in different surface waters in german rivers employing high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms mtfn was detected in all river water samples collected at concentrations ranging from 100 ng l 1 in the rhine river to 1700 ng l 1 in the elbe river from its intricate sampling methodology the authors observed an increase in mtfn concentration over the natural course of the rhine river they have concluded that this tendency indicated that more than one wwtp discharged in this river however for rivers such as neckar and main the increased concentration effect is small and the concentration of mtfn may be more related to the discharge of municipal sewage since the rivers that receive it such as the neckar and elbe that have higher concentrations than those that do not receive sewage such as the danube 40 in 2013 blair and co workers also used hplc ms ms to analyze surface water samples collected at a depth of 5 m and in locations as far as 3 6 km from where the discharge of effluents into lake michigan occurred screening for all the pharmaceutical compounds present in the sample the antidiabetic mtfn was present in most samples being found above the minimum detection limit and in locations up to 3 2 km from the coast the average concentration was higher than 100 ng l 1 equivalent to the average of studies of small rivers and streams in which the antidiabetic was detected in concentrations around 110 ng l 1 in the u s 38 it is possible to notice that it is common for all the studies conducted around this same period between 2009 and 2014 to report mtfn concentrations in the range of ng l 1 with very few exceptions such as reported by oosterhuis et al 35 for surface waters 3 9 Î¼g l 1 in this study despite the higher value according to the authors this value is even lower than expected due to the estimated incomplete consumption of the amounts reported as sold as well as pharmaceutic industries and hospitals not being included in the study 35 in 2012 the use of quadrupole time of flight q tof coupled with ms an even more powerful tool was reported by martÃ­n et al reflecting on the need for higher efficiency in the quantification of low amounts of mtfn in the samples analyzed by then 53 in 2013 however it was already possible to notice an increase in the concentration range of mtfn detected in the samples in the order of Î¼g l 1 as houtman et al reported 47 the authors associated this phenomenon with the higher consumption of mtfn the most prescribed antidiabetic in the countries reached by the waters of the river studied even though its removal in wastewater is considered efficient with 98 removal this efficiency does not mean much if the starting value is so high that it leaves behind remaining amounts in the order of Î¼g l 1 moreover the study by houtman et al 47 reinforces the thesis of scheurer et al 40 on the ubiquity of mtfn in german rivers contrarily to other polluting substances lower limits of detection or quantification were not an intrinsic need for mtfn over the years given the increase observed from ng to Î¼g in most samples investigated for example meador et al analyzed fish tissue and reported a mean concentration of mtfn equal to 27 8 ng g 1 in the samples 52 the values presented by meador et al were slightly higher than the values reported by lubliner et al 44 52 according to xiao et al 69 it is possible to clearly see an increasing trend in mtfn detection frequency in environmental samples analyzed between 2015 and 2018 going from 1 8 to 3 8 the authors also report using gas chromatography gc coupled to ms a much simpler apparatus especially when compared to a q tof analyzer for quantification employing only solid phase extraction and derivatization reactions the successful use of less sensitive techniques without the need for extensive pre concentration methods is again an indication that mtfn must be present in much higher concentrations in the samples then confirmed by the final values of mtfn in wastewater reported between 1 7 Î¼g l 1 to 239 0 Î¼g l 1 69 3 toxicological effects observed and the controversies on mtfn endocrine disrupting effect due to the described mtfn fate and occurrence and its primary aerobic bacterial transformation product guanylurea in the environment several studies investigated the potential poisonous impacts on plants aquatic organisms and animals as a pollutant mtfn s main characteristics are high mobility and easy transformation to recalcitrant secondary metabolites by bacteria in natural compartments it has been observed that mtfn and its associated compounds can bioaccumulate in tissues of aquatic organisms 45 as well as in terrestrial 70 and aquatic plant tissues 71 in amphibians an increase in the contents of isoleucine leucine valine and glutamate was reported 72 in crustaceans an acute and chronic toxicity effect was observed 73 in algae it negatively affected the photosynthesis of chlorophytes 74 and changes in the reproductive system of mussels 75 as in algae the accumulation of the drug in plant tissues affects photosynthesis and consequently its growth and development mainly in the radicular system 17 other effects observed in other studies include alteration of t cells higher vulnerability to viral infection 76 scoliosis and abnormal pigmentation in embryos 73 oxidative stress 77 decreased proliferation behavioral and physical changes 78 morphological changes 3 79 and alteration of the intestinal microbiome and carbohydrate metabolism with an increase in liver glycogen 80 changes in sexual behavior were also reported in mammals such as in rats with a considerable reduction in sperm production and count 81 in addition its exposure in utero can decrease the fetal testicular size in rats and humans associated with a reduction in leydig and sertoli cell populations 82 in bovines it was observed that ovarian granulosa cell cultures decreased steroid production 83 a similar effect has been reported in human ovarian granulosa cell cultures where the drug also reduced basal and insulin stimulated aromatase expression and activity 84 changes in the expression and activity of follicle stimulating hormones have also been observed in humans 85 86 in humans its most attention calling effects were attributed to the observation that mtfn acts as an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex i leading to metabolic encephalopathy with end stage chronic kidney disease and even impaired consciousness and parkinsonism 87 in pregnant women it was observed that mtfn crosses the placenta and can affect fetal metabolism 88 89 in addition to the findings reported by tartarin et al 82 the main effects are again on the development of the reproductive system 90 therefore as reported continuous and undue exposure damage can generate cumulative toxic effects on aquatic organisms humans and animals the endocrine disrupting effect of mtfn has been observed by chance mainly in studies where the primary goal was investigating its toxicity niemuth et al 21 for example observed for the first time the appearance of intersex gonads in already adult males of pimephales promelas exposed to 40 Î¼g l 1 for 4 weeks in addition they also observed a reduction in fertility extended to 84 of the subjects exposed to mtfn in contrast to only 13 observed for the control group 11 even though the endocrine disruption effect of mtfn has been observed by other authors such as crago et al 22 and lee et al 91 in addition to niemuth et al 21 a fuss was raised in the scientific community by sumpter scott and katsiadaki 92 the authors questioned several aspects of the papers such as the experimental design its repeatability the concentration of mtfn used and many others suggesting that all procedures adopted were sub optimal 92 however the authors of the criticism disclosed a conflict of interest by being funded by one of the largest pharmaceutical companies there are other authors investigated a few of these matters in 2021 and 2022 which have addressed the questions raised on the duration and dietary phase of pimephales promelas according to parrott et al no adverse effects were observed on the subjects over a life cycle 93 however they did not test mtfn concentrations as high as niemuth et al 11 21 nevertheless parrott et al did observe a delay in breeding which may or may not be related to hormonal fluctuations 93 on the other hand blackwell et al investigated concentrations of mtfn as high or even higher than niemuth et al 21 and reported that no significant effects related to reproductivity or transcription of endocrine gene were observed 94 their study however was conducted for only 23 days corresponding to approximately only 6 30 of the period of 365 days investigated by niemuth et al 21 and parrott et al 93 in 2019 a series of papers was published in two parts discussing the so called real threat of mtfn and guanylurea in the environment highlighting that none of these compounds should bioaccumulate to fish nor show significant risk to the environment 95 96 these two papers also disclosed conflicts of interest declaring that the authors are employees or consultants of pharmaceutical companies that manufacture develop market and distribute mtfn worldwide however even though these researches are indeed funded we strongly disagree that it should be taken as any sort of confirmation bias since their methodology is anything but correct on the contrary we believe that opposing conversations move science encouraging that some blurred points and doubts be enlightened such as in the case discussed in the last paragraph still it is undeniable that i mtfn use and consumption is exponentially increasing over the years and ii even though some of these effects might not be yet observed in natural compartments they have occurred to some extent in the life forms studied revealing the need for further studies and critical data analysis in light of these discussions we have taken the liberty to further explore the toxicity traits of the mtfn and guanylurea molecules by employing quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis using toxtree 97 we used the simplified molecular input line entry system smiles where mtfn and guanylurea are represented by cn c c n n c n n and c nc o n n n respectively the software applied physicochemical and structural rules to the structures generating a decision tree approach that provides the final cramer class to which the compound belongs 98 the cramer rules classify compounds into different classes i ii or iii going from potentially least to most toxic 99 using the same smiles code we have also conducted a biodegradation and persistence analysis using the structural alerts for reactivity in toxtree start package 97 it is possible to see the cramer decision tree for mtfn and guanylurea toxic hazards in fig 2 a1 and a2 respectively according to the results both mtfn and guanylurea are classified as high toxic hazards belonging to the cramer class iii which means that the structural features in both molecules are often linked to toxicity reached at a threshold toxicological concern up to 90 Î¼g day 1 98 100 in other words according to this classification the threshold for toxicity concern is reaching 1 5 Î¼g per kg of body weight per day however this does not apply to human consumption for example since mtfn s initial dose starts at 500 mg day 1 a dosage is about 6 thousand times higher than the threshold estimates in conclusion extending these predictions to levels other than environmental hazards and aquatic toxicity would be incorrect therefore even though from a structural point of view both molecules are classified under the highest toxicity class a more critical view needs to be taken into consideration as suggested in the works by sumpter et al caldwell et al and straub et al 92 95 96 in fig 2b1 and b2 it is shown the results from the biodegradation and persistence analysis it is possible to see that while mtfn is considered persistent to biodegradation guanylurea is classified as unknown persistence however the fact that mtfn is readily transformed to guanylurea under aerobic bacterial degradation should not be considered controversial this only occurs by a particular type of bacteria that has adapted its metabolism to the substrates available in wwtps pipes trautwein and kÃ¼mmerer 101 showed that mtfn was classified as not readily biodegradable by the results obtained in three tests carried out according to the organisation of economic cooperation and development oecd protocols they have also observed that mtfn degradation to guanylurea only occurs under high bacterial density and even though other transformation products were formed only guanylurea was stable to any photolysis degradation process employed 101 4 mtfn remediation by adsorption and how the variations on the main parameters impact the process efficiency the recent study of adsorption as a viable and effective remediation alternative for mtfn started to be investigated only after 2017 during this period several types of adsorbents have been proposed and investigated including the classical use of activated carbon ac prepared from waste residues as well as zeolites silica based composites and other novel materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes in table 2 it is reported the adsorbents found in the literature alongside to the experimental conditions employed it is possible to observe that some parameters are optimized in all these works revealing their importance therefore after having carefully analyzed the results reported in the literature we have divided this section into three main topics i on the effects caused by the variation of parameters that can be easily altered during the adsorption process such as ph temperature adsorbate dosage and mtfn initial concentration ii on the morphological properties of the adsorbents used including specific surface area ssa pore volume pv pore diameter pd and point of zero charge ph pzc iii the results obtained as a product of the combination between operational conditions and adsorbent morphology such as optimal contact time best fit kinetic model best fit equilibrium isotherm model and maximum adsorption capacity obtained q max and the thermodynamics of the adsorption process 4 1 on the effects of variables that can be easily altered the ph of the solution greatly influences the adsorption capacity of a given adsorbent as it can influence the degree of ionization of the adsorbate and the properties and functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent 120 mtfn has two pk a values corresponding to the interconversions of the biprotonated monoprotonated forms at ph 2 8 pk a 1 and monoprotonated neutral forms at ph 11 6 pk a 2 most adsorption studies report that the maximum adsorption capacity of mtfn occurs between ph 6 and 7 which is approximately in the middle between the opposite pk a values according to the information provided by the pk a the monoprotonated forms can indeed increase within this range but will only decrease at much higher ph values this indicates that as the monoprotonated mtfn molecules outnumbers the other molecular forms in the solution while self repulsion effects inhibit mtfn diffusion decreasing its attraction to the surface of the adsorbent moreover according to zhu et al the changes in the amount of the monoprotonated form can also lead to a decline in mtfn s electron accepting capacity and weaker physical interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 113 it is essential therefore to note that the results and behaviors observed are also related to the charges present on the surface of the adsorbents which are ruled according to the point of zero charge ph pzc of the material determined under different ph values most adsorbents used were carbon based in the abovementioned cases where higher efficiency was obtained between ph 6 and 7 contrarily in the studies that observed better efficiency under more basic ph values between ph 8 and 12 the adsorbents were either zeolite or hydrogels thus the authors attributed the variations in the optimal ph pattern to the ph pzc estimated for the adsorbent used note that mtfn is in its cationic form at ph pk a 2 and neutral when ph pk a 2 therefore when ph ph pzc the surface of the adsorbent was negatively charged attracting the positive charges of mtfn favoring adsorption under conditions where ph ph pzc electrostatic repulsion possibly occurred and impacted the overall low efficiency under these conditions the same explanation is valid for the study that obtained a better adsorption capacity under more acidic conditions specifically at ph 4 again it was possible to attribute a heavier weight to the influence caused by the surface characteristics of the adsorbent which consisted of acid treated clay 119 after acid treatment the surfaces tend to become negatively charged benefiting positively charged molecules adsorption the only study with very distinct results was carried out by spessato et al 104 where a better adsorption capacity was obtained at ph 13 using an ac based adsorbent varying highly from the pattern observed between ph 6 and 7 for carbon based materials the authors claimed that in this case mtfn molecules are less solvated facilitating mobility and increasing diffusivity within the adsorbent s micropores 104 the adsorbent dosage is another critical variable that can be easily adjusted throughout the experiments however it was observed that not all studies presented tests for this parameter only fixing an optimal dosage for the experiments which can result from a limitation implied by low yields in the production of the material used in general it is observed that the adsorption capacity increases as the adsorbent dosage also increases and this is related to the increase in surface sites available for adsorbate molecules thus investigating the relationship between removal efficiency and adsorbent dosage can be very helpful in establishing the lowest adsorbent dosage possibly needed to remove a certain amount of pollutant a very effective way to determine the optimal amount has been proposed by kerkhoff et al suggesting the use of double y axis plots of the data on pollutant removal efficiency versus adsorption capacity where the intersection point of the curves is the maximal dosage needed prior to no further significant enhancing effects be observed 121 it is also important to point out that in many cases the use of dosages higher than the effects needed can inhibit adsorption through self aggregation and hinder pore accessibility due to particle agglomeration thus even though it is found acceptable in most studies to use 1 g l 1 of adsorbent dosage this can be very prejudicial to the process and to the success of the research than spending another few days or weeks investigating this variable at last the variations in mtfn initial concentration c 0 were investigated within the mg l 1 range varying from c 0 1 to c 0 700 mg l 1 the general trend observed in most adsorption studies was also observed for mtfn i e the increase in mtfn concentration increases the adsorption capacity q max mg g 1 as a response most studies used 5 different concentrations during their isothermal studies reporting the same trend of increase in adsorption capacities followed by a plateau that indicated the saturation limit since adsorption is a mass transfer process limitations always appear between the bulk and solid phases but still at the liquid film according to igwegbe et al and eletta et al this comportment is linked to the enhancement in the driving force of mass transfer of adsorbate molecules and it falls within the same category of the effects caused by the higher mobility of the adsorbate which can begin with higher mechanical agitation or higher temperature for example 31 122 4 2 on the morphological properties of the adsorbents produced for mtfn uptake the ssa is the most critical adsorbent property that can influence the sorption capacity therefore the ssa is directly related to the adsorption performance still not all studies investigating mtfn adsorption presented the ssa value of the adsorbents used however even within the low amount of data collected it is possible to observe that despite some materials having a low surface area the q max value obtained was high for example in the study by mahmoud et al 110 with an adsorbent with an ssa of only 8 82 m2 g 1 the q max was calculated to be 30 3 mg g 1 for c 0 in the range of 15 to 20 mg l 1 according to the isotherm fitting the adsorption occurred in the monolayer therefore the only plausible explanation is that this adsorbent was nanosized and its surface was highly functionalized therefore a much larger number of particles with increased adsorption sites was available in the solution 110 also as demonstrated in other studies functionalization is a crucial detail in optimizing many materials for adsorption efficiency 123 125 elamin et al also obtained similar results by employing an adsorbent with an ssa of 11 49 m2 g 1 and reaching a q max value of 30 5 mg g 1 within the c 0 range between 1 and 20 mg l 1 119 the largest ssa of 1889 m2 g 1 was reported by spessato et al 104 followed by an adsorbent with 1273 6 m2 g 1 reported by quesada et al 103 while the first reached a q max value of 103 83 mg g 1 within the c 0 range between 25 and 900 mg l 1 the latter reached a q max value of 45 5 mg g 1 within the c 0 range between 10 and 500 mg l 1 mg g 1 high ssa however does not mean the most outstanding efficiency especially if the dosage is not well adjusted to the optimal lowest amount for example zhu et al 113 and balasubramani et al 112 obtained q max values of 96 748 and 122 61 mg g 1 nearly as high as those obtained by spessato et al 104 and quesada et al 103 employing adsorbents with at least 6 80 times less ssa available curiously zhu et al 113 and balasubramani et al 112 also used lower adsorbent dosages of 0 150 and 0 126 g l 1 respectively while quesada et al 103 employed the standard amount of 1 g l 1 therefore it is possible to conclude that even though the ssa plays an indisputable role in adsorption efficiency it does not always nor by itself determine whether the adsorbent will have high removal efficiency in addition to the ssa other morphological factors such as pore diameter pore volume phpzc adsorbent functional groups and hydrophobicity will influence on the q max 126 another critical factor is that the pore distribution may affect the overall adsorption rate depending on the size of the pore the internal mass transfer is increased or diminished accordingly other easily controllable parameters such as those discussed in the previous section can influence surface charges and chemical equilibrium and must be considered 4 3 on the resultant representations of the mass transfer phenomena and the thermodynamic process aspects 4 3 1 effect of temperature and best fit isothermal model it is known that temperature strongly influences adsorption affecting adsorbate mobility and the interface adsorbate adsorbent these effects will consequently determine the fitting of the equilibrium data to isotherm models also reflecting on the estimation of critical parameters such as affinity constants and capacities as well as on the estimations of the thermodynamic parameters 127 128 in other words even though the temperature is indeed an easily alterable parameter it could not have been discussed in section 4 1 because it is intrinsically related to the isothermal behavior as the name already suggests the information obtained through isotherms assays is vital going from confirming the porosity of solids revealing if the adsorbate adsorbent interactions take place in mono or multilayers and up to a point where such information can make easier the industrial adsorption processes planning 129 130 at this moment where we have already established the importance of temperature to adsorption efficiency we would like to highlight the importance of carefully providing accurate data on room temperature as can be observed in table 2 even though not all works investigated the variation of temperature in the adsorption studies of mtfn under simple batch experiments the mean values reported vary between 298 and 288 k except for one study that reported its higher efficiency at 318 k most studies reported good adsorption efficiencies at the so called room temperature being favorable for application in systems that require none or little supply of thermal energy reducing operational costs still even though room temperature is known to be 298 k this value must be explicitly reported suppose we carefully reflect on the actual information provided by the reports on efficiency according to the temperature in that case we can conclude that most processes are exothermic according to the predominance of disadvantaged processes with the increase in temperature in the system in addition to the magnetic carbon composite developed by Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 only ac produced by kalumpha et al 102 spessato et al 104 jimoh et al 105 and mohammad et al 108 was shown to be endothermic which could only be confirmed by the thermodynamic study usually adsorption studies relate the enhancements at high temperatures to increase the adsorbate molecule s solubility however in most studies the c 0 used is far from saturation especially if the solution was adequately prepared and homogenized this behavior actually is more heavily linked to the morphological properties of the adsorbent used given that as discussed the ssa and the pore parameters will rule diffusion and how the thermal agitation of the adsorbate will influence the overall process as also presented in table 2 either the freundlich or the langmuir isotherm models better represented the adsorption behavior of most adsorbents against mtfn uptake the freundlich model was more representative of the processes carried out using graphene oxide 113 three different biochars 103 106 109 acid treated clay 119 and cellulose based hydrogel 116 the materials differed significantly in ssa and ph pzc and the only possible similarity between them is their possibly highly heterogeneous surface resultant from the synthetic procedure employed or as a consequence of some particularity of the feedstock used as precursor the langmuir isotherm model on other hand represented better mtfn adsorption for adsorbents with smaller particle size and similar ph pzc confirming that the adsorbate molecules are well distributed in monolayer form at near neutral ph 102 110 114 115 117 thus it is possible to say that the mtfn molecule contributes to the adsorption mechanism as much as the adsorbent given that it has been observed for example that smaller ions such as cs follow langmuir isotherm not freundlich on similar cellulose based adsorbents 131 132 in the study by alnajjar et al mtfn adsorption onto silica alumina composite followed the sips isotherm 118 the good sorption capacity was obtained because the optimal ph was set at 9 very close to mtfn s second pk a value even though only work used a silica based material for mtfn removal its use is very promising for the removal of other contaminants such as the potentially toxic metal ions cu ii 133 134 cd ii 135 137 pd ii 138 cs i 139 and pb ii 140 one of the advantages of silica based materials is their high sensitivity which can be selectively expanded and functionalized toward the removal of other contaminants from wastewater samples 141 142 finally the two studies by balasubramani et al 111 112 employing two different types of graphene oxide presented a good fit to the weber van vliet and fritz schlunder v models 111 112 which are non linearized models with four and parameters respectively the weber van vliet and fritz schlunder v models can significantly represent heterogeneous equilibrium data within a wide range of solute concentrations limited by being reduced to freundlich or langmuir isotherms at extreme conditions over the years these types of isotherms have been growing over the use of classical ones precisely because they can provide much more information on the interaction mechanisms another important aspect is the increased use of naturally non linearized isothermal models meaning that the days where data was forced to be linear by c t q t relations are finally being left behind sadly studies that linearize the data are still observed as in the case of the studies by adel niaei rostamizadeh 117 and mahmoud et al 110 4 3 2 thermodynamic parameters through thermodynamic investigations it is possible to determine several vital functions such as gibbs free energy g enthalpy h and entropy s with precision these variables are important because they allow us to extend further the predictions made regarding adsorption performance and mechanism being essential for the characterization and optimization of the process while also providing information on whether the adsorption process is spontaneous 143 144 estimating the variations in thermodynamic parameters is done accordingly to the best fit isotherm model by employing several adjusted equations resulting in the final g h and s values in kj mol 1 kj mol 1 and j mol 1 k 1 units respectively not all work reporting on mtfn adsorption determined the thermodynamic parameters however a significant number of studies reported the nature of the adsorption process as exothermic based only on the efficiencies obtained at a temperature set between 288 k and 298 k this is highly mistaken because the lack of comparison within a broader temperature range can lead to wrongful assumptions for example as shown by nguyen et al only after estimating the thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures were they able to find that their adsorption process was endothermic favored at 323 k contrarily to the conclusions made only considering the results obtained in batch experiments at 298 k 145 from the studies that conducted a thorough thermodynamic investigation it was possible to observe that g was 0 and that g value decreased as the temperature increased these studies also showed coherent h 0 values confirming the exothermic nature of the process in these cases the affinity k aff between adsorbate molecules and the adsorbent was higher at the lowest temperatures studied where lesser thermal agitation effects took place confirming that the adsorption occurs spontaneously and without interference from external forces 146 as reported in the previous section only the study by kalumpha et al 2019 reported mtfn adsorption of endothermic nature however the maximum temperature analyzed was 293 k 102 last most studies reported s 0 indicating a characteristic increase in solid solution interface randomness 147 4 3 3 contact time obtaining the optimal contact time directly affects the adsorption processes by altering the kinetic projection and to what extent the mass transfer phenomena will occur for most adsorbents reported the saturation time takes longer than 300 min to reach because i the adsorbate molecules are slow to occupy all available places on the surface of the adsorbent or ii the mass transfer is not very efficient in table 3 it is presented the mtfn adsorption studies that carried out kinetic investigations and which model their data best fit it is possible to see that the contact time needed equilibrium to be reached much shorter usually occurring at 160 min or even less corresponding to a fast diffusion of course much slower adsorption processes were also reported such as in the cases of balasubramani et al 112 and cusioli et al 114 who reported the need for 25 000 and 720 min respectively for their adsorbents to reach saturation kinetic time differences are directly related to the characteristics of adsorbents such as ssa pv and pd especially in the case of mtfn as shown in table 3 in order to determine the kinetic model that best fits the data the statistical adjustment coefficients r2 r2 adj are and msr were considered the data collected by most studies fit better with the pseudo second order model with high correlation coefficients and low are and msr this kinetic model suggests a more complex process of diffusion reinforcing the hypothesis that the surface of these adsorbents tends to be more heterogeneous than homogeneous a result that would be in agreement with the discussions in the previous section where it was shown that most isotherms were better fit to the freundlich model zhu et al 113 suggested that the adsorption mechanism could be chemisorption due to the better fit to the pseudo second order model however after determining the thermodynamic parameters it was confirmed that the interactions were of physical nature where Ï Ï interactions and hydrogen bonds are predominant in the process furthermore studies better suited to the pseudo first order kinetic model and weber was also presented however the study by faleh and radhy 116 despite performing kinetic studies did not fit the data to mathematical models 5 mtfn adsorption mechanisms sadly not all works discussed in the previous sections provided clear information about the interactions on the surface of the adsorbent and mtfn molecules therefore the 8 studies that indeed proposed mechanisms are presented in table 4 all pointing to electrostatic and physical nature interactions varying from hydrogen bonding to Ï Ï interactions except for one work that pointed to chemisorption the importance of studying adsorption mechanisms relies on the forecasting to up scale and on the thorough understanding and validation of previous results allowing the data to be interpreted most accurately for example in the study by balasubramani et al 112 the authors initially suggested chemisorption due to the pseudo second order kinetic best fit however after further investigating into the adsorption mechanism from a thermodynamic point of view they estimated g to be 40 kj mol 1 and confirmed the predominance of Ï Ï interactions 112 in the study by Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 however the authors observed through ft ir analysis that feo peaks present in the carbon nanotube significantly decreased after adsorption moreover in addition to feo peaks the co elongation and oh curvature peaks showed decreased intensities in the spectra therefore the authors assumed a link between the adsorbate and mtfn was formed through its nh2 functional groups 115 still it is noteworthy that thermodynamic studies were not carried out to prove whether the interactions are chemical and even though it is helpful and enlightening an analysis using only ft ir peaks is not enough 115 as discussed previously mtfn is a large molecule with two broad pk a values and its charges over the ph range will determine the nature of the interactions that will occur between it and the surface of the adsorbent it is also vital to highlight the adsorbent s nature and the adsorbent s interactions with the adsorbate therefore the functional groups determined in the ft ir spectra the ph pzc the morphological characteristics help us understand the adsorption mechanism between the adsorbate and the adsorbent as summarized in fig 3 if we analyze the studies involving adsorption we will observe that practically in all cases the reaction is physical since for a chemical interaction to occur the Î´g must have a magnitude 40 kj mol 1 in the case of most interactions reported the magnitude of Î´g is 40 kj mol 1 as in studies involving mtfn 148 149 in these cases desorption is facilitated and can occur in distilled water or organic solvents these are capable of desorbing the mtfn from the surface of the adsorbent whereas in cases of chemosorption desorption is more complicated requiring the addition of a strong acid or base generating more pollutants and economic costs 5 1 taking over computational approaches and quantum modeling for further understanding of mtfn interaction mechanisms molecular modeling and computational chemistry have provided exciting drug design tools for over a century however its use for describing drug delivery interaction is almost as recent as in mechanism interpretations 150 151 which has only expanded toward understanding adsorption processes in the last years 152 in addition to the already used phenomenological modeling quantum mechanical calculations have become an effective combined approach mainly using density functional theory dft 127 128 153 dft allows predicting the properties and behavior of many chemical compounds at a molecular level by determining several chemical descriptors electronic properties and structural data such as optimized geometries 154 these parameters are constructive in understanding how the adsorbate molecule interacts with the surface of the adsorbent as much as it is an effective drug delivery prediction tool several authors have evaluated the mechanisms behind mtfn adsorption through the dft perspective ibarra rodrÃ­guez sÃ¡nchez 155 used this approach on graphitic carbon nitride functionalized with metals from groups 1 2 and 3 li na k be mg ca b al and ga it was observed that graphitic carbon nitride gc3n4 has properties to adsorb ions in the central cavity and that mtfn is physically adsorbed with considerable adsorption energy values based on the adsorption energy values the molecules are strongly physisorbed in some prepared adsorbents due to higher oxidation states of the metal used i e 2 and 3 the natural bond orbital analysis nbo program indicated that the donor orbitals belong to the nitrogen atoms of mtfn while the acceptors n belong to the metal atoms the result of the quantum calculations pointed to m gc3n4 adsorbent as the most stable produced material to be used as an mtfn carrier while the compounds m gc3n4 2 and m gc3n4 3 can be used in drug detection sensors 155 ghasemi et al 156 analyzed the adsorption behavior and detection of mtfn on external surfaces of doped pure boron nitride bn fullerenes by using a different dft d approach through the corrected generalized gradient approximation perdew wang 91 pw91 d functions the authors also used the conventional becke 3 parameter lee yang parr b3lyp d function for comparison according to their results the nh2 and nh groups of mtfn depending on the ph can chemically adsorb on the pure and doped boron nitride fullerenes furthermore the binding energy and dipole moment determinations showed that the electronic properties of fullerenes doped with gab11n12 have changed less remarkably contrary to those doped with ge and si analogs the authors also observed that water a polar solvent increased the adsorption energy under all circumstances helping simulate a body like environment 156 in the study by spessato et al 104 the adsorption of a mixture of mtfn with the dye rhodamine b was investigated by employing dft calculations and the results were compared against the results obtained by the conventional isotherm modeling in this case even though the authors used the right approach they compared the values obtained for the molecules studied as if they were analyzing the band gap variations for metal catalysts even calling the molecules conductors or insulators despite this misconception the obtained values confirmed that the dye studied was a better electron donor than mtfn after investigating and comparing their differences in their homo and lumo regions however the authors did not explain in detail how the estimated chemical hardness and electrophilicity of the molecules influenced their interactions with the adsorbent surface even though they had the results they simply projected that the surface of activated carbon not the molecules modeled tends to have a greater preference for adsorbing the dye molecules over mtfn which can simply be deduced by knowing the surface charges and the chemical equilibria of the molecules 104 anota and cocoletzi 157 used a purely computational approach to investigate the interactions between mtfn and single walls nanotubes functionalized with boron nitride studying six different approximations of the mtfn molecule to the surface according to their theoretical results mtfn is adsorbed by interacting with nh2 groups present at the end of the carbon nanotubes and during the interaction the system s polarity is increased indicating possible dispersion and solubility added to this there was an increase in the chemical reactivity of the order while the solvation in water maintains the semiconductor characteristics of the nanotube and the mtfn 157 in addition to intrinsic interaction and mechanism elucidations investigations of the effects caused by heteroatom doping have been carried out in the study by hoseininezhad namin et al 158 it was verified that the addition of al and si atoms to carbon nanotubes could change the type and strength of the interactions up to a point where it shifts from physisorption to chemisorption the authors also verified that the si doped nanotubes 1 46 and 1 40 ev in states i and ii respectively presented a greater change in the energy gap than the al doped one 1 52 ev under both states allowing it to be more sensitive toward mtfn presence therefore the si doped nanotube can be a reliable drug delivery system 158 finally the study by kamali et al 159 analyzed mtfn interaction with various nanoclusters c60 c48 sic59 sic47 gec59 and gec47 poor sensitivity and low adsorption have been reported for nanoclusters c60 and c48 with their calculated adsorption energies being 0 43 and 2 10 kj mol 1 respectively although the adsorption energy in sic59 sic47 gec59 and gec47 indicated strong adsorption the sensitivity only increased in sic59 where a short recovery time was predicted 159 6 going further than the lab expansion to simulated effluents desorption processes for reuse and continued flow systems in the previous sections we have demonstrated how the fluctuations of several key parameters affect adsorption efficiency for mtfn removal and how successful the adsorbents developed for this purpose have been the expressive results obtained for the adsorption of mtfn in simple aqueous solutions show the high potential of these adsorbents for the treatment of water and sewage however in real water and environmental matrices numerous contaminants are mixed and their synergy can result in competition effects that can change adsorption mechanisms and removal efficiency thus it is also necessary to investigate how these materials behave under such adverse conditions before they are considered for scale up applications gladly a few previously discussed works carried out studies considering actual environmental conditions for the mixture of mtfn and other compounds analyzing the capacity of the adsorbent developed in the study and the conventional batch assays in the study by quesada et al 103 where ac prepared from chichÃ¡ do cerrado fruit shells was employed it was observed that the adsorbent could remove both metal ions and mtfn reaching a removal efficiency of over 60 however when analyzing the single systems over the removal attained for the binary system a preference of the material to adsorb more cu ii ions than mtfn was noted 103 since metal adsorption usually involves several types of mechanisms including complexation the characterization analysis indicated a decrease in oxygenated groups due to the degradation of the biomass structure which is more intense with activation chemistry therefore this study suggests that complexation may be the main cu ii adsorption mechanism with synergistic effects occurring in the mixture and the adsorbent moreover cu ii ions are much smaller than mtfn therefore its mass transfer occurs faster saturating the adsorption sites available which then become inactive for receiving mtfn moreover huang et al 2016 demonstrated that in a binary mixture of mtfn and cu ii part of the mtfn was adsorbed as a cu ii mtfn 2 complex 160 which could have happened in the study by quesada et al 103 mahmoud et al analyzed the adsorption of mtfn in tap water seawater and wastewater samples reaching removal efficiencies of 87 97 and 92 respectively employing nanobiochar as adsorbent 110 elamin et al investigated the adsorption capacity of complex mixtures of mtfn and other compounds in tap water seawater and groundwater using acid treated clay the results showed removals above 70 with more promising results after desalination of the samples where the efficiencies were above 90 119 contrary results were obtained in the study by zhu et al 113 where the effects of ionic strength using different concentrations of nacl were investigated for graphene oxide as the ionic strength increased mtfn adsorption efficiency decreased in addition the active coefficients associated with its adsorption also decreased demonstrating the limitations imposed on its migration to the surface of the adsorbent by competitive processes also the authors reported that the increase in ionic strength reduced the electrostatic repulsions between the adsorbent particles resulting in aggregation 113 these effects can be easily explained by considering the significant differences between the adsorbent materials as well as that clay contrary to graphene oxide can also adsorb other compounds through an ionic exchange which would result in decreased favorable adsorption sites other studies that investigated the influence of nacl in solution were also carried out employing nanobiochar and carbon based magnetic composite as adsorbents 110 115 Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 observed the same trend as zhu et al 113 reporting that increasing the salt concentration from 0 01 to 0 1 mol l 1 directly affected the adsorption capacity of mtfn which decreased from 6 69 to 3 06 mg g 1 115 mahmoud et al also investigated the influence of other salts such as k2so4 cacl2 and mgso4 in addition to nacl which led to a decrease in mtfn removal from 85 4 to 52 5 46 3 52 8 and 55 7 respectively 110 spessato et al 104 verified the adsorption of the drug in a binary mixture with the dye rhodamine b in the mixture the capacity for mtfn was 103 83 mg g 1 while for the monocomponent system the capacity was 112 54 mg g 1 little affected by the presence of the dye 104 in the study by kalumpha et al 102 the capacity of the zea mays tassel ac adsorbent was tested with real effluent from the pharmaceutical industry the removal reached 94 19 showing the high potential of the material to be used in actual conditions however the authors did not report which other compounds were present besides mtfn 102 therefore due to the complexity of the effluents and the synergistic effects between the compounds and the drug more studies are needed in this field analyzing other compounds mainly other pharmacological molecules still it was possible to observe that ionic strength plays a crucial role in adsorption systems that emulate environmental conditions worsening or improving the efficiency reached depending on the adsorbent 6 1 1 desorption and reuse the regeneration performance of an adsorbent is the major advantage of adsorption over other technologies regarding economic aspects and sustainability for industrial applications therefore just as a high adsorption capacity is essential in a material its regeneration capacity is also necessary a significant number of the studies reported in table 2 successfully performed desorption and reuse tests on the proposed materials for example in the study by balasubramani et al 112 the desorption experiments were carried out using hot water diluted hcl 1 mol l 1 diluted naoh 1 mol l 1 and acetone where it was observed that diluted naoh has greater regeneration capacity than other solvents this occurred because the oh ions replaced the mtfn ions on the surface of the adsorbent it was also observed that the adsorption decreased slightly after each cycle about 8 resulting in an adsorbent that can be reused in up to 5 cycles 112 in the study by zhu et al 113 using 0 2 m naoh as eluent it was observed that the material could also be reused in up to 5 cycles maintaining a capacity of 31 6 mg g 1 113 adel niaei rostamizadeh reported that heating the adsorbent at 550 c for 6 h was efficient in desorption maintaining removal at 92 3 after the first regeneration cycle 117 alnajjar et al also reported that thermal regeneration was efficient maintaining removal at 97 after three cycles 118 Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 performed the desorption with a phosphate buffer solution and reported that after three cycles the removal was kept at 66 115 mahmoud et al used even more a 0 1 mol l 1 solution of hcl as eluent where after 4 cycles the adsorbent maintained an efficiency of 82 110 finally in the study by kalumpha et al diluted hcl 0 2 mol l 1 was used and after 6 cycles the adsorbent maintained 81 5 efficiency 102 therefore adsorbents containing mtfn can be regenerated by employing different and diluted eluents and thermal heating while maintaining structural stability in up to 6 regeneration cycles 6 1 2 mtfn adsorption in a continuous system even though the great majority of the adsorption studies published only consider discontinuous systems i e batch mode it was possible to find 2 works that analyzed mtfn adsorption in continuous i e column systems this type of study and its application is significant especially considering that the application of adsorption on a large scale and for treating large volumes is performed under continuous mode the study by hethnawi et al 161 represented in fig 4 investigated the adsorptive removal of mtfn by amorphous silica alumina composite under various dynamic conditions column adsorption performance was tested at ph 6 and 9 with a flow rate from 2 to 5 ml min 1 a bed height from 1 21 to 3 63 cm and mtfn c 0 from 25 at 75 ml min 1 the results showed better performance in removing mtfn in lower effluent concentration lower flow rate higher ph and higher adsorbent bed height and the axial split scatter kinetic model accurately described the breaking behavior within the column 161 in the study by piai et al 162 the adsorption of several drugs including mtfn was investigated using granular activated carbon in fixed bed filters it was observed however that 3 of the 10 compounds were biodegraded by the biofilm no general effects were observed for the mixture which was highly dependent on the target pollutant the temperature increase for example could either affect positively or negatively depending on the pollutant at a higher concentration in the solution mtfn 30 and hexamethylenetetramine 23 had the lowest removal capacities while diclofenac and benzotriazole reached the highest values 99 162 therefore due to the complexity of the parameters that interfere with adsorption in continuous systems the peculiarities of adsorbents used for this purpose and the lack of studies in this field we strongly suggest that this area be explored in future research so that the knowledge gaps can be filled 7 application of other technologies in mtfn adsorption in addition to adsorption other technologies can be used as supporting coupled techniques in wastewater treatment plants to obtain greater efficiency with lower operational costs as each technology has its advantages and disadvantages in addition to the effluents complexity combining other processes with adsorption will always lead to greater success in the treatment in the case of mtfn biodegradation abiotic degradation and phytoremediation are more commonly observed than other processes in the literature it is possible to find recent studies obtaining good removal results by aerobic and anaerobic routes 101 163 165 a few differences were observed for mtfn and its main metabolite guanylurea such as in the study by tisler zwiener where they observed that metabolite degradation was faster under anaerobic conditions while mtfn was more efficiently degraded under aerobic conditions 166 expressive results have also been obtained such as the ones by janka et al who achieved 100 mtfn removal using a hybrid vertical anaerobic biofilm reactor 167 if combined with adsorption in addition to the possibility of reducing the days needed because not total removal efficiency must be achieved in the first stage the final effluent would even be odorless removing the unappealing remaining scent left by most biological treatments markiewicz et al 168 analyzed the biodegradation of pharmaceutical compounds including mtfn in activated charcoal from sewage sludge in 15 days mtfn was utterly degraded however its metabolite was not so a double dealkylation was suggested as a possible route of guanylurea decomposition 168 briones et al 13 employed glucose as a co substrate to enhance cultures with certain mtfn degraders and their metabolites it achieved 25 degradation after 19 days using guanylurea as a single substrate notwithstanding with glucose contents in the culture medium it wholly degraded after only 12 days this result indicates that microbes only used compost as a source of nitrogen when readily biodegradable carbon was lacking 13 therefore by adding adsorption as a sequential step it would be secured that all byproducts generated were removed from the treated effluent cui and schrÃ¶der 164 evaluated the efficiency of mtfn removal by typha latifolia exploring the context of phytoremediation after one month the maximum efficiency was 81 164 moogouei et al used arid and semiarid plants h annuus reaching a maximum removal of 69 169 therefore biological treatments can efficiently remove mtfn especially in aerobic conditions with rapid degradation in station sequencing batch reactors are more efficient under anaerobic conditions leading to slower and often incomplete drug degradation however one negative point is that many of these treatments were inefficient for the metabolite guanylurea 164 169 often found in water resources as previously discussed in the introductory sections again if adsorption were employed as a sequential step the byproducts and the unpleasant odors typical of phytoremediation processes would also be removed through flocculation mohd amin et al 170 removed 70 of various drugs using a mixture of clay with biodegradable polymeric flocculants however mtfn only achieved 21 removal after 60 min 170 despite the low efficiency reported using polymers for mtfn adsorption can become a viable alternative as it has been shown that these materials can be pretty exceptional adsorbents for removing organic pollutants such as dyes 171 for example polymeric carbohydrates obtained from turmeric powder were converted to adsorbents and employed for methylene dye removal the polymers reached an adsorption capacity of 157 33 mg g 1 and the process was well represented by langmuir isotherm the polymer used in addition to its low cost was also highly reusable without significant losses after 7 cycles indicating much more potential yet to be explored for these materials in the field of adsorption 172 regarding mtfn photodegradation recently quintÃ£o et al performed the drug oxidation induced by photocatalysis tio2 uvc and ozonation the mineralization rates varied and there was an accumulation of metabolite concentration 173 carbuloni et al showed that photocatalysis completely removed the drug leaving 4 mg l 1 of the residual drug after degradation with tio2 174 in the study by orsetti et al under uv irradiation it was observed that after 210 min about 67 of the mtfn had been degraded 175 neamÅ£u et al analyzed the degradation of 8 pollutants by photo fenton under uv and simulated light irradiation all compounds oxidation rates increased except for mtfn being persistent with 24 removal after 60 min 176 therefore it is possible to say that the use of conventional catalysts such as tio2 is not adequate for mtfn degradation and novel photocatalysts must be developed in this context the use of combined materials could be interesting to prevent photocorrosion drawbacks as has been demonstrated by you et al 177 as an example of our suggestions made above the study by choi et al 28 investigated the application of adsorption with ac combined with filtration and biological treatment in a wwtp as expected most micropollutants were not significantly influenced by the primary treatment with a removal efficiency below 10 whereas the secondary biological treatment significantly influenced the overall removal rate combining an anaerobic anoxic oxic process followed by a membrane bioreactor process enhanced the removal efficiency remarkably reaching 96 of total removal the removal of more than half of the concentrations of 13 pollutants was reached by the secondary stage of effluent treatment with the exception of mtfn which presented 3 8 removal adsorption employing commercial powdered ac was then employed as a tertiary treatment and an impressive removal efficiency of 90 5 was finally reached for mtfn 28 therefore using adsorption combined with numerous other techniques is auspicious in treating real effluents adding many advantages such as shorter retention times for biological treatment removal of odors from previous stages and secured removal of mtfn s byproducts 8 possibilities and challenges despite works reporting the successful uptake of mtfn many studies need to be explored especially if we consider its high mtfn consumption and increasing release rate into the environment a small list of adsorbents has been tested for mtfn including either classical ac or novel trending materials such as carbon nanotubes or graphene oxide however except for the materials tested to be used as electrochemical sensors or drug carriers the adsorbents designed up until now have not been developed selectively toward mtfn uptake even though some studies investigated the synergistic effect of several compounds very few studies have studied the material s potential in treating large volumes of effluents or even containing several molecules the analysis of competitive adsorption has also been poorly explored even though it is crucial since other compounds can impede mtfn adsorption therefore the development of new and functionalized adsorbents must be reassured seeking a better performance against mixtures of pollutants in addition to better adsorption capacities of the adsorbents discussed in this review it was observed that most require some process with high energy consumption for their production such as pyrolysis for producing even the simplest ac however only the study by bhowmick et al 109 conducted an economic analysis of the adsorbent where it was reported that the cost of producing algae feedstock was reported to range from 445 to 3 711 dollars per dry weight free of ash biomass in tons depending on the different economic scenarios through economic analysis studies in addition to reducing energy consumption and economic gains it is also possible to seek mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and control climate change sustainably always considering the different materials and their peculiarities thus issues such as the cost of preparing the material i e cost analysis and economic feasibility need to be taken into consideration before stating that the material is prone to use under scale up unit operations and not only the efficiencies obtained from using simple water and mtfn mixture under identical control conditions another vital aspect that needs to be investigated is mtfn adsorption in the continuous system over batch mode adsorption given its many advantages for industrial purposes however we found only two works reporting mtfn adsorption in the continuous system with promising results other novel approaches such as artificial neural networks ann could be used to lessen the numerous time consuming experiments needed to enhance the continuous mode however no reports were found at last understanding mtfn adsorption mechanisms and interactions involved in different surfaces is also a less explored field where even statistical physical models have never been used as previously reported the only works found near this field were applying molecular modeling and computational chemistry mainly with dft calculations therefore the combination of simulations quantum modeling and computational approaches is still severely unexplored regarding mftn 9 conclusion mtfn is a pharmaceutical compound on the rise especially considering that its use is indicated for the treatment of diabetes a disease with alarmingly increasing diagnoses as the year passes by despite its well established use and pharmacological safety several studies point to risks after unmetabolized excretion that can reach any environmental fate especially aquatic organisms however there is no agreement or consensus on the extent of these effects due to the few studies and investigations published so far in addition as discussed in this manuscript several controversies on its endocrine disrupting effect have emerged with no final answer yet reached despite these limitations studies on adsorption as an efficient alternative for mtfn remediation have started to be published after 2017 even within this short timeframe it is already possible to find a wide range of adsorbents produced from different sources capable of reaching high mtfn removal efficiency in most studies adsorption efficiency increased at ph between 6 and 7 where a positive balance between the surface charges of the adsorbents was reached against the dominant molecular species of mtfn in the solution the freundlich and langmuir models represented most of the isothermal data confirming that adsorption can occur on heterogeneous and homogeneous surfaces the highest adsorption capacities reported were 122 61 96 74 65 01 and 45 5 mg g 1 employing graphene oxide nanoparticles graphene oxide functionalized ac obtained from moringa oleifera seeds and ac obtained from chichÃ¡ do cerrado respectively therefore carbon based materials have shown to be the best alternatives for mtfn removal so far except for only one study all the adsorption processes reported were favorable at the lowest temperature studied indicating a process of exothermic nature represented through electrostatic interactions Ï Ï stacking and h bonding the pseudo second order model better represented the kinetic data where most adsorbents could reach equilibrium in 160 min as previously stated even though the efforts made in this field of research are recent it was already possible to find studies that approached scale up prospects reaching removal efficiencies as high as 97 for simulated effluents with mtfn organic and inorganic compounds surprisingly the reuse and recycling of the proposed adsorbents were also investigated in most of the analyzed studies detailed work on the regeneration time needed was carried out and most materials could keep their removal capacity above 66 while varying between 3 and 6 reuse cycles the eluents used were very diversified for desorption including acids bases and organic solvents nevertheless using naoh was the most successful method especially given that it was efficient even when diluted despite being less attractive thermal regeneration was also efficient and a choice that can be made when eluents are missing or when the same temperature will be set on a shared oven in summary despite the small number of studies on mtfn removal using adsorption it is already possible to see a pattern of behavior revealing that i the chemical equilibrium of the pollutant molecule heavily weighs on the efficiency of the adsorptive process ii carbon based adsorbents achieve higher removal efficiencies and iii mtfn complete removal is quickly reached in most processes which are favorable and exothermic the remaining challenge however lies in embracing novel methodologies and trends such as continuous system adsorption advanced mechanism understanding using quantum calculations economic viability assessments and advanced oxidation processes coupled to adsorption however the resistance to these advances is not an exclusive problem of this topic but of the whole adsorption research community thus we suggest that future studies regarding mtfn adsorption start to incorporate and naturalize such methodologies and advances since their conceptualization step to fill these research gaps and solve unanswered questions

12421,the consumption of the antidiabetic drug metformin mtfn has escalated over the last years due to the worrisome modern sedentary lifestyle since mtfn is not metabolized it reaches several environmental compartments imposing risks to aquatic organisms and possible future public health issues therefore the use of adsorption as a low cost and highly versatile mass transfer process has been proposed for its remediation and environmental control this review presents discusses and compares the efficiencies reached by all adsorbents prepared and employed in mtfn adsorption we carefully addressed the interaction mechanisms adsorption kinetics equilibrium modeling and the most relevant thermodynamic parameters creating a guide of solutions to practical problems by comparing the data on its toxicity and controversial endocrine disrupting effects reported in the literature with self performed quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis it was possible to see that mtfn is indeed adequately classified under the highest toxicity class contrarily to the claims of various studies thus according to the research gaps possibilities and challenges in the field there is much yet to be understood and developed toward mtfn thorough removal by adsorption such as i the need for studies under continuous systems ii mechanism elucidation employing computational tools and

wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction over the last decades the modern sedentary lifestyle is making increasingly usual the consumption of lots of highly processed food high in salt fat and sugar by our society consequently the cases of diseases linked to obesity and bad eating habits such as type ii diabetes have skyrocketed in 2016 for example the world health organization who estimated that 350 million people would be diagnosed with diabetes by 2030 1 however this prediction has already been surpassed by a surplus of almost 112 million people in 2020 2 4 automatically an increase in the consumption of pharmaceutical compounds used for controlling blood sugar levels and diabetes treatment has become inevitable raising public health and environmental concerns about the fate and amounts of such substances after ingestion 5 amongst the many available substances metformin mtfn c4h11n5 has been the most used drug since the late 1950s in the first line treatment of type ii diabetes popularly known as diabetes mellitus 6 its dominance in the market is mainly attributed to its high efficacy and low cost and in addition its use has been reported as an antiviral and anticancer stimulator which is particularly important when treating patients with comorbidities 7 8 moreover recent studies have also found that mtfn attenuates experimental autoimmune arthritis through reciprocal regulation of th17 treg balance and osteoclastogenesis 9 still up to this date mtfn consumption is primarily associated with treating diabetes type ii because over 150 million people consume it annually mtfn is one of the most detected drugs in sewage effluents 10 11 contrarily to several other pharmaceutical compounds mtfn metabolism is not hepatic and over 90 of the original compound is excreted after 24 h 12 still even though the drug is not metabolized by the human body after excretion it undergoes aerobic bacterial degradation and becomes the metabolite guanylurea 13 14 guanylurea is considered highly recalcitrant a problematic compound to degrade 15 both mtfn and guanylurea persist in the aqueous medium and are highly harmful to aquatic and animal organisms as endocrine disruptors 16 especially due to their polarity and high water mobility with low values of the octanol water partition coefficient kow 17 18 given that the us environmental protection agency epa defines endocrine disruptors as agents that interfere with natural hormones responsible for homeostasis reproduction and development behavior in different ways 19 20 mtfn is also included in the list of non traditional endocrine disruptors in the environment ever since several studies have proven the endocrine disrupting effect that mtfn causes in organisms and the environment 21 22 this occurred because in 2012 it was proved that mtfn could be used in treating polycystic ovaries concluding that mtfn can alter self regulating processes and hormonal effects 23 therefore as time goes by more and more problems that can be caused by mtfn and guanylurea presence in the environment are being known and reported raising even more concerns and discussions even though mtfn pollution is heavily associated with its already high and rising consumption the low efficiencies obtained by outdated treatments used in wastewater treatment plants wwtp also contribute to the current and future public health challenges related to its use given the relevance of these potential health risks and the diverse environmental fates of mtfn and its metabolite guanylurea the scientific community has focused on improving several modern remediation techniques aiming at greater efficiency and lower costs 24 25 amongst the successfully proven methods adsorption is the most readily applicable versatile and low cost technique of all 26 27 furthermore adsorption has even been recommended as the most viable and environmentally friendly alternative for mtfn remediation since it has been demonstrated that conventional degradation methods such as chlorination form highly toxic byproducts 28 30 in addition to these advantages varied waste materials can be converted to powerful adsorbents for mtfn and guanylurea removal employing processes with high efficiency and simple design 28 31 which solves two environmental problems at the same time 32 34 however up to this date very few studies on this topic have been conducted despite the significant problem of environmental mtfn pollution in light of these findings we reviewed all reported advances in adsorption technology for effectively removing mtfn and guanylurea from aqueous systems then with the help of an extensively published database we painted a panorama with the studies that detected mtfn in the environment stressing its increased presence in environmental compartments worldwide then we described the damage these substances can cause to the environment and all life forms next we discussed the interaction mechanisms involved and how these processes circle back to each other then after clarifying some controversial effects regarding its toxicity and endocrine disrupting effects we thoroughly presented and analyzed the adsorption data reported for all the adsorbents fabricated and tested for mtfn and guanylurea remediation we especially dedicated entire sections to discussing the main interaction mechanisms observed the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium modeling and the most relevant thermodynamic parameters for each type of process creating a direct guide of solutions to possibly encountered practical problems at last we critically discussed the research gaps possibilities and challenges in the field 2 presence of mtfn in the environment around the world due to the alarming increase in the number of diabetic patients and the inefficiency of wastewater management mtfn has become an emerging pollutant found in water resources in several countries and wwtps effluents 22 for example in the city of enschede holland mtfn was the drug found in the highest concentration in wastewater 64 98 Î¼g l 1 whereas its metabolite guanylurea was detected in effluents at concentrations from 39 to 56 Î¼g l 1 and in surface water at a concentration of 1 8 to 3 9 Î¼g l 1 35 in wwtps in the united states mtfn is amongst the most commonly found drugs which corroborates data from 2013 where mtfn was the 7th most prescribed drug with 72 8 million prescriptions 36 37 as one of the drugs most commonly found in wwtps and surface water mtfn means concentration typically varies from 0 1 to 10 Î¼g l 1 in these compartments 16 35 38 40 however these values can be much higher depending on the region detected in surface water at high concentrations of up to 100 Î¼g l 1 41 for example in effluents from stations located in malaysia the average concentration detected was 34 228 ng l 1 42 6111 ng l 1 in the united kingdom 43 and at concentrations of 58 and 149 Î¼g kg 1 in 6 treatment plants in the united states puget sound 44 the maximum mtfn limits detected in canada were 10 100 ng l 1 in the study by de solla et al 2016 in a river that received sewage effluent 45 while in the united states a concentration of 4308 ng l 1 was found in a river that receives discharges from wwtps 46 in the study by scheurer et al mtfn was detected in higher concentrations than other drugs in several rivers in germany 40 these results agree with data from 2011 where germany alone prescribed 601 million daily doses of mtfn an increase of 3 9 compared to the 578 million prescriptions in 2010 the german rivers elbe and weser accounted for 15 2 kg day 1 and 6 4 kg day 1 daily mtfn loads respectively in the german lake constance used as a source of potable water about 61 ng l 1 of mtfn was detected 16 moreover even higher mtfn concentrations have also been reported in the dutch meuse river basin 600 300 ng l 1 47 in malaysian rivers 42 in subterranean and surface water samples in switzerland 48 and in affluent receiving waters in canada 49 in sweden 50 and austria 51 in conclusion the presence of mtfn in surface water wastewater and drinking water samples makes clear the absence of any degradation and removal process already implemented in typical wwtps that is 100 efficient in table 1 all the data reported by the studies discussed above are presented and summarized between 2012 and 2022 425 research articles were published discussing mtfn occurrence in aquatic environments according to a search performed in the web of science database shown in fig 1 a significant growth in the reports has taken place going from 14 papers in 2012 to 70 papers during the same yearly counting period after 10 years which highlights the relevance that this subject has been gaining also we cannot ignore that in 10 years analytical procedures have been optimized and the knowledge regarding sampling methods heavily influences the final result obtained thus all the details for sample preparation and sampling locations point to contamination tendencies and are also discussed in the follow up paragraphs the earliest report considered in this study was from 2009 by scheurer and co workers whom analyzed the concentration of mtfn in different surface waters in german rivers employing high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms mtfn was detected in all river water samples collected at concentrations ranging from 100 ng l 1 in the rhine river to 1700 ng l 1 in the elbe river from its intricate sampling methodology the authors observed an increase in mtfn concentration over the natural course of the rhine river they have concluded that this tendency indicated that more than one wwtp discharged in this river however for rivers such as neckar and main the increased concentration effect is small and the concentration of mtfn may be more related to the discharge of municipal sewage since the rivers that receive it such as the neckar and elbe that have higher concentrations than those that do not receive sewage such as the danube 40 in 2013 blair and co workers also used hplc ms ms to analyze surface water samples collected at a depth of 5 m and in locations as far as 3 6 km from where the discharge of effluents into lake michigan occurred screening for all the pharmaceutical compounds present in the sample the antidiabetic mtfn was present in most samples being found above the minimum detection limit and in locations up to 3 2 km from the coast the average concentration was higher than 100 ng l 1 equivalent to the average of studies of small rivers and streams in which the antidiabetic was detected in concentrations around 110 ng l 1 in the u s 38 it is possible to notice that it is common for all the studies conducted around this same period between 2009 and 2014 to report mtfn concentrations in the range of ng l 1 with very few exceptions such as reported by oosterhuis et al 35 for surface waters 3 9 Î¼g l 1 in this study despite the higher value according to the authors this value is even lower than expected due to the estimated incomplete consumption of the amounts reported as sold as well as pharmaceutic industries and hospitals not being included in the study 35 in 2012 the use of quadrupole time of flight q tof coupled with ms an even more powerful tool was reported by martÃ­n et al reflecting on the need for higher efficiency in the quantification of low amounts of mtfn in the samples analyzed by then 53 in 2013 however it was already possible to notice an increase in the concentration range of mtfn detected in the samples in the order of Î¼g l 1 as houtman et al reported 47 the authors associated this phenomenon with the higher consumption of mtfn the most prescribed antidiabetic in the countries reached by the waters of the river studied even though its removal in wastewater is considered efficient with 98 removal this efficiency does not mean much if the starting value is so high that it leaves behind remaining amounts in the order of Î¼g l 1 moreover the study by houtman et al 47 reinforces the thesis of scheurer et al 40 on the ubiquity of mtfn in german rivers contrarily to other polluting substances lower limits of detection or quantification were not an intrinsic need for mtfn over the years given the increase observed from ng to Î¼g in most samples investigated for example meador et al analyzed fish tissue and reported a mean concentration of mtfn equal to 27 8 ng g 1 in the samples 52 the values presented by meador et al were slightly higher than the values reported by lubliner et al 44 52 according to xiao et al 69 it is possible to clearly see an increasing trend in mtfn detection frequency in environmental samples analyzed between 2015 and 2018 going from 1 8 to 3 8 the authors also report using gas chromatography gc coupled to ms a much simpler apparatus especially when compared to a q tof analyzer for quantification employing only solid phase extraction and derivatization reactions the successful use of less sensitive techniques without the need for extensive pre concentration methods is again an indication that mtfn must be present in much higher concentrations in the samples then confirmed by the final values of mtfn in wastewater reported between 1 7 Î¼g l 1 to 239 0 Î¼g l 1 69 3 toxicological effects observed and the controversies on mtfn endocrine disrupting effect due to the described mtfn fate and occurrence and its primary aerobic bacterial transformation product guanylurea in the environment several studies investigated the potential poisonous impacts on plants aquatic organisms and animals as a pollutant mtfn s main characteristics are high mobility and easy transformation to recalcitrant secondary metabolites by bacteria in natural compartments it has been observed that mtfn and its associated compounds can bioaccumulate in tissues of aquatic organisms 45 as well as in terrestrial 70 and aquatic plant tissues 71 in amphibians an increase in the contents of isoleucine leucine valine and glutamate was reported 72 in crustaceans an acute and chronic toxicity effect was observed 73 in algae it negatively affected the photosynthesis of chlorophytes 74 and changes in the reproductive system of mussels 75 as in algae the accumulation of the drug in plant tissues affects photosynthesis and consequently its growth and development mainly in the radicular system 17 other effects observed in other studies include alteration of t cells higher vulnerability to viral infection 76 scoliosis and abnormal pigmentation in embryos 73 oxidative stress 77 decreased proliferation behavioral and physical changes 78 morphological changes 3 79 and alteration of the intestinal microbiome and carbohydrate metabolism with an increase in liver glycogen 80 changes in sexual behavior were also reported in mammals such as in rats with a considerable reduction in sperm production and count 81 in addition its exposure in utero can decrease the fetal testicular size in rats and humans associated with a reduction in leydig and sertoli cell populations 82 in bovines it was observed that ovarian granulosa cell cultures decreased steroid production 83 a similar effect has been reported in human ovarian granulosa cell cultures where the drug also reduced basal and insulin stimulated aromatase expression and activity 84 changes in the expression and activity of follicle stimulating hormones have also been observed in humans 85 86 in humans its most attention calling effects were attributed to the observation that mtfn acts as an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex i leading to metabolic encephalopathy with end stage chronic kidney disease and even impaired consciousness and parkinsonism 87 in pregnant women it was observed that mtfn crosses the placenta and can affect fetal metabolism 88 89 in addition to the findings reported by tartarin et al 82 the main effects are again on the development of the reproductive system 90 therefore as reported continuous and undue exposure damage can generate cumulative toxic effects on aquatic organisms humans and animals the endocrine disrupting effect of mtfn has been observed by chance mainly in studies where the primary goal was investigating its toxicity niemuth et al 21 for example observed for the first time the appearance of intersex gonads in already adult males of pimephales promelas exposed to 40 Î¼g l 1 for 4 weeks in addition they also observed a reduction in fertility extended to 84 of the subjects exposed to mtfn in contrast to only 13 observed for the control group 11 even though the endocrine disruption effect of mtfn has been observed by other authors such as crago et al 22 and lee et al 91 in addition to niemuth et al 21 a fuss was raised in the scientific community by sumpter scott and katsiadaki 92 the authors questioned several aspects of the papers such as the experimental design its repeatability the concentration of mtfn used and many others suggesting that all procedures adopted were sub optimal 92 however the authors of the criticism disclosed a conflict of interest by being funded by one of the largest pharmaceutical companies there are other authors investigated a few of these matters in 2021 and 2022 which have addressed the questions raised on the duration and dietary phase of pimephales promelas according to parrott et al no adverse effects were observed on the subjects over a life cycle 93 however they did not test mtfn concentrations as high as niemuth et al 11 21 nevertheless parrott et al did observe a delay in breeding which may or may not be related to hormonal fluctuations 93 on the other hand blackwell et al investigated concentrations of mtfn as high or even higher than niemuth et al 21 and reported that no significant effects related to reproductivity or transcription of endocrine gene were observed 94 their study however was conducted for only 23 days corresponding to approximately only 6 30 of the period of 365 days investigated by niemuth et al 21 and parrott et al 93 in 2019 a series of papers was published in two parts discussing the so called real threat of mtfn and guanylurea in the environment highlighting that none of these compounds should bioaccumulate to fish nor show significant risk to the environment 95 96 these two papers also disclosed conflicts of interest declaring that the authors are employees or consultants of pharmaceutical companies that manufacture develop market and distribute mtfn worldwide however even though these researches are indeed funded we strongly disagree that it should be taken as any sort of confirmation bias since their methodology is anything but correct on the contrary we believe that opposing conversations move science encouraging that some blurred points and doubts be enlightened such as in the case discussed in the last paragraph still it is undeniable that i mtfn use and consumption is exponentially increasing over the years and ii even though some of these effects might not be yet observed in natural compartments they have occurred to some extent in the life forms studied revealing the need for further studies and critical data analysis in light of these discussions we have taken the liberty to further explore the toxicity traits of the mtfn and guanylurea molecules by employing quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis using toxtree 97 we used the simplified molecular input line entry system smiles where mtfn and guanylurea are represented by cn c c n n c n n and c nc o n n n respectively the software applied physicochemical and structural rules to the structures generating a decision tree approach that provides the final cramer class to which the compound belongs 98 the cramer rules classify compounds into different classes i ii or iii going from potentially least to most toxic 99 using the same smiles code we have also conducted a biodegradation and persistence analysis using the structural alerts for reactivity in toxtree start package 97 it is possible to see the cramer decision tree for mtfn and guanylurea toxic hazards in fig 2 a1 and a2 respectively according to the results both mtfn and guanylurea are classified as high toxic hazards belonging to the cramer class iii which means that the structural features in both molecules are often linked to toxicity reached at a threshold toxicological concern up to 90 Î¼g day 1 98 100 in other words according to this classification the threshold for toxicity concern is reaching 1 5 Î¼g per kg of body weight per day however this does not apply to human consumption for example since mtfn s initial dose starts at 500 mg day 1 a dosage is about 6 thousand times higher than the threshold estimates in conclusion extending these predictions to levels other than environmental hazards and aquatic toxicity would be incorrect therefore even though from a structural point of view both molecules are classified under the highest toxicity class a more critical view needs to be taken into consideration as suggested in the works by sumpter et al caldwell et al and straub et al 92 95 96 in fig 2b1 and b2 it is shown the results from the biodegradation and persistence analysis it is possible to see that while mtfn is considered persistent to biodegradation guanylurea is classified as unknown persistence however the fact that mtfn is readily transformed to guanylurea under aerobic bacterial degradation should not be considered controversial this only occurs by a particular type of bacteria that has adapted its metabolism to the substrates available in wwtps pipes trautwein and kÃ¼mmerer 101 showed that mtfn was classified as not readily biodegradable by the results obtained in three tests carried out according to the organisation of economic cooperation and development oecd protocols they have also observed that mtfn degradation to guanylurea only occurs under high bacterial density and even though other transformation products were formed only guanylurea was stable to any photolysis degradation process employed 101 4 mtfn remediation by adsorption and how the variations on the main parameters impact the process efficiency the recent study of adsorption as a viable and effective remediation alternative for mtfn started to be investigated only after 2017 during this period several types of adsorbents have been proposed and investigated including the classical use of activated carbon ac prepared from waste residues as well as zeolites silica based composites and other novel materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes in table 2 it is reported the adsorbents found in the literature alongside to the experimental conditions employed it is possible to observe that some parameters are optimized in all these works revealing their importance therefore after having carefully analyzed the results reported in the literature we have divided this section into three main topics i on the effects caused by the variation of parameters that can be easily altered during the adsorption process such as ph temperature adsorbate dosage and mtfn initial concentration ii on the morphological properties of the adsorbents used including specific surface area ssa pore volume pv pore diameter pd and point of zero charge ph pzc iii the results obtained as a product of the combination between operational conditions and adsorbent morphology such as optimal contact time best fit kinetic model best fit equilibrium isotherm model and maximum adsorption capacity obtained q max and the thermodynamics of the adsorption process 4 1 on the effects of variables that can be easily altered the ph of the solution greatly influences the adsorption capacity of a given adsorbent as it can influence the degree of ionization of the adsorbate and the properties and functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent 120 mtfn has two pk a values corresponding to the interconversions of the biprotonated monoprotonated forms at ph 2 8 pk a 1 and monoprotonated neutral forms at ph 11 6 pk a 2 most adsorption studies report that the maximum adsorption capacity of mtfn occurs between ph 6 and 7 which is approximately in the middle between the opposite pk a values according to the information provided by the pk a the monoprotonated forms can indeed increase within this range but will only decrease at much higher ph values this indicates that as the monoprotonated mtfn molecules outnumbers the other molecular forms in the solution while self repulsion effects inhibit mtfn diffusion decreasing its attraction to the surface of the adsorbent moreover according to zhu et al the changes in the amount of the monoprotonated form can also lead to a decline in mtfn s electron accepting capacity and weaker physical interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 113 it is essential therefore to note that the results and behaviors observed are also related to the charges present on the surface of the adsorbents which are ruled according to the point of zero charge ph pzc of the material determined under different ph values most adsorbents used were carbon based in the abovementioned cases where higher efficiency was obtained between ph 6 and 7 contrarily in the studies that observed better efficiency under more basic ph values between ph 8 and 12 the adsorbents were either zeolite or hydrogels thus the authors attributed the variations in the optimal ph pattern to the ph pzc estimated for the adsorbent used note that mtfn is in its cationic form at ph pk a 2 and neutral when ph pk a 2 therefore when ph ph pzc the surface of the adsorbent was negatively charged attracting the positive charges of mtfn favoring adsorption under conditions where ph ph pzc electrostatic repulsion possibly occurred and impacted the overall low efficiency under these conditions the same explanation is valid for the study that obtained a better adsorption capacity under more acidic conditions specifically at ph 4 again it was possible to attribute a heavier weight to the influence caused by the surface characteristics of the adsorbent which consisted of acid treated clay 119 after acid treatment the surfaces tend to become negatively charged benefiting positively charged molecules adsorption the only study with very distinct results was carried out by spessato et al 104 where a better adsorption capacity was obtained at ph 13 using an ac based adsorbent varying highly from the pattern observed between ph 6 and 7 for carbon based materials the authors claimed that in this case mtfn molecules are less solvated facilitating mobility and increasing diffusivity within the adsorbent s micropores 104 the adsorbent dosage is another critical variable that can be easily adjusted throughout the experiments however it was observed that not all studies presented tests for this parameter only fixing an optimal dosage for the experiments which can result from a limitation implied by low yields in the production of the material used in general it is observed that the adsorption capacity increases as the adsorbent dosage also increases and this is related to the increase in surface sites available for adsorbate molecules thus investigating the relationship between removal efficiency and adsorbent dosage can be very helpful in establishing the lowest adsorbent dosage possibly needed to remove a certain amount of pollutant a very effective way to determine the optimal amount has been proposed by kerkhoff et al suggesting the use of double y axis plots of the data on pollutant removal efficiency versus adsorption capacity where the intersection point of the curves is the maximal dosage needed prior to no further significant enhancing effects be observed 121 it is also important to point out that in many cases the use of dosages higher than the effects needed can inhibit adsorption through self aggregation and hinder pore accessibility due to particle agglomeration thus even though it is found acceptable in most studies to use 1 g l 1 of adsorbent dosage this can be very prejudicial to the process and to the success of the research than spending another few days or weeks investigating this variable at last the variations in mtfn initial concentration c 0 were investigated within the mg l 1 range varying from c 0 1 to c 0 700 mg l 1 the general trend observed in most adsorption studies was also observed for mtfn i e the increase in mtfn concentration increases the adsorption capacity q max mg g 1 as a response most studies used 5 different concentrations during their isothermal studies reporting the same trend of increase in adsorption capacities followed by a plateau that indicated the saturation limit since adsorption is a mass transfer process limitations always appear between the bulk and solid phases but still at the liquid film according to igwegbe et al and eletta et al this comportment is linked to the enhancement in the driving force of mass transfer of adsorbate molecules and it falls within the same category of the effects caused by the higher mobility of the adsorbate which can begin with higher mechanical agitation or higher temperature for example 31 122 4 2 on the morphological properties of the adsorbents produced for mtfn uptake the ssa is the most critical adsorbent property that can influence the sorption capacity therefore the ssa is directly related to the adsorption performance still not all studies investigating mtfn adsorption presented the ssa value of the adsorbents used however even within the low amount of data collected it is possible to observe that despite some materials having a low surface area the q max value obtained was high for example in the study by mahmoud et al 110 with an adsorbent with an ssa of only 8 82 m2 g 1 the q max was calculated to be 30 3 mg g 1 for c 0 in the range of 15 to 20 mg l 1 according to the isotherm fitting the adsorption occurred in the monolayer therefore the only plausible explanation is that this adsorbent was nanosized and its surface was highly functionalized therefore a much larger number of particles with increased adsorption sites was available in the solution 110 also as demonstrated in other studies functionalization is a crucial detail in optimizing many materials for adsorption efficiency 123 125 elamin et al also obtained similar results by employing an adsorbent with an ssa of 11 49 m2 g 1 and reaching a q max value of 30 5 mg g 1 within the c 0 range between 1 and 20 mg l 1 119 the largest ssa of 1889 m2 g 1 was reported by spessato et al 104 followed by an adsorbent with 1273 6 m2 g 1 reported by quesada et al 103 while the first reached a q max value of 103 83 mg g 1 within the c 0 range between 25 and 900 mg l 1 the latter reached a q max value of 45 5 mg g 1 within the c 0 range between 10 and 500 mg l 1 mg g 1 high ssa however does not mean the most outstanding efficiency especially if the dosage is not well adjusted to the optimal lowest amount for example zhu et al 113 and balasubramani et al 112 obtained q max values of 96 748 and 122 61 mg g 1 nearly as high as those obtained by spessato et al 104 and quesada et al 103 employing adsorbents with at least 6 80 times less ssa available curiously zhu et al 113 and balasubramani et al 112 also used lower adsorbent dosages of 0 150 and 0 126 g l 1 respectively while quesada et al 103 employed the standard amount of 1 g l 1 therefore it is possible to conclude that even though the ssa plays an indisputable role in adsorption efficiency it does not always nor by itself determine whether the adsorbent will have high removal efficiency in addition to the ssa other morphological factors such as pore diameter pore volume phpzc adsorbent functional groups and hydrophobicity will influence on the q max 126 another critical factor is that the pore distribution may affect the overall adsorption rate depending on the size of the pore the internal mass transfer is increased or diminished accordingly other easily controllable parameters such as those discussed in the previous section can influence surface charges and chemical equilibrium and must be considered 4 3 on the resultant representations of the mass transfer phenomena and the thermodynamic process aspects 4 3 1 effect of temperature and best fit isothermal model it is known that temperature strongly influences adsorption affecting adsorbate mobility and the interface adsorbate adsorbent these effects will consequently determine the fitting of the equilibrium data to isotherm models also reflecting on the estimation of critical parameters such as affinity constants and capacities as well as on the estimations of the thermodynamic parameters 127 128 in other words even though the temperature is indeed an easily alterable parameter it could not have been discussed in section 4 1 because it is intrinsically related to the isothermal behavior as the name already suggests the information obtained through isotherms assays is vital going from confirming the porosity of solids revealing if the adsorbate adsorbent interactions take place in mono or multilayers and up to a point where such information can make easier the industrial adsorption processes planning 129 130 at this moment where we have already established the importance of temperature to adsorption efficiency we would like to highlight the importance of carefully providing accurate data on room temperature as can be observed in table 2 even though not all works investigated the variation of temperature in the adsorption studies of mtfn under simple batch experiments the mean values reported vary between 298 and 288 k except for one study that reported its higher efficiency at 318 k most studies reported good adsorption efficiencies at the so called room temperature being favorable for application in systems that require none or little supply of thermal energy reducing operational costs still even though room temperature is known to be 298 k this value must be explicitly reported suppose we carefully reflect on the actual information provided by the reports on efficiency according to the temperature in that case we can conclude that most processes are exothermic according to the predominance of disadvantaged processes with the increase in temperature in the system in addition to the magnetic carbon composite developed by Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 only ac produced by kalumpha et al 102 spessato et al 104 jimoh et al 105 and mohammad et al 108 was shown to be endothermic which could only be confirmed by the thermodynamic study usually adsorption studies relate the enhancements at high temperatures to increase the adsorbate molecule s solubility however in most studies the c 0 used is far from saturation especially if the solution was adequately prepared and homogenized this behavior actually is more heavily linked to the morphological properties of the adsorbent used given that as discussed the ssa and the pore parameters will rule diffusion and how the thermal agitation of the adsorbate will influence the overall process as also presented in table 2 either the freundlich or the langmuir isotherm models better represented the adsorption behavior of most adsorbents against mtfn uptake the freundlich model was more representative of the processes carried out using graphene oxide 113 three different biochars 103 106 109 acid treated clay 119 and cellulose based hydrogel 116 the materials differed significantly in ssa and ph pzc and the only possible similarity between them is their possibly highly heterogeneous surface resultant from the synthetic procedure employed or as a consequence of some particularity of the feedstock used as precursor the langmuir isotherm model on other hand represented better mtfn adsorption for adsorbents with smaller particle size and similar ph pzc confirming that the adsorbate molecules are well distributed in monolayer form at near neutral ph 102 110 114 115 117 thus it is possible to say that the mtfn molecule contributes to the adsorption mechanism as much as the adsorbent given that it has been observed for example that smaller ions such as cs follow langmuir isotherm not freundlich on similar cellulose based adsorbents 131 132 in the study by alnajjar et al mtfn adsorption onto silica alumina composite followed the sips isotherm 118 the good sorption capacity was obtained because the optimal ph was set at 9 very close to mtfn s second pk a value even though only work used a silica based material for mtfn removal its use is very promising for the removal of other contaminants such as the potentially toxic metal ions cu ii 133 134 cd ii 135 137 pd ii 138 cs i 139 and pb ii 140 one of the advantages of silica based materials is their high sensitivity which can be selectively expanded and functionalized toward the removal of other contaminants from wastewater samples 141 142 finally the two studies by balasubramani et al 111 112 employing two different types of graphene oxide presented a good fit to the weber van vliet and fritz schlunder v models 111 112 which are non linearized models with four and parameters respectively the weber van vliet and fritz schlunder v models can significantly represent heterogeneous equilibrium data within a wide range of solute concentrations limited by being reduced to freundlich or langmuir isotherms at extreme conditions over the years these types of isotherms have been growing over the use of classical ones precisely because they can provide much more information on the interaction mechanisms another important aspect is the increased use of naturally non linearized isothermal models meaning that the days where data was forced to be linear by c t q t relations are finally being left behind sadly studies that linearize the data are still observed as in the case of the studies by adel niaei rostamizadeh 117 and mahmoud et al 110 4 3 2 thermodynamic parameters through thermodynamic investigations it is possible to determine several vital functions such as gibbs free energy g enthalpy h and entropy s with precision these variables are important because they allow us to extend further the predictions made regarding adsorption performance and mechanism being essential for the characterization and optimization of the process while also providing information on whether the adsorption process is spontaneous 143 144 estimating the variations in thermodynamic parameters is done accordingly to the best fit isotherm model by employing several adjusted equations resulting in the final g h and s values in kj mol 1 kj mol 1 and j mol 1 k 1 units respectively not all work reporting on mtfn adsorption determined the thermodynamic parameters however a significant number of studies reported the nature of the adsorption process as exothermic based only on the efficiencies obtained at a temperature set between 288 k and 298 k this is highly mistaken because the lack of comparison within a broader temperature range can lead to wrongful assumptions for example as shown by nguyen et al only after estimating the thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures were they able to find that their adsorption process was endothermic favored at 323 k contrarily to the conclusions made only considering the results obtained in batch experiments at 298 k 145 from the studies that conducted a thorough thermodynamic investigation it was possible to observe that g was 0 and that g value decreased as the temperature increased these studies also showed coherent h 0 values confirming the exothermic nature of the process in these cases the affinity k aff between adsorbate molecules and the adsorbent was higher at the lowest temperatures studied where lesser thermal agitation effects took place confirming that the adsorption occurs spontaneously and without interference from external forces 146 as reported in the previous section only the study by kalumpha et al 2019 reported mtfn adsorption of endothermic nature however the maximum temperature analyzed was 293 k 102 last most studies reported s 0 indicating a characteristic increase in solid solution interface randomness 147 4 3 3 contact time obtaining the optimal contact time directly affects the adsorption processes by altering the kinetic projection and to what extent the mass transfer phenomena will occur for most adsorbents reported the saturation time takes longer than 300 min to reach because i the adsorbate molecules are slow to occupy all available places on the surface of the adsorbent or ii the mass transfer is not very efficient in table 3 it is presented the mtfn adsorption studies that carried out kinetic investigations and which model their data best fit it is possible to see that the contact time needed equilibrium to be reached much shorter usually occurring at 160 min or even less corresponding to a fast diffusion of course much slower adsorption processes were also reported such as in the cases of balasubramani et al 112 and cusioli et al 114 who reported the need for 25 000 and 720 min respectively for their adsorbents to reach saturation kinetic time differences are directly related to the characteristics of adsorbents such as ssa pv and pd especially in the case of mtfn as shown in table 3 in order to determine the kinetic model that best fits the data the statistical adjustment coefficients r2 r2 adj are and msr were considered the data collected by most studies fit better with the pseudo second order model with high correlation coefficients and low are and msr this kinetic model suggests a more complex process of diffusion reinforcing the hypothesis that the surface of these adsorbents tends to be more heterogeneous than homogeneous a result that would be in agreement with the discussions in the previous section where it was shown that most isotherms were better fit to the freundlich model zhu et al 113 suggested that the adsorption mechanism could be chemisorption due to the better fit to the pseudo second order model however after determining the thermodynamic parameters it was confirmed that the interactions were of physical nature where Ï Ï interactions and hydrogen bonds are predominant in the process furthermore studies better suited to the pseudo first order kinetic model and weber was also presented however the study by faleh and radhy 116 despite performing kinetic studies did not fit the data to mathematical models 5 mtfn adsorption mechanisms sadly not all works discussed in the previous sections provided clear information about the interactions on the surface of the adsorbent and mtfn molecules therefore the 8 studies that indeed proposed mechanisms are presented in table 4 all pointing to electrostatic and physical nature interactions varying from hydrogen bonding to Ï Ï interactions except for one work that pointed to chemisorption the importance of studying adsorption mechanisms relies on the forecasting to up scale and on the thorough understanding and validation of previous results allowing the data to be interpreted most accurately for example in the study by balasubramani et al 112 the authors initially suggested chemisorption due to the pseudo second order kinetic best fit however after further investigating into the adsorption mechanism from a thermodynamic point of view they estimated g to be 40 kj mol 1 and confirmed the predominance of Ï Ï interactions 112 in the study by Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 however the authors observed through ft ir analysis that feo peaks present in the carbon nanotube significantly decreased after adsorption moreover in addition to feo peaks the co elongation and oh curvature peaks showed decreased intensities in the spectra therefore the authors assumed a link between the adsorbate and mtfn was formed through its nh2 functional groups 115 still it is noteworthy that thermodynamic studies were not carried out to prove whether the interactions are chemical and even though it is helpful and enlightening an analysis using only ft ir peaks is not enough 115 as discussed previously mtfn is a large molecule with two broad pk a values and its charges over the ph range will determine the nature of the interactions that will occur between it and the surface of the adsorbent it is also vital to highlight the adsorbent s nature and the adsorbent s interactions with the adsorbate therefore the functional groups determined in the ft ir spectra the ph pzc the morphological characteristics help us understand the adsorption mechanism between the adsorbate and the adsorbent as summarized in fig 3 if we analyze the studies involving adsorption we will observe that practically in all cases the reaction is physical since for a chemical interaction to occur the Î´g must have a magnitude 40 kj mol 1 in the case of most interactions reported the magnitude of Î´g is 40 kj mol 1 as in studies involving mtfn 148 149 in these cases desorption is facilitated and can occur in distilled water or organic solvents these are capable of desorbing the mtfn from the surface of the adsorbent whereas in cases of chemosorption desorption is more complicated requiring the addition of a strong acid or base generating more pollutants and economic costs 5 1 taking over computational approaches and quantum modeling for further understanding of mtfn interaction mechanisms molecular modeling and computational chemistry have provided exciting drug design tools for over a century however its use for describing drug delivery interaction is almost as recent as in mechanism interpretations 150 151 which has only expanded toward understanding adsorption processes in the last years 152 in addition to the already used phenomenological modeling quantum mechanical calculations have become an effective combined approach mainly using density functional theory dft 127 128 153 dft allows predicting the properties and behavior of many chemical compounds at a molecular level by determining several chemical descriptors electronic properties and structural data such as optimized geometries 154 these parameters are constructive in understanding how the adsorbate molecule interacts with the surface of the adsorbent as much as it is an effective drug delivery prediction tool several authors have evaluated the mechanisms behind mtfn adsorption through the dft perspective ibarra rodrÃ­guez sÃ¡nchez 155 used this approach on graphitic carbon nitride functionalized with metals from groups 1 2 and 3 li na k be mg ca b al and ga it was observed that graphitic carbon nitride gc3n4 has properties to adsorb ions in the central cavity and that mtfn is physically adsorbed with considerable adsorption energy values based on the adsorption energy values the molecules are strongly physisorbed in some prepared adsorbents due to higher oxidation states of the metal used i e 2 and 3 the natural bond orbital analysis nbo program indicated that the donor orbitals belong to the nitrogen atoms of mtfn while the acceptors n belong to the metal atoms the result of the quantum calculations pointed to m gc3n4 adsorbent as the most stable produced material to be used as an mtfn carrier while the compounds m gc3n4 2 and m gc3n4 3 can be used in drug detection sensors 155 ghasemi et al 156 analyzed the adsorption behavior and detection of mtfn on external surfaces of doped pure boron nitride bn fullerenes by using a different dft d approach through the corrected generalized gradient approximation perdew wang 91 pw91 d functions the authors also used the conventional becke 3 parameter lee yang parr b3lyp d function for comparison according to their results the nh2 and nh groups of mtfn depending on the ph can chemically adsorb on the pure and doped boron nitride fullerenes furthermore the binding energy and dipole moment determinations showed that the electronic properties of fullerenes doped with gab11n12 have changed less remarkably contrary to those doped with ge and si analogs the authors also observed that water a polar solvent increased the adsorption energy under all circumstances helping simulate a body like environment 156 in the study by spessato et al 104 the adsorption of a mixture of mtfn with the dye rhodamine b was investigated by employing dft calculations and the results were compared against the results obtained by the conventional isotherm modeling in this case even though the authors used the right approach they compared the values obtained for the molecules studied as if they were analyzing the band gap variations for metal catalysts even calling the molecules conductors or insulators despite this misconception the obtained values confirmed that the dye studied was a better electron donor than mtfn after investigating and comparing their differences in their homo and lumo regions however the authors did not explain in detail how the estimated chemical hardness and electrophilicity of the molecules influenced their interactions with the adsorbent surface even though they had the results they simply projected that the surface of activated carbon not the molecules modeled tends to have a greater preference for adsorbing the dye molecules over mtfn which can simply be deduced by knowing the surface charges and the chemical equilibria of the molecules 104 anota and cocoletzi 157 used a purely computational approach to investigate the interactions between mtfn and single walls nanotubes functionalized with boron nitride studying six different approximations of the mtfn molecule to the surface according to their theoretical results mtfn is adsorbed by interacting with nh2 groups present at the end of the carbon nanotubes and during the interaction the system s polarity is increased indicating possible dispersion and solubility added to this there was an increase in the chemical reactivity of the order while the solvation in water maintains the semiconductor characteristics of the nanotube and the mtfn 157 in addition to intrinsic interaction and mechanism elucidations investigations of the effects caused by heteroatom doping have been carried out in the study by hoseininezhad namin et al 158 it was verified that the addition of al and si atoms to carbon nanotubes could change the type and strength of the interactions up to a point where it shifts from physisorption to chemisorption the authors also verified that the si doped nanotubes 1 46 and 1 40 ev in states i and ii respectively presented a greater change in the energy gap than the al doped one 1 52 ev under both states allowing it to be more sensitive toward mtfn presence therefore the si doped nanotube can be a reliable drug delivery system 158 finally the study by kamali et al 159 analyzed mtfn interaction with various nanoclusters c60 c48 sic59 sic47 gec59 and gec47 poor sensitivity and low adsorption have been reported for nanoclusters c60 and c48 with their calculated adsorption energies being 0 43 and 2 10 kj mol 1 respectively although the adsorption energy in sic59 sic47 gec59 and gec47 indicated strong adsorption the sensitivity only increased in sic59 where a short recovery time was predicted 159 6 going further than the lab expansion to simulated effluents desorption processes for reuse and continued flow systems in the previous sections we have demonstrated how the fluctuations of several key parameters affect adsorption efficiency for mtfn removal and how successful the adsorbents developed for this purpose have been the expressive results obtained for the adsorption of mtfn in simple aqueous solutions show the high potential of these adsorbents for the treatment of water and sewage however in real water and environmental matrices numerous contaminants are mixed and their synergy can result in competition effects that can change adsorption mechanisms and removal efficiency thus it is also necessary to investigate how these materials behave under such adverse conditions before they are considered for scale up applications gladly a few previously discussed works carried out studies considering actual environmental conditions for the mixture of mtfn and other compounds analyzing the capacity of the adsorbent developed in the study and the conventional batch assays in the study by quesada et al 103 where ac prepared from chichÃ¡ do cerrado fruit shells was employed it was observed that the adsorbent could remove both metal ions and mtfn reaching a removal efficiency of over 60 however when analyzing the single systems over the removal attained for the binary system a preference of the material to adsorb more cu ii ions than mtfn was noted 103 since metal adsorption usually involves several types of mechanisms including complexation the characterization analysis indicated a decrease in oxygenated groups due to the degradation of the biomass structure which is more intense with activation chemistry therefore this study suggests that complexation may be the main cu ii adsorption mechanism with synergistic effects occurring in the mixture and the adsorbent moreover cu ii ions are much smaller than mtfn therefore its mass transfer occurs faster saturating the adsorption sites available which then become inactive for receiving mtfn moreover huang et al 2016 demonstrated that in a binary mixture of mtfn and cu ii part of the mtfn was adsorbed as a cu ii mtfn 2 complex 160 which could have happened in the study by quesada et al 103 mahmoud et al analyzed the adsorption of mtfn in tap water seawater and wastewater samples reaching removal efficiencies of 87 97 and 92 respectively employing nanobiochar as adsorbent 110 elamin et al investigated the adsorption capacity of complex mixtures of mtfn and other compounds in tap water seawater and groundwater using acid treated clay the results showed removals above 70 with more promising results after desalination of the samples where the efficiencies were above 90 119 contrary results were obtained in the study by zhu et al 113 where the effects of ionic strength using different concentrations of nacl were investigated for graphene oxide as the ionic strength increased mtfn adsorption efficiency decreased in addition the active coefficients associated with its adsorption also decreased demonstrating the limitations imposed on its migration to the surface of the adsorbent by competitive processes also the authors reported that the increase in ionic strength reduced the electrostatic repulsions between the adsorbent particles resulting in aggregation 113 these effects can be easily explained by considering the significant differences between the adsorbent materials as well as that clay contrary to graphene oxide can also adsorb other compounds through an ionic exchange which would result in decreased favorable adsorption sites other studies that investigated the influence of nacl in solution were also carried out employing nanobiochar and carbon based magnetic composite as adsorbents 110 115 Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 observed the same trend as zhu et al 113 reporting that increasing the salt concentration from 0 01 to 0 1 mol l 1 directly affected the adsorption capacity of mtfn which decreased from 6 69 to 3 06 mg g 1 115 mahmoud et al also investigated the influence of other salts such as k2so4 cacl2 and mgso4 in addition to nacl which led to a decrease in mtfn removal from 85 4 to 52 5 46 3 52 8 and 55 7 respectively 110 spessato et al 104 verified the adsorption of the drug in a binary mixture with the dye rhodamine b in the mixture the capacity for mtfn was 103 83 mg g 1 while for the monocomponent system the capacity was 112 54 mg g 1 little affected by the presence of the dye 104 in the study by kalumpha et al 102 the capacity of the zea mays tassel ac adsorbent was tested with real effluent from the pharmaceutical industry the removal reached 94 19 showing the high potential of the material to be used in actual conditions however the authors did not report which other compounds were present besides mtfn 102 therefore due to the complexity of the effluents and the synergistic effects between the compounds and the drug more studies are needed in this field analyzing other compounds mainly other pharmacological molecules still it was possible to observe that ionic strength plays a crucial role in adsorption systems that emulate environmental conditions worsening or improving the efficiency reached depending on the adsorbent 6 1 1 desorption and reuse the regeneration performance of an adsorbent is the major advantage of adsorption over other technologies regarding economic aspects and sustainability for industrial applications therefore just as a high adsorption capacity is essential in a material its regeneration capacity is also necessary a significant number of the studies reported in table 2 successfully performed desorption and reuse tests on the proposed materials for example in the study by balasubramani et al 112 the desorption experiments were carried out using hot water diluted hcl 1 mol l 1 diluted naoh 1 mol l 1 and acetone where it was observed that diluted naoh has greater regeneration capacity than other solvents this occurred because the oh ions replaced the mtfn ions on the surface of the adsorbent it was also observed that the adsorption decreased slightly after each cycle about 8 resulting in an adsorbent that can be reused in up to 5 cycles 112 in the study by zhu et al 113 using 0 2 m naoh as eluent it was observed that the material could also be reused in up to 5 cycles maintaining a capacity of 31 6 mg g 1 113 adel niaei rostamizadeh reported that heating the adsorbent at 550 c for 6 h was efficient in desorption maintaining removal at 92 3 after the first regeneration cycle 117 alnajjar et al also reported that thermal regeneration was efficient maintaining removal at 97 after three cycles 118 Ã§avuÅoÄlu et al 115 performed the desorption with a phosphate buffer solution and reported that after three cycles the removal was kept at 66 115 mahmoud et al used even more a 0 1 mol l 1 solution of hcl as eluent where after 4 cycles the adsorbent maintained an efficiency of 82 110 finally in the study by kalumpha et al diluted hcl 0 2 mol l 1 was used and after 6 cycles the adsorbent maintained 81 5 efficiency 102 therefore adsorbents containing mtfn can be regenerated by employing different and diluted eluents and thermal heating while maintaining structural stability in up to 6 regeneration cycles 6 1 2 mtfn adsorption in a continuous system even though the great majority of the adsorption studies published only consider discontinuous systems i e batch mode it was possible to find 2 works that analyzed mtfn adsorption in continuous i e column systems this type of study and its application is significant especially considering that the application of adsorption on a large scale and for treating large volumes is performed under continuous mode the study by hethnawi et al 161 represented in fig 4 investigated the adsorptive removal of mtfn by amorphous silica alumina composite under various dynamic conditions column adsorption performance was tested at ph 6 and 9 with a flow rate from 2 to 5 ml min 1 a bed height from 1 21 to 3 63 cm and mtfn c 0 from 25 at 75 ml min 1 the results showed better performance in removing mtfn in lower effluent concentration lower flow rate higher ph and higher adsorbent bed height and the axial split scatter kinetic model accurately described the breaking behavior within the column 161 in the study by piai et al 162 the adsorption of several drugs including mtfn was investigated using granular activated carbon in fixed bed filters it was observed however that 3 of the 10 compounds were biodegraded by the biofilm no general effects were observed for the mixture which was highly dependent on the target pollutant the temperature increase for example could either affect positively or negatively depending on the pollutant at a higher concentration in the solution mtfn 30 and hexamethylenetetramine 23 had the lowest removal capacities while diclofenac and benzotriazole reached the highest values 99 162 therefore due to the complexity of the parameters that interfere with adsorption in continuous systems the peculiarities of adsorbents used for this purpose and the lack of studies in this field we strongly suggest that this area be explored in future research so that the knowledge gaps can be filled 7 application of other technologies in mtfn adsorption in addition to adsorption other technologies can be used as supporting coupled techniques in wastewater treatment plants to obtain greater efficiency with lower operational costs as each technology has its advantages and disadvantages in addition to the effluents complexity combining other processes with adsorption will always lead to greater success in the treatment in the case of mtfn biodegradation abiotic degradation and phytoremediation are more commonly observed than other processes in the literature it is possible to find recent studies obtaining good removal results by aerobic and anaerobic routes 101 163 165 a few differences were observed for mtfn and its main metabolite guanylurea such as in the study by tisler zwiener where they observed that metabolite degradation was faster under anaerobic conditions while mtfn was more efficiently degraded under aerobic conditions 166 expressive results have also been obtained such as the ones by janka et al who achieved 100 mtfn removal using a hybrid vertical anaerobic biofilm reactor 167 if combined with adsorption in addition to the possibility of reducing the days needed because not total removal efficiency must be achieved in the first stage the final effluent would even be odorless removing the unappealing remaining scent left by most biological treatments markiewicz et al 168 analyzed the biodegradation of pharmaceutical compounds including mtfn in activated charcoal from sewage sludge in 15 days mtfn was utterly degraded however its metabolite was not so a double dealkylation was suggested as a possible route of guanylurea decomposition 168 briones et al 13 employed glucose as a co substrate to enhance cultures with certain mtfn degraders and their metabolites it achieved 25 degradation after 19 days using guanylurea as a single substrate notwithstanding with glucose contents in the culture medium it wholly degraded after only 12 days this result indicates that microbes only used compost as a source of nitrogen when readily biodegradable carbon was lacking 13 therefore by adding adsorption as a sequential step it would be secured that all byproducts generated were removed from the treated effluent cui and schrÃ¶der 164 evaluated the efficiency of mtfn removal by typha latifolia exploring the context of phytoremediation after one month the maximum efficiency was 81 164 moogouei et al used arid and semiarid plants h annuus reaching a maximum removal of 69 169 therefore biological treatments can efficiently remove mtfn especially in aerobic conditions with rapid degradation in station sequencing batch reactors are more efficient under anaerobic conditions leading to slower and often incomplete drug degradation however one negative point is that many of these treatments were inefficient for the metabolite guanylurea 164 169 often found in water resources as previously discussed in the introductory sections again if adsorption were employed as a sequential step the byproducts and the unpleasant odors typical of phytoremediation processes would also be removed through flocculation mohd amin et al 170 removed 70 of various drugs using a mixture of clay with biodegradable polymeric flocculants however mtfn only achieved 21 removal after 60 min 170 despite the low efficiency reported using polymers for mtfn adsorption can become a viable alternative as it has been shown that these materials can be pretty exceptional adsorbents for removing organic pollutants such as dyes 171 for example polymeric carbohydrates obtained from turmeric powder were converted to adsorbents and employed for methylene dye removal the polymers reached an adsorption capacity of 157 33 mg g 1 and the process was well represented by langmuir isotherm the polymer used in addition to its low cost was also highly reusable without significant losses after 7 cycles indicating much more potential yet to be explored for these materials in the field of adsorption 172 regarding mtfn photodegradation recently quintÃ£o et al performed the drug oxidation induced by photocatalysis tio2 uvc and ozonation the mineralization rates varied and there was an accumulation of metabolite concentration 173 carbuloni et al showed that photocatalysis completely removed the drug leaving 4 mg l 1 of the residual drug after degradation with tio2 174 in the study by orsetti et al under uv irradiation it was observed that after 210 min about 67 of the mtfn had been degraded 175 neamÅ£u et al analyzed the degradation of 8 pollutants by photo fenton under uv and simulated light irradiation all compounds oxidation rates increased except for mtfn being persistent with 24 removal after 60 min 176 therefore it is possible to say that the use of conventional catalysts such as tio2 is not adequate for mtfn degradation and novel photocatalysts must be developed in this context the use of combined materials could be interesting to prevent photocorrosion drawbacks as has been demonstrated by you et al 177 as an example of our suggestions made above the study by choi et al 28 investigated the application of adsorption with ac combined with filtration and biological treatment in a wwtp as expected most micropollutants were not significantly influenced by the primary treatment with a removal efficiency below 10 whereas the secondary biological treatment significantly influenced the overall removal rate combining an anaerobic anoxic oxic process followed by a membrane bioreactor process enhanced the removal efficiency remarkably reaching 96 of total removal the removal of more than half of the concentrations of 13 pollutants was reached by the secondary stage of effluent treatment with the exception of mtfn which presented 3 8 removal adsorption employing commercial powdered ac was then employed as a tertiary treatment and an impressive removal efficiency of 90 5 was finally reached for mtfn 28 therefore using adsorption combined with numerous other techniques is auspicious in treating real effluents adding many advantages such as shorter retention times for biological treatment removal of odors from previous stages and secured removal of mtfn s byproducts 8 possibilities and challenges despite works reporting the successful uptake of mtfn many studies need to be explored especially if we consider its high mtfn consumption and increasing release rate into the environment a small list of adsorbents has been tested for mtfn including either classical ac or novel trending materials such as carbon nanotubes or graphene oxide however except for the materials tested to be used as electrochemical sensors or drug carriers the adsorbents designed up until now have not been developed selectively toward mtfn uptake even though some studies investigated the synergistic effect of several compounds very few studies have studied the material s potential in treating large volumes of effluents or even containing several molecules the analysis of competitive adsorption has also been poorly explored even though it is crucial since other compounds can impede mtfn adsorption therefore the development of new and functionalized adsorbents must be reassured seeking a better performance against mixtures of pollutants in addition to better adsorption capacities of the adsorbents discussed in this review it was observed that most require some process with high energy consumption for their production such as pyrolysis for producing even the simplest ac however only the study by bhowmick et al 109 conducted an economic analysis of the adsorbent where it was reported that the cost of producing algae feedstock was reported to range from 445 to 3 711 dollars per dry weight free of ash biomass in tons depending on the different economic scenarios through economic analysis studies in addition to reducing energy consumption and economic gains it is also possible to seek mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and control climate change sustainably always considering the different materials and their peculiarities thus issues such as the cost of preparing the material i e cost analysis and economic feasibility need to be taken into consideration before stating that the material is prone to use under scale up unit operations and not only the efficiencies obtained from using simple water and mtfn mixture under identical control conditions another vital aspect that needs to be investigated is mtfn adsorption in the continuous system over batch mode adsorption given its many advantages for industrial purposes however we found only two works reporting mtfn adsorption in the continuous system with promising results other novel approaches such as artificial neural networks ann could be used to lessen the numerous time consuming experiments needed to enhance the continuous mode however no reports were found at last understanding mtfn adsorption mechanisms and interactions involved in different surfaces is also a less explored field where even statistical physical models have never been used as previously reported the only works found near this field were applying molecular modeling and computational chemistry mainly with dft calculations therefore the combination of simulations quantum modeling and computational approaches is still severely unexplored regarding mftn 9 conclusion mtfn is a pharmaceutical compound on the rise especially considering that its use is indicated for the treatment of diabetes a disease with alarmingly increasing diagnoses as the year passes by despite its well established use and pharmacological safety several studies point to risks after unmetabolized excretion that can reach any environmental fate especially aquatic organisms however there is no agreement or consensus on the extent of these effects due to the few studies and investigations published so far in addition as discussed in this manuscript several controversies on its endocrine disrupting effect have emerged with no final answer yet reached despite these limitations studies on adsorption as an efficient alternative for mtfn remediation have started to be published after 2017 even within this short timeframe it is already possible to find a wide range of adsorbents produced from different sources capable of reaching high mtfn removal efficiency in most studies adsorption efficiency increased at ph between 6 and 7 where a positive balance between the surface charges of the adsorbents was reached against the dominant molecular species of mtfn in the solution the freundlich and langmuir models represented most of the isothermal data confirming that adsorption can occur on heterogeneous and homogeneous surfaces the highest adsorption capacities reported were 122 61 96 74 65 01 and 45 5 mg g 1 employing graphene oxide nanoparticles graphene oxide functionalized ac obtained from moringa oleifera seeds and ac obtained from chichÃ¡ do cerrado respectively therefore carbon based materials have shown to be the best alternatives for mtfn removal so far except for only one study all the adsorption processes reported were favorable at the lowest temperature studied indicating a process of exothermic nature represented through electrostatic interactions Ï Ï stacking and h bonding the pseudo second order model better represented the kinetic data where most adsorbents could reach equilibrium in 160 min as previously stated even though the efforts made in this field of research are recent it was already possible to find studies that approached scale up prospects reaching removal efficiencies as high as 97 for simulated effluents with mtfn organic and inorganic compounds surprisingly the reuse and recycling of the proposed adsorbents were also investigated in most of the analyzed studies detailed work on the regeneration time needed was carried out and most materials could keep their removal capacity above 66 while varying between 3 and 6 reuse cycles the eluents used were very diversified for desorption including acids bases and organic solvents nevertheless using naoh was the most successful method especially given that it was efficient even when diluted despite being less attractive thermal regeneration was also efficient and a choice that can be made when eluents are missing or when the same temperature will be set on a shared oven in summary despite the small number of studies on mtfn removal using adsorption it is already possible to see a pattern of behavior revealing that i the chemical equilibrium of the pollutant molecule heavily weighs on the efficiency of the adsorptive process ii carbon based adsorbents achieve higher removal efficiencies and iii mtfn complete removal is quickly reached in most processes which are favorable and exothermic the remaining challenge however lies in embracing novel methodologies and trends such as continuous system adsorption advanced mechanism understanding using quantum calculations economic viability assessments and advanced oxidation processes coupled to adsorption however the resistance to these advances is not an exclusive problem of this topic but of the whole adsorption research community thus we suggest that future studies regarding mtfn adsorption start to incorporate and naturalize such methodologies and advances since their conceptualization step to fill these research gaps and solve unanswered questions

12422,in this review we discuss recent advancements in lignin based spherical nanocomposites targeted studies are focused on the overall design and structure functionalization the mechanism of functionalization and the target points and functional groups on the lignin nps surface nanostructures come in various shapes such as spheres cylinders nanostars and nanorods a variety of nanomaterials have distinctive characteristics and must be investigated differently this part focuses on the nanospheres applications in lignin based nanocomposites also we summarized the emerging applications in removing toxic cationic dyes which help in environmental monitoring and protection at the end of the review we analyzed and discussed the possible developments and challenges of lignin based spherical nanocomposites and summarized the impact on industrial production and scientific development keywords lignin nanostructures spherical structures functionalization cationic dyes removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there is a growing interest in biomaterials fabrication because of the rapid development of their applications lignin chitin cellulose starch and peptides are natural polymers plant derivatives or by products of some industrial processes 1 4 the advantages of these materials include their low price and excellent biocompatibility because of their negligible toxicity they are widely used in contrast imaging sensors cleaning and anti corrosion nanoscale and microscale materials can be designed and synthesized from organic and inorganic composites 5 9 for example there are irregular hexagonal spherical cubic and other shaped nanoparticles 10 12 in addition synthesis procedures are essential for further nano biomaterial applications however sol gel and hydrothermal solvothermal spray drying technologies based on microfluidics are rarely used 13 15 various forms of nanomaterials have recently gained much attention such as core shell and hollow structures 16 19 the morphology of solid particles is precise and they exist in various forms including cylinders cubes hexagons pyramids and other irregular shapes 20 however the most common shape of natural materials is spherical with the smallest surface area of all particles 21 22 in addition spherical particles are the functions of their thermal magnetic optical and electrical characteristics 23 25 removing environmental pollutants generated from natural and anthropogenic resources is a major problem and must be urgently managed for public health s well being 26 28 many toxic pollutants enter water bodies including heavy metals and anionic and cationic dyes 29 30 therefore the development and improvement of the existing techniques must be addressed for the purification of water 31 33 spherical materials exhibit unique characteristics such as biocompatibility and small size and can be prepared from waste and renewable materials furthermore it is easy to fabricate spherical nps from novel materials compared to rod shape raspberry shaped and janus materials research on wastewater treatment is needed to remove various pollutants and conserve freshwater sources effectively several wastewater treatment methods have been reported such as ion exchange electrolysis precipitation and reverse osmosis 2 3 however these conventional technologies have not fully addressed existing wastewater treatment issues composite materials have received attention due to their easy functionalization large surface area and chemical accessibility synthetic and biopolymer based composites such as lignin and cellulose based composites are promising for wastewater remediation 31 lignin and polysaccharides are biodegradable easily available and contain functional groups which can facilitate their chemical modification into well engineered adsorbents for wastewater treatment 7 it is evident from the literature that lignin nps and functionalized lignin nanocomposites exhibit excellent removal properties for toxic cationic dyes 34 35 lignin based spherical nanocomposites have exhibited outstanding removal efficiency towards hazardous textile dyes azo dyes and nitrobenzene via adsorption 36 38 and reduction methods 39 42 lignin is the second most abundant biomass from plants after cellulose and it is one of the most crucial sources of natural aromatic based structures worldwide 32 43 the presence of anionic functional groups such as aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl guaiacyl uncondensed and carboxylic groups on the surface of lignin makes lignin nps strongly hydrophilic easily functionalized and reactive scheme 1 44 45 the functionalization of lignin nps improved the removal efficiency of cationic dyes 46 in the last ten years extensive research has been achieved in the fabrication of lignin based functional materials in porous and blended composite forms 47 49 the main promising properties of spherical lignin based composites are easily adjustable superior mechanical and chemical stability large surface areas low cost high adsorption and low chemical toxicity 38 39 in this review we aim to inspire further research on lignin based structures that can meet the growing demand for environmentally friendly applications focusing on removing cationic dyes the review is divided into two parts the first part introduces lignin nanoparticles covering their morphology synthesis structure and properties followed by a discussion on lignin functionalization the second part discusses the application of spherical particles for removing cationic dyes from wastewater as shown in the accompanying scheme the biocompatibility biodegradability and other properties of spherical particles promote low toxicity minimal waste and simple synthesis methods in the final part of the review we highlight the challenges and prospects in this field 2 lignin biopolymer based materials lignin can be obtained from natural sources or living organisms many compounds can be divided into proteins polysaccharides and monomers 50 a literature review of the selected compounds validates a recent increase in the structure of lignin nps and lignin based composites in the last five years the number of publications markedly increased on chitosan cellulose starch and especially lignin studies it is easy to obtain raw lignin materials because they are often presented as a by product or waste it is worth including zen protein which is also studied frequently because it originates from plants such as corn 51 52 lignin nanostructures are available in various sizes and shapes 34 53 54 and their applications and physicochemical properties can be determined from their shapes the spherical shape of biopolymeric particles is particularly interesting and is suitable for environmental and medical applications their spherical morphology is suitable for easy addition or injection into reaction media 55 biopolymers show promising applications in the environment especially for dye removal synthetic polymers have many advantages such as controlled removal high mechanical strength and excellent processing capacity 56 therefore they are widely used in 3d printing 39 but the improvement in environmental awareness has directed researchers to use some of the selected lignin nps in these technologies and microfluidic devices 57 2 1 sources of lignin lignocellulose is available in many forms and lignin forms a strong chemical bond with cellulose in plants cell walls 58 lignin can be synthesized from coumaryl alcohol 59 coniferyl alcohol 60 phenyl propylene 61 and sinapyl alcohol 62 as non conjugated lignin 63 the two main types of lignin are native and technical lignins coir fibers contain the highest amount of lignin at 59 5 among all biomass feedstocks 64 lignin is present in the vascular bundles of plant trunks and branches and exhibits hydrophilic wettability compared to cellulose polysaccharides 65 in addition lignin contributes to water balance and the swelling ability of cells 58 a major source of native lignin is lignin which has a natural structure that has not been modified since it is not available independently 66 67 the biosphere contains about 1850 2400 billion tons of lignocellulose representing one fifth of the total 68 table 1 summarizes different biomass sources of lignin 2 2 spherical morphology of lignin the production of materials of 100 nm particle size is due to development in the field of nanotechnology 78 additionally renewable resources are of the main interest in np extraction due to their promising biodegradability applications which show potential in the various fields of science and technology 79 lignin nps with spherical morphology and controllable size can be synthesized strategically by varying the lignin precursor lignin nps with different morphologies and hydrophobicity can be prepared 80 the morphology of lignin nps can be affected by the synthetic approaches employed for example when prepared by self assembly lignin np aggregates were obtained in the form of hollow nanospheres and spherical shapes it can be attributed to an increase in Ï Ï interaction within the benzene ring resulting from a decrease in the water lignin nps interface area which depends on the lignin np s hydrophobicity furthermore the carboxylic and phenolic groups in lignin nps can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules leading to interface displacement additionally the morphology of lignin can be influenced by the reaction conditions 81 enzymatically hydrolyzed lignin nps of uniform shape and size in the range of 190 nm were prepared using the self assembly method in different ratios of thf h2o solvents 82 the drop wise addition of lignin also affected the morphology of lignin nps tem images of lignin nps are shown in fig 1 which confirm that the particle size increased with the increase in lignin concentration an increase from 0 5 mg l 1 to 2 mg l 1 mass of lignin resulted in a higher yield of nps and an increase in the particle size to 327 nm 82 compared with ethylene glycol thf was found to be a better solvent than ethylene glycol for the preparation of more uniform and spherical lignin nps because of the better solvent exchange interaction of lignin nps with water 83 the tunable surface area and spherical morphology of lignin nps were explained using tem sem images fig 2 a e butylated hydroxytoluene bht of different concentrations affected the morphology of lignin nps at low concentrations no significant changes were observed in the spherical morphology fig 2 b f however if the amount of bht increased a cavity appeared fig 2 c d and g h this hollow structure was formed due to the phase separation between water and thf which formed an emulsion 84 3 preparation of lignin nps the synthesis of lignin nps can be achieved using two approaches 85 i the mechanical approach uses the physical methods of insoluble polymers to obtain narrow particle size but due to the high energy consumption the value of the mechanical method has declined 86 87 ii the chemical approach is used in diverse ways to synthesize lignin nps from the literature lignin and its composites exhibit excellent biodegradability negligible toxicity high stability and low cost 88 therefore lignin and its composites can be employed for drug delivery 79 83 table 2 summarizes the different preparation methods reaction conditions and obtained products recently the modification of lignin materials into well ordered and uniform micromaterials and nanomaterials has received more attention due to the promising properties of controlled morphology and size excellent antioxidant properties and dissolution in polymers therefore many lignin based composites were synthesized from various sources by coupling chemical and physical methods some methods are freeze drying ultrasonication self assembly polymerization acid precipitation interfacial cross linking microbial and enzyme mediated thermal stabilization solvent exchange and co2 antisolvent 50 79 89 90 3 1 chemical aided preparation 3 1 1 self assembly method lignin a paper and pulp industry byproduct that can be obtained from wood is often used to prepare microspheres the self assembly method can prepare lignin microspheres with spherical morphology proper shape and size these microspheres are safe cheap biodegradable and uv resistant 91 in a study by li et al 2019 lignin microspheres were prepared using a mixture of ctab surfactant and nals in water and ethanol the resulting microspheres were applied to encapsulate the photosensitive abamectin pesticide and subsequent half life and release tests demonstrated their effectiveness in removing pesticides and protecting avermectin from photodegradation due to the anti ultraviolet properties of lignin 92 93 tang et al conducted a study using the self assembly method for colloidal sphere preparation utilizing different ctab and nals weight ratios 94 through a series of experiments they determined that the optimal stoichiometric molar ratio and charge neutralization for nals ctab microsphere formation was 2 1 82 w w as estimated by measuring zeta potential and surface tension the researchers also found that water content played a crucial role in forming spherical nals ctab microspheres and adjusting the amount of water during the aggregation process was necessary to ensure the complete development of spherical microspheres 94 it was observed that the concentration of nals ctab in ethanol had an inverse impact on the amount of water required to form spherical microspheres adjusting the water content was crucial to ensure the completion of the aggregation process and the development of spherical microspheres in addition the study conducted by tang et al also aimed to determine the effect of solvent ratio and water content on the size of the particles the results indicated that the size of particles increased with the increase in the ratio of v v h2o etoh while smaller particles were formed when the water content was reduced 89 94 at the maximum water content level the formation of spherical particles stopped at the maximum size however the particle size decreased when the v v h2o etoh ratio was much higher than the maximum moreover the study also evaluated the impact of water addition rate on particle size and it was found that particle size decreased significantly with an increase in water amount fig 3 a c fig 3 d demonstrated that the addition of an excessive amount of water 84 vol led to the formation of a colloidal sphere with higher stability resulting in a decrease in particle size by further quenching the colloidal structures of nals ctab 94 lignin core shell spherical particles were synthesized via self assembly in a study by tortora 95 different kraft lignin solutions and biopolymers were used as cross linkers and high intensity ultrasonic waves were applied in oil water emulsions to create lignin shells various lignin microspheres were prepared using polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether as a cross linker and a 30 hydrogen peroxide solution to demonstrate their potential applications olive oil was combined with coumarin 6 wrapped in lignin and a release test was conducted in sodium dodecyl sulfate dissolved in water while no release of coumarin 6 was observed in water 100 of the drug was released within 60 min in the presence of surfactants the experiments were conducted on chinese hamster ovaries 95 biopolymer based core shell nps were designed and fabricated via ph derived approach and were used for the delivery and encapsulation of curcumin the varied factors of curcumin s physicochemical properties encapsulation composition and release performance were investigated 96 ft ir and xrd analysis techniques confirmed that curcumin was effectively encapsulated the uniform particle size and zeta potential measurements indicated that the core shell nps are stable in different ph values elevated temperatures salt content and storage time the scavenging activity of curcumin against 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl radical was notably improved after the within particle encapsulation process consequently the encapsulation of curcumin within the nals and alginate core shell nps resulted in a prolonged gastrointestinal release time as the thick encapsulation layer increased the repulsion and steric properties among the particles and enhanced the curcumin release 96 li et al 97 prepared porous solid smooth faced single holed and multi holed core shell microspheres from the shoots of the bamboo shell dendrocalamus lactiferous l by controlling the lignin concentration the addition rate of the antisolvent temperature and mixing of useful chemicals in the antisolvent 97 the average size of lignin in microparticles and nanoparticles increased with temperature and lignin concentration however it showed a significant decrease with the increased antisolvent addition rate the morphology of the particles depends on lignin concentration antisolvent dose and added chemicals to the antisolvent the particle size of solid and single holed microspheres ranged from 200 to 400 nm while porous smooth faced and multi holed microsphere spheres were noted from 400 nm to micrometer level 97 these results provide a better understanding of the preparation of lignin microparticles and nanoparticles with unique and diverse shapes and morphologies with promising applications as shown in fig 4 from the results we better understood the preparation of lignin microparticles and nanoparticles with unique and diverse shapes and morphologies with promising applications fig 4 the self assembly method can prepare lignin nanoparticles with a single hole 98 lignin was dissolved in thf then deionized water was added and a hollow capsule was prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis an appropriate amount of water 80 by volume was added to obtain a hollow sphere with high stability after the lignin capsules were formed thf was easily removed from the dialysis solution a significant impact was on the morphology of the lignin capsule by the stirring speed rate of water flow and ph high stirring speed resulted in very narrow particle size and acidic ph generated unstable dispersion hence the particle size was increased fig 5 98 it was also found that the dispersion remained very stable and the particle diameter did not change in the ph range of 3 5 12 98 3 1 2 emulsion polymerization chen et al synthesized core shell lignin structures using microemulsion polymerization and ultrasonic treatment 99 allyl functionalized lignin was prepared by modifying allyl bromide with sodium lignin butyl acetate was used as the oil phase hexadecane as a co stabilizer abn as initiator and trimethylolpropane tris 3 mercapto propionate as a cross linker for the preparation of nanocapsules to check the prepared nanocapsule drug loading and release capability the coumarin 6 dye was added to the oil phase and the drug release was measured at different ph values before the ultrasonic treatment coumarin 6 showed a high release rate at ph 4 0 compared to ph 7 the biopolymer shell at ph 7 behaved as a permeable membrane and released the drug over a longer time 99 hollow shaped lignin nps were fabricated and used as vehicles for delivering the cancer drug doxorubicin dox the hydrophilic dox was encapsulated inside the hydrophobic cavities of the hollow lignin nanoparticles through Ï Ï interactions and hydrogen bonding the prepared hollow nanoparticles showed good cellular uptake and accumulation of the drug in hela cells see fig 6 100 interestingly a self assembly technique was used for preparing the lignin nanoparticles which involved ph changes and solvent displacement approaches this method produced optimized particle sizes with excellent cellular uptake 101 cobalt carbon nps were prepared in a core shell arrangement using the carbonization process at low temperatures lignin oligomers and co no3 2 6h2o were used as precursors 102 for 12 h the mixed precursors were polymerized and the resulting polymer was carbonized in the temperature range of 400 800 c lignin nanoparticles were also prepared in core shell and hollow spherical shapes 103 and the process of esterification was used with methacrylic anhydride to modify lignin microemulsion polymerization and solvent evaporation processes were combined to prepare these nanocarriers to evaluate the drug release ability of lignin capsules the ultraviolet photoactive compound 2 propyl pyridine was added only a small amount of harmful emission of various solid particles was released interestingly the higher biopolymer structures exhibited different release behavior 103 the release rate study showed that considerable release was observed from porous particles however the fastest rate was achieved from core shell structures 103 to obtain lignin with spherical morphology lignin nanoparticles were used as templates 104 various methods are available for formulating spherical lignin nps using biorefinery residue industrial soda base non wood lignin industrial sulfate cork lignin and hardwood for instance microspheres were prepared from sulfate lignin black liquid by emulsion solvent evaporation 104 lignin was acetylated and dissolved in dichloromethane or ethyl acetate ea to prepare pellets the ea soluble portion was separated and dried to collect non acetylated lignin both acetylated biopolymers and the soluble microspheres were prepared under the same reaction conditions 104 the results showed that the type of solvent used significantly impacted the particle size the sizes of the particles obtained with dichloromethane were smaller than those obtained in ea it was also found that only hardwood kraft lignin and non wooden soda lignin a non acetylated biopolymer formed microspheres with spherical shapes 104 polyaniline pani materials have shown promising applications due to their unique properties 105 lignin is one of the useful materials as a precursor for pani and carbon materials to produce an effective adsorbent composite with high stability chemical compatibility and rich in carbon and phenol 105 pani was calcined and pretreated to fabricate a novel lignin carbon pani microwave absorbent fig 7 raman spectroscopy x ray diffraction ft ir tem network analyzer and sem instruments were used to investigate the structural microscopic and microwave absorption performance of the prepared lignin carbon pani sorbents from the optimized results it was confirmed that lignin carbon pani showed 50 96 db of reflection loss 3 09 mm of matching thickness 6 8 10 8 ghz rl 10 db of absorption frequency ranges which covers both x band and c band 106 3 1 3 precipitation method the precipitation method has many advantages such as a fast reaction rate mild reaction conditions low cost and elevated purity level 107 specifically the acid precipitation method is crucial for synthesizing lignin nps 90 frangville et al used two different precipitation methods namely acid precipitation and low sulfonated lignin solvent exchange precipitation to synthesize spherical lignin nps the stability of the prepared lignin nps was observed below ph 5 meanwhile nps prepared using the solvent exchange method exhibited stability over a broad range of ph 107 furthermore the size of lignin nps was influenced by the addition of ethylene glycol eg and hcl after conducting a mechanistic study it was concluded that the lignin particle size was influenced by the concentration of hcl and lignin in eg 108 following the frangville precipitation method homogeneously and well distributed lignin nps were prepared and incorporated into wheat gluten biocomposite at varying concentrations 109 this process significantly improved the biocomposite tensile strength thermal stability and water sensitivity the flash precipitation method was used to study the surface properties of the prepared lignin nps such as the particle nucleation and supersaturation while using the lignin of organosolvent hpl and kraft indulin at 80 the final report indicated that lignin nps prepared using both acid and solvent exchange precipitation methods exhibited high stability over a broad range of ph also indulin at nps are amphiphilic and were found to be more suitable for further functionalization using cationic activities at the same time hpl nps are highly hydrophobic which may be more suitable for organic activities using acid precipitation spherical lignin nps were successfully prepared from rice straw at various concentrations of water ethylene glycol and castor oil 88 the resulting nps with 15 20 nm particle size high thermal stability and spherical surface morphology were obtained in castor oil and ethylene glycol see fig 8 in this process rice straw was dissolved in water ethylene glycol and castor oil and the ph of the solution was kept at 10 lignin nps were prepared via nucleation by lowering the ph by slowly adding hcl solution 90 beisl et al synthesized lignin nps using direct precipitation in which the pretreated extract of poly butylene adipate terephthalate hpl from wheat straw was collected from the biorefinery this method is environmentally friendly as the consumption of solvent was exceptionally low also the morphology of the lignin nps was spherical with a 97 220 nm size range 110 lignin nps in the spherical shape form biodegradable and renewable lignin are easily available and can work as perfect material as building block due to their high water dispersibility biocompatibility and environment friendly nature 111 a sustainable and novel synthesis approach was developed to prepare spherical lignin nps using a binary solvent of a spent Î³ valerolactone and water 200 g l 1 of lignin was collected from various sources and was dissolved in the binary solvent of spent Î³ valerolactone and water followed by the dialysis or dropping method the size of the particles can be controlled during the precipitation process the dropping methods gave about 90 yield of the spherical lignin nps with an initial concentration of 24 g l 1 the dropping method may be scaled up for the large scale production of lignin nps 111 the diameter of the prepared lignin nps was 250 nm while Î¶ potential was 40 mv fig 9 3 2 physical aided synthetic process 3 2 1 microwave assisted techniques the preparation of lignin nps using mechanical routes still requires further investigation the most important mechanical treatment methods are wet and dry milling extensively used to synthesize lignin nps among them the milling at low temperatures of 18 c has been recognized and gives excellent results in forming spherical lignin nps with a particle size of about 10 nm 85 for decades lignin nps were synthesized using microwave assisted techniques for the rapid uniform and spherical shape 112 si et al prepared lignin nps from rice straw through a single step microwave assisted method at a noticeably short processing time 113 rice straw was used as a precursor and mixed with water ethanol solvent followed by acid catalyzed microwave irradiation which generated organic acid and monosaccharide and released some of the lignin a layer by layer lignin nps were formed from dissolved lignin via self assembly from outside to inside using Ï Ï interactions spherical particles of about 100 nm in size and 2 3 nanodots were obtained 113 furthermore the obtained lignin nps also showed low crystallinity with complex structures in the dispersed form the degree of stabilization of lignin nps was influenced by the carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl surface charges which formed a double surface layer 113 114 also the prepared lignin nps showed excellent dispersion stability at broad ph ranges with a double electrical surface layer confirmed by zeta potential values coconut coir is the main source of lignin and three different methods were used formic acid organosolvent naoh and polyethylene glycol to isolate lignin nps 115 dÃ¡vila and co workers reported the process of panamgama using microwave and thermal assisted methods it was noted that the thermal assisted coupled with an alkaline method was more efficient and produced the highest yield compared to the organosolvent process 116 3 2 2 ultrasonication ultrasonication has been an important process for synthesizing lignin nps vis polymerization since the 1950s 117 in this process high frequency waves from 16 to 100 mhz influenced the formation of radicals which penetrated the whole mass of the liquid also the overall ultrasonication process is affected by pressure temperature the type of liquid and operational conditions 118 alkali lignin nps were synthesized from sarkanda grass and wheat straw using an ultrasonication process with some modifications by the sonication of lignin solution for about 1 h a stable and homogeneous nanodispersion with 10 50 nm particle size and light scattering properties was obtained 118 in another study kraft wood lignin was treated for different reaction times such as 2 4 6 and 9 h under ultrasonic waves to prepare lignin nps 119 it was noted that 6 h of reaction time produced uniform lignin particles in the range of 10 to 50 nm but the increase in time led to significant changes in the same study lignin nps 6 h were incorporated with different polyurethane pu polymer concentrations to prepare strong composite materials furthermore the composite of lignin nps 10 wt 6 h pu was compared with slk 10 10 wt pu for thermal and mechanical stability a significant improvement was noted in the thermal stability of nl 10 pu composite due to the non covalent interaction of lignin with the polymer the high surface ratio of lignin nps resulted in a strong interaction between pu and lignin nps 119 with an alkali assisted ultrasonication technique yin and co workers reported the synthesis of lignin nps from switch grass 120 initially lignin was placed in deionized water and then 0 1 m naoh was added under ultrasonication lignin nps were prepared in the range of 200 nm as measured using the light scattering method 4 functionalization of lignin nps the structure origin functionality and chemical modification characteristics influence the reactivity of lignin nps the main limitation of bare lignin nps is their insufficient solubility in an aqueous medium in large scale production the complex molecular structure and associated steric hindrance are the reason for the restriction in the reactivity of lignin nps however many functional groups on the surface make lignin nps more suitable for surface modification and functionalization fig 10 different chemical methods such as carboxy methylation 123 130 esterification 131 132 epoxidation 34 hydroxy methylation 123 130 and oxidation and sulfonation 133 have been used for the modification of surface functional groups the main functional groups in the structure of lignin nps are carbonyl hydroxyl aliphatic and phenolic and guaiacyl uncondensed these functional groups are responsible for converting lignin nps into bio based thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers 134 incorporating lignin nanofiller into the polymeric matrix is convenient since it does not result in chemical modification however the hydroxyl group in lignin nps are more accessible for esterification and etherification 12 135 compared to lignin nps the nano lignin materials have more tendency to interact with polymers due to their high affinity for the composite formation and small size 136 137 in particular the spherical shape of lignin nps is suitable for dispersion in an aqueous solution and remains dispersed for 60 days furthermore ultrasonication ensures homogenous dispersion formation without chemical modification 118 126 138 acid pretreatment alone may not be sufficient to disrupt the recalcitrance derived from softwood lignin and post treatment may be necessary to obtain targeted lignin nps 136 therefore an alkali and acid mixture was used for the pretreatment of lignin nps with polyethylene glycol epoxides peg epoxides successfully developed on the surface of masson pine 136 although removing lignin was limited when using acid alkali combined treatment the yield was remarkably increased to 34 by further hydrolysis it is due to the successfully incorporating hydrophilic polyethylene glycol epoxides peg into the original lignin nps moreover the development of the digestive enzymes varies with the length of the peg chain and this improvement was successfully monitored and investigated in the properties of lignin nps followed by the variation in the water retention values after the in situ peg epoxides modification of lignin nps with different molecular weights 136 the hydroxy methylation reaction was used for the surface functionalization of lignin nps gilca et al 123 xiong et al 98 also reported that amidation salinization and sonication could produce fluorescent lignin nps the reaction of lignin nps and 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane effectively introduces the amino group into the structure of lignin nps which can then react with the 1 pyrene butyric acid pba called amidation to prepare lignin grafted with pyrene group s lignin pba after the sonication step the prepared lignin pba nanocomposites exhibit a spherical surface morphology with a narrow particle size of 95 5 nm 138 lignin nps can be functionalized using tyrosinase enzymes 139 direct encapsulation adsorption and layer by layer deposition were used with the reticulation of glutaraldehyde initially the prepared lignin nps were stable to the activity of tyrosinase enzymes after immobilization with tyrosinase enzymes the functionalized lignin nanocomposites exhibited good catalytic effects in preparing catechol and its derivatives fig 11 lignin nps were chemically functionalized by the steglich esterification of azo dye 2 e 2 hydroxy naphthalene 1 yl diazenyl benzoic acid and then successfully coupled with zinc oxide nps zinc oxide incorporation into the entire structure of functionalized lignin nanocomposite induced beneficial changes in the photo responsive efficiency such as photo stabilization and enhanced light absorption the photoinduced antimicrobial performance was also enhanced 139 another approach is carboxylation in which a carboxyl group incorporates the entire structure of lignin nps therefore before solvent extraction the lignin nps were subjected to carboxylation to add more carboxyl groups and the carboxylate lignin nps can further be conjugated peptides and copolymers 141 setÃ¤lÃ¤ and co workers used tall oil fatty acid in water for the surface functionalization of lignin nps tlnps and the double bond present in tlnp behaved as an excellent modifier in the functionalization of cellulose the prepared tlnps show spherical surface morphology and 140 nm to 160 nm particle size also tlnps effectively make a covalent bond with unmodified and modified cellulose fibers and form an antimicrobial composite 142 the grafting approach is highly effective in functionalizing lignin nps using some micro initiators that help in the polymerization reaction at the surface of lignin nps the application of the functionalized lignin nanocomposite depends on the polymer chain used for grafting also the different surface functionalities make lignin nps suitable for further modification 143 it is important to develop functionalization methods for lignin nps that are environmentally friendly and use simple processing conditions while avoiding harsh chemicals lignin nps are abundant low cost renewable and can be used as starting materials in polymer matrices such as epoxy polyvinyl alcohol and rubber 144 5 lignin based spherical composites for the removal of cationic dyes water remediation and purification approaches promote research to develop sustainable cost effective nanoscale sorbents and various techniques for wastewater treatment 6 functional groups on the surface make lignin nps suitable for surface modification the main functional groups in the structure of lignin nps are carbonyl groups hydroxyl aliphatic and phenolic and guaiacyl groups uncondensed these functional groups are responsible for converting lignin nps to bio based thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers spherical lignin nps and nanocomposites have shown excellent applications in removing toxic cationic dyes because of the ion exchange hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction or Ï Ï stacking fig 12 furthermore the functionalization of lignin nps directly improves the adsorption of different dyes depending on the type of functionalization table 3 summarizes functionalized lignin nps and their applications in removing cationic dyes kraft lignin can be functionalized using esterification 131 demethylation 123 130 hydroxy methylation 145 146 reduction oxidation 33 and sulfonation or sulfuric acid treatment 133 to prepare sulfonated lignin gao et al reported the functionalization of kraft lignin by phenolate followed by sulfonation and developed water soluble sulfonated lignin sap lignin or ssp lignin which showed excellent applications in the adsorption of dyes the prepared sulfonated lignin nps showed an adsorption performance of 90 4 for sap lignin and 72 1 for sp lignin in ethyl violet ev 147 the sulfonation process introduces sulfonated ions making the surface of lignin nps negatively charged and thus more efficient for the adsorption of cationic dyes 148 moreover during the adsorption process sulfonation improves the electrostatic and Ï Ï interactions resulting in expanded conformations of lignin nps li et al used sulfo methylation of kraft lignin na2so3 in an alkaline solution of naoh and epichlorohydrin crosslinking they fabricated new hydrogel type sulfonate lignin that was used to remove cationic dyes the sulfonate lignin showed a removal capacity of 495 4 mg g 1 for mb at 303 k significantly higher than the removal capacity of unmodified kraft lignin 97 22 mg g 1 7 silanization followed by amination was used to fabricate lignin nps in a single step which resulted in a nitrogen content of 6 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane was used for the silanization step 147 the resulting sal exhibited excellent properties including a large surface area chemical and thermal stability resistance to water solvents and an excellent porous structure with an adsorption capacity of 74 4 mg g 1 for congo red dye the removal efficiency was 100 and followed the langmuir adsorption model co solvents enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation celf method was developed by meng and co workers in which they combined celf with mannish transformation and prepared amino lignin nps for the removal of mb and direct blue db dyes from wastewater 149 the aminated lignin celf showed spherical morphology and 90 adsorption of direct blue 1 db 1 the material could be reused three times redox mediator materials exhibited promising biodegradation performance and the ability to remove azo dyes from wastewater rm materials derived from lignin nps and prepared using peroxidation were used for the adsorption of azo dyes from different biorefineries 150 ft ir gc ms electron paramagnetic resonance and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize rm materials and hplc was used to characterize the metabolites the removal efficiency of mb dye was improved using peroxidation to 20 95 in the optimized time of 12 h furthermore the product from the peroxidation of syringe aldehyde increased the removal efficiency from 40 to 85 in 24 h the azo dye removal for the two tested redox mediators followed the model of zero order and first order kinetics 150 palladium calcium lignosulfonates pd cls were fabricated using a series of laser assisted techniques using 30 w and 1064 nm light the calcium lignosulfonate cls was effectively decorated with pd nps the prepared pd cls lignosulfonates were evaluated for removing mb and 4 nitrophenol 4 np from wastewater 39 tem images revealed uniform decoration of particles on the surface of cls under optimized conditions 2 5 mm in 25 ml 4 np was removed from the aqueous solution in 1 min at ph 7 0 3 0 mg of the prepared pd cls was used to remove 3 1 10 5 m mb in 25 ml solution the material showed 90 removal efficiency and could be reusable up to eight times 39 the freeze drying method was used to fabricate and carbonize lignosulfonate nps ls the carbonized lignin nps cl were used to remove textile effluents fig 13 the lignin nps were characterized before and after carbonization at different temperatures of 600 c 750 c 900 c and 1050 c 151 using sonication the lignosulphonate material was broken down into nps of various diameters and low molecular weight material due to freeze drying and sonication the lignin nps contain different morphologies resulting in plated shapes and high surface area materials that showed excellent adsorption of mb at 109 77 mg g 1 151 spherical lignin based phenolic resin lpr was prepared using the solvothermal hydrothermal method resulting in efficient reducing agents that support the formation of 10 nm silver nps 152 lignin also behaved as a surfactant further reducing the particle size of the phenolic resin to the nanometer range the lpr ag nanocomposite was evaluated for the adsorption of mb and mo dyes with sodium borohydride and the heterostructure lpr ag nanocomposite showed better catalytic performance than the lpr ag prepared using the loading of silver on spherical lpr the negative charges functional groups on the lignin nps in lpr ag nanocomposite adsorbed cationic dyes they showed high adsorption efficiency for mb demonstrating the multi functional applications of lignin nps in both catalysis and adsorption 152 furthermore longer polymeric skeletons and functional groups make lignin a biopolymer sensitive to different temperatures and ph values 153 ahmed et al discussed the affinity of acid synthesized lignin au nps with a particle size of 5 7 nm and lignin ag nps with a particle size of 13 8 nm in addition lignin pd nps with a particle size of 4 5 nm were synthesized in a basic medium to remove yellow dye 145 lignin pd nps showed more removal efficiency than lignin au nps and the least efficient among the three nanocomposites was lignin ag nps 154 the nanostructures synthesized in a basic medium reduced the removal time to half for lignin au nps in 18 34 min and lignin ag nps in 21 87 min while for lignin pd nps it was 1 45 min lignin functioned as multi functional material for complexation binding and reducing stabilizing agents for lignin au lignin ag and lignin pd 154 the integration of porous carbon with lignin nps increased their adsorption efficiency a novel etching sulfonation method was used in which fe3o4 was utilized as a templating agent for a highly selective and efficient adsorbent of sulfonated lignin nps based porous carbon from cornstalk fig 14 a 155 because of the presence of anionic functional groups such as cooh oh and so3h at high density the as synthesized lspc nanocomposites exhibited promising selectivity in removing mb also lspc showed stability in a wide range of ph in the adsorption of mb as the ph increased from 2 to 11 the adsorption of mb increased drastically from 234 19 to 621 52 mg g 1 fig 14 b also lspc can be reused because of its robust regenerated property and high adsorption capacity for cationic dyes 155 another eco friendly alkali lignin based carbonaceous composite was designed and fabricated using hydrothermal and carbonization methods the material was further used for tio2 nps as support in 5 30 nm particle size 156 from the results the carboxylic group on the surface of carbon chemically reacted with the ti center in tio2 the lignin carbonaceous tio2 lc tio2 material was evaluated for its photocatalytic performance for the degradation of phenol and mb under uv visible light the lc tio2 with a thickness of 2 5 nm support exhibited excellent results for the tio2 photocatalytic activity which was improved to 34 8 times for phenol in the visible light and 3 8 times for tio2 without the support lignin carbonaceous material lignin carbonaceous material acted as a support and sensitizer for lc tio2 under uv visible light and its anionic functional groups facilitated the transfer of photo generated electrons resulting in excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol and mb 157 a hierarchical spherical mno2 lignin composite mno2 lnps was prepared to remove dyes from wastewater the nanodots of mno2 were dispersed within lignin nps fig 15 a 158 the as synthesized composite exhibited higher surface area than simple lignin nps and could be reused five times the adsorption efficiency of mno2 lnps was 806 mg g 1 for mb in a short time and about 80 removal was completed in 5 min this high adsorption is due to the anionic functional groups on the surface of lignin nps and the high surface area fig 15 b the dye removal is exothermic and ph responsive 158 alkali treated waste corncob derived lignin was utilized as feedstock for preparing activated carbon and further used for removing mb 159 two methods i e kissinger akahira sunose and flynn wall ozawa were employed to explain the kinetic mechanism of pyrolysis of alkali lignin at various rates of heating which were mostly used for the calculation of various dynamic parameters to minimize the error in the multi step dynamics the possible relation between the lignin structure and activated carbon was successfully investigated in the final preparation of lignin based activated carbon the final lignin based activated carbon exhibited promising properties such as a high surface area of 1215 83 m2 g 77 3 mesoporous portion optimum activation as well as 550 c of activation temperature 120 min of activation and the concentration of phosphoric acid reached 50 158 the mb adsorption process followed a pseudo second order kinetic model with maximum adsorption efficiency of 493 28 mg g 1 more or less 5 mg g 1 which is 99 0 and was the highest in the secondary adsorption fig 16 6 conclusion the main goal of this review is to highlight recent research in biopolymers especially lignin aimed at developing robust and versatile materials with diverse applications after cellulose lignin is the second most abundant biomass from plants and is considered one of the most important sources of various world natural aromatic based structures lignin is a versatile amorphous material that is easy to synthesize using free radical polymerization this review summarizes different separation methods used to extract lignin nps from lignocellulose approximately 95 of the prepared lignin is used for burning and the remaining 5 is used for commercial applications among all the shapes of lignin based nanocomposites the spherical shape is the most studied the applications of lignin materials depend on their morphology and the spherical morphology of lignin materials is desirable for most environmental applications due to their small size therefore we have gathered information on versatile lignin based spherical nanostructures in this review in this context lignin is the most recognized material because of its distinctive structure high volume and outstanding properties the surface of lignin nps contains functional groups that can be utilized for functionalization such as carbonyl hydroxyl aliphatic and phenolic and guaiacyl uncondensed these functional groups facilitate the conversion of lignin nps into biobased thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers the fabrication and functionalization of lignin nps have also led to the synthesis of novel lignin nanocomposites and the prevention of unwanted compound accumulation lignin based spherical nanocomposites with aromatic ligands and amorphous structures exhibit excellent sorption capabilities for cationic dyes toxic metals and organic pollutants the outstanding adsorption capacity of lignin nps and lignin nanocomposites is due to the presence of anionic functional groups which aid in the uptake of the cationic dyes via ion exchange hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction and Ï Ï stacking in conclusion the catalytic adsorption and selectivity performance of lignin nps can be further improved through functionalization fabrication and surface modification 7 future perspectives the utilization of lignin as a sorbent material faces numerous challenges especially regarding modifications required for large scale preparations therefore it is crucial to develop fabrication and functionalization protocols that utilize environmentally friendly reagents and cost effective methods to make lignin an effective biopolymer moreover developing novel standards to investigate different lignin types structures compositions and purity can help reduce the cost of commercialization and increase economic benefits this in turn can increase the market demand for lignin nps and lignin nanocomposites and stimulate research on innovative applications of lignin although substantial research has progressed on lignin nps and lignin nanocomposites with effective sorption applications there is still a necessity for further advances on topics such as i the expansion of environmentally friendly media for easy and low cost preparation extraction and separation of lignin nps from their raw feedstock ii the development of facile routes for functionalizing and fabricating lignin nps with spherical shapes iii the application of various bio wastes in preparing lignin nps

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there is a growing interest in biomaterials fabrication because of the rapid development of their applications lignin chitin cellulose starch and peptides are natural polymers plant derivatives or by products of some industrial processes 1 4 the advantages of these materials include their low price and excellent biocompatibility because of their negligible toxicity they are widely used in contrast imaging sensors cleaning and anti corrosion nanoscale and microscale materials can be designed and synthesized from organic and inorganic composites 5 9 for example there are irregular hexagonal spherical cubic and other shaped nanoparticles 10 12 in addition synthesis procedures are essential for further nano biomaterial applications however sol gel and hydrothermal solvothermal spray drying technologies based on microfluidics are rarely used 13 15 various forms of nanomaterials have recently gained much attention such as core shell and hollow structures 16 19 the morphology of solid particles is precise and they exist in various forms including cylinders cubes hexagons pyramids and other irregular shapes 20 however the most common shape of natural materials is spherical with the smallest surface area of all particles 21 22 in addition spherical particles are the functions of their thermal magnetic optical and electrical characteristics 23 25 removing environmental pollutants generated from natural and anthropogenic resources is a major problem and must be urgently managed for public health s well being 26 28 many toxic pollutants enter water bodies including heavy metals and anionic and cationic dyes 29 30 therefore the development and improvement of the existing techniques must be addressed for the purification of water 31 33 spherical materials exhibit unique characteristics such as biocompatibility and small size and can be prepared from waste and renewable materials furthermore it is easy to fabricate spherical nps from novel materials compared to rod shape raspberry shaped and janus materials research on wastewater treatment is needed to remove various pollutants and conserve freshwater sources effectively several wastewater treatment methods have been reported such as ion exchange electrolysis precipitation and reverse osmosis 2 3 however these conventional technologies have not fully addressed existing wastewater treatment issues composite materials have received attention due to their easy functionalization large surface area and chemical accessibility synthetic and biopolymer based composites such as lignin and cellulose based composites are promising for wastewater remediation 31 lignin and polysaccharides are biodegradable easily available and contain functional groups which can facilitate their chemical modification into well engineered adsorbents for wastewater treatment 7 it is evident from the literature that lignin nps and functionalized lignin nanocomposites exhibit excellent removal properties for toxic cationic dyes 34 35 lignin based spherical nanocomposites have exhibited outstanding removal efficiency towards hazardous textile dyes azo dyes and nitrobenzene via adsorption 36 38 and reduction methods 39 42 lignin is the second most abundant biomass from plants after cellulose and it is one of the most crucial sources of natural aromatic based structures worldwide 32 43 the presence of anionic functional groups such as aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl guaiacyl uncondensed and carboxylic groups on the surface of lignin makes lignin nps strongly hydrophilic easily functionalized and reactive scheme 1 44 45 the functionalization of lignin nps improved the removal efficiency of cationic dyes 46 in the last ten years extensive research has been achieved in the fabrication of lignin based functional materials in porous and blended composite forms 47 49 the main promising properties of spherical lignin based composites are easily adjustable superior mechanical and chemical stability large surface areas low cost high adsorption and low chemical toxicity 38 39 in this review we aim to inspire further research on lignin based structures that can meet the growing demand for environmentally friendly applications focusing on removing cationic dyes the review is divided into two parts the first part introduces lignin nanoparticles covering their morphology synthesis structure and properties followed by a discussion on lignin functionalization the second part discusses the application of spherical particles for removing cationic dyes from wastewater as shown in the accompanying scheme the biocompatibility biodegradability and other properties of spherical particles promote low toxicity minimal waste and simple synthesis methods in the final part of the review we highlight the challenges and prospects in this field 2 lignin biopolymer based materials lignin can be obtained from natural sources or living organisms many compounds can be divided into proteins polysaccharides and monomers 50 a literature review of the selected compounds validates a recent increase in the structure of lignin nps and lignin based composites in the last five years the number of publications markedly increased on chitosan cellulose starch and especially lignin studies it is easy to obtain raw lignin materials because they are often presented as a by product or waste it is worth including zen protein which is also studied frequently because it originates from plants such as corn 51 52 lignin nanostructures are available in various sizes and shapes 34 53 54 and their applications and physicochemical properties can be determined from their shapes the spherical shape of biopolymeric particles is particularly interesting and is suitable for environmental and medical applications their spherical morphology is suitable for easy addition or injection into reaction media 55 biopolymers show promising applications in the environment especially for dye removal synthetic polymers have many advantages such as controlled removal high mechanical strength and excellent processing capacity 56 therefore they are widely used in 3d printing 39 but the improvement in environmental awareness has directed researchers to use some of the selected lignin nps in these technologies and microfluidic devices 57 2 1 sources of lignin lignocellulose is available in many forms and lignin forms a strong chemical bond with cellulose in plants cell walls 58 lignin can be synthesized from coumaryl alcohol 59 coniferyl alcohol 60 phenyl propylene 61 and sinapyl alcohol 62 as non conjugated lignin 63 the two main types of lignin are native and technical lignins coir fibers contain the highest amount of lignin at 59 5 among all biomass feedstocks 64 lignin is present in the vascular bundles of plant trunks and branches and exhibits hydrophilic wettability compared to cellulose polysaccharides 65 in addition lignin contributes to water balance and the swelling ability of cells 58 a major source of native lignin is lignin which has a natural structure that has

different biomass sources of lignin 2 2 spherical morphology of lignin the production of materials of 100 nm particle size is due to development in the field of nanotechnology 78 additionally renewable resources are of the main interest in np extraction due to their promising biodegradability applications which show potential in the various fields of science and technology 79 lignin nps with spherical morphology and controllable size can be synthesized strategically by varying the lignin precursor lignin nps with different morphologies and hydrophobicity can be prepared 80 the morphology of lignin nps can be affected by the synthetic approaches employed for example when prepared by self assembly lignin np aggregates were obtained in the form of hollow nanospheres and spherical shapes it can be attributed to an increase in Ï Ï interaction within the benzene ring resulting from a decrease in the water lignin nps interface area which depends on the lignin np s hydrophobicity furthermore the carboxylic and phenolic groups in lignin nps can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules leading to interface displacement additionally the morphology of lignin can be influenced by the reaction conditions 81 enzymatically hydrolyzed lignin nps of uniform shape and size in the range of 190 nm were prepared using the self assembly method in different ratios of thf h2o solvents 82 the drop wise addition of lignin also affected the morphology of lignin nps tem images of lignin nps are shown in fig 1 which confirm that the particle size increased with the increase in lignin concentration an increase from 0 5 mg l 1 to 2 mg l 1 mass of lignin resulted in a higher yield of nps and an increase in the particle size to 327 nm 82 compared with ethylene glycol thf was found to be a better solvent than ethylene glycol for the preparation of more uniform and spherical lignin nps because of the better solvent exchange interaction of lignin nps with water 83 the tunable surface area and spherical morphology of lignin nps were explained using tem sem images fig 2 a e butylated hydroxytoluene bht of different concentrations affected the morphology of lignin nps at low concentrations no significant changes were observed in the spherical morphology fig 2 b f however if the amount of bht increased a cavity appeared fig 2 c d and g h this hollow structure was formed due to the phase separation between water and thf which formed an emulsion 84 3 preparation of lignin nps the synthesis of lignin nps can be achieved using two approaches 85 i the mechanical approach uses the physical methods of insoluble polymers to obtain narrow particle size but due to the high energy consumption the value of the mechanical method has declined 86 87 ii the chemical approach is used in diverse ways to synthesize lignin nps from the literature lignin and its composites exhibit excellent biodegradability negligible toxicity high stability and low cost 88 therefore lignin and its composites can be employed for drug delivery 79 83 table 2 summarizes the different preparation methods reaction conditions and obtained products recently the modification of lignin materials into well ordered and uniform micromaterials and nanomaterials has received more attention due to the promising properties of controlled morphology and size excellent antioxidant properties and dissolution in polymers therefore many lignin based composites were synthesized from various sources by coupling chemical and physical methods some methods are freeze drying ultrasonication self assembly polymerization acid precipitation interfacial cross linking microbial and enzyme mediated thermal stabilization solvent exchange and co2 antisolvent 50 79 89 90 3 1 chemical aided preparation 3 1 1 self assembly method lignin a paper and pulp industry byproduct that can be obtained from wood is often used to prepare microspheres the self assembly method can prepare lignin microspheres with spherical morphology proper shape and size these microspheres are safe cheap biodegradable and uv resistant 91 in a study by li et al 2019 lignin microspheres were prepared using a mixture of ctab surfactant and nals in water and ethanol the resulting microspheres were applied to encapsulate the photosensitive abamectin pesticide and subsequent half life and release tests demonstrated their effectiveness in removing pesticides and protecting avermectin from photodegradation due to the anti ultraviolet properties of lignin 92 93 tang et al conducted a study using the self assembly method for colloidal sphere preparation utilizing different ctab and nals weight ratios 94 through a series of experiments they determined that the optimal stoichiometric molar ratio and charge neutralization for nals ctab microsphere formation was 2 1 82 w w as estimated by measuring zeta potential and surface tension the researchers also found that water content played a crucial role in forming spherical nals ctab microspheres and adjusting the amount of water during the aggregation process was necessary to ensure the complete development of spherical microspheres 94 it was observed that the concentration of nals ctab in ethanol had an inverse impact on the amount of water required to form spherical microspheres adjusting the water content was crucial to ensure the completion of the aggregation process and the development of spherical microspheres in addition the study conducted by tang et al also aimed to determine the effect of solvent ratio and water content on the size of the particles the results indicated that the size of particles increased with the increase in the ratio of v v h2o etoh while smaller particles were formed when the water content was reduced 89 94 at the maximum water content level the formation of spherical particles stopped at the maximum size however the particle size decreased when the v v h2o etoh ratio was much higher than the maximum moreover the study also evaluated the impact of water addition rate on particle size and it was found that particle size decreased significantly with an increase in water amount fig 3 a c fig 3 d demonstrated that the addition of an excessive amount of water 84 vol led to the formation of a colloidal sphere with higher stability resulting in a decrease in particle size by further quenching the colloidal structures of nals ctab 94 lignin core shell spherical particles were synthesized via self assembly in a study by tortora 95 different kraft lignin solutions and biopolymers were used as cross linkers and high intensity ultrasonic waves were applied in oil water emulsions to create lignin shells various lignin microspheres were prepared using polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether as a cross linker and a 30 hydrogen peroxide solution to demonstrate their potential applications olive oil was combined with coumarin 6 wrapped in lignin and a release test was conducted in sodium dodecyl sulfate dissolved in water while no release of coumarin 6 was observed in water 100 of the drug was released within 60 min in the presence of surfactants the experiments were conducted on chinese hamster ovaries 95 biopolymer based core shell nps were designed and fabricated via ph derived approach and were used for the delivery and encapsulation of curcumin the varied factors of curcumin s physicochemical properties encapsulation composition and release performance were investigated 96 ft ir and xrd analysis techniques confirmed that curcumin was effectively encapsulated the uniform particle size and zeta potential measurements indicated that the core shell nps are stable in different ph values elevated temperatures salt content and storage time the scavenging activity of curcumin against 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl radical was notably improved after the within particle encapsulation process consequently the encapsulation of curcumin within the nals and alginate core shell nps resulted in a prolonged gastrointestinal release time as the thick encapsulation layer increased the repulsion and steric properties among the particles and enhanced the curcumin release 96 li et al 97 prepared porous solid smooth faced single holed and multi holed core shell microspheres from the shoots of the bamboo shell dendrocalamus lactiferous l by controlling the lignin concentration the addition rate of the antisolvent temperature and mixing of useful chemicals in the antisolvent 97 the average size of lignin in microparticles and nanoparticles increased with temperature and lignin concentration however it showed a significant decrease with the increased antisolvent addition rate the morphology of the particles depends on lignin concentration antisolvent dose and added chemicals to the antisolvent the particle size of solid and single holed microspheres ranged from 200 to 400 nm while porous smooth faced and multi holed microsphere spheres were noted from 400 nm to micrometer level 97 these results provide a better understanding of the preparation of lignin microparticles and nanoparticles with unique and diverse shapes and morphologies with promising applications as shown in fig 4 from the results we better understood the preparation of lignin microparticles and nanoparticles with unique and diverse shapes and morphologies with promising applications fig 4 the self assembly method can prepare lignin nanoparticles with a single hole 98 lignin was dissolved in thf then deionized water was added and a hollow capsule was prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis an appropriate amount of water 80 by volume was added to obtain a hollow sphere with high stability after the lignin capsules were formed thf was easily removed from the dialysis solution a significant impact was on the morphology of the lignin capsule by the stirring speed rate of water flow and ph high stirring speed resulted in very narrow particle size and acidic ph generated unstable dispersion hence the particle size was increased fig 5 98 it was also found that the dispersion remained very stable and the particle diameter did not change in the ph range of 3 5 12 98 3 1 2 emulsion polymerization chen et al synthesized core shell lignin structures using microemulsion polymerization and ultrasonic treatment 99 allyl functionalized lignin was prepared by modifying allyl bromide with sodium lignin butyl acetate was used as the oil phase hexadecane as a co stabilizer abn as initiator and trimethylolpropane tris 3 mercapto propionate as a cross linker for the preparation of nanocapsules to check the prepared nanocapsule drug loading and release capability the coumarin 6 dye was added to the oil phase and the drug release was measured at different ph values before the ultrasonic treatment coumarin 6 showed a high release rate at ph 4 0 compared to ph 7 the biopolymer shell at ph 7 behaved as a permeable membrane and released the drug over a longer time 99 hollow shaped lignin nps were fabricated and used as vehicles for delivering the cancer drug doxorubicin dox the hydrophilic dox was encapsulated inside the hydrophobic cavities of the hollow lignin nanoparticles through Ï Ï interactions and hydrogen bonding the prepared hollow nanoparticles showed good cellular uptake and accumulation of the drug in hela cells see fig 6 100 interestingly a self assembly technique was used for preparing the lignin nanoparticles which involved ph changes and solvent displacement approaches this method produced optimized particle sizes with excellent cellular uptake 101 cobalt carbon nps were prepared in a core shell arrangement using the carbonization process at low temperatures lignin oligomers and co no3 2 6h2o were used as precursors 102 for 12 h the mixed precursors were polymerized and the resulting polymer was carbonized in the temperature range of 400 800 c lignin nanoparticles were also prepared in core shell and hollow spherical shapes 103 and the process of esterification was used with methacrylic anhydride to modify lignin microemulsion polymerization and solvent evaporation processes were combined to prepare these nanocarriers to evaluate the drug release ability of lignin capsules the ultraviolet photoactive compound 2 propyl pyridine was added only a small amount of harmful emission of various solid particles was released interestingly the higher biopolymer structures exhibited different release behavior 103 the release rate study showed that considerable release was observed from porous particles however the fastest rate was achieved from core shell structures 103 to obtain lignin with spherical morphology lignin nanoparticles were used as templates 104 various methods are available for formulating spherical lignin nps using biorefinery residue industrial soda base non wood lignin industrial sulfate cork lignin and hardwood for instance microspheres were prepared from sulfate lignin black liquid by emulsion solvent evaporation 104 lignin was acetylated and dissolved in dichloromethane or ethyl acetate ea to prepare pellets the ea soluble portion was separated and dried to collect non acetylated lignin both acetylated biopolymers and the soluble microspheres were prepared under the same reaction conditions 104 the results showed that the type of solvent used significantly impacted the particle size the sizes of the particles obtained with dichloromethane were smaller than those obtained in ea it was also found that only hardwood kraft lignin and non wooden soda lignin a non acetylated biopolymer formed microspheres with spherical shapes 104 polyaniline pani materials have shown promising applications due to their unique properties 105 lignin is one of the useful materials as a precursor for pani and carbon materials to produce an effective adsorbent composite with high stability chemical compatibility and rich in carbon and phenol 105 pani was calcined and pretreated to fabricate a novel lignin carbon pani microwave absorbent fig 7 raman spectroscopy x ray diffraction ft ir tem network analyzer and sem instruments were used to investigate the structural microscopic and microwave absorption performance of the prepared lignin carbon pani sorbents from the optimized results it was confirmed that lignin carbon pani showed 50 96 db of reflection loss 3 09 mm of matching thickness 6 8 10 8 ghz rl 10 db of absorption frequency ranges which covers both x band and c band 106 3 1 3 precipitation method the precipitation method has many advantages such as a fast reaction rate mild reaction conditions low cost and elevated purity level 107 specifically the acid precipitation method is crucial for synthesizing lignin nps 90 frangville et al used two different precipitation methods namely acid precipitation and low sulfonated lignin solvent exchange precipitation to synthesize spherical lignin nps the stability of the prepared lignin nps was observed below ph 5 meanwhile nps prepared using the solvent exchange method exhibited stability over a broad range of ph 107 furthermore the size of lignin nps was influenced by the addition of ethylene glycol eg and hcl after conducting a mechanistic study it was concluded that the lignin particle size was influenced by the concentration of hcl and lignin in eg 108 following the frangville precipitation method homogeneously and well distributed lignin nps were prepared and incorporated into wheat gluten biocomposite at varying concentrations 109 this process significantly improved the biocomposite tensile strength thermal stability and water sensitivity the flash precipitation method was used to study the surface properties of the prepared lignin nps such as the particle nucleation and supersaturation while using the lignin of organosolvent hpl and kraft indulin at 80 the final report indicated that lignin nps prepared using both acid and solvent exchange precipitation methods exhibited high stability over a broad range of ph also indulin at nps are amphiphilic and were found to be more suitable for further functionalization using cationic activities at the same time hpl nps are highly hydrophobic which may be more suitable for organic activities using acid precipitation spherical lignin nps were successfully prepared from rice straw at various concentrations of water ethylene glycol and castor oil 88 the resulting nps with 15 20 nm particle size high thermal stability and spherical surface morphology were obtained in castor oil and ethylene glycol see fig 8 in this process rice straw was dissolved in water ethylene glycol and castor oil and the ph of the solution was kept at 10 lignin nps were prepared via nucleation by lowering the ph by slowly adding hcl solution 90 beisl et al synthesized lignin nps using direct precipitation in which the pretreated extract of poly butylene adipate terephthalate hpl from wheat straw was collected from the biorefinery this method is environmentally friendly as the consumption of solvent was exceptionally low also the morphology of the lignin nps was spherical with a 97 220 nm size range 110 lignin nps in the spherical shape form biodegradable and renewable lignin are easily available and can work as perfect material as building block due to their high water dispersibility biocompatibility and environment friendly nature 111 a sustainable and novel synthesis approach was developed to prepare spherical lignin nps using a binary solvent of a spent Î³ valerolactone and water 200 g l 1 of lignin was collected from various sources and was dissolved in the binary solvent of spent Î³ valerolactone and water followed by the dialysis or dropping method the size of the particles can be controlled during the precipitation process the dropping methods gave about 90 yield of the spherical lignin nps with an initial concentration of 24 g l 1 the dropping method may be scaled up for the large scale production of lignin nps 111 the diameter of the prepared lignin nps was 250 nm while Î¶ potential was 40 mv fig 9 3 2 physical aided synthetic process 3 2 1 microwave assisted techniques the preparation of lignin nps using mechanical routes still requires further investigation the most important mechanical treatment methods are wet and dry milling extensively used to synthesize lignin nps among them the milling at low temperatures of 18 c has been recognized and gives excellent results in forming spherical lignin nps with a particle size of about 10 nm 85 for decades lignin nps were synthesized using microwave assisted techniques for the rapid uniform and spherical shape 112 si et al prepared lignin nps from rice straw through a single step microwave assisted method at a noticeably short processing time 113 rice straw was used as a precursor and mixed with water ethanol solvent followed by acid catalyzed microwave irradiation which generated organic acid and monosaccharide and released some of the lignin a layer by layer lignin nps were formed from dissolved lignin via self assembly from outside to inside using Ï Ï interactions spherical particles of about 100 nm in size and 2 3 nanodots were obtained 113 furthermore the obtained lignin nps also showed low crystallinity with complex structures in the dispersed form the degree of stabilization of lignin nps was influenced by the carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl surface charges which formed a double surface layer 113 114 also the prepared lignin nps showed excellent dispersion stability at broad ph ranges with a double electrical surface layer confirmed by zeta potential values coconut coir is the main source of lignin and three different methods were used formic acid organosolvent naoh and polyethylene glycol to isolate lignin nps 115 dÃ¡vila and co workers reported the process of panamgama using microwave and thermal assisted methods it was noted that the thermal assisted coupled with an alkaline method was more efficient and produced the highest yield compared to the organosolvent process 116 3 2 2 ultrasonication ultrasonication has been an important process for synthesizing lignin nps vis polymerization since the 1950s 117 in this process high frequency waves from 16 to 100 mhz influenced the formation of radicals which penetrated the whole mass of the liquid also the overall ultrasonication process is affected by pressure temperature the type of liquid and operational conditions 118 alkali lignin nps were synthesized from sarkanda grass and wheat straw using an ultrasonication process with some modifications by the sonication of lignin solution for about 1 h a stable and homogeneous nanodispersion with 10 50 nm particle size and light scattering properties was obtained 118 in another study kraft wood lignin was treated for different reaction times such as 2 4 6 and 9 h under ultrasonic waves to prepare lignin nps 119 it was noted that 6 h of reaction time produced uniform lignin particles in the range of 10 to 50 nm but the increase in time led to significant changes in the same study lignin nps 6 h were incorporated with different polyurethane pu polymer concentrations to prepare strong composite materials furthermore the composite of lignin nps 10 wt 6 h pu was compared with slk 10 10 wt pu for thermal and mechanical stability a significant improvement was noted in the thermal stability of nl 10 pu composite due to the non covalent interaction of lignin with the polymer the high surface ratio of lignin nps resulted in a strong interaction between pu and lignin nps 119 with an alkali assisted ultrasonication technique yin and co workers reported the synthesis of lignin nps from switch grass 120 initially lignin was placed in deionized water and then 0 1 m naoh was added under ultrasonication lignin nps were prepared in the range of 200 nm as measured using the light scattering method 4 functionalization of lignin nps the structure origin functionality and chemical modification characteristics influence the reactivity of lignin nps the main limitation of bare lignin nps is their insufficient solubility in an aqueous medium in large scale production the complex molecular structure and associated steric hindrance are the reason for the restriction in the reactivity of lignin nps however many functional groups on the surface make lignin nps more suitable for surface modification and functionalization fig 10 different chemical methods such as carboxy methylation 123 130 esterification 131 132 epoxidation 34 hydroxy methylation 123 130 and oxidation and sulfonation 133 have been used for the modification of surface functional groups the main functional groups in the structure of lignin nps are carbonyl hydroxyl aliphatic and phenolic and guaiacyl uncondensed these functional groups are responsible for converting lignin nps into bio based thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers 134 incorporating lignin nanofiller into the polymeric matrix is convenient since it does not result in chemical modification however the hydroxyl group in lignin nps are more accessible for esterification and etherification 12 135 compared to lignin nps the nano lignin materials have more tendency to interact with polymers due to their high affinity for the composite formation and small size 136 137 in particular the spherical shape of lignin nps is suitable for dispersion in an aqueous solution and remains dispersed for 60 days furthermore ultrasonication ensures homogenous dispersion formation without chemical modification 118 126 138 acid pretreatment alone may not be sufficient to disrupt the recalcitrance derived from softwood lignin and post treatment may be necessary to obtain targeted lignin nps 136 therefore an alkali and acid mixture was used for the pretreatment of lignin nps with polyethylene glycol epoxides peg epoxides successfully developed on the surface of masson pine 136 although removing lignin was limited when using acid alkali combined treatment the yield was remarkably increased to 34 by further hydrolysis it is due to the successfully incorporating hydrophilic polyethylene glycol epoxides peg into the original lignin nps moreover the development of the digestive enzymes varies with the length of the peg chain and this improvement was successfully monitored and investigated in the properties of lignin nps followed by the variation in the water retention values after the in situ peg epoxides modification of lignin nps with different molecular weights 136 the hydroxy methylation reaction was used for the surface functionalization of lignin nps gilca et al 123 xiong et al 98 also reported that amidation salinization and sonication could produce fluorescent lignin nps the reaction of lignin nps and 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane effectively introduces the amino group into the structure of lignin nps which can then react with the 1 pyrene butyric acid pba called amidation to prepare lignin grafted with pyrene group s lignin pba after the sonication step the prepared lignin pba nanocomposites exhibit a spherical surface morphology with a narrow particle size of 95 5 nm 138 lignin nps can be functionalized using tyrosinase enzymes 139 direct encapsulation adsorption and layer by layer deposition were used with the reticulation of glutaraldehyde initially the prepared lignin nps were stable to the activity of tyrosinase enzymes after immobilization with tyrosinase enzymes the functionalized lignin nanocomposites exhibited good catalytic effects in preparing catechol and its derivatives fig 11 lignin nps were chemically functionalized by the steglich esterification of azo dye 2 e 2 hydroxy naphthalene 1 yl diazenyl benzoic acid and then successfully coupled with zinc oxide nps zinc oxide incorporation into the entire structure of functionalized lignin nanocomposite induced beneficial changes in the photo responsive efficiency such as photo stabilization and enhanced light absorption the photoinduced antimicrobial performance was also enhanced 139 another approach is carboxylation in which a carboxyl group incorporates the entire structure of lignin nps therefore before solvent extraction the lignin nps were subjected to carboxylation to add more carboxyl groups and the carboxylate lignin nps can further be conjugated peptides and copolymers 141 setÃ¤lÃ¤ and co workers used tall oil fatty acid in water for the surface functionalization of lignin nps tlnps and the double bond present in tlnp behaved as an excellent modifier in the functionalization of cellulose the prepared tlnps show spherical surface morphology and 140 nm to 160 nm particle size also tlnps effectively make a covalent bond with unmodified and modified cellulose fibers and form an antimicrobial composite 142 the grafting approach is highly effective in functionalizing lignin nps using some micro initiators that help in the polymerization reaction at the surface of lignin nps the application of the functionalized lignin nanocomposite depends on the polymer chain used for grafting also the different surface functionalities make lignin nps suitable for further modification 143 it is important to develop functionalization methods for lignin nps that are environmentally friendly and use simple processing conditions while avoiding harsh chemicals lignin nps are abundant low cost renewable and can be used as starting materials in polymer matrices such as epoxy polyvinyl alcohol and rubber 144 5 lignin based spherical composites for the removal of cationic dyes water remediation and purification approaches promote research to develop sustainable cost effective nanoscale sorbents and various techniques for wastewater treatment 6 functional groups on the surface make lignin nps suitable for surface modification the main functional groups in the structure of lignin nps are carbonyl groups hydroxyl aliphatic and phenolic and guaiacyl groups uncondensed these functional groups are responsible for converting lignin nps to bio based thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers spherical lignin nps and nanocomposites have shown excellent applications in removing toxic cationic dyes because of the ion exchange hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction or Ï Ï stacking fig 12 furthermore the functionalization of lignin nps directly improves the adsorption of different dyes depending on the type of functionalization table 3 summarizes functionalized lignin nps and their applications in removing cationic dyes kraft lignin can be functionalized using esterification 131 demethylation 123 130 hydroxy methylation 145 146 reduction oxidation 33 and sulfonation or sulfuric acid treatment 133 to prepare sulfonated lignin gao et al reported the functionalization of kraft lignin by phenolate followed by sulfonation and developed water soluble sulfonated lignin sap lignin or ssp lignin which showed excellent applications in the adsorption of dyes the prepared sulfonated lignin nps showed an adsorption performance of 90 4 for sap lignin and 72 1 for sp lignin in ethyl violet ev 147 the sulfonation process introduces sulfonated ions making the surface of lignin nps negatively charged and thus more efficient for the adsorption of cationic dyes 148 moreover during the adsorption process sulfonation improves the electrostatic and Ï Ï interactions resulting in expanded conformations of lignin nps li et al used sulfo methylation of kraft lignin na2so3 in an alkaline solution of naoh and epichlorohydrin crosslinking they fabricated new hydrogel type sulfonate lignin that was used to remove cationic dyes the sulfonate lignin showed a removal capacity of 495 4 mg g 1 for mb at 303 k significantly higher than the removal capacity of unmodified kraft lignin 97 22 mg g 1 7 silanization followed by amination was used to fabricate lignin nps in a single step which resulted in a nitrogen content of 6 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane was used for the silanization step 147 the resulting sal exhibited excellent properties including a large surface area chemical and thermal stability resistance to water solvents and an excellent porous structure with an adsorption capacity of 74 4 mg g 1 for congo red dye the removal efficiency was 100 and followed the langmuir adsorption model co solvents enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation celf method was developed by meng and co workers in which they combined celf with mannish transformation and prepared amino lignin nps for the removal of mb and direct blue db dyes from wastewater 149 the aminated lignin celf showed spherical morphology and 90 adsorption of direct blue 1 db 1 the material could be reused three times redox mediator materials exhibited promising biodegradation performance and the ability to remove azo dyes from wastewater rm materials derived from lignin nps and prepared using peroxidation were used for the adsorption of azo dyes from different biorefineries 150 ft ir gc ms electron paramagnetic resonance and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize rm materials and hplc was used to characterize the metabolites the removal efficiency of mb dye was improved using peroxidation to 20 95 in the optimized time of 12 h furthermore the product from the peroxidation of syringe aldehyde increased the removal efficiency from 40 to 85 in 24 h the azo dye removal for the two tested redox mediators followed the model of zero order and first order kinetics 150 palladium calcium lignosulfonates pd cls were fabricated using a series of laser assisted techniques using 30 w and 1064 nm light the calcium lignosulfonate cls was effectively decorated with pd nps the prepared pd cls lignosulfonates were evaluated for removing mb and 4 nitrophenol 4 np from wastewater 39 tem images revealed uniform decoration of particles on the surface of cls under optimized conditions 2 5 mm in 25 ml 4 np was removed from the aqueous solution in 1 min at ph 7 0 3 0 mg of the prepared pd cls was used to remove 3 1 10 5 m mb in 25 ml solution the material showed 90 removal efficiency and could be reusable up to eight times 39 the freeze drying method was used to fabricate and carbonize lignosulfonate nps ls the carbonized lignin nps cl were used to remove textile effluents fig 13 the lignin nps were characterized before and after carbonization at different temperatures of 600 c 750 c 900 c and 1050 c 151 using sonication the lignosulphonate material was broken down into nps of various diameters and low molecular weight material due to freeze drying and sonication the lignin nps contain different morphologies resulting in plated shapes and high surface area materials that showed excellent adsorption of mb at 109 77 mg g 1 151 spherical lignin based phenolic resin lpr was prepared using the solvothermal hydrothermal method resulting in efficient reducing agents that support the formation of 10 nm silver nps 152 lignin also behaved as a surfactant further reducing the particle size of the phenolic resin to the nanometer range the lpr ag nanocomposite was evaluated for the adsorption of mb and mo dyes with sodium borohydride and the heterostructure lpr ag nanocomposite showed better catalytic performance than the lpr ag prepared using the loading of silver on spherical lpr the negative charges functional groups on the lignin nps in lpr ag nanocomposite adsorbed cationic dyes they showed high adsorption efficiency for mb demonstrating the multi functional applications of lignin nps in both catalysis and adsorption 152 furthermore longer polymeric skeletons and functional groups make lignin a biopolymer sensitive to different temperatures and ph values 153 ahmed et al discussed the affinity of acid synthesized lignin au nps with a particle size of 5 7 nm and lignin ag nps with a particle size of 13 8 nm in addition lignin pd nps with a particle size of 4 5 nm were synthesized in a basic medium to remove yellow dye 145 lignin pd nps showed more removal efficiency than lignin au nps and the least efficient among the three nanocomposites was lignin ag nps 154 the nanostructures synthesized in a basic medium reduced the removal time to half for lignin au nps in 18 34 min and lignin ag nps in 21 87 min while for lignin pd nps it was 1 45 min lignin functioned as multi functional material for complexation binding and reducing stabilizing agents for lignin au lignin ag and lignin pd 154 the integration of porous carbon with lignin nps increased their adsorption efficiency a novel etching sulfonation method was used in which fe3o4 was utilized as a templating agent for a highly selective and efficient adsorbent of sulfonated lignin nps based porous carbon from cornstalk fig 14 a 155 because of the presence of anionic functional groups such as cooh oh and so3h at high density the as synthesized lspc nanocomposites exhibited promising selectivity in removing mb also lspc showed stability in a wide range of ph in the adsorption of mb as the ph increased from 2 to 11 the adsorption of mb increased drastically from 234 19 to 621 52 mg g 1 fig 14 b also lspc can be reused because of its robust regenerated property and high adsorption capacity for cationic dyes 155 another eco friendly alkali lignin based carbonaceous composite was designed and fabricated using hydrothermal and carbonization methods the material was further used for tio2 nps as support in 5 30 nm particle size 156 from the results the carboxylic group on the surface of carbon chemically reacted with the ti center in tio2 the lignin carbonaceous tio2 lc tio2 material was evaluated for its photocatalytic performance for the degradation of phenol and mb under uv visible light the lc tio2 with a thickness of 2 5 nm support exhibited excellent results for the tio2 photocatalytic activity which was improved to 34 8 times for phenol in the visible light and 3 8 times for tio2 without the support lignin carbonaceous material lignin carbonaceous material acted as a support and sensitizer for lc tio2 under uv visible light and its anionic functional groups facilitated the transfer of photo generated electrons resulting in excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol and mb 157 a hierarchical spherical mno2 lignin composite mno2 lnps was prepared to remove dyes from wastewater the nanodots of mno2 were dispersed within lignin nps fig 15 a 158 the as synthesized composite exhibited higher surface area than simple lignin nps and could be reused five times the adsorption efficiency of mno2 lnps was 806 mg g 1 for mb in a short time and about 80 removal was completed in 5 min this high adsorption is due to the anionic functional groups on the surface of lignin nps and the high surface area fig 15 b the dye removal is exothermic and ph responsive 158 alkali treated waste corncob derived lignin was utilized as feedstock for preparing activated carbon and further used for removing mb 159 two methods i e kissinger akahira sunose and flynn wall ozawa were employed to explain the kinetic mechanism of pyrolysis of alkali lignin at various rates of heating which were mostly used for the calculation of various dynamic parameters to minimize the error in the multi step dynamics the possible relation between the lignin structure and activated carbon was successfully investigated in the final preparation of lignin based activated carbon the final lignin based activated carbon exhibited promising properties such as a high surface area of 1215 83 m2 g 77 3 mesoporous portion optimum activation as well as 550 c of activation temperature 120 min of activation and the concentration of phosphoric acid reached 50 158 the mb adsorption process followed a pseudo second order kinetic model with maximum adsorption efficiency of 493 28 mg g 1 more or less 5 mg g 1 which is 99 0 and was the highest in the secondary adsorption fig 16 6 conclusion the main goal of this review is to highlight recent research in biopolymers especially lignin aimed at developing robust and versatile materials with diverse applications after cellulose lignin is the second most abundant biomass from plants and is considered one of the most important sources of various world natural aromatic based structures lignin is a versatile amorphous material that is easy to synthesize using free radical polymerization this review summarizes different separation methods used to extract lignin nps from lignocellulose approximately 95 of the prepared lignin is used for burning and the remaining 5 is used for commercial applications among all the shapes of lignin based nanocomposites the spherical shape is the most studied the applications of lignin materials depend on their morphology and the spherical morphology of lignin materials is desirable for most environmental applications due to their small size therefore we have gathered information on versatile lignin based spherical nanostructures in this review in this context lignin is the most recognized material because of its distinctive structure high volume and outstanding properties the surface of lignin nps contains functional groups that can be utilized for functionalization such as carbonyl hydroxyl aliphatic and phenolic and guaiacyl uncondensed these functional groups facilitate the conversion of lignin nps into biobased thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers the fabrication and functionalization of lignin nps have also led to the synthesis of novel lignin nanocomposites and the prevention of unwanted compound accumulation lignin based spherical nanocomposites with aromatic ligands and amorphous structures exhibit excellent sorption capabilities for cationic dyes toxic metals and organic pollutants the outstanding adsorption capacity of lignin nps and lignin nanocomposites is due to the presence of anionic functional groups which aid in the uptake of the cationic dyes via ion exchange hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction and Ï Ï stacking in conclusion the catalytic adsorption and selectivity performance of lignin nps can be further improved through functionalization fabrication and surface modification 7 future perspectives the utilization of lignin as a sorbent material faces numerous challenges especially regarding modifications required for large scale preparations therefore it is crucial to develop fabrication and functionalization protocols that utilize environmentally friendly reagents and cost effective methods to make lignin an effective biopolymer moreover developing novel standards to investigate different lignin types structures compositions and purity can help reduce the cost of commercialization and increase economic benefits this in turn can increase the market demand for lignin nps and lignin nanocomposites and stimulate research on innovative applications of lignin although substantial research has progressed on lignin nps and lignin nanocomposites with effective sorption applications there is still a necessity for further advances on topics such as i the expansion of environmentally friendly media for easy and low cost preparation extraction and separation of lignin nps from their raw feedstock ii the development of facile routes for functionalizing and fabricating lignin nps with spherical shapes iii the application of various bio wastes in preparing lignin nps iv the fabrication of greener biological methods with cheaper fabrication costs and improved sorption efficiency v the development of lignin based magnetic composites that can often be reused using magnetic separation moreover research should focus on developing lignin nps and nanocomposites with specific applications such as wastewater treatment removal of heavy metals and pollutants from air and water and selective separation of biomolecules advanced analytical and characterization techniques should be used to study the fundamental properties of lignin based materials such as surface area pore size distribution and surface chemistry which are crucial for their sorption performance additionally research should be conducted to explore lignin based materials toxicological and

operational complexity energy consumption and treatment cost of different integrated systems this analysis provides profound insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach one of the significant contributions of this work is the study of the cost analysis of different aop based integrated methods this analysis serves as a crucial guideline for selecting the most suitable integrated approach for efficient pollutant removal from diverse aqueous matrices finally the future perspective on aop based integration techniques is defined to engage and inspire both current and prospective researchers in this field fostering further advancements and innovations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption advanced oxidation processes cost analysis hybrid process pharmaceuticals data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a vital component for nourishing ecosystems the continuous use of water in agriculture transportation and industries is depleting this limited resource 1 the increasing population and rapid industrial expansion have escalated the demand for clean water moreover advancements in health medications have resulted in a substantial rise in pharmaceutical product usage consequently the production and consumption of pharmaceutical compounds pcs have significantly elevated their concentration in water and wastewater matrices in recent decades the pcs are mainly consisting of antibiotics analgesics antipyretics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids antivirals antiparasitics and cardiovascular drugs 2 although their concentration in aqueous systems is very low e g ng l their presence adversely affects the ecological system and the health of living organisms 3 the pcs enter the aqueous system through pharmaceutical industries effluent human and animal excreta effluent from health care institutions inappropriate disposal of expired medicines and pcs used in agriculture household hospital and veterinary 4 5 removal of pcs is critical as they are chemically stable non biodegradable and bio accumulative in the living organism 6 besides pcs appear in aquatic bodies as a stable and bio transformed molecular product form due to the intensive and continuous use of pharmaceuticals 7 therefore it is essential to develop an advanced promising and sustainable technology for removing or degrading pcs from wastewater pharmaceutical compound toxicity evaluation includes assessing acute and chronic toxicity genotoxicity reproductive and developmental toxicity chronic toxicity ecological toxicity and carcinogenicity understanding these risks is essential for safety regulatory compliance and minimizing environmental impact contaminated drinking water reservoirs pose adverse effects like headaches nausea asthma and bone diseases cancer related antibiotics in water sources can cause embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in pregnant women an efficient and cost effective treatment system is crucial for pc wastewater and a comprehensive assessment of pc toxicity is necessary over the last two decades there has been a lot of research on the fate toxicity and impacts of pcs and their potential degradation strategies from various water matrices 8 9 fig 1 represents pcs possible sources fate and impact on humans the environment and aquatic life the advances in analytical technologies 10 11 for identifying and detecting pcs at ng l levels motivated researchers in this field table 1 summarizes commonly detected pharmaceuticals in aqueous systems including their concentrations and their detrimental impacts on public health and biota although pcs are present in trace amounts ng l to Î¼g l their properties such as lipophilicity volatility polarity adsorption persistence etc adversely affect their removal rate and efficiency by conventional techniques 12 13 conventional sewage treatment plants are designed to treat biodegradable compounds 14 and therefore the non biodegradable pcs cannot be removed effectively through conventional sewage treatment plants 15 thus there is a need to implement combined or hybrid technologies for the effective removal of these contaminants from aqueous systems it is crucial to highlight the distinction between combined and hybrid processes as they are frequently used interchangeably in a combined process two or more techniques are sequentially implemented individually one after another on the other hand a hybrid process integrates multiple techniques synergistically and optimally in a single vessel to facilitate the removal or degradation process these technologies must exhibit effectiveness sustainability and economic viability this paper utilizes the sign to represent combined processes and the or sign to denote hybrid processes recently aops have been extensively explored for the efficient degradation mineralization of pcs from various aqueous matrices 34 35 these processes are based on the generation of reactive species of hydroxyl ion h o radicals with high oxidizing power 36 the radical species oxidize the complex molecules into smaller fragments or completely mineralize them some popular aops commonly used for the degradation of residual pharmaceuticals include ozone based aops 37 uv based aops 38 fenton based aops 39 sonolysis 40 electro oxidation 41 wet air oxidation 34 sulfate radicals based aops 42 ferrioxalate oxidation 43 visible light driven z scheme photocatalysis 44 and persulfate oxidation 45 processes they exhibit high degradation efficiency non selectivity rapid degradation rates and eco friendly characteristics making them promising compared to other techniques however their main limitations are the relatively high capital and operating costs to enhance cost effectiveness aops are integrated with physicochemical and or biological techniques ensuring environmentally sustainable remediation and the production of clean water this paper critically reviews aop based integrated techniques for removing pcs valuable insights from global researchers work are obtained through comprehensive bibliographic analysis the integration of aops with other techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration and biological methods is extensively examined additionally a comparative

the terms by default 1000 items were displayed among five clusters and oxidation process is among the top keywords 3 process integration of aop with other techniques the majority of published research is focused on the treatment of wastewater containing very low concentration pcs in the range of ng l of cod using aops however the effluents from the hospitals and pharmaceutical production plants are highly contaminated e g in the range of several g l of cod and considered industrial effluents the aop alone is not adequate for the treatment of industrial effluent in compliance with environmental regulations to meet regulatory compliance the aops have been integrated with other techniques for cost effective mineralization the optimal integration of aops with other techniques overcomes the limitations of individual treatments process in terms of economic and technological competitiveness the optimal integration of treatment techniques can provide a better alternative concerning cost time and efficiency which can be implemented at a commercial scale for the treatment of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater the aop is integrated with physical and biological methods for the effective removal of toxic pcs the following section discusses the integration of aop based integrated combined hybrid technologies for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 3 1 integrated adsorption aop systems adsorption is one of the most commonly used treatment methods due to its simple design mild operating conditions low investment and operating costs 46 47 integrated adsorption aop systems are designed to effectively remove pollutants from contaminated water by combining the adsorption and degradation capabilities of two distinct treatment methods as illustrated in fig 3 the mechanism of integrated adsorption aop systems typically involves the adsorption followed by aop treatment and synergistic effects of both treatments during the adsorption stage a solid adsorbent material is employed to remove target pollutants from the water this can be achieved through various mechanisms such as surface complexation ion exchange physical adsorption electrostatic interactions or chemical bonding depending on the nature of the adsorbent and the contaminants as a result the concentration of contaminants in the wastewater is reduced following the adsorption step the effluent is subjected to aops this process involves the generation of highly reactive oxidizing species which can break down the remaining pollutants that were not removed by adsorption the oxidizing species react with the pollutants leading to their degradation into smaller less harmful byproducts such as carbon dioxide and water the combined approach enhances the overall efficiency of the treatment system it is important to note that the specific mechanisms and performance of integrated adsorption aop systems can vary depending on factors such as the adsorbent material used the type and concentration of contaminants in the wastewater and the specific aop technique employed researchers have explored various adsorbents including activated carbon 48 clay materials 49 bio adsorbents 50 metal organic framework and biochar 51 52 for the removal of a variety of pcs from different aqueous matrices husein et al 53 used green synthesized copper nano adsorbent for the removal of nsaids diclofenac dcf naproxen npx and ibuprofen ibu in a lab scale batch process and observed 74 4 86 9 and 91 4 removal of ibu npx and dcf respectively powdered activated carbon pac removed 87 of ciprofloxacin 54 95 of amoxicillin 55 and 80 96 of quinolone antibiotics 56 granular activated carbon was used to remove pharmaceuticals and pesticides and reported 82 removal 57 lin et al 58 used iron nanoparticles and observed 92 removal of rifampicin in 120 min with 0 5 g l of adsorbent dose mondal et al 59 prepared the gooseberry seed shells activated carbon gb ac adsorbent and a composite of gb ac with graphite powder and silver nanoparticles gb ac g ag for npx removal in a batch experiment at lab scale the optimal npx removal of 61 99 and 87 3 were obtained using gb ac and gb ac g ag respectively the use of the metal organic framework and their derivates for the removal of pcs have been extensively reviewed 60 61 the complete degradation of pcs using adsorption alone could not be achieved also conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed for the complete degradation of pcs as such researchers have explored the integration of aop and adsorption for the effective degradation of pcs a combination of peroxone aop and adsorption was used for the removal of pharmaceuticals from real pharmaceutical wastewater 62 the effluent was pretreated with peroxone and granular activated carbon gac was used as post treatment the peroxone treatment removed cod in the range of 75 88 5 for ph 5 11 and the total cod removal after gac post treatment was achieved between 85 4 and 92 7 a combined adsorption and catalytic ozonation system using commercial activated carbon as well as metal oxide fe2o3 ceo2 impregnated activated carbon moac was used for the investigation of sulfamethoxazole smz removal from aqueous solution 63 both the smz removal and ozone consumption efficiency were better for the moac o3 combination as compared to the pac o3 combination 63 mojiri et al 64 designed a combined ozonation reactor and cross linked chitosan bentonite fixed bed column system fig 4 for acetaminophen act and amoxicillin amx removal from synthetic solution the degradation of act and amx with an ozone reactor was optimized using an artificial neural network ann the ozone reactor removed 84 8 of act and 82 7 of amx under optimal conditions the act and amx were completely removed after adsorption in the chitosan bentonite fixed bed column tio2 is a commonly used photocatalyst due to its excellent catalytic activity and good stability however the catalyst has to be recovered for the economic sustainability of a process immobilizing the catalyst using an adsorbent carrier facilitates pollutant removal by adsorption and helps in catalyst recovery zheng et al 65 investigated ciprofloxacin degradation using a hybrid tio2 graphitized mesoporous carbon nanocomposite and reported complete degradation by adsorption photocatalysis in a similar work belhouchet et al 66 employed calcite mineral tio2 nanocomposite for the degradation of tetracycline tc and reported efficient mineralization the experiment was conducted under solar irradiation and uv light after 300 min of irradiation 90 of the tc was eliminated by uv and 82 by solar irradiation tio2 zeolite integrated photocatalytic adsorbent hybrid was synthesized for the degradation of amoxicillin 67 the photocatalytic adsorbent was pretreated with acid alkaline and calcined at 300 c under n2 and resulting in efficient degradation of amoxicillin huang et al 68 utilized a low cost bio adsorbent alkali cooking modified rice straw fiber amsf coated with tio2 hydrogels tio2 amsf to synthesize a low cost photocatalytic adsorbent for ciprofloxacin remediation from aqueous solution surface coating of amsf using tio2 hydrogels facilitated regeneration and the removal process was controlled by a continuous adsorption photodegradation process tio2 amsf removed the maximum ciprofloxacin during uv irradiation 153 mg g single atom catalysts sacs offer the advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts making them highly effective in aops carbon based single metal atom catalysts e g nitrogen doped fe sacs exhibit high activity selectivity and stability 69 zhou et al 70 developed an efficient single atom catalyst sa mn nsc to activate peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade a wide range of pollutants including enrofloxacin enr within 10 min the catalyst exhibited exceptional activity and stability xia et al 71 explored autogenous n rich biochar derived from spirulina npsbs for activating peroxydisulfate pds to degrade 97 59 of smx within 40 min biochar derived from agricultural wastes has been utilized as catalysts and catalytic support in aops for the effective removal of organic pollutants 72 the engineered nanomaterials such as graphene and its derivatives have high surface areas as well a very high catalytic activity 73 these materials have a great potential for remediation of pcs by adsorption as well as aop the nanoscale zero valent iron has been utilized as a catalyst in the fenton process in the presence of h2o2 for the enhanced degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic 74 however the presence of van der walls and magnetic forces leads to the aggregation of nanoscale zero valent iron which subsequently lowers its surface reactivity this can be addressed by utilizing mechanical support material such as reduced graphene oxide to immobilize zero valent iron particles 75 masud et al 76 employed reduced graphene oxide as a support for nanoscale zero valent iron to prepare nanohybrids which was synergistically utilized as both an adsorbent and a heterogeneous fenton catalyst for the degradation of antibiotics anti seizure and nsaids the hybrid aop adsorption process showed superior 93 removal efficiency and faster removal for pcs compared to the adsorption treatment hassani et al 77 utilized uva led assisted cofe2o4 reduced graphene oxide cfo rgo nanocomposites to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for bisphenol a degradation the nanocomposite achieved over 99 removal of bpa within 30 min using 150 mg l pms 400 mg l cfo rgo and a ph range of 3 9 yaghoot nezhad et al 78 employed uv e chlorination hematite nanoparticles as a photocatalytic method to degrade bpa the process achieved a 99 4 decontamination efficiency within 40 min under optimal conditions he et al 79 synthesized mn o pcn a co doped polymeric carbon nitride catalyst and activated pms for enrofloxacin enr removal the mn o pcn pms system exhibited excellent reactivity for enr degradation the catalytic system also exhibited excellent reusability table 2 summarizes the integrated adsorption aop systems for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds the review suggests that the hybrid of adsorption photocatalysis using various photocatalytic adsorbents composite is an attractive technique for the effective degradation of pcs from various water matrices however the higher cost of photocatalysts and the disposal challenges of saturated composite inhibit their use for large scale applications there is a need to explore low cost adsorbents e g biochar based photocatalysts this will also address the issue of the disposal of saturated composite the reusability and stability of catalysts are crucial in integrated aop adsorption systems catalyst reusability refers to its ability to be used multiple times without significant activity loss while stability is maintaining catalytic activity over time efficient catalysts with high reusability and stability reduce costs and ensure consistent treatment efficiency mn o pcn a co doped polymeric carbon nitride catalyst 79 zinc based nano catalysts modified with nanocarbon 80 fe3o4 ac tio2 81 and co3o4 cnt carbon nanotube catalysts 82 demonstrated exceptional stability and reusability these catalysts can be reused without significant deterioration in their performance they offer cost effective and sustainable solutions for wastewater treatment and other applications 3 2 integrated aop membrane systems membrane processes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration are widely used for the removal of contaminants from wastewater however the membrane process is only a physical method and it must be integrated with other degradation methods such as chemical oxidation for the effective removal of pcs integration of aop with membrane technology has been explored for the remediation of pharmaceutical residue from aqueous solution in the integrated approach the aop mineralize the complex molecules into simple one and the membrane system allows the effluent to pass through them this improves the membrane performance enhances the permeate water flux and minimizes fouling the integrated system of aop and membrane filtration allows for the removal of both particulate and dissolved contaminants the membrane filtration step removes larger particles and suspended matter while the subsequent aop treatment addresses dissolved organic compounds and recalcitrant contaminants overall the mechanism of integrated aop membrane systems involves the combination of membrane filtration for pre treatment which removes larger particles and protects the aop process followed by aop treatment using highly reactive hydroxyl radicals to effectively degrade organic contaminants in the water this integrated approach provides enhanced water treatment efficiency improved contaminant removal and the potential for advanced treatment of various organic pollutants it s important to note that the performance and mechanisms of integrated aop membrane systems can vary depending on factors such as the specific aop and membrane technologies used the characteristics of the wastewater and the operational conditions a general schematic of the integrated aop membrane systems is illustrated in fig 5 the aop and membrane system can be integrated into three different modes i membrane filtration followed by aop 90 91 ii aop followed by membrane filtration 92 93 and iii aop and membrane filtration simultaneous treatment in which the oxidation and filtration processes are carried out simultaneously 94 the integration of aop and membrane filtration offer several advantages such as the ability to remove by product during oxidation and the prevention of membrane fouling 95 96 the combined fenton oxidation and reverse osmosis removed 99 of amoxicillin from the aqueous solution 97 researchers have explored the use of organic membranes and ceramic membranes for coupling of ozonation membrane filtration system he et al 94 employed a hybrid heterogeneous catalytic ozonation membrane filtration pvdf flat sheet membrane system for degradation of bisphenol a bpa from aqueous solution and observed 81 2 of bpa degradation in 150 min compared to 62 using ozonation membrane filtration without catalyst system liu et al 98 combined nanofiltration using organic membrane polyamine polyester membrane and ozone based aop for the degradation of antibiotics from wastewater and reported 99 degradation vatankhah et al 93 employed combined ozonation nanofiltration polyamide membrane and reported 94 removal of dissolved organic matter and considerable mitigation in membrane fouling compared to filtration without pre ozonation thus the coupled membrane and catalytic ozonation ozonation are promising approaches to mitigate the fouling of organic membranes heterogeneous catalytic ozonation employs various metal oxides 99 to enhance the o3 decomposition into oh radicals and reactive oxygen species and thereby facilitates the complete mineralization of pcs 100 however their widespread application is limited by catalyst recovery and agglomeration in slurry reactors ceramic membranes 101 are useful catalyst support to address these limitations of the catalytic ozonation process researchers have explored the application of various ceramic membranes in coupled ozonation membrane systems 102 the hybrid ozonation membrane filtration system was used to degrade antibiotics from the synthetic water 103 the membrane support and separation layer was made of Î± al2o3 and tio2 respectively the hybrid ozone membrane filtration showed an enhanced removal rate of antibiotics as compared to the single membrane filtration lee et al 104 employed a ceox and mnox impregnated catalytic ceramic membrane in a hybrid catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system for the degradation of micropollutants namely bpa benzotriazole and clofibric acid the ceox impregnated catalytic ceramic membrane had a higher mineralization ability and efficient ozone utilization than the mnox impregnated catalytic ceramic membrane the ceramic membrane is chemical and thermal resistant and has longer lifetimes however the relatively high cost of the catalytic ceramic membrane is a major concern with this method the cementitious membrane fabricated from portland cement is a low cost candidate for a hybrid catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system with enhanced ozone decomposition ability the metal oxides and silicates present in hydrate cement catalyze ozone decomposition and enhance the micropollutant degradation efficiency wang et al 105 fabricated a cementitious membrane based hybrid catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system for the degradation of p chloronitrobenzene a synthetic intermediate used in pharmaceutical applications and reported that the hybrid system decomposed 1 5 mg l of o3 and enhanced the p chloronitrobenzene removal by 50 lan et al 106 employed a heterogeneous fenton reaction with a membrane filtration hybrid fig 6 for the degradation of ibuprofen from water the hybrid system consists of a hollow fiber membrane immersed into a fe loaded zeolite fe zsm5 fenton reactor which ensures catalytic retention during treatment the immersed membrane is a compact configuration and consumes less energy compared to the external membrane filtration system the investigation was focused on the fouling control strategies in the hybrid fenton reactor the critical flux to eliminate the irreversible fouling was obtained as 23 l h m2 two fouling control strategies were proposed the first strategy was to operate the system below the critical flux however this strategy has a negative impact on productivity therefore when the operating flux is higher than the critical flux hydrodynamic back washing was proposed as a second strategy the coupling of ceramic membrane and aop is a promising approach to effectively degrade pcs present in an aqueous solution with varying conditions of temperatures pressures solvents and ph the photocatalytic membrane is a hybrid technology of membrane filtration and photocatalysis the integrated techniques facilitate the separation and recovery of photocatalysts and the decomposition of rejected micropollutants via photocatalysis which subsequently reduces membrane fouling 107 polymeric membranes are the preferred choice for their application in photocatalytic membrane filtration pmf systems due to their low cost some commonly used polymeric membranes are polysulfone ps polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polyacrylonitrile pan the photocatalytic membrane filtration system can be fabricated by embedding catalyst nanoparticles within the membrane or coating spraying over the commercial membrane or membrane itself made with the catalyst material the membrane coating with the photocatalysts has been achieved by different methods such as dip coating 108 electrospraying 109 and magnetron sputtering 110 the tio2 sol gel solution is typically used in the dip coating method 111 wang et al 112 used the sol gel technique to spin coat water soluble chitosan to produce tio2 membranes on an alumina support compared to the spray coating method nanoparticles embedded membrane is a simple technique to fabricate photocatalysts and improves catalyst recycling rosman et al 113 fabricated pvdf zno ag2co3 ag2o nanocomposite for ibuprofen ibu degradation the synergistic effect of hybrid membrane photocatalysis pvdf zno ag2co3 ag2o irradiated with visible light showed higher ibu removal 35 27 compared to pvdf zno ag2co3 ag2o in dark condition 27 37 additionally the hybrid system membranes susceptibility to fouling has been significantly decreased by the photocatalytic activity the electrochemical ec technique is a promising aop for the degradation of organic pollutants using anode material with very high voltage this leads to the generation of strong oxidation species and improves degradation however the ec process is controlled by mass transfer rate when treating low concentrations of pollutants which results in low energy efficiency 114 115 kashani et al 116 employed an integrated process combining electro peroxone with a sacrificial iron anode ep iron for ciprofloxacin cip degradation under optimal conditions cip was completely degraded in 40 min with a rate constant of 0 126 min the ep iron process showed better performance compared to other methods completely degrading cip within 40 min optimal conditions were a ph of 3 an ozone dosage of 33 1 mg l and an applied current of 180 ma the ep iron process also achieved significant mineralization and removal of total organic carbon toc with oxidation playing a dominant role real hospital wastewater tests demonstrated up to 85 elimination of cip and a 45 reduction in toc using the ep iron system 116 ahmadi et al 117 utilized a facile method to fabricate a carbonaceous aerogel electrode doped with iron ii for the electro fenton process achieving ceftazidime caz removal efficiency of 95 34 under optimal conditions of current density 400 ma ph 4 process time 110 min and caz concentration 40 mg l ghanbari et al 117 investigated pct degradation under ultrasound us assisted heterogeneous electro fenton process using fe2o3 nanoparticles as a catalyst the synergistic effect of ultrasound and electro fenton process resulted in 98 9 pct degradation under optimal conditions of ph 5 fe2o3 concentration 0 15 g l current density 230 ma us power 100 w process time 60 min and pct concentration 20 mg l hassani et al 118 reviewed the integration of ultrasound with ec processes for the effective decomposition of organic pollutants the synergistic effect of ultrasound and electrochemistry enhances mineralization through cavitation thus electro fenton sono electro fenton and sono ec are the feasible methods for pharmaceutical degradation synergistic integration of ec and membrane system through a reactive ec membrane rem used as anode enhances the advantages and addresses the limitations of individual techniques in the integrated rem the diffusion time of micropollutant from the center of the pore to the electrode surface is significantly reduced leading to an enhanced mass transfer rate ti4o7 rem is the most suitable anode material for ec oxidation due to its highest conductivity good thermal and chemical stability and high energy efficiency ti4o7 rem was integrated into the electro fenton process for the degradation of pct 119 in this system fig 7 oh radicals were generated in both the retentate from fenton s reaction and at the rem from anodic oxidation the integrated process resulted in 67 toc removal with high mineralization current efficiency mce of 43 as compared to the individual rem 47 toc removal with mce of 30 and ef 31 toc removal with mce of 20 techniques 119 ganzenko et al 120 employed the integrated ti4o7 rem electro fenton system for the carbamazepine 100 Î¼g l degradation from wwtp secondary effluent the integrated system resulted in 98 carbamazepine removal and 70 mineralization with an optimal energy consumption of 0 15 kwh g of toc removal therefore the integrated rem electro fenton is a cost effective and viable technology even for the degradation the pcs with low concentrations of pollutants table 3 summarizes the removal of pcs using coupled membrane aop systems 3 3 integration of aop with biological method pharmaceutical degradation using aops might be effective but they are energy intensive and requires relatively higher treatment cost due to the use of chemicals and catalysts separation and recovery of catalyst is another challenge with some aops the high operating cost and increased energy consumption of aops lead to increased treatment costs thus there is a need to explore cost effective routes for the complete degradation of pcs biological methods are cost effective and eco friendly wastewater treatment methods they operate in mild conditions and produce high yields however the application of biological methods is limited to biodegradable organic contaminants the biological methods are less effective for non biodegradable pcs in addition biological treatments provide slow and partial degradation therefore the aop and biological methods are coupled synergistically to exploit their advantages and overcome their limitations the combined hybrid systems fig 8 present significant advantages over the individual treatments the aops biological integrated techniques have been explored for pharmaceutical degradation the integrated system offers cost effective and efficient treatment with improved permeate quality uv h2o2 has been used as a post treatment to the activated sludge as process for the effective degradation of pcs 127 da silva et al 127 investigated as uv h2o2 for the degradation of five pcs namely cbz act dcf smx and ethinylestradiol ee from synthetic solution a comparison of as uv h2o2 and integration of as uv h2o2 treatments for the removal of 5 pcs is shown in fig 9 among the 5 pcs ee showed the highest biodegradation due to its excellent biodegradability 128 and cbz showed the lowest biodegradability in as process the poor biodegradability of cbz has been reported by several researchers 129 130 low removal of ee at 10 mg l of uv h2o2 post treatment was attributed to its lowest initial concentration compared to other pcs furthermore 10 mg l of h2o2 and 195 84 kj m2 uv resulted in over 98 degradation of all pcs in the combined process 127 james et al 131 employed a combined as mf ro uv h2o2 system at a pilot scale for the degradation of micropollutants from municipal wastewater n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and endocrine disrupting substances edcs were significantly removed 99 under optimal conditions of h2o2 and uv recently biologically treated wastewater containing cbz cpr clar dcf meto sita and smx was subjected to v uv o3 treatment and led to 80 100 removal for most of the compounds 132 thus irradiation peroxone post treatment to biologically treated aqueous solution is a promising approach for the effective removal of pcs the use of electro fenton oxidation facilitates the degradation of non degradable compounds by converting them into more biodegradable products such biodegradable products can be efficiently removed by a post biological treatment the combined electro fenton biological ef bio treatment also reduces the overall operating cost to make it economically attractive olvera vargas et al 133 employed the combined ef bio process for the degradation of pharmaceuticals furosemide and ranitidine from synthetic wastewater the combined system substantially reduced the operational cost for the complete mineralization of pcs after 1 h of electrolysis the biodegradability of the treated effluent was improved with bod5 cod ratio values of 0 41 and 0 37 for furosemide and ranitidine respectively the same combined treatment ef bio was used for the mineralization of another drug metoprolol from the synthetic solution and 90 mineralization was achieved 47 mineralization was achieved during 1 h of electro fenton oxidation pretreatment and the rest 43 was achieved in 4 days using a biological process 134 ganzenko et al 135 also used a combined ef bio treatment for the degradation of 13 pcs from a synthetic solution an optimal fe 2 concentration and current were obtained as 0 2 mm and 400 ma respectively the 3 h of treatment at 500 and 1000 ma was sufficient to enhance biodegradability martÃ­nez et al 136 used a combined fenton biological f bio system for the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater the fenton pretreatment improved the biodegradability at 70 c using 7 5 mg h2o2 mg toc and led to 35 toc removal the biological post treatment led to enhanced toc removal of 90 further the combined system f bio resulted in a 36 cost reduction compared to single fenton oxidation the membrane bioreactor mbr 137 offers the synergistic benefits of membrane filtration and biological reactors for the effective mineralization of pharmaceutical compounds the mbr is a promising technique to achieve high removal efficiency compared to conventional activated sludge cas systems the mbr eliminates the pollutants by membrane separation adsorption and biodegradation mechanisms the nature of pharmaceutical pollutants and their concentration ph hydraulic retention time hrt solids retention time srt temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration are the important parameters affecting the performance of mbr the membrane fouling high pumping costs and low biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds are major limitations of the mbr 138 fig 10 illustrates the two fundamental mbr setups side stream external mbr and immersed submerged mbr the membrane module is directly positioned within the reactor in a submerged mbr and the driving force is produced by either raising the pressure in the bioreactor or lowering it on the permeate side the membrane module is located outside the bioreactor in an external mbr the membrane fouling can be reduced by mbr with dynamic membranes with relatively low energy costs 139 the integration of aops and mbr provides complete mineralization improves permeate quality helps to control membrane fouling and minimizes costs ouarda et al 140 investigated the electrochemical oxidation mbr eo mbr combination with both eo as pre treatment and post treatment for the degradation of four pharmaceuticals cbz ibu estradiol ee and venlafaxine ven from hospital wastewater the mbr eo coupling eo as post treatment provided high

another investigation eo with ti pbo2 anode was used as the post treatment to the mbr for cbz removal from synthetic wastewater and provided complete removal whereas the mbr alone provided only 20 removal 141 kaya et al 142 used the ozonation anaerobic mbr system for the pharmaceutical wastewater and they obtained the removal efficiencies of cod and etodolac as 85 90 and 100 respectively lastre acosta et al 143 investigated the performance of mbr ozonation and mbr ozonation combined systems toward sulfadiazine sfz removal from simulated wastewater the mbr system resulted in the satisfactory removal of bod5 91 5 cod 93 1 and toc 96 3 however the removal of sfz was only 33 in contrast the mbr o3 system showed complete removal of sdz 100 and improved performance toward toc 97 bod5 94 and

hospital wastewater and reported complete removal using mbr and cw the coupled system was reported to be an optimal technology for the pre treatment of hospital wastewater table 4 compiles the removal of pcs using coupled aop biological systems 4 advantages and disadvantages of different techniques and comparative study the selection of treatment methods to clean polluted water depends upon the cost effectiveness and efficacy of the treatment process in the available treatment technologies biological treatment is recommended for a higher biodegradability index bi containing wastewater 154 while chemical and advanced treatment options are recommended for lower bi or higher initial organic load containing wastewater adsorption based treatment options are recommended for metallic and lower load containing pollutants other advanced treatment options like membrane separation pressurized reactor treatments etc needs high operational installation and maintenance cost and their individual use in wastewater treatment may need high operational and maintenance cost larger space and time requirements in biological treatment secondary pollutants generation during adsorption higher operation and maintenance costs in pressurized and many advanced treatments option restrict their use in wastewater treatment generally the pharmaceutical industry produces wastewater enriched with heavy metals lower bi and higher pollutant loads therefore aops based treatment options could be an effective approach for industrial wastewater treatment the effectiveness of the aops depends on the operating conditions and the type of contaminants in the wastewater while aop based techniques are capable to treat almost all types of wastewater in which pollutants are removed in terms of co2 h2o and precipitation 155 therefore integrating other treatment options with aop can achieve an effective treatment solution the advantages and disadvantages of different aop integrated treatments are summarized in table 5 a comparative study of different integrated systems in terms of treatment efficiency versatility sludge production and waste management operational complexity energy consumption and treatment cost can suggest the feasibility of these methods for wastewater treatment table 6 provides a comparative analysis of integrated processes 5 cost comparison of different aop based integrated techniques the cost for the integrated aop treatment process can be calculated as per the following equation 1 integrated aop treatment cost a b c d where a energy cost for integrated aop process b material cost c sludge scum disposal cost d energy cost recovered from sludge scum treatment cost and their efficacy by aop and aop integrated processes for various types of wastewater treatment have been compared and presented in table 7 the comparative table indicates treatment cost and efficacy depend upon the types composition and organic load of wastewater 62 individual aop treatment shows higher treatment costs in comparison with aop integrated systems generally for the treatment of high organic load containing wastewater with lower bi us treatment can be recommended to destabilize the pollutants and further can be easily treated by aop individual use of peroxide based treatment could be a costlier treatment option while the integration of h2o2 with some other aop option e g ec could reduce the overall use of chemicals and reduces the treatment cost since adsorption based treatment is effective for lower organic containing wastewater aop followed by adsorption could be recommended for sustainable wastewater treatment overall it indicates individual aop operation needs more investment in comparison with the coupling of aop with other processes 6 future perspectives the scientific community working in this field can explore the following areas to gain a deeper understanding and broader perspectives in this area a researchers have explored integrating aops with adsorption membrane and biological methods for pc removal however there is limited exploration of combining aops with low cost sustainable materials like clay and agricultural biomass based adsorbents e g biochar addressing the challenge of adsorbent regeneration is crucial and future research should focus on cost effective regeneration techniques additionally ensuring sustainability in aops by utilizing renewable sources of illumination such as solar energy is important detailed economic analysis of integrated techniques including installation operating and maintenance costs is lacking in the published literature and it would greatly aid the design of cost effective methods on a larger scale b the combination of membrane bioreactor systems and aops for the decontamination of aqueous solutions with pcs has been explored however membrane fouling remains a major concern future work should concentrate on developing low cost anti fouling membrane materials and efficient cleaning techniques that consider physicochemical and mass transfer aspects integration of aops with self cleaning membrane systems is also a promising area for future research c integration of aops with adsorption membrane and biological methods has been investigated however achieving optimal integration in terms of process design and operating conditions requires further effort extensive investigation is needed to determine the optimal operating conditions that ensure maximum effectiveness of the combined treatments 7 conclusions the presence of pcs including antibiotics anticonvulsants nsaids Î² blocker etc in the aqueous system is a major concern for the environment the evaluation pcs toxicity is crucial for ensuring safety regulatory compliance and minimizing environmental and health impact to address the challenges posed by pcs present in wastewater it is necessary to establish an efficient and cost effective treatment system the integration of aops with other techniques including adsorption membrane filtration and biological methods are promising approaches for the effective remediation of pcs however every integrated treatment has its advantages and limitations the removal efficiency of the integrated process depends upon the nature of pcs type of aop and type of physical and biological processes and operating variables the removal efficiency is also found to be dependent upon the use of aop as a pretreatment or post treatment method in the integration process therefore an experimental investigation is a necessary step to finalize an integrative approach for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds the different combinations of aop based integrated processes also resulted in a variation in the cost of wastewater treatment the comparative analysis has been conducted to assess the treatment efficiency versatility sludge production and waste management operational complexity energy consumption and treatment cost of different integrated systems these analyses provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach the cost analysis of various aop based integrated methods serves as a crucial guideline for selecting the most suitable approach for efficient pollutant removal from diverse aqueous matrices by considering these factors researchers can make informed decisions and choose appropriate techniques for specific applications furthermore the future perspective on aop based integration techniques aims to motivate current and prospective researchers in this field fostering further

12423,the presence of pharmaceutical compounds pcs in aqueous systems poses a significant threat to ecological systems conventional methods are inadequate in removing these compounds from wastewater

operational complexity energy consumption and treatment cost of different integrated systems this analysis provides profound insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach one of the significant contributions of this work is the study of the cost analysis of different aop based integrated methods this analysis serves as a crucial guideline for selecting the most suitable integrated approach for efficient pollutant removal from diverse aqueous matrices finally the future perspective on aop based integration techniques is defined to engage and inspire both current and prospective researchers in this field fostering further advancements and innovations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption advanced oxidation processes cost analysis hybrid process pharmaceuticals data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a vital component for nourishing ecosystems the continuous use of water in agriculture transportation and industries is depleting this limited resource 1 the increasing population and rapid industrial expansion have escalated the demand for clean water moreover advancements in health medications have resulted in a substantial rise in pharmaceutical product usage consequently the production and consumption of pharmaceutical compounds pcs have significantly elevated their concentration in water and wastewater matrices in recent decades the pcs are mainly consisting of antibiotics analgesics antipyretics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids antivirals antiparasitics and cardiovascular drugs 2 although their concentration in aqueous systems is very low e g ng l their presence adversely affects the ecological system and the health of living organisms 3 the pcs enter the aqueous system through pharmaceutical industries effluent human and animal excreta effluent from health care institutions inappropriate disposal of expired medicines and pcs used in agriculture household hospital and veterinary 4 5 removal of pcs is critical as they are chemically stable non biodegradable and bio accumulative in the living organism 6 besides pcs appear in aquatic bodies as a stable and bio transformed molecular product form due to the intensive and continuous use of pharmaceuticals 7 therefore it is essential to develop an advanced promising and sustainable technology for removing or degrading pcs from wastewater pharmaceutical compound toxicity evaluation includes assessing acute and chronic toxicity genotoxicity reproductive and developmental toxicity chronic toxicity ecological toxicity and carcinogenicity understanding these risks is essential for safety regulatory compliance and minimizing environmental impact contaminated drinking water reservoirs pose adverse effects like headaches nausea asthma and bone diseases cancer related antibiotics in water sources can cause embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in pregnant women an efficient and cost effective treatment system is crucial for pc wastewater and a comprehensive assessment of pc toxicity is necessary over the last two decades there has been a lot of research on the fate toxicity and impacts of pcs and their potential degradation strategies from various water matrices 8 9 fig 1 represents pcs possible sources fate and impact on humans the environment and aquatic life the advances in analytical technologies 10 11 for identifying and detecting pcs at ng l levels motivated researchers in this field table 1 summarizes commonly detected pharmaceuticals in aqueous systems including their concentrations and their detrimental impacts on public health and biota although pcs are present in trace amounts ng l to Î¼g l their properties such as lipophilicity volatility polarity adsorption persistence etc adversely affect their removal rate and efficiency by conventional techniques 12 13 conventional sewage treatment plants are designed to treat biodegradable compounds 14 and therefore the non biodegradable pcs cannot be removed effectively through conventional sewage treatment plants 15 thus there is a need to implement combined or hybrid technologies for the effective removal of these contaminants from aqueous systems it is crucial to highlight the distinction between combined and hybrid processes as they are frequently used interchangeably in a combined process two or more techniques are sequentially implemented individually one after another on the other hand a hybrid process integrates multiple techniques synergistically and optimally in a single vessel to facilitate the removal or degradation process these technologies must exhibit effectiveness sustainability and economic viability this paper utilizes the sign to represent combined processes and the or sign to denote hybrid processes recently aops have been extensively explored for the efficient degradation mineralization of pcs from various aqueous matrices 34 35 these processes are based on the generation of reactive species of hydroxyl ion h o radicals with high oxidizing power 36 the radical species oxidize the complex molecules into smaller fragments or completely mineralize them some popular aops commonly used for the degradation of residual pharmaceuticals include ozone based aops 37 uv based aops 38 fenton based aops 39 sonolysis 40 electro oxidation 41 wet air oxidation 34 sulfate radicals based aops 42 ferrioxalate oxidation 43 visible light driven z scheme photocatalysis 44 and persulfate oxidation 45 processes they exhibit high degradation efficiency non selectivity rapid degradation rates and eco friendly characteristics making them promising compared to other techniques however their main limitations are the relatively high capital and operating costs to enhance cost effectiveness aops are integrated with physicochemical and or biological techniques ensuring environmentally sustainable remediation and the production of clean water this paper critically reviews aop based integrated techniques for removing pcs valuable insights from global researchers work are obtained through comprehensive bibliographic analysis the integration of aops with other techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration and biological methods is extensively examined additionally a comparative

is focused on the treatment of wastewater containing very low concentration pcs in the range of ng l of cod using aops however the effluents from the hospitals and pharmaceutical production plants are highly contaminated e g in the range of several g l of cod and considered industrial effluents the aop alone is not adequate for the treatment of industrial effluent in compliance with environmental regulations to meet regulatory compliance the aops have been integrated with other techniques for cost effective mineralization the optimal integration of aops with other techniques overcomes the limitations of individual treatments process in terms of economic and technological competitiveness the optimal integration of treatment techniques can provide a better alternative concerning cost time and efficiency which can be implemented at a commercial scale for the treatment of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater the aop is integrated with physical and biological methods for the effective removal of toxic pcs the following section discusses the integration of aop based integrated combined hybrid technologies for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 3 1 integrated adsorption aop systems adsorption is one of the most commonly used treatment methods due to its simple design mild operating conditions low investment and operating costs 46 47 integrated adsorption aop systems are designed to effectively remove pollutants from contaminated water by combining the adsorption and degradation capabilities of two distinct treatment methods as illustrated in fig 3 the mechanism of integrated adsorption aop systems typically involves the adsorption followed by aop treatment and synergistic effects of both treatments during the adsorption stage a solid adsorbent material is employed to remove target pollutants from the water this can be achieved through various mechanisms such as surface complexation ion exchange physical adsorption electrostatic interactions or chemical bonding depending on the nature of the adsorbent and the contaminants as a result the concentration of contaminants in the wastewater is reduced following the adsorption step the effluent is subjected to aops this process involves the generation of highly reactive oxidizing species which can break down the remaining pollutants that were not removed by adsorption the oxidizing species react with the pollutants leading to their degradation into smaller less harmful byproducts such as carbon dioxide and water the combined approach enhances the overall efficiency of the treatment system it is important to note that the specific mechanisms and performance of integrated adsorption aop systems can vary depending on factors such as the adsorbent material used the type and concentration of contaminants in the wastewater and the specific aop technique employed researchers have explored various adsorbents including activated carbon 48 clay materials 49 bio adsorbents 50 metal organic framework and biochar 51 52 for the removal of a variety of pcs from different aqueous matrices husein et al 53 used green synthesized copper nano adsorbent for the removal of nsaids diclofenac dcf naproxen npx and ibuprofen ibu in a lab scale batch process and observed 74 4 86 9 and 91 4 removal of ibu npx and dcf respectively powdered activated carbon pac removed 87 of ciprofloxacin 54 95 of amoxicillin 55 and 80 96 of quinolone antibiotics 56 granular activated carbon was used to remove pharmaceuticals and pesticides and reported 82 removal 57 lin et al 58 used iron nanoparticles and observed 92 removal of rifampicin in 120 min with 0 5 g l of adsorbent dose mondal et al 59 prepared the gooseberry seed shells activated carbon gb ac adsorbent and a composite of gb ac with graphite powder and silver nanoparticles gb ac g ag for npx removal in a batch experiment at lab scale the optimal npx removal of 61 99 and 87 3 were obtained using gb ac and gb ac g ag respectively the use of the metal organic framework and their derivates for the removal of pcs have been extensively reviewed 60 61 the complete degradation of pcs using adsorption alone could not be achieved also conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed for the complete degradation of pcs as such researchers have explored the integration of aop and adsorption for the effective degradation of pcs a combination of peroxone aop and adsorption was used for the removal of pharmaceuticals from real pharmaceutical wastewater 62 the effluent was pretreated with peroxone and granular activated carbon gac was used as post treatment the peroxone treatment removed cod in the range of 75 88 5 for ph 5 11 and the total cod removal after gac post treatment was achieved between 85 4 and 92 7 a combined adsorption and catalytic ozonation system using commercial activated carbon as well as metal oxide fe2o3 ceo2 impregnated activated carbon moac was used for the investigation of sulfamethoxazole smz removal from aqueous solution 63 both the smz removal and ozone consumption efficiency were better for the moac o3 combination as compared to the pac o3 combination 63 mojiri et al 64 designed a combined ozonation reactor and cross linked chitosan bentonite fixed bed column system fig 4 for acetaminophen act and amoxicillin amx removal from synthetic solution the degradation of act and amx with an ozone reactor was optimized using an artificial neural network ann the ozone reactor removed 84 8 of act and 82 7 of amx under optimal conditions the act and amx were completely removed after adsorption in the chitosan bentonite fixed bed column tio2 is a commonly used photocatalyst due to its excellent catalytic activity and good stability however the catalyst has to be recovered for the economic sustainability of a process immobilizing the catalyst using an adsorbent carrier facilitates pollutant removal by adsorption and helps in catalyst recovery zheng et al 65 investigated ciprofloxacin degradation using a hybrid tio2 graphitized mesoporous carbon nanocomposite and reported complete degradation by adsorption photocatalysis in a similar work belhouchet et al 66 employed calcite mineral tio2 nanocomposite for the degradation of tetracycline tc and reported efficient mineralization the experiment was conducted under solar irradiation and uv light after 300 min of irradiation 90 of the tc was eliminated by uv and 82 by solar irradiation tio2 zeolite integrated photocatalytic adsorbent hybrid was synthesized for the degradation of amoxicillin 67 the photocatalytic adsorbent was pretreated with acid alkaline and calcined at 300 c under n2 and resulting in efficient degradation of amoxicillin huang et al 68 utilized a low cost bio adsorbent alkali cooking modified rice straw fiber amsf coated with tio2 hydrogels tio2 amsf to synthesize a low cost photocatalytic adsorbent for ciprofloxacin remediation from aqueous solution surface coating of amsf using tio2 hydrogels facilitated regeneration and the removal process was controlled by a continuous adsorption photodegradation process tio2 amsf removed the maximum ciprofloxacin during uv irradiation 153 mg g single atom catalysts sacs offer the advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts making them highly effective in aops carbon based single metal atom catalysts e g nitrogen doped fe sacs exhibit high activity selectivity and stability 69 zhou et al 70 developed an efficient single atom catalyst sa mn nsc to activate peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade a wide range of pollutants including enrofloxacin enr within 10 min the catalyst exhibited exceptional activity and stability xia et al 71 explored autogenous n rich biochar derived from spirulina npsbs for activating peroxydisulfate pds to degrade 97 59 of smx within 40 min biochar derived from agricultural wastes has been utilized as catalysts and catalytic support in aops for the effective removal of organic pollutants 72 the engineered nanomaterials such as graphene and its derivatives have high surface areas as well a very high catalytic activity 73 these materials have a great potential for remediation of pcs by adsorption as well as aop the nanoscale zero valent iron has been utilized as a catalyst in the fenton process in the presence of h2o2 for the enhanced degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic 74 however the presence of van der walls and magnetic forces leads to the aggregation of nanoscale zero valent iron which subsequently lowers its surface reactivity this can be addressed by utilizing mechanical support material such as reduced graphene oxide to immobilize zero valent iron particles 75 masud et al 76 employed reduced graphene oxide as a support for nanoscale zero valent iron to prepare nanohybrids which was synergistically utilized as both an adsorbent and a heterogeneous fenton catalyst for the degradation of antibiotics anti seizure and nsaids the hybrid aop adsorption process showed superior 93 removal efficiency and faster removal for pcs compared to the adsorption treatment hassani et al 77 utilized uva led assisted cofe2o4 reduced graphene oxide cfo rgo nanocomposites to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for bisphenol a degradation the nanocomposite achieved over 99 removal of bpa within 30 min using 150 mg l pms 400 mg l cfo rgo and a ph range of 3 9 yaghoot nezhad et al 78 employed uv e chlorination hematite nanoparticles as a photocatalytic method to degrade bpa the process achieved a 99 4 decontamination efficiency within 40 min under optimal conditions he et al 79 synthesized mn o pcn a co doped polymeric carbon nitride catalyst and activated pms for enrofloxacin enr removal the mn o pcn pms system exhibited excellent reactivity for enr degradation the catalytic system also exhibited excellent reusability table 2 summarizes the integrated adsorption aop systems for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds the review suggests that the hybrid of adsorption photocatalysis using various photocatalytic adsorbents composite is an attractive technique for the effective degradation of pcs from various water matrices however the higher cost of photocatalysts and the disposal challenges of saturated composite inhibit their use for large scale applications there is a need to explore low cost adsorbents e g biochar based photocatalysts this will also address the issue of the disposal of saturated composite the reusability and stability of catalysts are crucial in integrated aop adsorption systems catalyst reusability refers to its ability to be used multiple times without significant activity loss while stability is maintaining catalytic activity over time efficient catalysts with high reusability and stability reduce costs and ensure consistent treatment efficiency mn o pcn a co doped polymeric carbon nitride catalyst 79 zinc based nano catalysts modified with nanocarbon 80 fe3o4 ac tio2 81 and co3o4 cnt carbon nanotube catalysts 82 demonstrated exceptional stability and reusability these catalysts can be reused without significant deterioration in their performance they offer cost effective and sustainable solutions for wastewater treatment and other applications 3 2 integrated aop membrane systems membrane processes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration are widely used for the removal of contaminants from wastewater however the membrane process is only a physical method and it must be integrated with other degradation methods such as chemical oxidation for the effective removal of pcs integration of aop with membrane technology has been explored for the remediation of pharmaceutical residue from aqueous solution in the integrated approach the aop mineralize the complex molecules into simple one and the membrane system allows the effluent to pass through them this improves the membrane performance enhances the permeate water flux and minimizes fouling the integrated system of aop and membrane filtration allows for the removal of both particulate and dissolved contaminants the membrane filtration step removes larger particles and suspended matter while the subsequent aop treatment addresses dissolved organic compounds and recalcitrant contaminants overall the mechanism of integrated aop membrane systems involves the combination of membrane filtration for pre treatment which removes larger particles and protects the aop process followed by aop treatment using highly reactive hydroxyl radicals to effectively degrade organic contaminants in the water this integrated approach provides enhanced water treatment efficiency improved contaminant removal and the potential for advanced treatment of various organic pollutants it s important to note that the performance and mechanisms of integrated aop membrane systems can vary depending on factors such as the specific aop and membrane technologies used the characteristics of the wastewater and the operational conditions a general schematic of the integrated aop membrane systems is illustrated in fig 5 the aop and membrane system can be integrated into three different modes i membrane filtration followed by aop 90 91 ii aop followed by membrane filtration 92 93 and iii aop and membrane filtration simultaneous treatment in which the oxidation and filtration processes are carried out simultaneously 94 the integration of aop and membrane filtration offer several advantages such as the ability to remove by product during oxidation and the prevention of membrane fouling 95 96 the combined fenton oxidation and reverse osmosis removed 99 of amoxicillin from the aqueous solution 97 researchers have explored the use of organic membranes and ceramic membranes for coupling of ozonation membrane filtration system he et al 94 employed a hybrid heterogeneous catalytic ozonation membrane filtration pvdf flat sheet membrane system for degradation of bisphenol a bpa from aqueous solution and observed 81 2 of bpa degradation in 150 min compared to 62 using ozonation membrane filtration without catalyst system liu et al 98 combined nanofiltration using organic membrane polyamine polyester membrane and ozone based aop for the degradation of antibiotics from wastewater and reported 99 degradation vatankhah et al 93 employed combined ozonation nanofiltration polyamide membrane and reported 94 removal of dissolved organic matter and considerable mitigation in membrane fouling compared to filtration without pre ozonation thus the coupled membrane and catalytic ozonation ozonation are promising approaches to mitigate the fouling of organic membranes heterogeneous catalytic ozonation employs various metal oxides 99 to enhance the o3 decomposition into oh radicals and reactive oxygen species and thereby facilitates the complete mineralization of pcs 100 however their widespread application is limited by catalyst recovery and agglomeration in slurry reactors ceramic membranes 101 are useful catalyst support to address these limitations of the catalytic ozonation process researchers have explored the application of various ceramic membranes in coupled ozonation membrane systems 102 the hybrid ozonation membrane filtration system was used to degrade antibiotics from the synthetic water 103 the membrane support and separation layer was made of Î± al2o3 and tio2 respectively the hybrid ozone membrane filtration showed an enhanced removal rate of antibiotics as compared to the single membrane filtration lee et al 104 employed a ceox and mnox impregnated catalytic ceramic membrane in a hybrid catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system for the degradation of micropollutants namely bpa benzotriazole and clofibric acid the ceox impregnated catalytic ceramic membrane had a higher mineralization ability and efficient ozone utilization than the mnox impregnated catalytic ceramic membrane the ceramic membrane is chemical and thermal resistant and has longer lifetimes however the relatively high cost of the catalytic ceramic membrane is a major concern with this method the cementitious membrane fabricated from portland cement is a low cost candidate for a hybrid catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system with enhanced ozone decomposition ability the metal oxides and silicates present in hydrate cement catalyze ozone decomposition and enhance the micropollutant degradation efficiency wang et al 105 fabricated a cementitious membrane based hybrid catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system for the degradation of p chloronitrobenzene a synthetic intermediate used in pharmaceutical applications and reported that the hybrid system decomposed 1 5 mg l of o3 and enhanced the p chloronitrobenzene removal by 50 lan et al 106 employed a heterogeneous fenton reaction with a membrane filtration hybrid fig 6 for the degradation of ibuprofen from water the hybrid system consists of a hollow fiber membrane immersed into a fe loaded zeolite fe zsm5 fenton reactor which ensures catalytic retention during treatment the immersed membrane is a compact configuration and consumes less energy compared to the external membrane filtration system the investigation was focused on the fouling control strategies in the hybrid fenton reactor the critical flux to eliminate the irreversible fouling was obtained as 23 l h m2 two fouling control strategies were proposed the first strategy was to operate the system below the critical flux however this strategy has a negative impact on productivity therefore when the operating flux is higher than the critical flux hydrodynamic back washing was proposed as a second strategy the coupling of ceramic membrane and aop is a promising approach to effectively degrade pcs present in an aqueous solution with varying conditions of temperatures pressures solvents and ph the photocatalytic membrane is a hybrid technology of membrane filtration and photocatalysis the integrated techniques facilitate the separation and recovery of photocatalysts and the decomposition of rejected micropollutants via photocatalysis which subsequently reduces membrane fouling 107 polymeric membranes are the preferred choice for their application in photocatalytic membrane filtration pmf systems due to their low cost some commonly used polymeric membranes are polysulfone ps polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polyacrylonitrile pan the photocatalytic membrane filtration system can be fabricated by embedding catalyst nanoparticles within the membrane or coating spraying over the commercial membrane or membrane itself made with the catalyst material the membrane coating with the photocatalysts has been achieved by different methods such as dip coating 108 electrospraying 109 and magnetron sputtering 110 the tio2 sol gel solution is typically used in the dip coating method 111 wang et al 112 used the sol gel technique to spin coat water soluble chitosan to produce tio2 membranes on an alumina support compared to the spray coating method nanoparticles embedded membrane is a simple technique to fabricate photocatalysts and improves catalyst recycling rosman et al 113 fabricated pvdf zno ag2co3 ag2o nanocomposite for ibuprofen ibu degradation the synergistic effect of hybrid membrane photocatalysis pvdf zno ag2co3 ag2o irradiated with visible light showed higher ibu removal 35 27 compared to pvdf zno ag2co3 ag2o in dark condition 27 37 additionally the hybrid system membranes susceptibility to fouling has been significantly decreased by the photocatalytic activity the electrochemical ec technique is a promising aop for the degradation of organic pollutants using anode material with very high voltage this leads to the generation of strong oxidation species and improves degradation however the ec process is controlled by mass transfer rate when treating low concentrations of pollutants which results in low energy efficiency 114 115 kashani et al 116 employed an integrated process combining electro peroxone with a sacrificial iron anode ep iron for ciprofloxacin cip degradation under optimal conditions cip was completely degraded in 40 min with a rate constant of 0 126 min the ep iron process showed better performance compared to other methods completely degrading cip within 40 min optimal conditions were a ph of 3 an ozone dosage of 33 1 mg l and an applied current of 180 ma the ep iron process also achieved significant mineralization and removal of total organic carbon toc with oxidation playing a dominant role real hospital wastewater tests demonstrated up to 85 elimination of cip and a 45 reduction in toc using the ep iron system 116 ahmadi et al 117 utilized a facile method to fabricate a carbonaceous aerogel electrode doped with iron ii for the electro fenton process achieving ceftazidime caz removal efficiency of 95 34

are the feasible methods for pharmaceutical degradation synergistic integration of ec and membrane system through a reactive ec membrane rem used as anode enhances the advantages and addresses the limitations of individual techniques in the integrated rem the diffusion time of micropollutant from the center of the pore to the electrode surface is significantly reduced leading to an enhanced mass transfer rate ti4o7 rem is the most suitable anode material for ec oxidation due to its highest conductivity good thermal and chemical stability and high energy efficiency ti4o7 rem was integrated into the electro fenton process for the degradation of pct 119 in this system fig 7 oh radicals were generated in both the retentate from fenton s reaction and at the rem from anodic oxidation the integrated process resulted in 67 toc removal with high mineralization current efficiency mce of 43 as compared to the individual rem 47 toc removal with mce of 30 and ef 31 toc removal with mce of 20 techniques 119 ganzenko et al 120 employed the integrated ti4o7 rem electro fenton system for the carbamazepine 100 Î¼g l degradation from wwtp secondary effluent the integrated system resulted in 98 carbamazepine removal and 70 mineralization with an optimal energy consumption of 0 15 kwh g of toc removal therefore the integrated rem electro fenton is a cost effective and viable technology even for the degradation the pcs with low concentrations of pollutants table 3 summarizes the removal of pcs using coupled membrane aop systems 3 3 integration of aop with biological method pharmaceutical degradation using aops might be effective but they are energy intensive and requires relatively higher treatment cost due to the use of chemicals and catalysts separation and recovery of catalyst is another challenge with some aops the high operating cost and increased energy consumption of aops lead to increased treatment costs thus there is a need to explore cost effective routes for the complete degradation of pcs biological methods are cost effective and eco friendly wastewater treatment methods they operate in mild conditions and produce high yields however the application of biological methods is limited to biodegradable organic contaminants the biological methods are less effective for non biodegradable pcs in addition biological treatments provide slow and partial degradation therefore the aop and biological methods are coupled synergistically to exploit their advantages and overcome their limitations the combined hybrid systems fig 8 present significant advantages over the individual treatments the aops biological integrated techniques have been explored for pharmaceutical degradation the integrated system offers cost effective and efficient treatment with improved permeate quality uv h2o2 has been used as a post treatment to the activated sludge as process for the effective degradation of pcs 127 da silva et al 127 investigated as uv h2o2 for the degradation of five pcs namely cbz act dcf smx and ethinylestradiol ee from synthetic solution a comparison of as uv h2o2 and integration of as uv h2o2 treatments for the removal of 5 pcs is shown in fig 9 among the 5 pcs ee showed the highest biodegradation due to its excellent biodegradability 128 and cbz showed the lowest biodegradability in as process the poor biodegradability of cbz has been reported by several researchers 129 130 low removal of ee at 10 mg l of uv h2o2 post treatment was attributed to its lowest initial concentration compared to other pcs furthermore 10 mg l of h2o2 and 195 84 kj m2 uv resulted in over 98 degradation of all pcs in the combined process 127 james et al 131 employed a combined as mf ro uv h2o2 system at a pilot scale for the degradation of micropollutants from municipal wastewater n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and endocrine disrupting substances edcs were significantly removed 99 under optimal conditions of h2o2 and uv recently biologically treated wastewater containing cbz cpr clar dcf meto sita and smx was subjected to v uv o3 treatment and led to 80 100 removal for most of the compounds 132 thus irradiation peroxone post treatment to biologically treated aqueous solution is a promising approach for the effective removal of pcs the use of electro fenton oxidation facilitates the degradation of non degradable compounds by converting them into more biodegradable products such biodegradable products can be efficiently removed by a post biological treatment the combined electro fenton biological ef bio treatment also reduces the overall operating cost to make it economically attractive olvera vargas et al 133 employed the combined ef bio process for the degradation of pharmaceuticals furosemide and ranitidine from synthetic wastewater the combined system substantially reduced the operational cost for the complete mineralization of pcs after 1 h of electrolysis the biodegradability of the treated effluent was improved with bod5 cod ratio values of 0 41 and 0 37 for furosemide and ranitidine respectively the same combined treatment ef bio was used for the mineralization of another drug metoprolol from the synthetic solution and 90 mineralization was achieved 47 mineralization was achieved during 1 h of electro fenton oxidation pretreatment and the rest 43 was achieved in 4 days using a biological process 134 ganzenko et al 135 also used a combined ef bio treatment for the degradation of 13 pcs from a synthetic solution an optimal fe 2 concentration and current were obtained as 0 2 mm and 400 ma respectively the 3 h of treatment at 500 and 1000 ma was sufficient to enhance biodegradability martÃ­nez et al 136 used a combined fenton biological f bio system for the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater the fenton pretreatment improved the biodegradability at 70 c using 7 5 mg h2o2 mg toc and led to 35 toc removal the biological post treatment led to enhanced toc removal of 90 further the combined system f bio resulted in a 36 cost reduction compared to single fenton oxidation the membrane bioreactor mbr 137 offers the synergistic benefits of membrane filtration and biological reactors for the effective mineralization of pharmaceutical compounds the mbr is a promising technique to achieve high removal efficiency compared to conventional activated sludge cas systems the mbr eliminates the pollutants by membrane separation adsorption and biodegradation mechanisms the nature of pharmaceutical pollutants and their concentration ph hydraulic retention time hrt solids retention time srt temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration are the important parameters affecting the performance of mbr the membrane fouling high pumping costs and low biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds are major limitations of the mbr 138 fig 10 illustrates the two fundamental mbr setups side stream external mbr and immersed submerged mbr the membrane module is directly positioned within the reactor in a submerged mbr and the driving force is produced by either raising the pressure in the bioreactor or lowering it on the permeate side the membrane module is located outside the bioreactor in an external mbr the membrane fouling can be reduced by mbr with dynamic membranes with relatively low energy costs 139 the integration of aops and mbr provides complete mineralization improves permeate quality helps to control membrane fouling and minimizes costs ouarda et al 140 investigated the electrochemical oxidation mbr eo mbr combination with both eo as pre treatment and post treatment for the degradation of four pharmaceuticals cbz ibu estradiol ee and venlafaxine ven from hospital wastewater the mbr eo coupling eo as post treatment provided high removal 97 of the four pharmaceutical pollutants compared to the eo mbr configuration eo as pre treatment furthermore the mbr alone provided 90 removal of ibu and e e and 10 removal of cbz and ven in another investigation eo with ti pbo2 anode was used as the post treatment to the mbr for cbz removal from synthetic wastewater and provided complete removal whereas the mbr alone provided only 20 removal 141 kaya et al 142 used the ozonation anaerobic mbr system for the pharmaceutical wastewater and they obtained the removal efficiencies of cod and etodolac as 85 90 and 100 respectively lastre acosta et al 143 investigated the performance of mbr ozonation and mbr ozonation combined systems toward sulfadiazine sfz removal from simulated wastewater the mbr system resulted in the satisfactory removal of bod5 91 5 cod 93 1 and toc 96 3 however the removal of sfz was only 33 in contrast the mbr o3 system showed complete removal of sdz 100 and improved performance toward toc 97 bod5 94 and cod 97 recently khan et al 144 investigated the effectiveness of coupled aops o3 and o3 h2o2 with mbr and constructed wetlands cw for the removal of ibuprofen carbamazepine frusemide and ofloxacin hospital wastewater and reported complete removal using mbr and cw the coupled system was reported to be an optimal technology for the pre treatment of hospital wastewater table 4 compiles the removal of pcs using coupled aop biological systems 4 advantages and disadvantages of different techniques and comparative study the selection of treatment methods to clean polluted water depends upon the cost effectiveness and efficacy of the treatment process in the available treatment technologies biological treatment is recommended for a higher biodegradability index bi containing wastewater 154 while chemical and advanced treatment options are recommended for lower bi or higher initial organic load containing wastewater adsorption based treatment options are recommended for metallic and lower load containing pollutants other advanced treatment options like membrane separation pressurized reactor treatments etc needs high operational installation and maintenance cost and their individual use in wastewater treatment may need high operational and maintenance cost larger space and time requirements in biological treatment secondary pollutants generation during adsorption higher operation and maintenance costs in pressurized and many advanced treatments option restrict their use in wastewater treatment generally the pharmaceutical industry produces wastewater enriched with heavy metals lower bi and higher pollutant loads therefore aops based treatment options could be an effective approach for industrial wastewater treatment the effectiveness of the aops depends on the operating conditions and the type of contaminants in the wastewater while aop based techniques are capable to treat almost all types of wastewater in which pollutants are removed in terms of co2 h2o and precipitation 155 therefore integrating other treatment options with aop can achieve an effective treatment solution the advantages and disadvantages of different aop integrated treatments are summarized in table 5 a comparative study of different integrated systems in terms of treatment efficiency versatility sludge production and waste management operational complexity energy consumption and treatment cost can suggest the feasibility of these methods for wastewater treatment table 6 provides a comparative analysis of integrated processes 5 cost comparison of different aop based integrated techniques the cost for the integrated aop treatment process can be calculated as per the following equation 1 integrated aop treatment cost a b c d where a energy cost for integrated aop process b material cost c sludge scum disposal cost d energy cost recovered from sludge scum treatment cost and their efficacy by aop and aop integrated processes for various types of wastewater treatment have been compared and presented in table 7 the comparative table indicates treatment cost and efficacy depend upon the types composition and organic load of wastewater 62 individual aop treatment shows higher treatment costs in comparison with aop integrated systems generally for the treatment of high organic load containing wastewater with lower bi us treatment can be recommended to destabilize the pollutants and further can be easily treated by aop individual use of peroxide based treatment could be a costlier treatment option while the integration of h2o2 with some other aop option e g ec could reduce the overall use of chemicals and reduces the treatment cost since adsorption based treatment is effective for lower organic containing wastewater aop followed by adsorption could be recommended for sustainable wastewater treatment overall it indicates individual aop operation needs more investment in comparison with the coupling of aop with other processes 6 future perspectives the scientific community working in this field can explore the following areas to gain a deeper understanding and broader perspectives in this area a researchers have explored integrating aops with adsorption membrane and biological methods for pc removal however there is limited exploration of combining aops with low cost sustainable materials like clay and agricultural biomass based adsorbents e g biochar addressing the challenge of adsorbent regeneration is crucial and future research should focus on cost effective regeneration techniques additionally ensuring sustainability in aops by utilizing renewable sources of illumination such as solar energy is important detailed economic analysis of integrated techniques including installation operating and maintenance costs is lacking in the published literature and it would greatly aid the design of cost effective methods on a larger scale b the combination of membrane bioreactor systems and aops for the decontamination of aqueous solutions with pcs has been explored however membrane fouling remains a major concern future work should concentrate on developing low cost anti fouling membrane materials and efficient cleaning techniques that consider physicochemical and mass transfer aspects integration of aops with self cleaning membrane systems is also a promising area for future research c integration of aops with adsorption membrane and biological methods has been investigated however achieving optimal integration in terms of process design and operating conditions requires further effort extensive investigation is needed to determine the optimal operating conditions that ensure maximum effectiveness of the combined treatments 7 conclusions the presence of pcs including antibiotics anticonvulsants nsaids Î² blocker etc in the aqueous system is a major concern for the environment the evaluation pcs toxicity is crucial for ensuring safety regulatory compliance and minimizing environmental and health impact to address the challenges posed by pcs present in wastewater it is necessary to establish an efficient and cost effective treatment system the integration of aops with other techniques including adsorption membrane filtration and biological methods are promising approaches for the effective remediation of pcs however every integrated treatment has its advantages and limitations the removal efficiency of the integrated process depends upon the nature of pcs type of aop and type of physical and biological processes and operating variables the removal efficiency is also found to be dependent upon the use of aop as a pretreatment or post treatment method in the integration process therefore an experimental investigation is a necessary step to finalize an integrative approach for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds the different combinations of aop based integrated processes also resulted in a variation in the cost of wastewater treatment the comparative analysis has been conducted to assess the treatment efficiency versatility sludge production and waste management operational complexity energy consumption and treatment cost of different integrated systems these analyses provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach the cost analysis of various aop based integrated methods serves as a crucial guideline for selecting the most suitable approach for efficient pollutant removal from diverse aqueous matrices by considering these factors researchers can make informed decisions and choose appropriate techniques for specific applications furthermore the future perspective on aop based integration techniques aims to motivate current and prospective researchers in this field fostering further

12424,the degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx was studied by anodic oxidation ao process using mixed metal oxide mmo electrodes with different ru ir ratios each electrode was characterized morphological and electrochemically the electrolyzes were performed in nacl and na2so4 applying two current densities 10 and 50 ma cm 2 the electrode with the highest composition of ir ru ir 30 70 showed greater smx degradation and generation of oxidizing species and was used to treat the antibiotic by ao and ao assisted by solar energy in natural water and actual municipal wastewater effluents the efficiency in smx degradation depends on the type of electrode used mmo and electrolytic medium all mmo electrodes reached almost total degradation of smx in chloride medium however 60 degradation of smx in sulfate medium was achieved with anode with lower ru ir ratio additionally degradation of smx in complex matrices can be successfully carried out by solar assisted ao and ao processes without the need to adjust the ph at room temperature and using anode with lower ru ir ratio finally the ao process assisted by solar energy reduced electrolysis times and the cell s potential leading to lower energy consumption keywords sulfamethoxazole anodic oxidation ru ir ratios electrodes solar energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are among the group of emerging contaminants that cause detrimental effects on aquatic organisms even at low concentrations 1 due to their toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature 2 among the most widely used antibiotics in the treatment of many bacterial infections is sulfamethoxazole smx 3 about 90 of this drug is excreted in the urine within 24 h after oral administration increasing toxicity in environmental matrices 4 it is important to mention that although the concentrations of smx in the environment are below those that can cause a toxic effect on humans 5 6 its accumulation in fish and birds can lead even at trace levels to the development of antibiotic resistance 4 which would have negative consequences for humans and represent a serious threat to the ecosystems 7 8 the biological processes that are commonly used in wastewater treatment plants do not achieve an efficient removal of this type of contaminant 7 9 which is related to its recalcitrant characteristics this reveals a need for alternative treatments that guarantee safe water without the presence of antibiotics in this context electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops represent an efficient and environmentally compatible alternative to eliminate these persistent pollutants 10 12 in these processes the oxidation of organic compounds occurs mainly through a reaction with highly oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radicals oh with e oh h2o 2 80 v she 13 this provides rapid kinetics in the decomposition of different pollutants and safety at work by not having to constantly handle reagents 14 among eaops anodic oxidation ao is a simple alternative in which physisorbed oh are generated on the surface of the anode m reaction r1 as a result of the electrochemical discharge of water this indicates that the nature of the anodic material plays an essential role in the efficiency of the treatment 11 15 r1 m h2o m oh h e the boron doped diamond bdd anode has been the most used to study the degradation of different contaminants including smx due to its great oxidizing power 16 however active anodes such as mixed metal oxides mmo have gained great interest due to their low cost excellent durability and easy scalability 17 19 when this type of anode is used the m oh are transformed into higher state oxides or superoxides mo through reaction r2 later the redox couple mo m acts as a selective mediator in the oxidation of organic compounds r regenerating the metal surface m through reaction r3 15 20 21 r2 m oh mo h e r3 mo r ro m these anodes usually consist of a substrate of titanium covered with an electroactive layer of ruthenium oxide ruo2 iridium oxide iro2 tantalum pentoxide ta2o5 titanium dioxide tio2 or tin dioxide sno2 22 however for the degradation of some contaminants ternary oxide electrodes such as ti ru ir have been tested 14 in this way the advantages of each electrode are used to obtain better anodes for example according to dos anjos bezerra et al 18 the presence of iro2 improves the stability of ruo2 in this sense the anodes based on ruo2 and iro2 present good electrocatalytic activity for o2 and cl2 evolutions 17 18 23 in addition both anodes have a low cl2 overpotential which favors the formation of active chlorine species 14 despite these advantages it is unknown how the composition of the anodic material ru ir ratio can influence degradation efficiency the objective of this work is to evaluate the degradation of smx using mmo electrodes with different ru ir ratios as anodes anode 1 ru ir 30 70 ti ru ir 65 10 50 24 50 anode 2 ru ir 50 50 ti ru ir 65 17 50 17 50 and anode 3 ru ir 70 30 ti ru ir 65 24 50 10 50 the efficiency of the electrochemical process was studied based on the effect of operating conditions that included current density the use of support electrolytes nacl or na2so4 and the effect of solar energy given the importance of ao in wastewater treatment the use of anodes with excellent electrochemical activity and a long service lifetime at the lowest possible cost is essential therefore this work could contribute to future applications of this technology at industrial scale 2 materials and methods

hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh all provided by j t baker in order to detect the free chlorine in the samples powder sachets of this reagent hach were used titanium iv oxysulfate evonik corporation

formic acid hplc grade were supplied by panreac and used for mobile phases preparation to analyze smx degradation by liquid chromatography hplc 2 2 water matrices experiments were carried out in demineralized water dw natural water nw and an actual secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant mwwtp table 1 shows the main characteristics of these water matrices actual mwwtp effluent was collected during the month of september 2021 at el bobar mwwtp located in almerÃ­a south east of spain the samples were collected in a 5 l drum and stored at 4 c for a maximum of two days 2 3 experimental set up 2 3 1 electrochemical system solutions of 25 mg l 1 of smx in dw were subjected to the ao process at room temperature each solution was adjusted to ph 7 with h2so4 or hcl and naoh the electrochemical system fig 1 consisted of 1 a reservoir with a working volume of 2 l of solution 2 a peristaltic pump heidolph 58120 type rzr2 3 a filter press electrochemical cell containing

precision that provides a constant current to carry out the electrolysis in galvanostatic mode and offers the potential difference that occurs between the electrodes in order to evaluate the effect of the anodic material on the degradation of smx in dw three electrodes corresponding to metallic oxides of ru and ir in different ratios and supported on a sheet of titanium were used anode 1 ru ir 30 70 ti ru ir 65 10 50 24 50 anode 2 ru ir 50 50 ti ru ir 65 17 50 17 50 and anode 3 ru ir 70 30 ti ru ir 65 24 50 10 50 all from nmt electrodes pty ltd pinetown south africa electrolyses with dw were carried out adding 50 mm of naso4 or 50 mm of nacl used as supporting electrolytes in addition to study the effect of the applied current density j these experiments were carried out applying two current densities one low j 10 ma cm 2 and one high j 50 ma cm 2 to remove impurities from the surfaces of the cathode and anodes the electrodes were polarized in a 0 10 m h2so4 solution at 80 ma cm 2 for 120 min before each electrolysis in each experiment the energy consumption ec per volume of electrolyzed solutions was determined using eq 1 in addition another parameter used to evaluate the performance of the ao process was the electrical energy per order eeo this parameter is defined as the electrical energy required in kwh to reduce the concentration of smx by one order of magnitude in one cubic meter of contaminated water 24 and it is determined by eq 2 1 energy consumption kw h m 3 e cell i t v s 2 eeo kw h m 3 order 1 e cell i t v s log c 0 c f where ecell is the average cell voltage v i is the applied current a t is the electrolysis time h and vs is the volume of the treated solution l c0 and cf are the smx concentration mol l 1 at t 0 and t different electrolysis times respectively once the ru ir ratio that produced the greatest smx degradation was determined that electrode was chosen as the anode to perform the rest of the experiments where the degradation of smx with more complex water matrices such as nw and mwwtp effluent was studied 2 3 2 electrochemical system assisted by solar energy electrochemical system was coupled to an atlas suntest xls solar simulator ametek usa to evaluate solar energy effect on the smx degradation process fig 1 thus the same experiments of the previous stage were carried out but this time with the anode that offered the best results and applying the lowest current density 10 ma cm 2 under simulated solar radiation the working volume was 1 l and each solution was exposed to a total radiation of 365 w m 2 Î» 300 800 nm

characterization of the electrodes the electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry allowed for the determination of the overpotential of cl2 and o2 in this sense table 2 shows that the three electrodes present low values of overpotential this result may be due to the presence of iro2 the coating of titanium substrates with noble metal oxides such as iro2 is known to favor the water oxidation reaction mainly due to its good resistance to corrosion and low overpotential 27 in addition the electrodes used in this study mmo are known as chlorine evolution electrodes because the mixture of ru and ir oxides specifically favors the generation of active chlorine species 23 however it is important to mention that there are no significant differences between the overpotential values of each electrode 10 to 30 mv for overpotential cl2 and 10 to 20 mv for overpotential o2 this result indicates that the three electrodes generate oxidizing species under the same conditions electrochemical behavior was analyzed in a potassium hexacyanoferrate iii solution k3 fe cn 6 by cyclic voltammetry the increase in the scan rate is observed to affect the oxide reduction potential of the redox probe in addition displacement and tendency to irreversibility are found as well as an increase in the intensity of the current figs s1a and s1b therefore the calculation of the electroactive area ea was performed at low scan rates fig 2a thus complying with the reversibility criterion the randles sevcik equation eq 4 was used to determine the ea 28 4 ip 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 d 1 2 v 1 2 a c where ip measured in amperes a is the peak current n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction d cm2 s 1 is the diffusion of the redox probe v vs 1 is the scan rate used in the experiment a cm2 is the ea to be determined and c molcm 3 is the concentration of the redox probe in the electrolyte the exposure area was 0 126 cm2 and the ea determined for each electrode are presented in table 2 since the electroactive areas are less than the exposed areas it could be inferred that the surface of the electrode coating is only partly exposed to both direct and indirect oxidation thus affecting degradation however the difference between the values of electroactive areas is very small which could indicate that this parameter does not influence the degradation efficiency of smx as observed in the section 3 2 electrochemical characterization by secm from anode 1 is present in fig 2b a representative 3d view and the contour maps are presented with normalized currents and the same scale it was observed that the local electroactivity of the surface is homogeneous all over the surface scanned with no differences with that observed for anode 2 and 3 figs s1c and s1d the morphological characterization of the anodes was obtained by sem fig 2c it was observed that the ru and ir oxides that cover the ti support appear as terraces superimposed on each other with smooth surfaces and grooves through which the lower terraces supporting the upper ones this is known as cracked mud texture 29 as magnification increases to 2 Î¼m to 500 nm a smooth morphology is observed on the surface of the terraces with small spherical holes at anode 1 fig s2 however the increase in magnification shows that the percentage of ruo2 favors the generation of granules at anode 2 fig s3 and of crystallographic cones at anode 3 29 between the grooves appear in the cracked mud morphology fig s4 the structures observed in anodes 2 and 3 can be generated roughness or an irregular surface on the anode producing corrosive process into de structure caused by the effect of severe chlorine gas evolution invasive chlorine and chlorate ion besides iro2 has a better corrosion resistance than other oxides therefore a greater proportion of this oxide on the structure will improve the performance of the anode 30 therefore according to the morphological characterization the anode 1 is more efficient for the generation of oxidizing species ruo2 favors the increase of the electroactive area only if the crystallographic granules or cones formed are exposed in the upper zone of the terraces as reported by okur et al 30 thus it is confirmed that the decrease in the ea compared to the exposed area is due to electrode coating composition and the presence of ruo2 the slight difference in area between anode 1 versus anodes 2 and 3 could be attributed to the presence of the crystallographic granules and cones between the grooves the general mapping and the mapping in two specific areas carried out on the surface by edx was averaged and reported in table 2 confirming that the surface does not have the same proportion of oxides as those reported by the supplier without statistically significant differences however the increase in ru in the coating is associated with the presence of crystallographic granules and cones figs s3 and s4 meanwhile as shown in fig 2d the results confirm the presence of ru and ir coating the anodic surface in this context the literature shows that electrodes with ru and ir oxides favor the specific generation of active chlorine species which is why they are recognized as electrodes for chlorine evolution this generation depending on the type of oxide present in the electrode was previously analyzed by shan et al 27 who reported that electrodes coated with ruo2 have 5 more current efficiency than electrodes coated with iro2 which is directly related to the generation of chlorine active species however in this study it was found that the anode with the greatest presence of ir anode 1 allowed a greater generation of free chlorine as observed in the section 3 2 1 3 2 sulfamethoxazole degradation in demineralized water with electrodes of different ru ir ratios in order to study the effect of the anode material on the degradation of smx in dw the three mmo electrodes with different ru ir ratios previously described were used 30 70 anode 1 50 50 anode 2 and 70 30 anode 3 the electrolyses were conducted for 180 min fig 3 shows the degradation of smx 25 mg l 1 in dw according to the ru ir ratio of each anode smx degradation 99 was observed in 15 min in all cases when working in chloride medium because of the generation of active chlorine species such as cl2 hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite clo these species are generated by reactions r4 r5 and r6 21 31 33 and like oh can oxidize the contaminant 14 34 it is important to mention that when working with 10 ma cm 2 degradation was slower than with 50 ma cm 2 this result is attributed to the greater number of oxidizing species that are formed when current density is increased 15 35 r4 2cl cl2 aq 2e r5 cl2 aq h2o hclo h cl r6 hclo clo h in contrast in a sulfate medium the degradation of smx did not surpass 60 in any assay fig 3 the best results were obtained with anode 1 which allowed achieving 33 and 54 degradation when 10 and 50 ma cm 2 were applied respectively fig 3a the slight degradation of smx in a sulfate medium may be due to the reactions that occur when active anodes such as mmo are used reactions r2 and r3 in this case the oh adsorbed at the anode interact strongly with the electrode surface forming metal oxides that act as mediators in the partial oxidation of the organic contaminant 22 some studies show an efficient degradation of contaminants by adding na2so4 as supporting electrolyte for example lebik elhadi et al 35 found a complete degradation of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam at 20 min by applying 16 ma cm 2 using a bdd electrode as anode and adding 100 mm of na2so4 on the contrary when they added 100 mm of nacl the degradation was much slower which they associated with the formation of chlorinated organic compounds carneiro et al 36 also used a bdd anode and found complete degradation of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin by applying 10 ma cm 2 in both a sulfate medium 100 mm na2so4 and a chloride medium 100 mm nacl however the degradation rate in the chloride medium was significantly higher in the same sense than our results the results of this work coincide also with what was reported by espinoza et al 22 who used mmo anodes to study the degradation of oxamic acid in a sulfate medium 50 mm na2so4 and in a chloride medium 50 mm nacl the results showed 85 degradation only in chloride medium this indicates that the medium used play a key role in the degradation of the contaminant the potential difference generated between the different anodes with the stainless steel plate used as cathode is another important factor to consider for the selection of the best anode table s1 shows the average potential difference generated between experiments increasing current density produced an increase in potential in all cases being in the chloride medium where the greatest potential differences were generated for both currents however it is noteworthy that in the sulfate medium the partial removal of the contaminant resulted in much higher energy consumption tables s2 and s3 additionally eeo was calculated and the results are shown in table 3 this calculation was made taking into account the electrolysis times where the greatest degradation of smx is achieved a direct correlation between eeo and the applied current density was observed however the lowest values were obtained when working in a chloride medium this result is related to the high degradation of smx when working with nacl fig 3 furthermore it is important to note that regardless of the supporting electrolyte used the lowest eeo value was obtained with anode 1 these results demonstrate that the use of anode 1 leads to a lower consumption of electrical energy which may be associated with the generation of a greater number of oxidizing species when this electrode was used 3 2 1 generation of oxidizing species in demineralized water with electrodes of different ru ir ratios in addition to oh other species can oxidize organic compounds 14 for example active chlorine species cl2 hclo clo persulfate s2o8 2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in this sense fig 4 shows the evolution of some oxidizing species during electrolyses when applying the two current densities studied fig 4a shows that there was a reduction in the concentration of cl ions in all cases this result is due to the continuous oxidation of cl ions at the anode to form active chlorine species 36 however it can be seen that by applying a higher current density greater oxidation of the cl ions is achieved this result coincides with the highest generation of free chlorine when 50 ma cm 2 is applied fig 4b it is important to mention that all the experiments started at ph 7 which increased during electrolysis time fig s5 this increase is attributed to the electrocatalytic effect on chloride evolution and the active chlorine species that are formed in water 37 reactions r4 r6 i e generated oh reacts with the chloride present in the medium and form chlorine oxides and active chlorine species such as clo reaction r7 that increase ph 20 according to sÃ¡nchez montes et al 38 at these ph values the predominant free chlorine species are clo and hclo therefore the faster degradation of smx observed in fig 3a when anode 1 is used in a chloride medium may be caused by a greater generation of these active chlorine species when 50 ma cm 2 is applied fig 4b it is noteworthy that although these species can attack organic contaminants they can also promote the occurrence of some parasitic reactions reactions r8 r14 that reduce the efficiency of the process 21 generating toxic ions such as chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 this indicates that selecting suitable experimental conditions to mitigate these reactions is necessary when a current density of 10 ma cm 2 was applied no significant differences in the generation of free chlorine species were found between experiments fig 4b at this point it is important to consider that an increase in current density can improve the efficiency of contaminant removal due to an increase of oxidizing species production rate and yield however this can also be a disadvantage since side reactions like oxygen evolution can interfere with the current efficiency of the process and cause an increase in energy consumption 33 in this study higher density caused higher energy consumption tables s2 and s3 therefore considering that in a chloride medium smx degradation above 99 was achieved in 8 min when 10 ma cm 2 was applied it is recommended working with the lowest current density under these conditions r7 cl oh clo h e r8 clo h2o clo2 2h 2e r9 clo2 h2o clo3 2h 2e r10 clo3 h2o clo4 2h 2e r11 clo h2o 2e cl 2oh r12 clo 2hclo clo3 2cl 2h r13 hclo 3 oh clo2 2h2o r14 hclo 4 oh clo3 2h2o h in turn fig 4c shows the generation of h2o2 in the chloride medium this oxidant is generated from the electrolysis of water 39 reaction r15 and as it can be seen the generation of h2o2 was not 3 mg l 1 it is noteworthy that h2o2 can also be formed from the dimerization of oh reaction r16 40 this produces a decrease in the reactivity of oh with organic compounds which results in lower efficiency 41 in addition h2o2 can react with oh to produce the radical peroxyhydroxyl ho2 reaction r17 which exhibits a much smaller oxidation power than oh therefore this can be considered as a parasitic reaction r15 2h2o h2o2 2h 2e r16 2 oh h2o2 r17 2h2o2 oh ho2 h2o regarding the species generated in sulfate medium such as h2o2 and s2o8 2 the analytical results were not conclusive obtaining low concentrations in both cases s2o8 2 can be formed by oxidation of so4 2 reactions r18 r19 however in this case the consumption of so4 2 was extremely low which is consistent with the low formation of s2o8 2 according to yavuz and shahbazi 39 the formation of s2o8 2 can help preventing the secondary reaction of oxygen evolution promoting the degradation of pollutants in addition in this study the low formation of this oxidant is possibly due to the nature of the anodes used in this study active anodes according to moreira et al 15 s2o8 2 can be efficiently produced using only non active anodes such as bdd and pbo2 r18 2so4 2 2so4 s2o8 2 2e r19 2hso4 2 oh s2o8 2 2h2o in this study when using anode 1 a faster degradation of smx has been obtained in the chloride medium and a greater degradation in the sulfate medium than when anodes 2 and 3 were used these results can be related to a higher generation of oxidizing species also during the characterization of the electrodes it was found that the surface of anode 1 is smooth therefore it could present greater resistance to corrosion than anodes 2 and 3 taking these aspects into account and considering the significant decrease in eeo obtained by using anode 1 it was decided to use this electrode as the anode for the following experiments in addition according to brillas and martÃ­nez huitle 14 iro2 is one of the cheapest mmo electrodes showing better stability against corrosion than ruo2 therefore anode 1 where the percentage of ir is greater than that of ru could be a promising electrode for the future application of this technology at an industrial level 3 3 sulfamethoxazole degradation in real water matrices during this stage of the experimentation 25 mg l 1 of smx in nw and actual mwwtp effluent were treated by ao using anode 1 the electrolyses were carried out at room temperature at the original ph of the samples and applying the lowest current density j 10 ma cm 2 different experiments were performed fig 5 at similar initial ph 7 60 7 70 i nw without the addition of supporting electrolyte ii nw adding 30 mm of nacl and iii actual mwwtp effluent in all cases a degradation of the antibiotic 99 was achieved however the degradation of smx was faster when nw with nacl was used in this context 7 min with nw with the extra addition of 30 mm nacl 19 min with nw and 80 min in the mwwtp effluent were required to achieve 95 degradation of smx in the case of actual mwwtp effluent it contained much more doc than nw see table 1 for physical chemical characterization which competed with smx for the reactive species in the reaction mixture 42 regarding the nw matrix the addition of supporting electrolyte led to faster smx degradation fig 5 as it was already commented the supporting electrolyte can be oxidized and give rise to different oxidizing species which improves the degradation of the contaminant in addition it is important to mention that the addition of supporting electrolyte can favor conductivity 15 in this study it was found that the addition of 30 mm of nacl led to a decrease in the potential of approximately 45 compared to the experiment in which no support electrolyte was added table s4 a decrease in energy consumption in the process from 3 56 to 0 25 kwh m 3 was observed these results showed that the ao process can be a desirable option for the degradation of antibiotics and other contaminants in highly salty water matrices 3 4 sulfamethoxazole degradation in the different water matrices using anodic oxidation assisted by solar energy 25 mg l 1 of smx were treated by solar assisted ao using a solar simulator different experiments were performed using anode 1 and applying a current density of 10 ma cm 2 fig 6 i 50 mm nacl in dw ii 50 mm na2so4 in dw iii nw iv nw adding 30 mm of nacl and v actual mwwtp effluent in none of the experiments the ph was adjusted and the initial average value of this parameter was around 7 50 when working with dw in chloride medium and without solar energy fig 3a it was found that the degradation of smx was 97 after 8 min when solar energy was applied it was 99 at the same time fig 6 with an eeo very similar to the experiment without solar energy 0 19 kw h m 3 order 1 this result indicates that for dw in chloride medium the application of solar energy does not offer an added advantage smx degradation occurred rapidly with or without solar energy possibly due to the physical chemical characteristics of the water where there is nothing to compete for free chlorine species or parasitic reactions that reduce the efficiency of the process on the contrary in a sulfate medium significant differences were found between the experiments with and without solar energy in dw in this context fig 3a shows that when working without solar energy only 33 of smx degradation was reached at 180 min however by applying solar energy fig 6 it was possible to increase smx degradation to 46 in addition in this last experiment the eeo was 29 kw h m 3 order 1 these results indicate that under these conditions it is not advisable to work with a sulfate medium in the case of the experiments in nw without the addition of nacl a faster degradation of smx was observed when working in the solar simulator figs 5 and 6 however when working in nw with 30 mm of nacl figs 5 and 6 the application of solar energy did not provide an additional improvement in smx degradation reaching a degradation 90 at 8 min in both cases with and without solar energy nevertheless it is important to mention that the application of solar energy produced a decrease in the generated potential table s4 this result indicated lower power consumption at the same applied current density possibly due to a larger generation of oxidizing species when solar energy is applied 13 43 in addition the experiment assisted by solar energy with the addition of nacl led to a lower eeo than in the experiments without solar energy 0 35 kw h m 3 order 1 compared to 0 63 and 1 19 kw h m 3 order 1 when nw is treated with and without nacl respectively these results demonstrate the benefits of solar energy in the process and nacl as a supporting electrolyte the application of solar energy in the actual mwwtp effluent treatment provided 97 degradation of smx at 60 min fig 6 unlike the experiment without application of solar energy in which 89 degradation was achieved at the same electrolysis time fig 5 this result is due to a higher generation of oxidizing species when solar energy is applied 13 in addition mwwtp effluent treatment assisted by solar energy needed more time to achieve smx degradation 99 than when using nw figs 5 and 6 likewise the generated eeo was also higher 5 13 kw h m 3 order 1 than when working with nw in addition as in the experiments with nw by applying solar energy a decrease in cell potential was achieved table s4 this result led to a decrease in energy consumption from 8 40 to 7 48 kw h m 3 indicating that the ao process assisted by solar energy can be a viable solution to treat this type of wastewater finally it is important to mention that although ru and ir electrodes have been widely studied in the ao of different contaminants due to their high catalytic activity the oxidation efficiency of smx may vary depending on the initial concentration of this contaminant in the wastewater the presence of other contaminants the type and concentration of the supporting electrolyte and the operating conditions such as ph temperature current intensity and treatment time this is because during the ao process smx can undergo secondary reactions that lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts that can be toxic or persistent resulting in environmental and or health issues additionally proper maintenance of the electrodes to ensure their lifespan and the energy consumption in the process should be considered as these aspects can affect the economic viability of large scale treatment therefore for future work it is recommended to conduct experimental studies that provide detailed information on the formation of byproducts as well as research involving a wider range of contaminants in wastewater 4 conclusions the morphological characterization of the electrodes revealed that the difference in their composition percentage of ru and ir affects the morphology of the surface since it was possible to observe a smooth surface at anode 1 ru ir 30 70 presence of granules at anode 2 ru ir 50 50 and crystals at anode 3 ru ir 70 30 these results show that anode 1 has the highest performance as it has a greater amount of ir in its structure electrodes showed very similar electroactive areas 0 094 cm2 on average therefore this parameter was not relevant in the degradation of smx the fastest degradation occurred when anode with ru ir 30 70 was used in chloride or sulfate medium as higher generation of oxidizing species was achieved however in the sulphate medium a lower degradation of smx was obtained when treating natural waters the addition of 30 mm of nacl led to faster degradation and to a decrease in energy consumption due to the higher generation of active chlorine species it has been demonstrated that the degradation of smx in complex water matrices can be successfully carried out through the ao process without the need to adjust the ph at room temperature and using an anode with a 30 70 ru ir ratio in addition it was found that the ao process assisted by solar energy can be a promising alternative to reduce energy consumption along the treatment of actual wastewater declaration of competing

12424,the degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx was studied by anodic oxidation ao process using mixed metal oxide mmo electrodes with different ru ir ratios each electrode was characterized morphological and electrochemically the electrolyzes were performed in nacl and na2so4 applying two current densities 10 and 50 ma cm 2 the electrode with the highest composition of ir ru ir 30 70 showed greater smx degradation and generation of oxidizing species and was used to treat the antibiotic by ao and ao assisted by solar energy in natural water and actual municipal wastewater effluents the efficiency in smx degradation depends on the type of electrode used mmo and electrolytic medium all mmo electrodes reached almost total degradation of smx in chloride medium however 60 degradation of smx in sulfate medium was achieved with anode with lower ru ir ratio additionally degradation of smx in complex matrices can be successfully carried out by solar assisted ao and ao processes without the need to adjust the ph at room temperature and using anode with lower ru ir ratio finally the ao process assisted by solar energy reduced electrolysis times and the cell s potential leading to lower energy consumption keywords sulfamethoxazole anodic oxidation ru ir ratios electrodes solar energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are among the group of emerging contaminants that cause detrimental effects on aquatic organisms even at low concentrations 1 due to their toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature 2 among the most widely used antibiotics in the treatment of many bacterial infections is sulfamethoxazole smx 3 about 90 of this drug is excreted in the urine within 24 h after oral administration increasing toxicity in environmental matrices 4 it is important to mention that although the concentrations of smx in the environment are below those that can cause a toxic effect on humans 5 6 its accumulation in fish and birds can lead even at trace levels to the development of antibiotic resistance 4 which would have negative consequences for humans and represent a serious threat to the ecosystems 7 8 the biological processes that are commonly used in wastewater treatment plants do not achieve an efficient removal of this type of contaminant 7 9 which is related to its recalcitrant characteristics this reveals a need for alternative treatments that guarantee safe water without the presence of antibiotics in this context electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops represent an efficient and environmentally compatible alternative to eliminate these persistent pollutants 10 12 in these processes the oxidation of organic compounds occurs mainly through a reaction with highly oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radicals oh with e oh h2o 2 80 v she 13 this provides rapid kinetics in the decomposition of different pollutants and safety at work by not having to constantly handle reagents 14 among eaops anodic oxidation ao is a simple alternative in which physisorbed oh are generated on the surface of the anode m reaction r1 as a result of the electrochemical discharge of water this indicates that the nature of the anodic material plays an essential role in the efficiency of the treatment 11 15 r1 m h2o m oh h e the boron doped diamond bdd anode has been the most used to study the degradation of different contaminants including smx due to its great oxidizing power 16 however active anodes such as mixed metal oxides mmo have gained great interest due to their low cost excellent durability and easy scalability 17 19 when this type of anode is used the m oh are transformed into higher state oxides or superoxides mo through reaction r2 later the redox couple mo m acts as a selective mediator in the oxidation of organic compounds r regenerating the metal surface m through reaction r3 15 20 21 r2 m oh mo h e r3 mo r ro m these anodes usually consist of a substrate of titanium covered with an electroactive layer of ruthenium oxide ruo2 iridium oxide iro2 tantalum pentoxide ta2o5 titanium dioxide tio2 or tin dioxide sno2 22 however for the degradation of some contaminants ternary oxide electrodes such as ti ru ir have been tested 14 in this way the advantages of each electrode are used to obtain better anodes for example according to dos anjos bezerra et al 18 the presence of iro2 improves the stability of ruo2 in this sense the anodes based on ruo2 and iro2 present good electrocatalytic activity for o2 and cl2 evolutions 17 18 23 in addition both anodes have a low cl2 overpotential which favors the formation of active chlorine species 14 despite these advantages it is unknown how the composition of the anodic material ru ir ratio can influence degradation efficiency the objective of this work is to evaluate the degradation of smx using mmo electrodes with different ru ir ratios as anodes anode 1 ru ir 30 70 ti ru ir 65 10 50 24 50 anode 2 ru ir 50 50 ti ru ir 65 17 50 17 50 and anode 3 ru ir 70 30 ti ru ir 65 24 50 10 50 the efficiency of the electrochemical process was studied based on the effect of operating conditions that included current density the use of support electrolytes nacl or na2so4 and the effect of solar energy given the importance of ao in wastewater treatment the use of anodes with excellent electrochemical activity and a long service lifetime at the lowest possible cost is essential therefore this work could contribute to future applications of this technology at industrial scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfamethoxazole smx cas number 723 46 6 c10h11n3o3s 99 of purity was selected as model micropollutant and purchased from sigma aldrich a 100 mg l 1 solution of smx in demineralized water was prepared and stored at 4 c for later use analytical grade sodium sulfate na2so4 and sodium chloride nacl from sigma aldrich were used as supporting electrolytes each solution was stirred for 10 min and after this time an adequate volume of the smx solution was added to obtain an initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 ph was adjusted with analytical grade sulfuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh all provided by j t baker in order to detect the free chlorine in the samples powder sachets of this reagent hach were used titanium iv oxysulfate evonik corporation

formic acid hplc grade were supplied by panreac and used for mobile phases preparation to analyze smx degradation by liquid chromatography hplc 2 2 water matrices experiments were carried out in demineralized water dw natural water nw and an actual secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant mwwtp table 1 shows the main characteristics of these water matrices actual mwwtp effluent was collected during the month of september 2021 at el bobar mwwtp located in almerÃ­a south east of spain the samples were collected in a 5 l drum and stored at 4 c for a maximum of two days 2 3 experimental set up 2 3 1 electrochemical system solutions of 25 mg l 1 of smx in dw were subjected to the ao process at room temperature each solution was adjusted to ph 7 with h2so4 or hcl and naoh the electrochemical system fig 1 consisted of 1 a reservoir with a working volume of 2 l of solution 2 a peristaltic pump heidolph 58120 type rzr2 3 a filter press electrochemical cell containing

precision that provides a constant current to carry out the electrolysis in galvanostatic mode and offers the potential difference that occurs between the electrodes in order to evaluate the effect of the anodic material on the degradation of smx in dw three electrodes corresponding to metallic oxides of ru and ir in different ratios and supported on a sheet of titanium were used anode 1 ru ir 30

carried out adding 50 mm of naso4 or 50 mm of nacl used as supporting electrolytes in addition to study the effect of the applied current density j these experiments were carried out applying two current densities one low j 10 ma cm 2 and one high j 50 ma cm 2 to remove impurities from the surfaces of the cathode and anodes the electrodes were polarized in a 0 10 m h2so4 solution at 80 ma cm 2 for 120 min before each electrolysis in each experiment the energy consumption ec per volume of electrolyzed solutions was determined using eq 1 in addition another parameter used to evaluate the performance of the ao process was the electrical energy per order eeo this parameter is defined as the electrical energy required in kwh to reduce the concentration of smx by one order of magnitude in one cubic meter of contaminated water 24 and it is determined by eq 2 1 energy consumption kw h m 3 e cell i t v s 2 eeo kw h m 3 order 1 e cell i t v s log c 0 c f where ecell is the average cell

respectively once the ru ir ratio that produced the greatest smx degradation was determined that electrode was chosen as the anode to perform the rest of the experiments where the degradation of smx with more complex water matrices such as nw and mwwtp effluent was studied 2 3 2 electrochemical system assisted by solar energy electrochemical system was coupled to an atlas suntest xls solar

characterization of the electrodes the electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry allowed for the determination of the overpotential of cl2 and o2 in this sense table 2 shows that the three electrodes present low values of overpotential this result may be due to the presence of iro2 the coating of titanium substrates with noble metal oxides such as iro2 is known to favor the water oxidation reaction mainly due to its good resistance to corrosion and low overpotential 27 in addition the electrodes used in this study mmo are known as chlorine evolution electrodes because the mixture of ru and ir oxides specifically favors the generation of active chlorine species 23 however it is important to mention that there are no significant differences between the overpotential values of each electrode 10 to 30 mv for overpotential cl2 and 10 to 20 mv for overpotential o2 this result indicates that the three electrodes generate oxidizing species under the same conditions electrochemical behavior was analyzed in a potassium hexacyanoferrate iii solution k3 fe cn 6 by cyclic voltammetry the increase in the scan rate is observed to affect the oxide reduction potential of the redox probe in addition displacement and tendency to irreversibility are found as well as an increase in the intensity of the current figs s1a and s1b therefore the calculation of the electroactive area ea was performed at low scan rates fig 2a thus complying with the reversibility criterion the randles sevcik equation eq 4 was used to determine the ea 28 4 ip 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 d 1 2

in the experiment a cm2 is the ea to be determined and c molcm 3 is the concentration of the redox probe in the electrolyte the exposure area was 0 126 cm2 and the ea determined for each electrode are presented in table 2 since the electroactive areas are less than the exposed areas it could be inferred that the surface of the electrode coating is only partly exposed to both direct and indirect oxidation thus affecting degradation however the difference between the values of electroactive areas is very small which could indicate that this parameter does not influence the degradation efficiency of smx as observed in the section 3 2 electrochemical characterization by secm from anode 1 is present in fig 2b a representative 3d view and the contour maps are presented with normalized currents and the same scale it was observed that the local electroactivity of the surface is homogeneous all over the surface scanned with no differences with that observed for anode 2 and 3 figs s1c and s1d the morphological characterization of the anodes was obtained by sem fig 2c it was observed that the ru and ir oxides that cover the ti support appear as terraces superimposed on each other with smooth surfaces and grooves through which the lower terraces supporting the upper ones this is known as cracked mud texture 29 as magnification increases to 2 Î¼m to 500 nm a smooth morphology is observed on the surface of the terraces with small spherical holes at anode 1 fig s2 however the increase in magnification shows that the percentage of ruo2 favors the generation of granules at anode 2 fig s3 and of crystallographic cones at anode 3 29 between the grooves appear in the cracked mud morphology fig s4 the structures observed in anodes 2 and 3 can be generated roughness or an irregular surface on the anode producing corrosive process into de structure caused by the effect of severe chlorine gas evolution invasive chlorine and chlorate ion besides iro2 has a better corrosion resistance than other oxides therefore a greater proportion of this oxide on the structure will improve the performance of the anode 30 therefore according to the morphological characterization the anode 1 is more efficient for the generation of oxidizing species ruo2 favors the increase of the electroactive area only if the crystallographic granules or cones formed are exposed in the upper zone of the terraces as reported by okur et al 30 thus it is confirmed that the decrease in the ea compared to the exposed area is due to electrode coating composition and the presence of ruo2 the slight difference in area between anode 1 versus anodes 2 and 3 could be attributed to the presence of the crystallographic granules and cones between the grooves the general mapping and the mapping in two specific areas carried out on the surface by edx was averaged and reported in table 2 confirming that the surface does not have the same proportion of oxides as those reported by the supplier without statistically significant differences however the increase in ru in the coating is associated with the presence of crystallographic granules and cones figs s3 and s4 meanwhile as shown in fig 2d the results confirm the presence of ru and ir coating the anodic surface in this context the literature shows that electrodes with ru and ir oxides favor the specific generation of active chlorine species which is why they are recognized as electrodes for chlorine evolution this generation depending on the type of oxide present in the electrode was previously analyzed by shan et al 27 who reported that electrodes coated with ruo2 have 5 more current efficiency than electrodes coated with iro2 which is directly related to the generation of chlorine active species however in this study it was found that the anode with the greatest presence of ir anode 1 allowed a greater generation of free chlorine as observed in the section 3 2 1 3 2 sulfamethoxazole degradation in demineralized water with electrodes of different ru ir ratios in order to study the effect of the anode material on the degradation of smx in dw the three mmo electrodes with different ru ir ratios previously described were used 30 70 anode 1 50 50 anode 2 and 70 30 anode 3 the electrolyses were conducted for 180 min fig 3 shows the degradation of smx 25 mg l 1 in dw according to the ru ir ratio of each anode smx degradation 99 was observed in 15 min in all cases when working in chloride medium because of the generation of active chlorine species such as cl2 hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite clo these species are generated by reactions r4 r5 and r6 21 31 33 and like oh can oxidize the contaminant 14 34 it is important to mention that when working with 10 ma cm 2 degradation was slower than with 50 ma cm 2 this result is attributed to the greater number of oxidizing species that are formed when current density is increased 15 35 r4 2cl cl2 aq 2e r5 cl2 aq h2o hclo h cl r6 hclo clo h in contrast in a sulfate medium the degradation of smx did not surpass 60 in any assay fig 3 the best results were obtained with anode 1 which allowed achieving 33 and 54 degradation when 10 and 50 ma cm 2 were applied respectively fig 3a the slight degradation of smx in a sulfate medium may be due to the reactions that occur when active anodes such as mmo are used reactions r2 and r3 in this case the oh adsorbed at the anode interact strongly with the electrode surface forming metal oxides that act as mediators in the partial oxidation of the organic contaminant 22 some studies show an efficient degradation of contaminants by adding na2so4 as supporting electrolyte for example lebik elhadi et al 35 found a complete degradation of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam at 20 min by applying 16 ma cm 2 using a bdd electrode as anode and adding 100 mm of na2so4 on the contrary when they added 100 mm of nacl the degradation was much slower which they associated with the formation of chlorinated organic compounds carneiro et al 36 also used a bdd anode and found complete degradation of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin by applying 10 ma cm 2 in both a sulfate medium 100 mm na2so4 and a chloride medium 100 mm nacl however the degradation rate in the chloride medium was significantly higher in the same sense than our results the results of this work coincide also with what was reported by espinoza et al 22 who used mmo anodes to study the degradation of oxamic acid in a sulfate medium 50 mm na2so4 and in a chloride medium 50 mm nacl the results showed 85 degradation only in chloride medium this indicates that the medium used play a key role in the degradation of the contaminant the potential difference generated between the different anodes with the stainless steel plate used as cathode is another important factor to consider for the selection of the best anode table s1 shows the average potential difference generated between experiments increasing current density produced an increase in potential in all cases being in the chloride medium where the greatest potential differences were generated for both currents however it is noteworthy that in the sulfate medium the partial removal of the contaminant resulted in much higher energy consumption tables s2 and s3 additionally eeo was calculated and the results are shown in table 3 this calculation was made taking into account the electrolysis times where the greatest degradation of smx is achieved a direct correlation between eeo and the applied current density was observed however the lowest values were obtained when working in a chloride medium this result is related to the high degradation of smx when working with nacl fig 3 furthermore it is important to note that regardless of the supporting electrolyte used the lowest eeo value was obtained with anode 1 these results demonstrate that the use of anode 1 leads to a lower consumption of electrical energy which may be associated with the generation of a greater number of oxidizing species when this electrode was used 3 2 1 generation of oxidizing species in demineralized water with electrodes of different ru ir ratios in addition to oh other species can oxidize organic compounds 14 for example active chlorine species cl2 hclo clo persulfate s2o8 2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in this sense fig 4 shows the evolution of some oxidizing species during electrolyses when applying the two current densities studied fig 4a shows that there was a reduction in the concentration of cl ions in all cases this result is due to the continuous oxidation of cl ions at the anode to form active chlorine species 36 however it can be seen that by applying a higher current density greater oxidation of the cl ions is achieved this result coincides with the highest generation of free chlorine when 50 ma cm 2 is applied fig 4b it is important to mention that all the experiments started at ph 7 which increased during electrolysis time fig s5 this increase is attributed to the electrocatalytic effect on chloride evolution and the active chlorine species that are formed in water 37 reactions r4 r6 i e generated oh reacts with the chloride present in the medium and form chlorine oxides and active chlorine species such as clo reaction r7 that increase ph 20 according to sÃ¡nchez montes et al 38 at these ph values the predominant free chlorine species are clo and hclo therefore the faster degradation of smx observed in fig 3a when anode 1 is used in a chloride medium may be caused by a greater generation of these active chlorine species when 50 ma cm 2 is applied fig 4b it is noteworthy that although these species can attack organic contaminants they can also promote the occurrence of some parasitic reactions reactions r8 r14 that reduce the efficiency of the process 21 generating toxic ions such as chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 this indicates that selecting suitable experimental conditions to mitigate these reactions is necessary when a current density of 10 ma cm 2 was applied no significant differences in the generation of free chlorine species were found between experiments fig 4b at this point it is important to consider that an increase in current density can improve the efficiency of contaminant removal due to an increase of oxidizing species production rate and yield however this can also be a disadvantage since side reactions like oxygen evolution can interfere with the current efficiency of the process and cause an increase in energy consumption 33 in this study higher density caused higher energy consumption tables s2 and s3 therefore considering that in a chloride medium smx degradation above 99 was achieved in 8 min when 10 ma cm 2 was applied it is recommended working with the lowest current density under these conditions r7 cl oh clo h e r8 clo h2o clo2 2h 2e r9 clo2 h2o clo3 2h 2e r10 clo3 h2o clo4 2h 2e r11 clo h2o 2e cl 2oh r12 clo 2hclo clo3 2cl 2h r13 hclo 3 oh clo2 2h2o r14 hclo 4 oh clo3 2h2o h in turn fig 4c shows the generation of h2o2 in the chloride medium this oxidant is generated from the electrolysis of water 39 reaction r15 and as it can be seen the generation of h2o2 was not 3 mg l 1 it is noteworthy that h2o2 can also be formed from the dimerization of oh reaction r16 40 this produces a decrease in the reactivity of oh with organic compounds which results in lower efficiency 41 in addition h2o2 can react with oh to produce the radical peroxyhydroxyl ho2 reaction r17 which exhibits a much smaller oxidation power than oh therefore this can be considered as a parasitic reaction r15 2h2o h2o2 2h 2e r16 2 oh h2o2 r17 2h2o2 oh ho2 h2o regarding the species generated in sulfate medium such as h2o2 and s2o8 2 the analytical results were not conclusive obtaining low concentrations in both cases s2o8 2 can be formed by oxidation of so4 2 reactions r18 r19 however in this case the consumption of so4 2 was extremely low which is consistent with the low formation of s2o8 2 according to yavuz and shahbazi 39 the formation of s2o8 2 can help preventing the secondary reaction of oxygen evolution promoting the degradation of pollutants in addition in this study the low formation of this oxidant is possibly due to the nature of the anodes used in this study active anodes according to moreira et al 15 s2o8 2 can be efficiently produced using only non active anodes such as bdd and pbo2 r18 2so4 2 2so4 s2o8 2 2e r19 2hso4 2 oh s2o8 2 2h2o in this study when using anode 1 a faster degradation of smx has been obtained in the chloride medium and a greater degradation in the sulfate medium than when anodes 2 and 3 were used these results can be related to a higher generation of oxidizing species also during the characterization of the electrodes it was found that the surface of anode 1 is smooth therefore it could present greater resistance to corrosion than anodes 2 and 3 taking these aspects into account and considering the significant decrease in eeo obtained by using anode 1 it was decided to use this electrode as the anode for the following experiments in addition according to brillas and martÃ­nez huitle 14 iro2 is one of the cheapest mmo electrodes showing better stability against corrosion than ruo2 therefore anode 1 where the percentage of ir is greater than that of ru could be a promising electrode for the future application of this technology at an industrial level 3 3 sulfamethoxazole degradation in real water matrices during this stage of the experimentation 25 mg l 1 of smx in nw and actual mwwtp effluent were treated by ao using anode 1 the electrolyses were carried out at room temperature at the original ph of the samples and applying the lowest current density j 10 ma cm 2 different experiments were performed fig 5 at similar initial ph 7 60 7 70 i nw without the addition of supporting electrolyte ii nw adding 30 mm of nacl and iii actual mwwtp effluent in all cases a degradation of the antibiotic 99 was achieved however the degradation of smx was faster when nw with nacl was used in this context 7 min with nw with the extra addition of 30 mm nacl 19 min with nw and 80 min in the mwwtp effluent were required to achieve 95 degradation of smx in the case of actual mwwtp effluent it contained much more doc than nw see table 1 for physical chemical characterization which competed with smx for the reactive species in the reaction mixture 42 regarding the nw matrix the addition of supporting electrolyte led to faster smx degradation fig 5 as it was already commented the supporting electrolyte can be oxidized and give rise to different oxidizing species which improves the degradation of the contaminant in addition it is important to mention that the addition of supporting electrolyte can favor conductivity 15 in this study it was found that the addition of 30 mm of nacl led to a decrease in the potential of approximately 45 compared to the experiment in which no support electrolyte was added table s4 a decrease in energy consumption in the process from 3 56 to 0 25 kwh m 3 was observed these results showed that the ao process can be a desirable option for the degradation of antibiotics and other contaminants in highly salty water matrices 3 4 sulfamethoxazole degradation in the different water matrices using anodic oxidation assisted by solar energy 25 mg l 1 of smx were treated by solar assisted ao using a solar simulator different experiments were performed using anode 1 and applying a current density of 10 ma cm 2 fig 6 i 50 mm nacl in dw ii 50 mm na2so4 in dw iii nw iv nw adding 30 mm of nacl and v actual mwwtp effluent in none of the experiments the ph was adjusted and the initial average value of this parameter was around 7 50 when working with dw in chloride medium and without solar energy fig 3a it was found that the degradation of smx was 97 after 8 min when solar energy was applied it was 99 at the same time fig 6 with an eeo very similar to the experiment without solar energy 0 19 kw h m 3 order 1 this result indicates that for dw in chloride medium the application of solar energy does not offer an added advantage smx degradation occurred rapidly with or without solar energy possibly due to the physical chemical characteristics of the water where there is nothing to compete for free chlorine species or parasitic reactions that reduce the efficiency of the process on the contrary in a sulfate medium significant differences were found between the experiments with and without solar energy in dw in this context fig 3a shows that when working without solar energy only 33 of smx degradation was reached at 180 min however by applying solar energy fig 6 it was possible to increase smx degradation to 46 in addition in this last experiment the eeo was 29 kw h m 3 order 1 these results indicate that under these conditions it is not advisable to work with a sulfate medium in the case of the experiments in nw without the addition of nacl a faster degradation of smx was observed when working in the solar simulator figs 5 and 6 however when working in nw with 30 mm of nacl figs 5 and 6 the application of solar energy did not provide an additional improvement in smx degradation reaching a degradation 90 at 8 min in both cases with and without solar energy nevertheless it is important to mention that the application of solar energy produced a decrease in the generated potential table s4 this result indicated lower power consumption at the same applied current density possibly due to a larger generation of oxidizing species when solar energy is applied 13 43 in addition the experiment assisted by solar energy with the addition of nacl led to a lower eeo than in the experiments without solar energy 0 35 kw h m 3 order 1 compared to 0 63 and 1 19 kw h m 3 order 1 when nw is treated with and without nacl respectively these results demonstrate the benefits of solar energy in the process and nacl as a supporting electrolyte the application of solar energy in the actual mwwtp effluent treatment provided 97 degradation of smx at 60 min fig 6 unlike the experiment without application of solar energy in which 89 degradation was achieved at the same electrolysis time fig 5 this result is due to a higher generation of oxidizing species when solar energy is applied 13 in addition mwwtp effluent treatment assisted by solar energy needed more time to achieve smx degradation 99 than when using nw figs 5 and 6 likewise the generated eeo was also higher 5 13 kw h m 3 order 1 than when working with nw in addition as in the experiments with nw by applying solar energy a decrease in cell potential was achieved table s4 this result led to a decrease in energy consumption from 8 40 to 7 48 kw h m 3 indicating that the ao process assisted by solar energy can be a viable solution to treat this type of wastewater finally it is important to mention that although ru and ir electrodes have been widely studied in the ao of different contaminants due to their high catalytic activity the oxidation efficiency of smx may vary depending on the initial concentration of this contaminant in the wastewater the presence of other contaminants the type and concentration of the supporting electrolyte and the operating conditions such as ph temperature current intensity and treatment time this is because during the ao process smx can undergo secondary reactions that lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts that can be toxic or persistent resulting in environmental and or health issues additionally proper maintenance of the electrodes to ensure their lifespan and the energy consumption in the process should be considered as these aspects can affect the economic viability of large scale treatment therefore for future work it is recommended to conduct experimental studies that provide detailed information on the formation of byproducts as well as research involving a wider range of contaminants in wastewater 4 conclusions the morphological characterization of the electrodes revealed that the difference in their composition percentage of ru and ir affects the morphology of the surface since it was possible to observe a smooth surface at anode 1 ru ir 30 70 presence of granules at anode 2 ru ir 50 50 and crystals at anode 3 ru ir 70 30 these results show that anode 1 has the highest performance as it has a greater amount of ir in its structure electrodes showed very similar electroactive areas 0 094 cm2 on average therefore this parameter was not relevant in the degradation of smx the fastest degradation occurred when anode with ru ir 30 70 was used in chloride or sulfate medium as higher generation of oxidizing species was achieved however in the sulphate medium a lower degradation of smx was obtained when treating natural waters the addition of 30 mm of nacl led to faster degradation and to a decrease in energy consumption due to the higher generation of active chlorine species it has been demonstrated that the degradation of smx in complex water matrices can be successfully carried out through the ao process without the need to adjust the ph at room temperature and using an anode with a 30 70 ru ir ratio in addition it was found that the ao process assisted by solar energy can be a promising alternative to reduce energy consumption along the treatment of actual wastewater declaration of competing
