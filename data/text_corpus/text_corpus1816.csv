9080,the increase of agricultural nitrogen n inputs since the 1960s is a key driver in surface and groundwater nitrate pollution the water abstracted from these sources can input substantial amounts of reactive nitrogen nirrig if used for crop irrigation this input is often not included in n related agricultural policies and studies which are likely underestimating the magnitude of n pollution hotspots and overestimating the n use efficiency in this study we provided prima facie evidence that nirrig is a neglected source of n in irrigated systems the nirrig was computed for 278 municipalities in mainland portugal along the period 1995 2019 based on the gross irrigation requirements and nitrate concentration in ground and surface water sources the former was derived using two complementary approaches using the aquacrop and globwat models while the latter were computed following spatially explicit approaches nirrig showed annual large fluctuations 6 11 gg n yr 1 of which 91 was from groundwater sources results show that nirrig averaged 14 11 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which is equivalent to 3 4 of the n in synthetic fertilisers this input was higher in the municipalities that simultaneously present high irrigation demand and the nitrate contaminated groundwater as an irrigation source in these cases located in nitrate vulnerable zones nirrig reached up to 95 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and more than 80 of the n in synthetic fertilizers this study highlights the importance of linking water and nutrient policies to better gain insight on nirrig for which the current study provided for

introduction the irrigation sector is responsible for 70 of the global withdrawals from surface and groundwater sources siebert et al 2010 bruinsma 2017 playing a key role in increasing crop yields wang et al 2021 high irrigation water demand occurs mostly in the arid semi arid regions of asia particularly india china but also in intensively cultivated developed nations such as the united states and europe wada et al 2014 2016 rosa et al 2020 cramer et al 2018 in addition to being the main water user the agriculture sector is also considered one of the main n pollution sources for surface and groundwater contamination from nitrate no3 runoff and leaching grizzetti et al 2011 irrigation water is extracted from groundwater and or surface water bodies the former often providing the most reliable and flexible irrigation source siebert et al 2010 the water from these sources is used for irrigation which contains no3 above background levels due to n contamination forming an often overlooked water nitrogen nexus the extent to which each water source transports no3 through irrigation has marked variation in space and time depends on biogeochemical processes that influence lag times management practices and pedoclimatic conditions mcdowell et al 2021 chang et al 2021 nakagawa et al 2021 given the considerable volume of irrigation water applied to fields the no3 content in irrigation water extracted from contaminated water bodies can represent a substantial n input to agricultural soils particularly in nitrate vulnerable zones nvz in portugal it is only mandatory to include this input in balanced fertilisation schemes in the nvz through action programs cameira et al 2019 it is unclear whether this n input must be legally accounted elsewhere although extension services may advise farmers to do so in certain regions e g the us cahn et al 2017 the linkage between the water nutrient nexus of irrigation has however been seldom explored it is known that irrigation increases crop yields and therefore to a higher n uptake lassaletta et al 2021 farneselli et al 2015 but there are few studies that have quantified nirrig for instance nirrig is the third largest n input in the tagus nvz portugal amounting up to 80 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 30 35 of the total agricultural n inputs cameira et al 2019 in the dataset developed by quemada et al 2020 from farm surveys nirrig reaches up to 159 kg n ha 1 yr 1 cameira et al 2014 report similar values up to 144 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in a field experiment in a peri urban agricultural area in lisbon portugal conversely nirrig is considerably lower 2 7 37 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in different regions in china yin et al 2022 he et al 2018 and consistently below 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in seven watersheds in the ebro basin spain andrés and cuchí 2014 studies applied to mainland china report nirrig ranging 0 7 1 1 tg n yr 1 representing 3 5 of the n fertiliser he et al 2018 wang et al 2014 it is thus likely that there are marked local and regional spatial variations in nirrig depending on the nutrient status of ground and surface water bodies and frequency and magnitude of irrigation rates this is not yet fully addressed by agri environmental policies in europe specifically european policies focus on improving water and nutrient management through a more efficient use of irrigation and agricultural n inputs but lack an integrated approach to address their relationship this is reflected in the way the water framework directive and nitrate directive emphasize water quality and n pollution without addressing irrigation as a common link between both in addition the 28 agri environmental indicators aei developed within the scope of the europe s common agricultural policy have separated the aeis related to water aei 7 irrigation aei 20 water abstraction and nutrient efficiency e g aei 15 gross n balance the lack of inclusion of nirrig in aeis that are used to quantify annual progress can lead to an underestimation of agricultural pollution hotspots and an overestimation of the overall efficiency this not only affects the accuracy but also limits the effectiveness of agri environmental policies similar procedures are likely to be followed in other countries outside europe where irrigation water is used from nitrate contaminated sources for instance the usda agricultural research service has conducted several field trials in california to determine the fertiliser value of irrigation water cahn et al 2017 this n input is also often calculated in rice paddies e g in japan saiki et al 2020 though it is still unclear to us whether such efforts have been successfully translated into policy work the current study aims to explore nirrig as the missing link in the water nitrogen nexus to gain insight on its relevance and to identify its implications in terms of european agri environmental policies specifically it aims to gain insight at whether there is prima facie evidence that nirrig makes a significant contribution to n flows and in which circumstances the approach was applied in mainland portugal for the period 1995 2019 but this approach can be further explored in other regions and countries to achieve the proposed goals the following computations were performed 1 net and gross irrigation requirements at the municipality level using two complementary modelling tools 2 spatially explicit no3 concentrations in surface and groundwater based on measured data and 3 compared nirrig with other agricultural n flows 2 methods an overview of the main modelling flows datasets and sources used in this study are displayed in fig 1 and table 1 respectively an assessment of the integrity of the weather data sets was also performed following allen 1996 the accuracy of both reanalysis climatic datasets was assessed by comparing with observations showing an acceptable error of estimates results not shown these results were in line with previous studies performed for portugal using reanalysis data martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018a the current study was performed for mainland portugal the modeling simulations are presented for the seven regions by aggregating the results at municipality level 2 1 irrigated crop areas data on irrigated crop areas was collected for 278 municipalities in mainland portugal from the available agricultural census of 2009 and 2019 ine 2009 2019 this dataset included 38 crops and 7 irrigation systems furrows other surface systems solid set sprinkler travelling gun sprinkler center pivot drip and micro sprinkler a two step approach was used to expand those data to the period 1995 2019 see the supplemental material for a detailed description first the total irrigated areas were derived at the municipality level from the total areas equipped for irrigation the fraction of crop irrigated areas for a given irrigation system relative to the total irrigated area at the municipality was interpolated between 2009 and 2019 lacking better data the fractions of 2009 were assumed to be equal for the period 1995 2008 crop areas for the different irrigation systems at the municipality scale were calculated as the product of total irrigated areas and the fraction of crop land under an irrigation system fig s1 2 2 estimating net irrigation water requirements the information from the diverse databases listed in table 1 were used to build diverse homogenous units of analysis hua ferreira et al 2022 consisting of areas which features soil physic properties crop irrigation system that influence the soil water balance terms and consequently the net irrigation water requirements nir mm yr 1 do not spatially change the nir were calculated for 37 crops for the period 1995 2019 using two complementary modeling tools the fao crop growth model aquacrop steduto et al 2012 from aquacrop ospy kelly and foster 2021 was selected for estimating the nir of 16 field crops potato and tomato which have been parameterized by the model developers raes et al 2012 for the remaining crops e g fruit trees grasslands and other vegetables the globwat vertical soil water balance hoogeveen et al 2015 was used the aquacrop model was selected since it has been widely calibrated and validated for field and horticultural crops as recently reviewed by salman et al 2021 it was calibrated and validated for portuguese conditions for maize paredes et al 2014a 2014b barley pereira et al 2015 and pea paredes and torres 2017 the globwat model was chosen due to the lack of adequate parameterization and validation of aquacrop particularly for orchards this model requires few input data although it is unable to estimate crop growth and yield both models were run at a daily timestep at a resolution of 0 1ºx0 1º 2 2 1 the aquacrop model aquacrop is a water driven model which combines four sub models 1 the soil water balance 2 the crop development growth and yield 3 the atmosphere sub model handling rainfall evaporative demand reference evapotranspiration eto and air co2 concentration as per fig 1 eto was computed using the parameterized hargreaves samani equation paredes et al 2020 and 4 the management sub model which includes irrigation groundwater table and fertilization raes et al 2012 the model performs the soil water balance for the entire root depth as follows 1 w r i 1 w i t p r o i cr et c act dp with wr t and wr t 1 mm soil water content in the root zone at day i and i 1 respectively p is the effective precipitation ro is the surface runoff i is the irrigation cr is the capillary rise from a shallow groundwater table etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration and dp is the deep percolation all terms are expressed in mm day 1 the model partitions etc act into its components i e the soil evaporation and crop transpiration and relates the latter with the above ground dry biomass b t ha 1 using the normalized biomass water productivity wp g m 2 wp represents the above ground biomass produced per unit of land area considering both the cumulative transpiration after normalization for atmospheric co2 concentration and eto raes et al 2012 a semi empiric approach is used to compute the crop yield y t ha 1 from b using the reference harvest index which indicates the harvestable proportion of biomass and an adjustment factor integrating five water stress factors relative to the inhibition of leaf growth inhibition of stomata reduction in green canopy duration due to senescence reduction in biomass due to pre anthesis stress and pollination failure raes et al 2012 the model default values for most of the conservative parameters were considered for the selected crops the values of the main model parameters that were used and adjusted to national conditions and related sources are provided in table a1 typical sowing and planting dates were obtained from farmers in previous surveys and from earth observations collected in previous studies e g rolim et al 2019 ferreira et al 2022 maximum rooting depths were established according to the tabulated values by pereira et al 2021a 2021b but constrained by the groundwater table and the soil depths whenever appropriate the yields from aquacrop were converted from dry to fresh yield using crop specific dry matter content these were set to 20 quiroz et al 2012 and 5 battilani et al 2012 for potato and tomato respectively for the remaining crops we used data from serra et al 2019 field management practices other than the irrigation scheduling generation were not considered due to the coarse spatial resolution of the results and high variability of conditions at small scale i e farm or field the model generated farmers typical irrigation schedules considering a threshold to trigger irrigation based on a soil water depletion table a1 soil moisture targets taw ranged between 65 75 for maize and sunflower 80 85 for potato 80 for forage crops winter cereals rice and pulses and 85 for tomatoes fixed net irrigation depths were set for each irrigation system of 30 mm for travelling gun 20 mm for solid set sprinkler 10 mm for center pivots and micro sprinkler while 8 mm were used for drip irrigation systems common farmers irrigation management practices such as the irrigation cut off at the end of the crop season were considered for each crop data provided by the wua and farmers surveys and from literature thus for cereals the irrigation cut off was performed at 20 days before harvest paredes et al 2014a 2014b pereira et al 2015 10 days in case of potato to allow vine killing paredes et al 2018b 15 days for sunflower and processing tomato johnstone et al 2005 7 days for beans and chickpeas yonts 2010 the aquacrop model was validated using two different approaches by comparing i simulated seasonal irrigation requirements with literature results from diverse studies performed in portugal and ii simulated crop yields for different regions and for the studied period with statistical yield data ine 2022 2 2 2 the globwat model the globwater vertical water balance hoogeveen et al 2015 uses a simplified approach to calculate the different water flows 2 pr e rain r 0 gr s where pr is the precipitation erain is the rainfall dependent evapotranspiration r0 is the surface runoff gr the groundwater recharge and s is the monthly water storage variation in the soil all terms are expressed in mm day 1 in globwat erain is assumed to be equal to the maximum evapotranspiration of a land use or vegetation type without water shortages 3 e rain k c lu e t o when s max s t

timestep t 1 smax seav half of smax and kc lu values were obtained using the data sets referred in table 1 soil water storage was updated monthly by adding the difference of ingoing and outgoing fluxes to st 1 eq 2 runoff occurred when the soil water storage at timestep t exceeded smax groundwater recharge gr was calculated as a function of the maximum recharge flux rmax and the fraction of soil water storage available to percolate if there was no sufficient water in the soil r was set to 0 monthly net irrigation requirements nir mm month 1 were calculated as the difference of crop evapotranspiration under irrigation etc mm month 1 and the rainfed evapotranspiration erain 4 nir e t c e rain k c crop e t o e rain where kc crop dimensionless refers to crop coefficients defined by allen et al 1998 for the three growing stages initial mid and end the kc crop values used are those recently updated by pereira et al 2021a b these were allocated to monthly crop calendars fig s2 when irrigation typically occurs portmann et al 2008 fig s1 the model was set to spin up time to 10 years i e starting from 1985 before the first year of the simulation of crop irrigation requirements the soundness of the nir estimations was performed using data collected in available studies performed in portugal 2 2 3 gross irrigation requirements the simulated crop nirs from aquacrop and globwat were converted into gross irrigation water requirements gir m3 yr 1 by accounting the distribution efficiencies of the seven irrigation systems furrows other surface irrigation systems sprinkler travelling gun sprinkler center pivot drip and micro sprinkler as follows 5 gir i 1 36 j 1 7 cni r i i eff j 10 a i j where i refers to the ith irrigated crop j to the jth irrigation system cnir is

2004 sousa and morais 2011 2 3 nitrate in the irrigation water from ground and surface water sources no3 concentration in ground and surface water for the period 1995 2019 were collated from the national monitoring stations snirh 2022 data concerning groundwater was withdrawn from the national grid of monitoring stations which increased from 77 stations in 1995 to 1210 stations in 2019 data relative to the surface water was also withdrawn from the national monitoring stations which had a similar increase in their number but less noticeable during the 1990s in 1995 there was 242 stations and their spatial coverage was not limited to the nvzs the spatial distribution of the monitoring stations grid is shown in figs s3 and s8 supplemental material because the sampling dates for both ground and surface water were irregular groundwater samples were often collected twice per year during autumn and spring an annual average was used for each monitoring station for surface water an annual value of no3 referring to data in mg no3 l 1 hereafter concentration was obtained for each municipality in mainland portugal using an ordinary kriging of the values measured at the different monitoring stations data gaps i e municipalities without any station for a given year were linearly interpolated allowing to reconstruct the missing no3 concentrations for municipalities with only one annual data point that value was assumed for the whole period municipalities without any value for the entire period were populated using an ordinary kriging of the values obtained from the adjacent municipalities the spatial distribution of no3 concentration in groundwater were estimated using the random forest algorithm rf breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 this is a popular approach to predict no3 concentration in groundwater showing good performance canion et al 2019 knoll et al 2019 ouedraogo et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 following probst et al 2019 we fine tuned 3 hyper parameters using a grid search the number of decision trees ntrees the number of randomly selected independent variables for each tree mtry and the node size which controls tree complexity the no3 spatial predictors used in the model included annual data concerning weather precipitation evapotranspiration management practices soil surface n balance soil e g soil organic carbon soil bulk density texture slope and hydraulic conductivity and groundwater water table depth aquifer porosity properties and annual land use moulds et al 2015 the spatial resolution was set to 500 m x 500 m the reader are referred to the supplementary materials for additional information the annual groundwater no3 concentration was partitioned into training 80 and testing 20 subsets the annual predictions for the period 1995 2002 achieved a low accuracy r2 0 40 due to the limited spatial distribution of the monitoring stations which covered only a small fraction of mainland portugal therefore the predictions from 2003 2019 were used as additional predictors for these years 2 4 quantification of the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources the total n input from irrigation water nirrig kg n yr 1 was calculated for both water sources src ground and surface water as follows 6 n irrig src 1 2 gir nc src f src where gir the irrigation water requirements l yr 1 ncsrc is the annual average no3 concentration at the municipality level for the srcth source kg n no3 l 1 and fsrc is the fraction of irrigation that comes from the srcth source at the municipality level collated from ine 2022 2 4 1 comparison with other agricultural nitrogen flows following the study by serra et al 2019 the current study included the most common n inputs and n outputs in kg n ha 1 yr 1 as identified by the eu nitrogen expert panel 2015 and the nitrogen use efficiency nue as the ratio of n outputs and the sum of all n inputs with and without nirrig the selected n flows from eu nitrogen expert panel 2015 were the n inputs from synthetic fertilisers nfert gross manure n excretion nman biological n fixation nbnf and atmospheric deposition ndep and the n harvested in crops ncrop the temporal coverage of the n flows using the methods developed in the previous study serra et al 2019 which only focussed on three years 1989 1999 and 2009 were expanded to the period 1995 2019 specifically the annual crop areas and livestock population at the municipality level were updated by interpolating data from the agricultural census years 1989 1999 2009 and 2019 with annual data at the agrarian region level ine 2022 a detailed description of the calculations can be found in the supplementary material 2 5 sensitivity and statistical analysis the model including its subroutines was implemented and analysed using r statistical software r core team 2022 a heuristic sensitivity analysis was performed by recalculating nirrig after varying the variables from eq 6 by 25 the variables selected were the fraction of irrigation water from groundwater and no3 concentration in surface and groundwater all variables were simulated separately and in parallel spearman s rank correlation coefficient rho was used as a nonparametric measure of rank correlation to identify monotonic functions i e statistically significant trends in the period 1995 2019 trend analyses were performed for all the variables in eq 6 including total irrigated areas and for the other agricultural n flows significant differences were reported when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of irrigation water requirements the validation of both modelling tools results against the seasonal gir found in studies performed in portugal table 2 showed an overall good agreement i e the estimated gir are within the ranges of the observed gir both tools were able to embody the contrasting climatic demand conditions in the country see fig s10 for the climatic gradient results relative to the yield predictions from aquacrop fig 2 show that the model was also able to capture the inter annual variability and trend of observed yields on a fresh matter basis obtained from regional statistics ine 2022 along the considered period a direct comparison between the absolute values of simulated yields with those derived from statistics was perceived because the latter represents an average value for a certain region a similar approach was used in regional climate change impacts assessment studies e g li et al 2011 silvestro et al 2017 or in regional yield estimations de wit et al 2019 total gross irrigation requirements for the period 1995 2019 in mainland portugal the annual total irrigated area tia showed statistically significant declining trends over 1995 2019 rho 0 60 p 0 001 see sm for more details during this period tia declined from 60 to 54 thousand ha between 1995 and 2018 but by 2019 it increased to 59 thousand ha this large increase in recent years resulted from a larger share of irrigated areas in total irrigable areas e g 87 and 90 in 2017 and 2019 respectively and an expansion of grassland field crops and permanent crops orchards the expansion of field crops particularly maize mainly occurred in the north while the area of olive orchards increased markedly in the alentejo region southern portugal in short tia is generally decreasing in mainland portugal but irrigated areas in specific regions have been increasing due to agricultural intensification serra et al 2019 as well as an increase in climate variability martins et al 2012 results relative to gir fig 3 show that wheat is mainly cropped in the central and southern regions where supplemental irrigation is common resulting in relatively low gir conversely maize is a water demanding crop 300 800 mm yr 1 widely cropped in most regions tomato is mainly cultivated in central portugal e g cameira et al 2007 where gir reached up to 500 mm yr 1 this region is known for its high yield irrigated tomatoes for processing fig 3 vegetables and cereals the gir at the national level remained quite stable rho 0 03 p 0 90 during the period 1995 2019 with large annual fluctuations fig 4a our results show that the total gir at the national level were evenly partitioned between crops from which gir were estimated using aquacrop rho 0 84 p 0 001 and globwat rho 0 62 p 0 001 the estimated gir are closely dependent on the changes in the cropping systems and related irrigated areas as well as with the climate variability the increase in gir by globwat in the last 5 years are related with the increase in orchards and grasslands areas declining trends in gir p 0 001 were found for cereals 26 3 and forage crops 20 1 whereas an increasing trend p 0 001 was found for olive groves 15 3 pastures 19 1 and vineyards 5 1 respectively these contrasting trends in gir are also related with the shift in the cropping systems particularly in the regions with higher climatic demand conditions where field crops were replaced by high economic return crops e g orchards results show that gir increased 28 from 2018 and 2019 which was likely driven by the combined effect of the increase in tia fig 4a and dry climatic conditions higher climatic demand conditions and lower precipitation another possible explanation for the increase of gir by 2019 particularly in southern portugal is the expansion of super intensive olive orchards from 120 to 142 thousand hectares branquinho et al 2021 the expansion of subtropical fruits e g avocado that took place in recent years in the southern regions may also have contributed to this increase since these crops are highly water demanding under the prevailing climatic conditions in addition gir in 2018 were about 14 lower than the 1995 2019 average fig 4b this may relate with more humid climatic conditions in that year as the precipitation amount was about 8 higher than the long term average conversely by 2019 the precipitation was 27 lower than the average resulting in a comparatively higher gir although in line with the average for the period 330 26 mm yr 1 the modelled annual gir was responsive to climatic drought years such as 2005 2009 and 2017 in those years the total gir was about 16 11 and 8 higher than the average gir for 1995 2019 fig 4b contrasting values of gir were found between coastal and inland areas particularly in southern portugal fig 5a the former where gir was higher are linked with high water demanding crops such as rice paddies irrigated up to 1 000 mm yr 1 orange orchards vegetables and cereals fig 3 on the other hand the lower gir in the inland regions of southern portugal are due the use of less water demanding crops irrigated with more efficient irrigation systems i e drip for instance in these regions drip irrigated vineyards gir ranging 200 350 mm yr 1 and olive orchards gir ranging 250 400 mm yr 1 are the main crops covering more than 50 of tia statistically significant increasing trends for gir rho 0 4 p 0 05 were found in the water scarce regions of southern portugal and most inland municipalities fig 5b while our results already showcase significant changes in gir for southern portugal studies show similar trends when using climate change projections valverde et al 2015 rolim et al 2016 associated with reduced water availability rocha et al 2020 increasing trends were also identified for municipalities in the peri urban regions in northern and central portugal fig 5b which are linked with high water demanding crops respectively maize and paddy rice conversely the decreasing trends mostly in municipalities in the central region are associated with the decline in irrigated grain maize and vegetables which are the most relevant irrigated crops in the region representing 15 and 30 tia respectively 3 2 spatially explicit nitrate concentration in the surface and groundwater sources the annual average no3 concentration in groundwater for mainland portugal and for the period 1995 2019 was 21 3 14 3 mg no3 l 1 showing a declining trend rho 0 60 p 0 002 fig 6 four main hotspots where the average concentration for the entire period exceeded 50 mg no3 l 1 were identified in nw portugal in the tagus river basin and throughout most southern portugal specifically in the alentejo and algarve regions fig 6a nw portugal showed the largest annual increase in no3 concentration reached up to 16 mg no3 l 1 yr 1 but the tagus river basin attained the largest rho with municipalities where the increase was statistically significant fig 6b these regions coincide with the current nvzs in portugal and with the regions identified by serra et al 2021 as having a high risk of groundwater n contamination from agriculture other studies have emphasized nvzs in northern zeferino et al 2019 and southern hugman et al 2017 portugal in nw portugal the high groundwater vulnerability is likely the main driver for the high no3 concentrations despite the low agricultural hazard serra et al 2021 in the remaining regions both the high groundwater vulnerability and agricultural hazard play a major role in the high no3 concentrations serra et al 2021 our data shows that no3 concentrations remained stable in the nvzs rho 0 p 0 42 but reductions were achieved in many municipalities fig 6b the proposed rf model achieved a very good accuracy r2 of 0 78 0 10 and rmse of 22 75 6 37 the readers is referred to sm for further details the most important predictors were among soil soil ph texture field capacity groundwater porosity and water table depth management n leaching and the soil surface n balance topographical elevation and slope and demographic gross domestic product properties these findings are consistent to similar studies knoll et al 2019 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 ouedraogo et al 2019 spijker et al 2021 that employed rf to predict no3 in groundwater for surface waters the annual no3 concentrations of the all watersheds in mainland portugal was 5 12 9 61 mg no3 l 1 with an increasing trend rho 0 58 p 0 002 during the studied period on average the concentrations were higher in the coastal regions fig 6c particularly in southern i e algarve and nw portugal reaching 220 mg no3 l 1 in the former in the latter region we found statistically significant increasing trends fig 6d 3 3 spatiotemporal patterns of the nitrogen inputs from irrigation water sources nirrig increased from 7 to 8 9 gg n yr 1 in mainland portugal during 1995 2019 fig 7a despite this nirrig showed a declining trend rho 0 17 p 0 41 with marked annual fluctuations up to 10 7 gg n yr 1 in 2003 and down to 6 gg n yr 1 in 2014 approximately 91 2 of nirrig came from contaminated groundwater which is in line how sensitive the model is to a change of 25 in groundwater no3 fig 7a indeed our heuristic sensitivity analysis showed nirrig was more responsive to changes in ground 23 than surface water 2 the modification of all parameters at the same time yielded a variation of 38 and 43 in nirrig fig 7a in terms of tia we obtained an average of 13 8 11 2 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for 1995 2019 fig 7b shows the spatiotemporal variation of nirrig at the municipality level for 1995 2019 the impact of drought years on nirrig is less evident than in gir fig 4b but nonetheless the average annual nirrig for 2005 and 2017 were 12 and 10 larger than the average for the whole period fig 7b in some years nirrig was higher than 80 kg n ha 1 yr 1 even reaching up to 95 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in nw portugal fig 8a indeed our data shows that hotspots i e values twice the 80th quantile of 19 2 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for 1995 2019 readily highlighted in fig 8a coincide with the nvzs as of 2022 values of this magnitude i e 38 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 only occur in the nvzs due to the combination of both high agricultural hazard and groundwater vulnerability serra et al 2021 the spatial distribution for the tagus nvz is very comparable to cameira et al 2019 insofar as nirrig was both greater with an increasing trend in its upper section 50 70 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but while the hotspots identified in the upper half of mainland portugal above 39ºn show declining trends fig 8b the ones in the bottom half are increasing over time p 0 05 this contrasting situation shows that in fact nirrig is declining in most municipalities in northern portugal and vice versa for southern portugal 3 4 implications for policymaking aiming to provide prima facie evidence that irrigation is an overlooked source of n in agri environmental policies we compared nirrig with other agricultural n flows at the mainland level nirrig was the third largest cumulative n flow 205 gg n far smaller than manure 5 or synthetic fertilisers 9 but larger than n fixation 139 and deposition 104 fig 8c briefly our results reveal that the impact of nirrig in agri environmental indicators should in principle be relatively small at the mainland scale given the large difference to manure and synthetic fertilisers nonetheless nirrig attained a statistically significant trend relative to synthetic fertilisers 0 733 p 0 001 which were roughly 2 4 0 5 nfert and a reduction of less than 1 in the nue locally the overall impact is similar to the mainland level 3 0 4 3 nfert and 0 3 0 4 decrease in the nue but in some municipalities nirrig reached up to more than 80 nfert with an implicit reduction in the nue of 6 the impact on the nue would likely be much larger though to an unknown extent if we considered total irrigated areas rather than total agricultural land therefore not including nirrig in national agri environmental indicators should not impact noticeably most countries performance but locally not including it may severely over and underestimate nue and the local magnitude of n pollution hotspots respectively 3 5 application and mitigation measures we provide the first analysis for nirrig as a missing link between farmers practices and the agri environmental indicators using a spatially explicit approach this approach is considerably more detailed than previous attempts at regional to national scales which were derived based on national n coefficients from field studies hayashi et al 2021 he et al 2018 wang et al 2014 or the coupling of a water balance model with averaged n concentrations cameira et al 2021 recently wei and bailey 2021 have expanded the swat modelling framework to include a sub module that computes n in irrigation water sources in southeastern colorado although we applied our modelling framework to the portuguese agricultural systems a similar outcome is likely to occur in other mediterranean or in other countries with intensive cropping systems e g india china usa where i irrigation practices are common ii there is a heavy reliance on groundwater for irrigation and iii there is a widespread no3 contamination of groundwater for regions that rely mainly on surface water for irrigation our data suggests that the impact of nirrig should be relatively minor since the no3 concentration from this source is comparatively much smaller fig 6 but this may not be the case for countries with a different predominance of biogeochemical processes and pedoclimatic condition nirrig should be therefore further researched in countries that meet the above criteria our results point to a need to further develop and implement targeted measures for regions or catchments within national supra national agri environmental policies for instance in the nvzs nirrig must be accounted in balanced fertilization schemes to reduce the need for synthetic fertilisers or other n input sources if n inputs are reduced according to the magnitude of nirrig excessive no3 amounts present in the aquifers can be potentially reduced cameira et al 2019 by two processes the no3 in groundwater recharge is reduced and no3 already in groundwater are recycled for utilisation by crops it is unlikely however that farmers outside the nvzs are aware of the importance of nirrig as an alternative source of nutrients even if they are aware they may not have the technical knowledge required to estimate nirrig at the field scale and adjust fertilisation accordingly 3 6 strengths and limitations of the study the major strength of this study lies on the flexibility of the proposed framework it can be applied using locally parametrized process based models with field data to estimate nirrig at a local level e g farm or can be upscaled to larger spatial scales e g in this study such as continental or global provided there is sufficient coverage of no3 monitoring stations the application of this framework can be considered an important step towards closing the agricultural n cycle and optimizing n management in irrigated systems this is possible to be achieved at different scales i optimizing n fertilisation according to nirrig at the farm level and ii upscaling its impacts on water quality at the watershed level aggregating data at the national level may provide for key information flow for agricultural policies particularly in identifying n hotspots related to nirrig on the other hand the limitations are tied with data gaps in irrigated areas and insufficient monitoring stations measurements but also with the uncertainties of the models used to estimate irrigation requirements several studies refer that detailed temporal and spatial coverage of irrigation data has been a major issue e g siebert et al 2010 a more detailed alternative to the proposed interpolation scheme section 2 1 consists upon the data fusion approaches that merge statistics with remote sensing products to shorten this data gap e g zhang et al 2022 these however usually focus on total irrigated areas rather than crop and irrigation system specific areas the no3 concentration dataset has several data limitations due to irregular sampling frequencies and lack of specifications about sample depths within the saturated zone the latter limits our predictive approach which is unable to account for shallow and deep aquifers since no3 concentration varies with depth the irregular sampling period dilutes the effect of seasonality of nitrate concentrations particularly in surface water thus distorting our estimates of nirrig since annual averaged values were used it should be noted that the simplicity of the proposed methodology aimed to quantify the potential linkage and magnitude between irrigation and the agricultural n cycle at the expense of a greater accuracy even with the use of the process based model aquacrop the approach to estimate gir excluded local water availability which may not be realistic when there are water restrictions and farmers do not have access to water and therefore crops may experience water stress this can be of particular importance in the future due to changes in precipitation and temperature cramer et al 2018 4 conclusions the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources was quantified at the municipality level in mainland portugal for the period 1995 2019 results show that this input was a substantial source of nitrogen averaging 14 11 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but reaching up to 95 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 80 of the n from synthetic fertilisers in the nitrate vulnerable zones regions with high irrigation requirements and nitrate contaminated groundwater as a source were highlighted in intensively managed regions in coastal regions particularly throughout the different nitrate vulnerable zones although a slight declining trend was found for the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources its relative importance compared with the other agricultural n inputs increased over time this suggests that the current agri environmental indicators which do not account for this additional source of reactive nitrogen may fail to properly support policies by failing to accurately identify pollution hotspots and the real nitrogen use efficiency of agricultural systems this missing link between farmers management practices and agri environmental indicators needs to be bridged to optimize nutrient flows across spatial scales we presented a simple approach to derive the contribution of nitrate in the irrigation water sources at different spatial scales from local to national the nitrogen in irrigation water should be considered in fertilization plans and in the calculation of agri environmental indicators related to water and nutrient efficiency in agriculture coupled with root zone process based models this methodology can assist environmental managers and policymakers in decision making concerning national and regional scale catchment mitigation measures to improve water quality it is likely that the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources is an important issue in those areas of the world with widespread irrigation and nitrate contaminated groundwater the public private sector can play a larger role to raise awareness improve technical knowledge and steer farmers towards a better

9080,the increase of agricultural nitrogen n inputs since the 1960s is a key driver in surface and groundwater nitrate pollution the water abstracted from these sources can input substantial amounts of reactive nitrogen nirrig if used for crop irrigation this input is often not included in n related agricultural policies and studies which are likely underestimating the magnitude of n pollution hotspots and overestimating the n use efficiency in this study we provided prima facie evidence that nirrig is a neglected source of n in irrigated systems the nirrig was computed for 278 municipalities in mainland portugal along the period 1995 2019 based on the gross irrigation requirements and nitrate concentration in ground and surface water sources the former was derived using two complementary approaches using the aquacrop and globwat models while the latter were computed following spatially explicit approaches nirrig showed annual large fluctuations 6 11 gg n yr 1 of which 91 was from groundwater sources results show that nirrig averaged 14 11 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which is equivalent to 3 4 of the n in synthetic fertilisers this input was higher in the municipalities that simultaneously present high irrigation demand and the nitrate contaminated groundwater as an irrigation source in these cases located in nitrate vulnerable zones nirrig reached up to 95 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and more than 80 of the n in synthetic fertilizers this study highlights the importance of linking water and nutrient policies to better gain insight on nirrig for which the current study provided for

introduction the irrigation sector is responsible for 70 of the global withdrawals from surface and groundwater sources siebert et al 2010 bruinsma 2017 playing a key role in increasing crop yields wang et al 2021 high irrigation water demand occurs mostly in the arid semi arid regions of asia particularly india china but also in intensively cultivated developed nations such as the united states and europe wada et al 2014 2016 rosa et al 2020 cramer et al 2018 in addition to being the main water user the agriculture sector is also considered one of the main n pollution sources for surface and groundwater contamination from nitrate no3 runoff and leaching grizzetti et al 2011 irrigation water is extracted from groundwater and or surface water bodies the former often providing the most reliable and flexible irrigation source siebert et al 2010 the water from these sources is used for irrigation which contains no3 above background levels due to n contamination forming an often overlooked water nitrogen nexus the extent to which each water source transports no3 through irrigation has marked variation in space and time depends on biogeochemical processes that influence lag times management practices and pedoclimatic conditions mcdowell et al 2021 chang et al 2021 nakagawa et al 2021 given the considerable volume of irrigation water applied to fields the no3 content in irrigation water extracted from contaminated water bodies can represent a substantial n input to agricultural soils particularly in nitrate vulnerable zones nvz in portugal it is only mandatory to include this input in balanced fertilisation schemes in the nvz through action programs cameira et al 2019 it is unclear whether this n input must be legally accounted elsewhere although extension services may advise farmers to do so in certain regions e g the us cahn et al 2017 the linkage between the water nutrient nexus of irrigation has however been seldom explored it is known that irrigation increases crop yields and therefore to a higher n uptake lassaletta et al 2021 farneselli et al 2015 but there are few studies that have quantified nirrig for instance nirrig is the third largest n input in the tagus nvz portugal amounting up to 80 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 30 35 of the total agricultural n inputs cameira et al 2019 in the dataset developed by quemada et al 2020 from farm surveys nirrig reaches up to 159 kg n ha 1 yr 1 cameira et al 2014 report similar values up to 144 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in a field experiment in a peri urban agricultural area in lisbon portugal conversely nirrig is considerably lower 2 7 37 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in different regions in china yin et al 2022 he et al 2018 and consistently below 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in seven watersheds in the ebro basin spain andrés and cuchí 2014 studies applied to mainland china report nirrig ranging 0 7 1 1 tg n yr 1 representing 3 5 of the n fertiliser he et al 2018 wang et al 2014 it is thus likely that there are marked local and regional spatial variations in nirrig depending on the nutrient status of ground and surface water bodies and frequency and magnitude of irrigation rates this is not yet fully addressed by agri environmental policies in europe specifically european policies focus on improving water and nutrient management through a more efficient use of irrigation and agricultural n inputs but lack an integrated approach to address their relationship this is reflected in the way the water framework directive and nitrate directive emphasize water quality and n pollution without addressing irrigation as a common link between both in addition the 28 agri environmental indicators aei developed within the scope of the europe s common agricultural policy have separated the aeis related to water aei 7 irrigation aei 20 water abstraction and nutrient efficiency e g aei 15 gross n balance the lack of inclusion of nirrig in aeis that are used to quantify annual progress can lead to an underestimation of agricultural pollution hotspots and an overestimation of the overall efficiency this not only affects the accuracy but also limits the effectiveness of agri environmental policies similar procedures are likely to be followed in other countries outside europe where irrigation water is used from nitrate contaminated sources for instance the usda agricultural research service has conducted several field trials in california to determine the fertiliser value of irrigation water cahn et al 2017 this n input is also often calculated in rice paddies e g in japan saiki et al 2020 though it is still unclear to us whether such efforts have been successfully translated into policy work the current study aims to explore nirrig as the missing link in the water nitrogen nexus to gain insight on its relevance and to identify its implications in terms of european agri environmental policies specifically it aims to gain insight at whether there is prima facie evidence that nirrig makes a significant contribution to n flows and in which circumstances the approach was applied in mainland portugal for the period 1995 2019 but this approach can be further explored in other regions and countries to achieve the proposed goals the following computations were performed 1 net and gross irrigation requirements at the municipality level using two complementary modelling tools 2 spatially explicit no3 concentrations in surface and groundwater based on measured data and 3 compared nirrig with other agricultural n flows 2 methods an overview of the main modelling flows datasets and sources used in this study are displayed in fig 1 and table 1 respectively an assessment of the integrity of the weather data sets was also performed following allen 1996 the accuracy of both reanalysis climatic datasets was assessed by comparing with observations showing an acceptable error of estimates results not shown these results were in line with previous studies performed for portugal using reanalysis data martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018a the current study was performed for mainland portugal the modeling simulations are presented for the seven regions by aggregating the results at municipality level 2 1 irrigated crop areas data on irrigated crop areas was collected for 278 municipalities in mainland portugal from the available agricultural census of 2009 and 2019 ine 2009 2019 this dataset included 38 crops and 7 irrigation systems furrows other surface systems solid set sprinkler travelling gun sprinkler center pivot drip and micro sprinkler a two step approach was used to expand those data to the period 1995 2019 see the supplemental material for a detailed description first the total irrigated areas were derived at the municipality level from the total areas equipped for irrigation the fraction of crop irrigated areas for a given irrigation system relative to the total irrigated area at the municipality was interpolated between 2009 and 2019 lacking better data the fractions of 2009 were assumed to be equal for the period 1995 2008 crop areas for the different irrigation systems at the municipality scale were calculated as the product of total irrigated areas and the fraction of crop land under an irrigation system fig s1 2 2 estimating net irrigation water requirements the information from the diverse databases listed in table 1 were used to build diverse homogenous units of analysis hua ferreira et al 2022 consisting of areas which features soil physic properties crop irrigation system that influence the soil water balance terms and consequently the net irrigation water requirements nir mm yr 1 do not spatially change the nir were calculated for 37 crops for the period 1995 2019 using two complementary modeling tools the fao crop growth model aquacrop steduto et al 2012 from aquacrop ospy kelly and foster 2021 was selected for estimating the nir of 16 field crops potato and tomato which have been parameterized by the model developers raes et al 2012 for the remaining crops e g fruit trees grasslands and other vegetables the globwat vertical soil water balance hoogeveen et al 2015 was used the aquacrop model was selected since it has been widely calibrated and validated for field and horticultural crops as recently reviewed by salman et al 2021 it was calibrated and validated for portuguese conditions for maize paredes et al 2014a 2014b barley pereira et al 2015 and pea paredes and torres 2017 the globwat model was chosen due to the lack of adequate parameterization and validation of aquacrop particularly for orchards this model requires few input data although it is unable to estimate crop growth and yield both models were run at a daily timestep at a resolution of 0 1ºx0 1º 2 2 1 the aquacrop model aquacrop is a water driven model which combines four sub models 1 the soil water balance 2 the crop development growth and yield 3 the atmosphere sub model handling rainfall evaporative demand reference evapotranspiration eto and air co2 concentration as per fig 1 eto was computed using the parameterized hargreaves samani equation paredes et al 2020 and 4 the management sub model which includes irrigation groundwater table and fertilization raes et al 2012 the model performs the soil water balance for the entire root depth as follows 1 w r i 1 w i t p r o i cr et c act dp with wr t and wr t 1 mm soil water content in the root zone at day i and i 1 respectively p is the effective precipitation ro is the surface runoff i is the irrigation cr is the capillary rise from a shallow groundwater table etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration and dp is the deep percolation all terms are expressed in mm day 1 the model partitions etc act into its components i e the soil evaporation and crop transpiration and relates the latter with the above ground dry biomass b t ha 1 using the normalized biomass water productivity wp g m 2 wp represents the above ground biomass produced per unit of land area considering both the cumulative transpiration after normalization for atmospheric co2 concentration and eto raes et al 2012 a semi empiric approach is used to compute the crop yield y t ha 1 from b using the reference harvest index which indicates the harvestable proportion of biomass and an adjustment factor integrating five water stress factors relative to the inhibition of leaf growth inhibition of stomata reduction in green canopy duration due to senescence reduction in biomass due to pre anthesis stress and pollination failure raes et al 2012 the model default values for most of the conservative parameters were considered for the selected crops the values of the main model parameters that were used and adjusted to national conditions and related sources are provided in table a1 typical sowing and planting dates were obtained from farmers in previous surveys and from earth observations collected in previous studies e g rolim et al 2019 ferreira et al 2022 maximum rooting depths were established according to the tabulated values by pereira et al 2021a 2021b but constrained by the groundwater table and the soil depths whenever appropriate the yields from aquacrop were converted from dry to fresh yield using crop specific dry matter content these were set to 20 quiroz et al 2012 and 5 battilani et al 2012 for potato and tomato respectively for the remaining crops we used data from serra et al 2019 field management practices other than the irrigation scheduling generation were not considered due to the coarse spatial resolution of the results and high variability of conditions at small scale i e farm or field the model generated farmers typical irrigation schedules considering a threshold to trigger irrigation based on a soil water depletion table a1 soil moisture targets taw ranged between 65 75 for maize and sunflower 80 85 for potato 80 for forage crops winter cereals rice and pulses and 85 for tomatoes fixed net irrigation depths were set for each irrigation system of 30 mm for travelling gun 20 mm for solid set sprinkler 10 mm for center pivots and micro sprinkler while 8 mm were used for drip irrigation systems common farmers irrigation management practices such as the irrigation cut off at the end of the crop season were considered for each crop data provided by the wua and farmers surveys and from literature thus for cereals the irrigation cut off was performed at 20 days before harvest paredes et al 2014a 2014b pereira et al 2015 10 days in case of potato to allow vine killing paredes et al 2018b 15 days for sunflower and processing tomato johnstone et al 2005 7 days for beans and chickpeas yonts 2010 the aquacrop model was validated using two different approaches by comparing i simulated seasonal irrigation requirements with literature results from diverse studies performed in portugal and ii simulated crop yields for different regions and for the studied period with statistical yield data ine 2022 2 2 2 the globwat model the globwater vertical water balance hoogeveen et al 2015 uses a simplified approach to calculate the different water flows 2 pr e rain r 0 gr s where pr is the precipitation erain is the rainfall dependent evapotranspiration r0 is the surface runoff gr the groundwater recharge and s is the monthly water storage variation in the soil all

irrigation typically occurs portmann et al 2008 fig s1 the model was set to spin up time to 10 years i e starting from 1985 before the first year of the simulation of crop irrigation requirements the soundness of the nir estimations was performed using data collected in available studies performed in portugal 2 2 3 gross irrigation requirements the simulated crop nirs from aquacrop and globwat were converted into gross irrigation water requirements gir m3 yr 1 by accounting the distribution efficiencies of the seven irrigation systems furrows other surface irrigation systems sprinkler

2004 sousa and morais 2011 2 3 nitrate in the irrigation water from ground and surface water sources no3 concentration in ground and surface water for the period 1995 2019 were collated from the national monitoring stations snirh 2022 data concerning groundwater was withdrawn from the national grid of monitoring stations which increased from 77 stations in 1995 to 1210 stations in 2019 data relative to the surface water was also withdrawn from the national monitoring stations which had a similar increase in their number but less noticeable during the 1990s in 1995 there was 242 stations and their spatial coverage was not limited to the nvzs the spatial distribution of the monitoring stations grid is shown in figs s3 and s8 supplemental material because the sampling dates for both ground and surface water were irregular groundwater samples were often collected twice per year during autumn and spring an annual average was used for each monitoring station for surface water an annual value of no3 referring to data in mg no3 l 1 hereafter concentration was obtained for each municipality in mainland portugal using an ordinary kriging of the values measured at the different monitoring stations data gaps i e municipalities without any station for a given year were linearly interpolated allowing to reconstruct the missing no3 concentrations for municipalities with only one annual data point that value was assumed for the whole period municipalities without any value for the entire period were populated using an ordinary kriging of the values obtained from the adjacent municipalities the spatial distribution of no3 concentration in groundwater were estimated using the random forest algorithm rf breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 this is a popular approach to predict no3 concentration in groundwater showing good performance canion et al 2019 knoll et al 2019 ouedraogo et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 following probst et al 2019 we fine tuned 3 hyper parameters using a grid search the number of decision trees ntrees the number of randomly selected independent variables for each tree mtry and the node size which controls tree complexity the no3 spatial predictors used in the model included annual data concerning weather precipitation evapotranspiration management practices soil surface n balance soil e g soil organic carbon soil bulk density texture slope and hydraulic conductivity and groundwater water table depth aquifer porosity properties and annual land use moulds et al 2015 the spatial resolution was set to 500 m x 500 m the reader are referred to the supplementary materials for additional information the annual groundwater no3 concentration was partitioned into training 80 and testing 20 subsets the annual predictions for the period 1995 2002 achieved a low accuracy r2 0 40 due to the limited spatial distribution of the monitoring stations which covered only a small fraction of mainland portugal therefore the predictions from 2003 2019 were used as additional predictors for these years 2 4 quantification of the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources the total n input from irrigation water nirrig kg n yr 1 was calculated for both water sources src ground and surface water as follows 6 n irrig src 1 2 gir nc src f src where gir the irrigation water requirements l yr 1 ncsrc is the annual average no3 concentration at the municipality level for the srcth source kg n no3 l 1 and fsrc is the fraction of irrigation that comes from the srcth source at the municipality level collated from ine 2022 2 4 1 comparison with other agricultural nitrogen flows following the study by serra et al 2019 the current study included the most common n inputs and n outputs in kg n ha 1 yr 1 as identified by the eu nitrogen expert panel 2015 and the nitrogen use efficiency nue as the ratio of n outputs and the sum of all n inputs with and without nirrig the selected n flows from eu nitrogen expert panel 2015 were the n inputs from synthetic fertilisers nfert gross manure n excretion nman biological n fixation nbnf and atmospheric deposition ndep and the n harvested in crops ncrop the temporal coverage of the n flows using the methods developed in the previous study serra et al 2019 which only focussed on three years 1989 1999 and 2009 were expanded to the period 1995 2019 specifically the annual crop areas and livestock population at the municipality level were updated by interpolating data from the agricultural census years 1989 1999 2009 and 2019 with annual data at the agrarian region level ine 2022 a detailed description of the calculations can be found in the supplementary material 2 5 sensitivity and statistical analysis the model including its subroutines was implemented and analysed using r statistical software r core team 2022 a heuristic sensitivity analysis was performed by recalculating nirrig after varying the variables from eq 6 by 25 the variables selected were the fraction of irrigation water from groundwater and no3 concentration in surface and groundwater all variables were simulated separately and in parallel spearman s rank correlation coefficient rho was used as a nonparametric measure of rank correlation to identify monotonic functions i e statistically significant trends in the period 1995 2019 trend analyses were performed for all the variables in eq 6 including total irrigated areas and for the other agricultural n flows significant differences were reported when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of irrigation water requirements the validation of both modelling tools results against the seasonal gir found in studies performed in portugal table 2 showed an overall good agreement i e the estimated gir are within the ranges of the observed gir both tools were able to embody the contrasting climatic demand conditions in the country see fig s10 for the climatic gradient results relative to the yield predictions from aquacrop fig 2 show that the model was also able to capture the inter annual variability and trend of observed yields on a fresh matter basis obtained from regional statistics ine 2022 along the considered period a direct comparison between the absolute values of simulated yields with those derived from statistics was perceived because the latter represents an average value for a certain region a similar approach was used in regional climate change impacts assessment studies e g li et al 2011 silvestro et al 2017 or in regional yield estimations de wit et al 2019 total gross irrigation requirements for the period 1995 2019 in mainland portugal the annual total irrigated area tia showed statistically significant declining trends over 1995 2019 rho 0 60 p 0 001 see sm for more details during this period tia declined from 60 to 54 thousand ha between 1995 and 2018 but by 2019 it increased to 59 thousand ha this large increase in recent years resulted from a larger share of irrigated areas in total irrigable areas e g 87 and 90 in 2017 and 2019 respectively and an expansion of grassland field crops and permanent crops orchards the expansion of field crops particularly maize mainly occurred in the north while the area of olive orchards increased markedly in the alentejo region southern portugal in short tia is generally decreasing in mainland portugal but irrigated areas in specific regions have been increasing due to agricultural intensification serra et al 2019 as well as an increase in climate variability martins et al 2012 results relative to gir fig 3 show that wheat is mainly cropped in the central and southern regions where supplemental irrigation is common resulting in relatively low gir conversely maize is a water demanding crop 300 800 mm yr 1 widely cropped in most regions tomato is mainly cultivated in central portugal e g cameira et al 2007 where gir reached up to 500 mm yr 1 this region is known for its high yield irrigated tomatoes for processing fig 3 vegetables and cereals the gir at the national level remained quite stable rho 0 03 p 0 90 during the period 1995 2019 with large annual fluctuations fig 4a our results show that the total gir at the national level were evenly partitioned between crops from which gir were estimated using aquacrop rho 0 84 p 0 001 and globwat rho 0 62 p 0 001 the estimated gir are closely dependent on the changes in the cropping systems and related irrigated areas as well as with the climate variability the increase in gir by globwat in the last 5 years are related with the increase in orchards and grasslands areas declining trends in gir p 0 001 were found for cereals 26 3 and forage crops 20 1 whereas an increasing trend p 0 001 was found for olive groves 15 3 pastures 19 1 and vineyards 5 1 respectively these contrasting trends in gir are also related with the shift in the cropping systems particularly in the regions with higher climatic demand conditions where field crops were replaced by high economic return crops e g orchards results show that gir increased 28 from 2018 and 2019 which was likely driven by the combined effect of the increase in tia fig 4a and dry climatic conditions higher climatic demand conditions and lower precipitation another possible explanation for the increase of gir by 2019 particularly in southern portugal is the expansion of super intensive olive orchards from 120 to 142 thousand hectares branquinho et al 2021 the expansion of subtropical fruits e g avocado that took place in recent years in the southern regions may also have contributed to this increase since these crops are highly water demanding under the prevailing climatic conditions in addition gir in 2018 were about 14 lower than the 1995 2019 average fig 4b this may relate with more humid climatic conditions in that year as the precipitation amount was about 8 higher than the long term average conversely by 2019 the precipitation was 27 lower than the average resulting in a comparatively higher gir although in line with the average for the period 330 26 mm yr 1 the modelled annual gir was responsive to climatic drought years such as 2005 2009 and 2017 in those years the total gir was about 16 11 and 8 higher than the average gir for 1995 2019 fig 4b contrasting values of gir were found between coastal and inland areas particularly in southern portugal fig 5a the former where gir was higher are linked with high water demanding crops such as rice paddies irrigated up to 1 000 mm yr 1 orange orchards vegetables and cereals fig 3 on the other hand the lower gir in the inland regions of southern portugal are due the use of less water demanding crops irrigated with more efficient irrigation systems i e drip for instance in these regions drip irrigated vineyards gir ranging 200 350 mm yr 1 and olive orchards gir ranging 250 400 mm yr 1 are the main crops covering more than 50 of tia statistically significant increasing trends for gir rho 0 4 p 0 05 were found in the water scarce regions of southern portugal and most inland municipalities fig 5b while our results already showcase significant changes in gir for southern portugal studies show similar trends when using climate change projections valverde et al 2015 rolim et al 2016 associated with reduced water availability rocha et al 2020 increasing trends were also identified for municipalities in the peri urban regions in northern and central portugal fig 5b which are linked with high water demanding crops respectively maize and paddy rice conversely the decreasing trends mostly in municipalities in the central region are associated with the decline in irrigated grain maize and vegetables which are the most relevant irrigated crops in the region representing 15 and 30 tia respectively 3 2 spatially explicit nitrate concentration in the surface and groundwater sources the annual average no3 concentration in groundwater for mainland portugal and for the period 1995 2019 was 21 3 14 3 mg no3 l 1 showing a declining trend rho 0 60 p 0 002 fig 6 four main hotspots where the average concentration for the entire period exceeded 50 mg no3 l 1 were identified in nw portugal in the tagus river basin and throughout most southern portugal specifically in the alentejo and algarve regions fig 6a nw portugal showed the largest annual increase in no3 concentration reached up to 16 mg no3 l 1 yr 1 but the tagus river basin attained the largest rho with municipalities where the increase was statistically significant fig 6b these regions coincide with the current nvzs in portugal and with the regions identified by serra et al 2021 as having a high risk of groundwater n contamination from agriculture other studies have emphasized nvzs in northern zeferino et al 2019 and southern hugman et al 2017 portugal in nw portugal the high groundwater vulnerability is likely the main driver for the high no3 concentrations despite the low agricultural hazard serra et al 2021 in the remaining regions both the high groundwater vulnerability and agricultural hazard play a major role in the high no3 concentrations serra et al 2021 our data shows that no3 concentrations remained stable in the nvzs rho 0 p 0 42 but reductions were achieved in many municipalities fig 6b the proposed rf model achieved a very good accuracy r2 of 0 78 0 10 and rmse of 22 75 6 37 the readers is referred to sm for further details the most important predictors were among soil soil ph texture field capacity groundwater porosity and water table depth management n leaching and the soil surface n balance topographical elevation and slope and demographic gross domestic product properties these findings are consistent to similar studies knoll et al 2019 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 ouedraogo et al 2019 spijker et al 2021 that employed rf to predict no3 in groundwater for surface waters the annual no3 concentrations of the all watersheds in mainland portugal was 5 12 9 61 mg no3 l 1 with an increasing trend rho 0 58 p 0 002 during the studied period on average the concentrations were higher in the coastal regions fig 6c particularly in southern i e algarve and nw portugal reaching 220 mg no3 l 1 in the former in the latter region we found statistically significant increasing trends fig 6d 3 3 spatiotemporal patterns of the nitrogen inputs from irrigation water sources nirrig increased from 7 to 8 9 gg n yr 1 in mainland portugal during 1995 2019 fig 7a despite this nirrig showed a declining trend rho 0 17 p 0 41 with marked annual fluctuations up to 10 7 gg n yr 1 in 2003 and down to 6 gg n yr 1 in 2014 approximately 91 2 of nirrig came from contaminated groundwater which is in line how sensitive the model is to a change of 25 in groundwater no3 fig 7a indeed our heuristic sensitivity analysis showed nirrig was more responsive to changes in ground 23 than surface water 2 the modification of all parameters at the same time yielded a variation of 38 and 43 in nirrig fig 7a in terms of tia we obtained an average of 13 8 11 2 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for 1995 2019 fig 7b shows the spatiotemporal variation of nirrig at the municipality level for 1995 2019 the impact of drought years on nirrig is less evident than in gir fig 4b but nonetheless the average annual nirrig for 2005 and 2017 were 12 and 10 larger than the average for the whole period fig 7b in some years nirrig was higher than 80 kg n ha 1 yr 1 even reaching up to 95 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in nw portugal fig 8a indeed our data shows that hotspots i e values twice the 80th quantile of 19 2 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for 1995 2019 readily highlighted in fig 8a coincide with the nvzs as of 2022 values of this magnitude i e 38 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 only occur in the nvzs due to the combination of both high agricultural hazard and groundwater vulnerability serra et al 2021 the spatial distribution for the tagus nvz is very comparable to cameira et al 2019 insofar as nirrig was both greater with an increasing trend in its upper section 50 70 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but while the hotspots identified in the upper half of mainland portugal above 39ºn show declining trends fig 8b the ones in the bottom half are increasing over time p 0 05 this contrasting situation shows that in fact nirrig is declining in most municipalities in northern portugal and vice versa for southern portugal 3 4 implications for policymaking aiming to provide prima facie evidence that irrigation is an overlooked source of n in agri environmental policies we compared nirrig with other agricultural n flows at the mainland level nirrig was the third largest cumulative n flow 205 gg n far smaller than manure 5 or synthetic fertilisers 9 but larger than n fixation 139 and deposition 104 fig 8c briefly our results reveal that the impact of nirrig in agri environmental indicators should in principle be relatively small at the mainland scale given the large difference to manure and synthetic fertilisers nonetheless nirrig attained a statistically significant trend relative to synthetic fertilisers 0 733 p 0 001 which were roughly 2 4 0 5 nfert and a reduction of less than 1 in the nue locally the overall impact is similar to the mainland level 3 0 4 3 nfert and 0 3 0 4 decrease in the nue but in some municipalities nirrig reached up to more than 80 nfert with an implicit reduction in the nue of 6 the impact on the nue would likely be much larger though to an unknown extent if we considered total irrigated areas rather than total agricultural land therefore not including nirrig in national agri environmental indicators should not impact noticeably most countries performance but locally not including it may severely over and underestimate nue and the local magnitude of n pollution hotspots respectively 3 5 application and mitigation measures we provide the first analysis for nirrig as a missing link between farmers practices and the agri environmental indicators using a spatially explicit approach this approach is considerably more detailed than previous attempts at regional to national scales which were derived based on national n coefficients from field studies hayashi et al 2021 he et al 2018 wang et al 2014 or the coupling of a water balance model with averaged n concentrations cameira et al 2021 recently wei and bailey 2021 have expanded the swat modelling framework to include a sub module that computes n in irrigation water sources in southeastern colorado although we applied our modelling framework to the portuguese agricultural systems a similar outcome is likely to occur in other mediterranean or in other countries with intensive cropping systems e g india china usa where i irrigation practices are common ii there is a heavy reliance on groundwater for irrigation and iii there is a widespread no3 contamination of groundwater for regions that rely mainly on surface water for irrigation our data suggests that the impact of nirrig should be relatively minor since the no3 concentration from this source is comparatively much smaller fig 6 but this may not be the case for countries with a different predominance of biogeochemical processes and pedoclimatic condition nirrig should be therefore further researched in countries that meet the above criteria our results point to a need to further develop and implement targeted measures for regions or catchments within national supra national agri environmental policies for instance in the nvzs nirrig must be accounted in balanced fertilization schemes to reduce the need for synthetic fertilisers or other n input sources if n inputs are reduced according to the magnitude of nirrig excessive no3 amounts present in the aquifers can be potentially reduced cameira et al 2019 by two processes the no3 in groundwater recharge is reduced and no3 already in groundwater are recycled for utilisation by crops it is unlikely however that farmers outside the nvzs are aware of the importance of nirrig as an alternative source of nutrients even if they are aware they may not have the technical knowledge required to estimate nirrig at the field scale and adjust fertilisation accordingly 3 6 strengths and limitations of the study the major strength of this study lies on the flexibility of the proposed framework it can be applied using locally parametrized process based models with field data to estimate nirrig at a local level e g farm or can be upscaled to larger spatial scales e g in this study such as continental or global provided there is sufficient coverage of no3 monitoring stations the application of this framework can be considered an important step towards closing the agricultural n cycle and optimizing n management in irrigated systems this is possible to be achieved at different scales i optimizing n fertilisation according to nirrig at the farm level and ii upscaling its impacts on water quality at the watershed level aggregating data at the national level may provide for key information flow for agricultural policies particularly in identifying n hotspots related to nirrig on the other hand the limitations are tied with data gaps in irrigated areas and insufficient monitoring stations measurements but also with the uncertainties of the models used to estimate irrigation requirements several studies refer that detailed temporal and spatial coverage of irrigation data has been a major issue e g siebert et al 2010 a more detailed alternative to the proposed interpolation scheme section 2 1 consists upon the data fusion approaches that merge statistics with remote sensing products to shorten this data gap e g zhang et al 2022 these however usually focus on total irrigated areas rather than crop and irrigation system specific areas the no3 concentration dataset has several data limitations due to irregular sampling frequencies and lack of specifications about sample depths within the saturated zone the latter limits our predictive approach which is unable to account for shallow and deep aquifers since no3 concentration varies with depth the irregular sampling period dilutes the effect of seasonality of nitrate concentrations particularly in surface water thus distorting our estimates of nirrig since annual averaged values were used it should be noted that the simplicity of the proposed methodology aimed to quantify the potential linkage and magnitude between irrigation and the agricultural n cycle at the expense of a greater accuracy even with the use of the process based model aquacrop the approach to estimate gir excluded local water availability which may not be realistic when there are water restrictions and farmers do not have access to water and therefore crops may experience water stress this can be of particular importance in the future due to changes in precipitation and temperature cramer et al 2018 4 conclusions the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources was quantified at the municipality level in mainland portugal for the period 1995 2019 results show that this input was a substantial source of nitrogen averaging 14 11 kg n ha 1 yr 1 but reaching up to 95 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 80 of the n from synthetic fertilisers in the nitrate vulnerable zones regions with high irrigation requirements and nitrate contaminated groundwater as a source were highlighted in intensively managed regions in coastal regions particularly throughout the different nitrate vulnerable zones although a slight declining trend was found for the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources its relative importance compared with the other agricultural n inputs increased over time this suggests that the current agri environmental indicators which do not account for this additional source of reactive nitrogen may fail to properly support policies by failing to accurately identify pollution hotspots and the real nitrogen use efficiency of agricultural systems this missing link between farmers management practices and agri environmental indicators needs to be bridged to optimize nutrient flows across spatial scales we presented a simple approach to derive the contribution of nitrate in the irrigation water sources at different spatial scales from local to national the nitrogen in irrigation water should be considered in fertilization plans and in the calculation of agri environmental indicators related to water and nutrient efficiency in agriculture coupled with root zone process based models this methodology can assist environmental managers and policymakers in decision making concerning national and regional scale catchment mitigation measures to improve water quality it is likely that the nitrogen input from irrigation water sources is an important issue in those areas of the world with widespread irrigation and nitrate contaminated groundwater the public private sector can play a larger role to raise awareness improve technical knowledge and steer farmers towards a better

9081,evapotranspiration et plays a vital role in surface energy balance and water management paddy rice is one of the most water intensive crops and a staple food worldwide thus paddy field et estimation is an impactful task in this paper an improved surface energy balance algorithm for land sebalr model is proposed to estimate the paddy field et and is validated in different climate zones it considers the advection effect and its applicable condition at the pixel scale and requires no ground measured data sebalr contains two core modules rice growth period detection and et retrieval sebalr accurately monitored the planting and harvest dates with an average error of less than 9 days except for a paddy field located in the us which had adopted dry seeding the comparison between the estimation results and eddy covariance data shows that sebalr can provide a more precise et estimation than the original surface energy balance algorithm for land yielding a root mean squared error rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 mean relative error mre of 22 97 and pearson s correlation r2 of 0 790 sebalr successfully monitored paddy field et from 2001 to 2019 in nanchang city nc china yearly et did not show an apparent change in trend from 2001 to 2019 in nc sebalr can be used to monitor the paddy rice growth period and estimate paddy field et at a regional scale with limited data providing helpful information for agricultural practices and water management keywords paddy field rice growth period detection evapotranspiration improved sebal model remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pressure on water resources is increasing worldwide due to many factors including urbanization and increasing demands for fiber biofuels and food meanwhile other factors such as climate change and evapotranspiration et changes may exacerbate water shortages d odorico et al 2020 flörke et al 2018 simons et al 2020 more than 85 of human water consumption was claimed by agriculture falkenmark and rockström 2004 and more than 62 of freshwater was consumed by agriculture in china over a decade exceeding 360 billion m3 per year ministry of water resources the people s republic of china 2022 as one of the most water intensive crops tuong et al 2005 paddy rice has the most extensive planting areas approximately 290 thousand km2 per year in china national bureau of statistics of china 2022 heavily influencing water resource management et is a crucial component of the water and carbon cycle playing a vital role in agricultural water management djaman et al 2017 irmak et al 2016 linquist et al 2015 thus determining the et for paddy rice is an important task generally et estimation methods can be separated into three main groups 1 field observations with in situ equipment such as lysimeters flux towers and large aperture scintillometers lage et al 2003 liu et al 2020 valayamkunnath et al 2018 2 weather based calculation methods allen et al 1998 hu et al 2009 qiu et al 2019 and 3 remote sensing based et models laipelt et al 2021 the field observation method can provide the most accurate et and present a time series variation if the observation is continuous however this method operates on a field scale and is labor intensive and incapable of providing precise regional information the weather based method supported by a robust theoretical basis can estimate large scale et when weather and crop information are available unfortunately this method has some limitations in et estimation for areas without sufficient primary data or other measures for instance the actual vegetative and growing conditions are hard to compare with the conditions represented by non stressed crop coefficient values in addition predicting the specific crop stage is a challenging task on a large scale allen et al 2007 mcshane et al 2017 with the immense challenges of performing et estimations in large areas many remote sensing based et models have been proposed for multiple temporal and spatial scales these models can be divided into two main categories 1 vegetation based vi based models including the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface evapotranspiration mod16 mu et al 2011 and the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and 2 temperature based ts based models include the two source time integrated model tstim anderson et al 1997 the surface energy balance algorithm for land model sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 the simple surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 the surface energy balance system model sebs su 2002 and the simplified surface energy balance model sseb senay et al 2007 some improved et estimation models were proposed based on the above models such as the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration model metric allen et al 2007 the modified sebal m sebal long and singh 2012 the sebal improved model sebali mhawej et al 2020 the sebali google earth engine sebaligee mhawej and faour 2020 and the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2022 sebal a temperature based model has been successfully applied over different landcover types worldwide jaafar and ahmad 2020 tang et al 2013 wagle et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 including paddy rice fields gao di long 2008 lee and kim 2016 wei et al 2022b sebal does not require aerodynamic temperature taero as input to calculate sensible flux h which is hardly obtained directly through the remote sensing method bastiaanssen et al 1998 more importantly sebal needs little input from incoming terrestrial data to calculate the actual et in each pixel and can further estimate et for large areas bashir et al 2008 many studies have indicated the occurrence of advection over irrigated croplands lei and yang 2010 demonstrated that regional irrigation enhances et and this increasing et accounted for 27 of the equilibrium et during the wheat seasons in the north china plain in northwest china advection accounted for 1 4 57 4 of daily et in an irrigated vineyard wang et al 2019 li and yu 2007 found that advection regularly occurred during wheat seasons leading et to be higher than 100 of the equilibrium et in some instances paddy rice is under flooded conditions over most of the growing season flooding substantially affects the surface energy balance components of a rice paddy relative to other upland crops terjung et al 1989 due to the high frequency of irrigation practices there might be more significant spatial heterogeneity of the temperature and humidity leading to advection effects on the heat flux kustas et al 2015 lei and yang 2010 li and yu 2007 lund and soegaard 2003 paddy fields have less water input irrigation and precipitation and lower temperatures in the fallow season than in the growing season therefore in this study the advection effect was considered during the paddy rice growth period rgp but not during the fallow season meanwhile sizeable horizontal wind velocities can promote the advection effect prueger et al 1996 rgp and wind speed were considered as the constraints of the advection effect for rice paddy et estimation yang et al 2012 demonstrated that advection effects should be considered when remote sensing models are applied to estimate regional et mkhwanazi et al 2015 described the advection effect on standard alfalfa fields using the drying power of the atmosphere liu et al 2016 proposed a method to quantify the advection effect on et through inverse distance weighting interpolations these studies successfully estimated the advection effect through ground measured data and remote sensing providing practical methods to calculate et when specific data are available however the data dependent characteristics hindered the application and migration of these methods precisely estimating advection effects is an arduous task through remote sensing due to the weak availability of some regional meteorological data for instance spatial temperature gradients and spatial humidity gradients therefore previous studies jaafar and ahmad 2020 tu et al 2020 estimated the difference between the instantaneous evaporation fraction and daily evaporation caused by the advection effect with a semiempirical equation and they indicated that advection occurs all the time however advection does not always occur because its generation requires specific circumstances for instance horizontal temperature gradient or wind hence the applicable prerequisites of the advection condition should be studied in et retrieval to quantify the advection effect for paddy field et in a more operable and portable manner a semiempirical method was used to describe the advection effect in the rice paddy at the pixel scale which required some easily accessed parameters and the applicable conditions were probed the applicable conditions of the advection equation rgp and wind speed threshold were introduced and the modified sebal model for paddy rice fields sebalr was proposed in this study landsat 5 7 8 datasets with 30 m spatial resolution and a revisit time of 16 days were adopted to estimate paddy rice et in nanchang city china and validated at three sites located in china the usa and south korea by combining different missions 5 7 or 7 8 sebalr can provide a 30 m spatial resolution et map with an 8 day revisit time the objective of this study is fourfold 1 to detect the rice growth period through remote sensing 2 to ascertain the applicable conditions of the advection factor in paddy fields 3 to estimate paddy rice et considering limited data and 4 to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of paddy rice et in nanchang city china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 in experimental fields 28 450 n 116 014 e in nanchang city jiangxi province china the site is a typical subtropical humid and monsoonal climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 18 1 0c annual sunshine duration of over 1700 h and annual precipitation of 1634 mm where double paddy rice is cultivated the early paddy rice was planted in late april and harvested in mid july the late paddy rice was planted in late july and harvested in late october or early november after harvesting the late paddy rice the field was fallow until the early rice was planted the following year the early and late rice were irrigated following flooded irrigation practices in which water was maintained excepting the late tillering and late maturity growth stages keeping dry conditions an open path eddy covariance opec system was installed at the central portion of the paddy field fig 1 to observe the paddy field et the details are described in section 2 2 3 the experimental field was approximately 42224 m2 209 208 m and 90 of the flux footprint was an irregular shape resembling a circle with a diameter of 100 m most of the time the same agricultural management was conducted throughout the whole field thus et should be approximate at different points in general the 3 3 pixel window scale et represents the most commonly measured scale of the opec system 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 remote sensing images the atmospherically corrected and precision terrain corrected land surface reflectance and land surface temperature lst datasets from landsat missions 5 7 and 8 were collected https earthexplorer usgs gov lsts are created with a single channel algorithm jointly developed by the rochester institute of technology and national aeronautics and space administration jet propulsion laboratory quality assessment bands were applied to exclude bad pixels and three visible one near infrared one shortwave infrared and one thermal infrared bands were used to calculate the spectrum index and broadband reflectance landsat provides 30 m spatial resolution images with a revisit time of 16 days two missions 5 7 or 7 8 were used simultaneously to improve the temporal resolution from 16 days to 8 days mcd12q1 https lpdaac usgs gov provides the global land cover types yearly with a 500 m spatial resolution the maps following the annual international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme were chosen as ancillary information for end member determination in the sebalr model the specific procedure can be found in appendix a the cloud cover from mod10a1 https nsidc org data mod10a1 versions 6 was used to estimate the daily sunshine durations with a one day temporal resolution and 500 m spatial resolution 2 2 2 meteorological data and digital elevation model data the era5 daily aggregates dataset https cds climate copernicus eu was selected as the meteorological input with a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution the wind speed at 10 m total precipitation max min mean air temperature and dew point temperature were used to calculate the effective flooding signal and daily reference evapotranspiration because the meteorological conditions will not change sharply in adjacent areas and the reliability of era5 has been validated by laipelt et al 2021 era5 was adopted regardless of its slightly coarse spatial resolution the 30 m shuttle radar topography mission farr et al 2007 digital elevation model dem https earthexplorer usgs gov dataset was adopted which underwent a void filling process using open source data a dem was used for paddy rice field identification the specific procedure can be found in section 2 3 1 for image compatibility all images whose spatial resolution was not 30 30 m were resampled to 30 30 m using cubic interpolation 2 2 3 validation data owing to the lack of regional et observations using et derived from open path eddy covariance opec systems is a common way to assess model performance bhattarai et al 2019 wagle et al 2017 many studies have reported that a negative sensible flux is an advection symbol alberto et al 2011 baldocchi et al 2016 liu et al 2019 which the opec system can capture meanwhile the opec system can monitor the total latent flux containing the imposed part from the advection effect which can be departed through the priestley taylor method alfieri et al 2012 kool et al 2018 estimated et24 h at each opec system location was obtained as an average of a 3 3 pixel window centered on the opec system coordinates to minimize errors associated with the distortion of pixels sun et al 2020 therefore using the latent flux from opec to validate the results from sebalr is reliable the opec system surrounded by paddy fields was equipped with a fast response 3d sonic anemometer windmasterpro gill instruments inc uk an open path h2o gas analyzer li 7500a li cor biosciences inc usa and a data logger li 7500a li cor biosciences inc usa all the sensors were installed at 2 5 m above ground level after raw flux data were processed through eddypro software https www licor com data that were flagged as low quality rainfall influence instrument malfunction and human disturbance by eddypro were removed in addition data with low friction velocity 0 15 m s 1 were eliminated and gap filling was conducted following the procedure from liu et al 2019 yielding daily and monthly et from 2017 to 2019 the data from january to april 2019 were missing due to equipment failure in theory turbulent energy sum of latent and sensible heat flux le h should equal available energy difference of net radiation and soil heat flux rn g however there was a difference between these two types of energy obtained from the opec system the bowen ratio β closure method was used to force an energy balance closure to diminish the imbalance of turbulent fluxes and available energy caused by measurement errors and advective effects kustas et al 2015 wohlfahrt et al 2009 following twine et al 2000 the residual energy rn le h g can be partitioned into h and le with the ratio of h and le 1 β h o l e o 2

dataset is reliable in terms of energy closure kustas et al 1999 meanwhile the actual rgp was collected in addition to data collected at the experimental site the other two opec datasets from the fluxnet community https fluxnet org table 1 were used to validate the performance of sebalr and the opec systems were installed in paddy rice fields the providers validated these datasets and evidenced their reliability the actual rgp huang et al 2018 knox et al 2016 was collected to validate the rgp detection module 2 2 4 other datasets to assess the performance of sebalr monthly et

detection compared to land crops paddy rice is constantly flooded during the growth period therefore the difference between the water and vegetation indexes can be used to identify paddy fields combined with other non paddy field masks dong et al 2016 the effective flooding signal fse method wei et al 2022a a phenology based algorithm was modified and adopted to identify the starting point of the rice growth period rgp compared with bare soil vegetation has higher reflectance in the near infrared band and a lower reflectance in the red band hence the vegetation indexes dropped sharply after harvest the threshold of vegetation indexes was applied to monitor the ending point of the rgp after the paddy fields were identified by the modified fse method the rgp was determined through the above process the specific procedures are as follows 1 identify paddy fields with the modified fse method 5 f s e 1 lswi ε ndviorevi andlst 10 c andlswi δ 0 others 6 ndvi ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ

paddy rice fields if flooding was detected several times f was between 5 and 33 wei et al 2022a regarding the spectrum of paddy rice worldwide actual observation data for determining specific parameters in different zones is lacking so the parameters ε 0 05 δ 0 15 with the best regional applicability were chosen from wei et al 2022a the bad pixels polluted by clouds and shadows were removed through bit arithmetic with quality assessment bands 2 after the paddy rice was mapped the fse was used to identify the starting point of the rice growth period spr and ndvi evi was used to determine the ending point of the rice growth period epr 10 spr min d o y f 11 epr max d o y evi 0 25 orndvi 0 35 spr 60 where doyf is the day of the year for the appearance of fse when there is no precipitation the days of the year during spr and epr were defined as rgp spr 60 was used to prohibit error identification of rgp because the vegetation index value is low at the initial stage of paddy rice growth and falls outside its growth stage xiao et al 2005 by averaging the evi or ndvi value of the paddy rice harvesting date when the data were available the values of 0 25 and 0 35 were determined 2 3 2 evapotranspiration retrieval paddy rice grows in water and soil mixture conditions which is unique compared to other croplands due to its enormous water demand paddy rice requires more irrigation amplifying the advection effect lei and yang 2010 in the growing season compared to the fallow season in addition to the underlying surface condition large horizontal wind velocities also promote the advection effect prueger et al 1996 therefore the two factors were considered based on the original sebal model for a more reasonable et through the combination of paddy rice mapping rgp detection wind speed threshold and the original sebal model the modified sebal sebalr was proposed which can estimate the paddy rice growth period and the et for a paddy field accurately with no ground measured data the workflow of sebalr is shown in fig 2 a semi empirical approach advective enhancement on advection mcnaughton 1976 was used to quantify et evaporation can be expressed as the sum of the equilibrium part and imposed part the same component composition of potential et is stated in the penman equation hobbins et al 2001 in this study et is divided into two parts equilibrium evapotranspiration eteq driven by available energy at the sites and imposed evapotranspiration etim due to extra energy brought in by advection the advection heat flux can be described with horizontal gradients of potential temperature and specific humidity tsai et al 2007 which are difficult to obtain on a regional scale a semi empirical equation rather than a constant anderson et al 1997 wilfried and michiaki 1992 was applied to quantify the advection effect on a regional scale the unique parts of sebalr different from sebal can be read as eqs 12 15 especially the applicable condition of the advection factor ω eq 14 other functions included with sebalr and sebal can be found in appendix a 12 e t 24 e t e q e t i m 13 e t i m ω e t e q 14 ω a e f e b v p d c spr t i epr u 2 ζ 0 others 15 e

retrieval models were generated table 2 the original sebal the original sebal with the advection factor but without restriction conditions sebala and the improved sebal sebalr which considered the applicable prerequisites of the advection factor to obtain the monthly yearly et the daily et is needed allen et al 1998 and lv et al 2018 illustrated that kc would not change sharply most of the time and linear interpolation was the recommended method to determine kc in crop development and late stages therefore the kc based method was adopted to calculate monthly et the specific procedures are listed as follows 1 daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated through meteorological data 2 kc et24 et0 was calculated when remote sensing images were available 3 rice kc of the day without remote sensing images was attained by linear interpolation 4 the continuous et24 was computed by et0 calculated in 1 and kc calculated in 3 5 monthly yearly et was obtained through the

psychrometric constant kpa 1 the other parameters have the same meaning as described above all calculation procedures are conducted through the google earth engine gee https code earthengine google com enabling paddy rice detection and paddy field et estimation to be automated without requiring specialized personnel and extra input datasets 2 4 mann kendall test to analyze the et variation trend with the circumstance factor the mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used in this study it searches for a trend in a series without specifying whether the trend is linear or not the specific value is regarded as a series so the et trend can be examined through the mk test method the details are as follows 1 each factor to be analyzed was sorted from smallest to largest and the corresponding et was recorded 2 the recorded et series was analyzed with the mk test method 17 s i 1 n j i 1 n sgn x j x i with 18 sgn x 1 if x 0 sgn 0 0 sgn x 1 if x 0 where xi xj is the ith jth value of the analyzed factor a positive negative value of statistic s suggests an increasing decreasing trend when n 8 the statistic s is approximately normally distributed with var s as follows 19 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 m t p p 1 2 p 5 where tp is the number of data in each tied group ets with the same value are bound into a tied group and m is the number of tied groups the standardized test statistic z follows the standard normal distribution 20 z s 1 v ar s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 v ar s if s 0 if the absolute value of z z1 α 2 the results demonstrate that et appears to have an apparent trend at the α confidence level where α is the statistical significance level concerned 2 5 performance metrics pearson s correlation r2 root mean squared error rmse and mean relative error mre were adopted in this study to evaluate the sebalr performance and to compare sebalr with other models 3 results 3 1 rice growth period according to the modified effective flooding signal method the paddy fields were successfully distinguished where the three opec systems are located after the paddy field maps were generated the spr and epr were detected through the above method and compared with the actual growth period of paddy rice one year results were randomly selected for each site and all the recorded data were compared with the simulated results fig 3 the estimated rgp coincided with the observed one with r2 0 931 vegetation and water indexes peaked between may and august and showed a synchronous change for each site vegetation indexes were higher than the water index in the year except for the rice transplanting phase which was reflected in eq 5 double paddy rice was planted at chn nc while single paddy rice was cultivated at the other sites so the spectral index profiles displayed a dual peak for chn nc but a single peak for the other sites the actual rgp for us twt was longer than that for kr crk because direct seeding was conducted at us twt but transplanting was carried out at kr crk in general the estimated rgp has a high degree of consistency with the actual rgp for the three sites however the estimated spr was later than the actual spr at us twt where the paddy field was flooded 45 60 days after planting 3 2 validation of evapotranspiration for paddy fields the difference between the et estimated against sebal and the observed et and its statistic s were used to analyze the wind speed threshold ζ at the three sites in fig 4 the error value shows an increasing trend to a negative value with the increase in wind speed u2 demonstrating that sebal underestimated et with the u2 increase a logistic model fits the statistics s and u2 showing good performance r2 0 993 this model shows that the error remains stable fluctuating around zero before u2 reaches the threshold the end of the curve flattens out caused by the low data volume of high wind speed the curve s might keep decreasing if the data volume is adequate the statistic s decreases sharply where u2 is more significant than 1 0 m s 1 indicating an accumulation of underestimations to have a robust performance avoiding overuse of the advection factor ζ was set as 1 5 m s 1 and was adopted at three sites overall the estimated et from sebalr showed high accuracy at three sites fig 5 and table 3 with a total rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 compared to the observed et from opec ranging between 0 97 and 1 14 mm d 1 the total mre and r2 generated from sebalr were 22 97 and 0 790 respectively from table 3 the estimation results from sebalr are superior to those of sebala and sebal at chn nc and us twt and show similar performance to sebal at kr crk just 6 8 8 117 of data are corrected by the advection factor in kr crk due to the restricted condition from eq 13 but more than 36 of data are updated in other sites which is why sebalr and sebal did not show appearance differences in kr crk but did at other sites as shown in fig 5 the dots of observations and simulations from seblar are scattered around the line of 1 1 demonstrating that sebalr can accurately reflect the rice paddy et trend sebal regularly underestimates the high value at chn cn and us twt probably due to the omission of the advection effect however overusing the advection factor leads sebala to overestimate rice paddy et therefore overusing or not applying the advection factor regularly magnifies the et estimation calculation error in agricultural practice period et also attracts much attention so the annual average monthly et was calculated through sebalr at three sites and compared with opec data fig 6 the maximum and minimum monthly et occurred from june to august and january respectively the results indicate a high accuracy for the sebalr estimation of monthly et with an average rmse and mre of 14 48 mm month 1 ranging from 10 73 to 16 94 mm month 1 and 13 35 ranging from 12 26 to 14 52 respectively there might be three sources for the monthly et estimation error 1 the daily et calculation error from the model structure 2 the et0 calculation error from the uncertainty of the era5 datasets and 3 sampling issues in the proposed method et was calculated only for clear days when satellite images were available so the estimated monthly et was higher than that observed in some months 3 3 long term et monitoring of paddy field et in nanchang city china the sebalr model was used to quantify the paddy field et from 2001 to 2019 in nanchang city nc china what is striking in fig 7 is that an apparent spatial difference existed in the annual paddy field et in nc specifically the low value was always concentrated in the northwest where the water supplementation is insufficient away from rivers and lakes compared to other regions however the high value was scattered in different parts the et did not show an apparent spatial pattern in 2010 2015 2016 and 2017 when the yearly et was lower than in other years demonstrating that the soil moisture water supplementation might not be the restriction of et the annual et the average of all pixels identified as paddy fields was 1161 mm year 1 from 2001 to 2019 mainly ranging between 950 and 1200 mm year 1 although the pixel et had a wide range for one year it always showed a normal distribution and most pixels were concentrated at approximately 1100 mm year 1 fig 8 however approximately 0 9 of abnormal data were shown tiny data 800 mm year 1 which might be caused by the poor quality of the remote sensing images or commission errors from paddy rice mapping some upland fields were identified as paddy fields after analyzing the circumstance factors fig 9 et showed apparent positive relevance to the lst vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature at 2 m height ta and net radiation rn nevertheless the relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m u2 did not appear to have patent relevance to et ta possesses the largest determination coefficient 0 803 with et followed by vpd 0 758 lst 0 707 and rn 0 558 the results of the mk test table 4 demonstrate that et showed an increasing trend with increasing vpd lst rn and ta and other factors were the opposite a higher rn means that more available energy can be supplied so the et might be higher when other factors are consistent or similar in addition higher lst ta can improve et under some conditions olivera guerra et al 2017 sun et al 2016 vpd is the difference between the saturated vapor at the current air temperature and the actual vapor which describes the air dryness in other words a higher vpd means that the air has a greater ability to absorb water therefore the et displays a consistent trend with vpd contrary to common sense the opposite trend between u2 and et is presented in fig 9 and table 4 et is affected by a complex interaction among climate vegetation and soil zhang et al 2001 and the circumstance factors are constantly in flux therefore it might be unreliable to conclude that et was inhibited by u2 when just a single element u2 is analyzed ta and u2 were analyzed with the mk test and u2 displayed a decreasing trend with increasing ta demonstrating that ta decreases with increasing u2 on the other hand the positive effect of u2 on et is weakened by the negative impact of ta on u2 nevertheless it should be noted that the above trend between ta and u2 is just in statistical significance and does not represent the physical reality because the meteorological factor has a complex interaction 4 discussion 4 1 performance of sebalr when the advection factor was considered with its applicable conditions the estimated et from sebalr was in better agreement with the opec datasets than the original sebal model on a daily scale this improvement is consistent with the suggestion of underestimating sebal compared with the actual et value long and singh 2012 mhawej et al 2020 singh et al 2008 rgp detection based on the modified fse and vegetation index showed good performance and can be applied in different districts and planting patterns direct seeding and transplanting this method distinct from the threshold algorithms ishikawa et al 2015 liao et al 2018 is independent of the rice varieties and specific planting dates jiang et al 2021 applied the decision tree method with the red edge band to monitor the rgp in china and obtained good results the machine learning method was chosen by ramadhani et al 2020 to detect the rice growth phase and showed good performance however these methods rely on the sample number and quality when this sample is limited or of low quality the rgp detection method based on fse can be a choice compared to sebala and sebal the sebalr model performs better for paddy rice et estimation in different climate zones with a mean rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 paddy rice requires more irrigation practices than other upland crops and this unique water management method can amplify the advection effect for its moist conditions alberto et al 2011 gao di long 2008 therefore considering the advection effect for paddy fields during the growing season not the fallow season might be reasonable given that advection does not occur all the time u2 was introduced into sebalr as a limitation combining rgp detection and the threshold of u2 the results of sebalr were better than those of sebala nevertheless due to the complex water condition changes for paddy fields the calculation accuracy of sebalr might be lower than that in some research concentrating on upland crops and vegetation bhattarai et al 2017 but higher than that in many previous studies rahimzadegan and janani 2019 sun et al 2020 zhou et al 2014 fig 10 shows a comparison between monthly et from multimodel and opec systems at three sites the results indicated that sebalr had higher accuracy in paddy rice et estimation than the other models at the three sites yielding an average error from 7 9 5 2 mm month 1 and an r2 value higher than 0 78 in general the ts based models sebalr sebali and ssebop show better performance at most sites than the vi based model mod16 however sebali showed apparent uncertainty with an mbe of 166 28 at kr crk an evident overestimation which might be overcome by local ground data calibration mhawej and faour 2020 meanwhile ssebop accuracy could be increased through local calibration and parameterization bhattarai et al 2016 unfortunately the calibration of sebali and parameterization of ssebop were not conduct in this study compared to previous sebal models such as sebali ssebop does not need to determine the endmember pixels eliminating the subjective error introduced by endmember selection nevertheless the automatic selection method the inverse modeling at extreme conditions algorithm allen et al 2013 was adopted in sebalr which could alleviate the uncertainty introduced by endmember selection mod16 showed a lower accuracy than other models when compared to opec data for paddy fields with obvious underestimation as observed in previous studies xue and ko 2022 but with higher accuracy in homogeneous grassland khan et al 2018 for mod16 the mixture of water and crop pixels compromised et estimation accuracy during the beginning of the rice cropping growing season souza et al 2019 the low spatial resolution of global meteorological reanalysis data yang et al 2015 and landcover maps kim et al 2012 kiptala et al 2013 might be another reason for low accuracy therefore sebalr is much more applicable for paddy field et estimation 4 2 model structure and uncertainty of sebalr sebalr mainly consists of two modules rgp detection and et retrieval compared to the original sebal sebalr couples the advection effect corrected algorithms yielding a higher et calculation accuracy meanwhile sebalr has advection limits rgp detection and wind speed threshold which are not contained in sebala eliminating the overuse of the advection factor singh and senay 2016 highlighted that the performance in estimating et is not necessarily associated with model complexity however model uncertainty is typically associated with input data and model structure the influence of bad weather conditions might lead to remote sensing imagery being unavailable for some months hindering et estimations additionally the pixels missed entirely during the flooding period of paddy rice might result in the omission of rice paddies as shown in fig 11 the usable images for us twt mean 2 5 images month 1 and kr crk mean 2 4 images month 1 are more than those for chn nc mean 1 6 images month 1 where conditions are more humid and susceptible to clouds more than one image can be used to calculate the et for most months but the quantity might be insufficient when paddy rice development changes drastically the lack of remote sensing images might be one source of calculation error uncertainty about the rice growth period rgp detection module might also result in some et misestimations the starting point of the rice growth period spr detection could be impacted by rainfall in some scenarios although the precipitation threshold 0 was used to exclude some misidentifications specifically precipitation occurs during the actual rice paddy flooding period and the detected spr is delayed beyond the actual flooding period due to the discarding of fse however when the precipitation threshold is not applied the spr is moved ahead of the actual flooding period if precipitation occurs given the greater probability of the first error occurring than the latter the precipitation threshold was used in rgp detection the algorithm of rgp detection for paddy rice was constructed to account for the most common water management practices in flooded paddies pereira et al 2021 and this method is helpful for other paddy rice water management practices such as flooding before transplanting however for aerobic rice choudhury et al 2013 moratiel and martínez cob 2013 rgp detection might fail due to the low value of lswi from the absence of a water layer rgp detection for different water management practices or breeds should be considered in future studies different agronomic measures for paddy fields might weaken the effectiveness of rgp detection including straw mulching after harvest qin et al 2006 and rotation ghosh et al 2020 kadiyala et al 2012 and the extent of their impact could be explored in subsequent research for the et estimation module the advection effect was considered in sebalr compared to the original sebal it is evident that advection is an energy transport between the adjacent pixels however analyzing the interaction of the pixels might be difficult due to calculation complexities from the energy component land cover and transmission mechanism alfieri et al 2012 therefore this study applied only the individual pixel based correction factor not the interaction between the pixels additionally sebalr has supplemented the applicable conditions of advection compared to sebala diminishing the overuse of advection correction and the overestimation of rice paddy et previous studies liu et al 2016 mkhwanazi et al 2015 quantified the advection effect based on in situ observation data producing good results while sebalr requires no ground measured data hence the application of sebalr will not be limited by primary data in the future a more precise description of the interaction of different pixels should be given to further explore the advection effect on et meanwhile irrigation practices might affect et estimation for instance the land surface temperature of drywet alternate irrigation fields is sometimes higher than that of flood irrigation paddy fields but there are no significant differences in et reavis et al 2021 however sebal sebalr is sensitive to lst so sebal sebalr might misestimate the paddy rice field et when drywet alternating irrigation is conducted the effect of different agronomic measures on et estimation based on remote sensing is expected to be explored in the future 5 conclusion with no ground measured data the regional paddy field et was obtained through sebalr in nanchang city china and the model was validated in different climate zones cfa csa and dwa compared to the sebalf and sebala models the advection factor and its limitations rgp detection and wind speed threshold were considered in sebalr yielding better performance in different climate zones the rgp detection module can accurately monitor the paddy rice planting and harvest dates in different zones which shows good portability through specific planting date detections the temporal scheduling of agricultural water management could be more straightforward and effective meanwhile ζ 1 5 m s 1 is recommended to diminish the overuse of the advection factor the comparison between the sebalr estimated et and the opec data demonstrates the accuracy of sebalr over different climate zones yielding a total rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 a total mre of 22 97 and r2 values higher than 0 75 for all the sites where flooding irrigation practices are adopted the estimation results from sebalr show higher consistency with the opec data than the sebala sebalf model over the paddy fields demonstrating that consideration of the advection factor and its limiting is reliable this model can provide information about the paddy rice growth stage and more accurate results for the paddy field et where flooding irrigation practices are conducted with limited data since sebalr requires no ground measured data it is expected to provide meaningful worldwide

9081,evapotranspiration et plays a vital role in surface energy balance and water management paddy rice is one of the most water intensive crops and a staple food worldwide thus paddy field et estimation is an impactful task in this paper an improved surface energy balance algorithm for land sebalr model is proposed to estimate the paddy field et and is validated in different climate zones it considers the advection effect and its applicable condition at the pixel scale and requires no ground measured data sebalr contains two core modules rice growth period detection and et retrieval sebalr accurately monitored the planting and harvest dates with an average error of less than 9 days except for a paddy field located in the us which had adopted dry seeding the comparison between the estimation results and eddy covariance data shows that sebalr can provide a more precise et estimation than the original surface energy balance algorithm for land yielding a root mean squared error rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 mean relative error mre of 22 97 and pearson s correlation r2 of 0 790 sebalr successfully monitored paddy field et from 2001 to 2019 in nanchang city nc china yearly et did not show an apparent change in trend from 2001 to 2019 in nc sebalr can be used to monitor the paddy rice growth period and estimate paddy field et at a regional scale with limited data providing helpful information for agricultural practices and water management keywords paddy field rice growth period detection evapotranspiration improved sebal model remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pressure on water resources is increasing worldwide due to many factors including urbanization and increasing demands for fiber biofuels and food meanwhile other factors such as climate change and evapotranspiration et changes may exacerbate water shortages d odorico et al 2020 flörke et al 2018 simons et al 2020 more than 85 of human water consumption was claimed by agriculture falkenmark and rockström 2004 and more than 62 of freshwater was consumed by agriculture in china over a decade exceeding 360 billion m3 per year ministry of water resources the people s republic of china 2022 as one of the most water intensive crops tuong et al 2005 paddy rice has the most extensive planting areas approximately 290 thousand km2 per year in china national bureau of statistics of china 2022 heavily influencing water resource management et is a crucial component of the water and carbon cycle playing a vital role in agricultural water management djaman et al 2017 irmak et al 2016 linquist et al 2015 thus determining the et for paddy rice is an important task generally et estimation methods can be separated into three main groups 1 field observations with in situ equipment such as lysimeters flux towers and large aperture scintillometers lage et al 2003 liu et al 2020 valayamkunnath et al 2018 2 weather based calculation methods allen et al 1998 hu et al 2009 qiu et al 2019 and 3 remote sensing based et models laipelt et al 2021 the field observation method can provide the most accurate et and present a time series variation if the observation is continuous however this method operates on a field scale and is labor intensive and incapable of providing precise regional information the weather based method supported by a robust theoretical basis can estimate large scale et when weather and crop information are available unfortunately this method has some limitations in et estimation for areas without sufficient primary data or other measures for instance the actual vegetative and growing conditions are hard to compare with the conditions represented by non stressed crop coefficient values in addition predicting the specific crop stage is a challenging task on a large scale allen et al 2007 mcshane et al 2017 with the immense challenges of performing et estimations in large areas many remote sensing based et models have been proposed for multiple temporal and spatial scales these models can be divided into two main categories 1 vegetation based vi based models including the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface evapotranspiration mod16 mu et al 2011 and the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and 2 temperature based ts based models include the two source time integrated model tstim anderson et al 1997 the surface energy balance algorithm for land model sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 the simple surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 the surface energy balance system model sebs su 2002 and the simplified surface energy balance model sseb senay et al 2007 some improved et estimation models were proposed based on the above models such as the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration model metric allen et al 2007 the modified sebal m sebal long and singh 2012 the sebal improved model sebali mhawej et al 2020 the sebali google earth engine sebaligee mhawej and faour 2020 and the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2022 sebal a temperature based model has been successfully applied over different landcover types worldwide jaafar and ahmad 2020 tang et al 2013 wagle et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 including paddy rice fields gao di long 2008 lee and kim 2016 wei et al 2022b sebal does not require aerodynamic temperature taero as input to calculate sensible flux h which is hardly obtained directly through the remote sensing method bastiaanssen et al 1998 more importantly sebal needs little input from incoming terrestrial data to calculate the actual et in each pixel and can further estimate et for large areas bashir et al 2008 many studies have indicated the occurrence of advection over irrigated croplands lei and yang 2010 demonstrated that regional irrigation enhances et and this increasing et accounted for 27 of the equilibrium et during the wheat seasons in the north china plain in northwest china advection accounted for 1 4 57 4 of daily et in an irrigated vineyard wang et al 2019 li and yu 2007 found that advection regularly occurred during wheat seasons leading et to be higher than 100 of the equilibrium et in some instances paddy rice is under flooded conditions over most of the growing season flooding substantially affects the surface energy balance components of a rice paddy relative to other upland crops terjung et al 1989 due to the high frequency of irrigation practices there might be more significant spatial heterogeneity of the temperature and humidity leading to advection effects on the heat flux kustas et al 2015 lei and yang 2010 li and yu 2007 lund and soegaard 2003 paddy fields have less water input irrigation and precipitation and lower temperatures in the fallow season than in the growing season therefore in this study the advection effect was considered during the paddy rice growth period rgp but not during the fallow season meanwhile sizeable horizontal wind velocities can promote the advection effect prueger et al 1996 rgp and wind speed were considered as the constraints of the advection effect for rice paddy et estimation yang et al 2012 demonstrated that advection effects should be considered when remote sensing models are applied to estimate regional et mkhwanazi et al 2015 described the advection effect on standard alfalfa fields using the drying power of the atmosphere liu et al 2016 proposed a method to quantify the advection effect on et through inverse distance weighting interpolations these studies successfully estimated the advection effect through ground measured data and remote sensing providing practical methods to calculate et when specific data are available however the data dependent characteristics hindered the application and migration of these methods precisely estimating advection effects is an arduous task through remote sensing due to the weak availability of some regional meteorological data for instance spatial temperature gradients and spatial humidity gradients therefore previous studies jaafar and ahmad 2020 tu et al 2020 estimated the difference between the instantaneous evaporation fraction and daily evaporation caused by the advection effect with a semiempirical equation and they indicated that advection occurs all the time however advection does not always occur because its generation requires specific circumstances for instance horizontal temperature gradient or wind hence the applicable prerequisites of the advection condition should be studied in et retrieval to quantify the advection effect for paddy field et in a more operable and portable manner a semiempirical method was used to describe the advection effect in the rice paddy at the pixel scale which required some easily accessed parameters and the applicable conditions were probed the applicable conditions of the advection equation rgp and wind speed threshold were introduced and the modified sebal model for paddy rice fields sebalr was proposed in this study landsat 5 7 8 datasets with 30 m spatial resolution and a revisit time of 16 days were adopted to estimate paddy rice et in nanchang city china and validated at three sites located in china the usa and south korea by combining different missions 5 7 or 7 8 sebalr can provide a 30 m spatial resolution et map with an 8 day revisit time the objective of this study is fourfold 1 to detect the rice growth period through remote sensing 2 to ascertain the applicable conditions of the advection factor in paddy fields 3 to estimate paddy rice et considering limited data and 4 to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of paddy rice et in nanchang city china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 in experimental fields 28 450 n 116 014 e in nanchang city jiangxi province china the site is a typical subtropical humid and monsoonal climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 18 1 0c annual sunshine duration of over 1700 h and annual precipitation of 1634 mm where double paddy rice is cultivated the early paddy rice was planted in late april and harvested in mid july the late paddy rice was planted in late july and harvested in late october or early november after harvesting the late paddy rice the field was fallow until the early rice was planted the following year the early and late rice were irrigated following flooded irrigation practices in which water was maintained excepting the late tillering and late maturity growth stages keeping dry conditions an open path eddy covariance opec system was installed at the central portion of the paddy field fig 1 to observe the paddy field et the details are described in section 2 2 3 the experimental field was approximately 42224 m2 209 208 m and 90 of the flux footprint was an irregular shape resembling a circle with a diameter of 100 m most of the time the same agricultural management was conducted throughout the whole field thus et should be approximate at different points in general the 3 3 pixel window scale et represents the most commonly measured scale of the opec system 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 remote sensing images the atmospherically corrected and precision terrain corrected land surface reflectance and land surface temperature lst datasets from landsat missions 5 7 and 8 were collected https earthexplorer usgs gov lsts are created with a single channel algorithm jointly developed by the rochester institute of technology and national aeronautics and space administration jet propulsion laboratory quality assessment bands were applied to exclude bad pixels and three visible one near infrared one shortwave infrared and one thermal infrared bands were used to calculate the spectrum index and broadband reflectance landsat provides 30 m spatial resolution images with a revisit time of 16 days two missions 5 7 or 7 8 were used simultaneously to improve the temporal resolution from 16 days to 8 days mcd12q1 https lpdaac usgs gov provides the global land cover types yearly with a 500 m spatial resolution the maps following the annual international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme were chosen as ancillary information for end member determination in the sebalr model the specific procedure can be found in appendix a the cloud cover from mod10a1 https nsidc org data mod10a1 versions 6 was used to estimate the daily sunshine durations with a one day temporal resolution and 500 m spatial resolution 2 2 2 meteorological data and digital elevation model data the era5 daily aggregates dataset https cds climate copernicus eu was selected as the meteorological input with a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution the wind speed at 10 m total precipitation max min mean air temperature and dew point temperature were used to calculate the effective flooding signal and daily reference evapotranspiration because the meteorological conditions will not change sharply in adjacent areas and the reliability of era5 has been validated by laipelt et al 2021 era5 was adopted regardless of its slightly coarse spatial resolution the 30 m shuttle radar topography mission farr et al 2007 digital elevation model dem https earthexplorer usgs gov dataset was adopted which underwent a void filling process using open source data a dem was used for paddy rice field identification the specific procedure can be found in section 2 3 1 for image compatibility all images whose spatial resolution was not 30 30 m were resampled to 30 30 m using cubic interpolation 2 2 3 validation data owing to the lack of regional et observations using et derived from open path eddy covariance opec systems is a common way to assess model performance bhattarai et al 2019 wagle et al 2017 many studies have reported that a negative sensible flux is an advection symbol alberto et al 2011 baldocchi et al 2016 liu et al 2019 which the opec system can capture meanwhile the opec system can monitor the total latent flux containing the imposed part from the advection effect which can be departed through the priestley taylor method alfieri et al 2012 kool et al 2018 estimated et24 h at each opec system location was obtained as an average of a 3 3 pixel window centered on the opec system coordinates to minimize errors associated with the distortion of pixels sun et al 2020 therefore using the latent flux from opec to validate the results from sebalr is reliable the opec system surrounded by paddy fields was equipped with a fast response 3d sonic anemometer windmasterpro gill instruments inc uk an open path h2o gas analyzer li 7500a li cor biosciences inc usa and a data logger li 7500a li cor biosciences inc usa all the sensors were installed at 2 5 m above ground level after raw flux data were processed through eddypro software https www licor com data that were flagged as low quality rainfall influence instrument malfunction and human disturbance by eddypro were removed in addition data with low friction velocity 0 15 m s 1 were eliminated and gap filling was conducted following the procedure from liu et al 2019 yielding daily and monthly et from 2017 to 2019 the data from january to april 2019 were missing due to equipment failure in theory turbulent energy sum of latent and sensible heat flux le h should equal available energy difference of net radiation and soil heat flux rn g however there was a difference between these two types of energy obtained from the opec system the bowen ratio β closure method was used to force an energy balance closure to diminish the imbalance of turbulent fluxes and available energy caused by measurement errors and advective effects kustas et al 2015 wohlfahrt et al 2009 following twine et al 2000 the residual energy rn le h g can be partitioned into h and le with the ratio of h and le 1 β h o l e o 2 l e c r n g 1 β 3 h c r n g l e c 4 e b r l e o h o r n g where subscript o c is the original corrected data the energy balance ratio ebr of the original data is 0 86 which demonstrates that the dataset is reliable in terms of energy closure kustas et al 1999 meanwhile the actual rgp was collected in addition to data collected at the experimental site the other two opec datasets from the fluxnet community https fluxnet org table 1 were used to validate the performance of sebalr and the opec systems were installed in paddy rice fields the providers validated these datasets and evidenced their reliability the actual rgp huang et al 2018 knox et al 2016 was collected to validate the rgp detection module 2 2 4 other datasets to assess the performance of sebalr monthly et derived from sebalr was compared against the well validated vi based et model mod16 and ts based model sebali and ssebop the monthly et from mod16 was obtained from the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac https lpdaac usgs gov sebaligee the sebali algorithm conducted on the google earth engine gee platform produces the monthly et automatically when the study area is selected mhawej and faour 2020 monthly et derived from ssebop was downloaded from the united states geological survey https edcintl cr usgs gov 2 3 sebalr 2 3 1 algorithms for rice growth period detection compared to land crops paddy rice is constantly flooded during the growth period therefore the difference between the water and vegetation indexes can be used to identify paddy fields combined with other non paddy field masks dong et al 2016 the effective flooding signal fse method wei et al 2022a a phenology based algorithm was modified and adopted to identify the starting point of the rice growth period rgp compared with bare soil vegetation has higher reflectance in the near infrared band and a lower reflectance in the red band hence the vegetation indexes dropped sharply after harvest the threshold of vegetation indexes was applied to monitor the ending point of the rgp after the paddy fields were identified by the modified fse method the rgp was determined through the above process the specific procedures are as follows 1 identify paddy fields with the modified fse method 5 f s e 1 lswi ε ndviorevi andlst 10 c andlswi δ 0 others 6 ndvi ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ r e d 7 lswi ρ n i r ρ s w i r ρ n i r ρ s w i r 8 evi 2 5 ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r 6 0 ρ r e d 7 5 ρ b l u e 1 9 f f s e n g where lst is the land surface temperature ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index evi is the enhanced vegetation index lswi is the land surface water index ρnir ρred ρblue and ρswir are the surface reflectances of the near infrared red blue and shortwave infrared bands respectively f is the fse frequency of each pixel and σng is the total number of good observations for each pixel flooding is considered when fse is equal to 1 the land surface was identified as paddy rice fields if flooding was detected several times f was between 5 and 33 wei et al 2022a regarding the spectrum of paddy rice worldwide actual observation data for determining specific parameters in different zones is lacking so the parameters ε 0 05 δ 0 15 with the best regional applicability were chosen from wei et al 2022a the bad pixels polluted by clouds and shadows were removed through bit arithmetic with quality assessment bands 2 after the paddy rice was mapped the fse was used to identify the starting point of the rice growth period spr and ndvi evi was used to determine the ending point of the rice growth period epr 10 spr min d o y f 11 epr max d o y evi 0 25 orndvi 0 35 spr 60 where doyf is the day of the year for the appearance of fse when there is no precipitation the days of the year during spr and epr were defined as rgp spr 60 was used to prohibit error identification of rgp because the vegetation index value is low at the initial stage of paddy rice growth and falls outside its growth stage xiao et al 2005 by averaging the evi or ndvi value of the paddy rice harvesting date when the data were available the values of 0 25 and 0 35 were determined 2 3 2 evapotranspiration retrieval paddy rice grows in water and soil mixture conditions which is unique compared to other croplands due to its enormous water demand paddy rice requires more irrigation amplifying the advection effect lei and yang 2010 in the growing season compared to the fallow season in addition to the underlying surface condition large horizontal wind velocities also promote the advection effect prueger et al 1996 therefore the two factors were considered based on the original sebal model for a more reasonable et through the combination of paddy rice mapping rgp detection wind speed threshold and the original sebal model the modified sebal sebalr was proposed which can estimate the paddy rice growth period and the et for a paddy field accurately with no ground measured data the workflow of sebalr is shown in fig 2 a semi empirical approach advective enhancement on advection mcnaughton 1976 was used to quantify et evaporation can be expressed as the sum of the equilibrium part and imposed part the same component composition of potential et is stated in the penman equation hobbins et al 2001 in this study et is divided into two parts equilibrium evapotranspiration eteq driven by available energy at the sites and imposed evapotranspiration etim due to extra energy brought in by advection the advection heat flux can be described with horizontal gradients of potential temperature and specific humidity tsai et al 2007 which are difficult to obtain on a regional scale a semi empirical equation rather than a constant anderson et al 1997 wilfried and michiaki 1992 was applied to quantify the advection effect on a regional scale the unique parts of sebalr different from sebal can be read as eqs 12 15 especially the applicable condition of the advection factor ω eq 14 other functions included with sebalr and sebal can be found in appendix a 12 e t 24 e t e q e t i m 13 e t i m ω e t e q 14 ω a e f e b v p d c spr t i epr u 2 ζ 0 others 15 e

using the original sebal and its error 2 order the wind speed and record the corresponding error and 3 use eqs 19 20 for analysis the first part of eq 15 is eteq and the second part is etim three et retrieval models were generated table 2 the original sebal the original sebal with the advection factor but without restriction conditions sebala and the improved sebal sebalr which considered the applicable prerequisites of the advection factor to obtain the monthly yearly et the daily et is needed allen et al 1998 and lv et al 2018 illustrated that kc would not change sharply most of the time and linear interpolation was the recommended method to determine kc in crop development and late stages therefore the kc based method was adopted to calculate monthly et the specific procedures are listed as follows 1 daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated through meteorological data 2 kc et24 et0 was calculated when remote sensing images were available 3 rice kc of the day without remote sensing images was attained by linear interpolation 4 the continuous et24 was computed by et0 calculated in 1 and kc calculated in 3 5 monthly yearly et was obtained through the accumulation of the daily et 16 e t 0 0 408 δ r n 24 g 24 γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where t is the mean daily air temperature δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 1 the other parameters have the same meaning as described above all calculation procedures are conducted through the google earth engine gee https code earthengine google com enabling paddy rice detection and paddy field et estimation to be automated without requiring specialized personnel and extra input datasets 2 4 mann kendall test to analyze the et variation trend with the circumstance factor the mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used in this study it searches for a trend in a series without specifying whether the trend is linear or not the specific value is regarded as a series so the et trend can be examined through the mk test method the details are as follows 1 each factor to be analyzed was sorted from smallest to largest and the corresponding et was recorded 2 the recorded et series was analyzed with the mk test method 17 s i 1 n j i 1 n sgn x j x i with 18 sgn x 1 if x 0 sgn 0 0 sgn x 1 if x 0 where xi xj is the ith jth value of the analyzed factor a positive negative value of statistic s suggests an increasing decreasing trend when n 8 the statistic s is approximately normally distributed with var s as follows 19 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 m t p p 1 2 p 5 where tp is the number of data in each tied group ets with the same value are bound into a tied group and m is the number of tied groups the standardized test statistic z follows the standard normal distribution 20 z s 1 v ar s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 v ar s if s 0 if the absolute value of z z1 α 2 the results demonstrate that et appears to have an apparent trend at the α confidence level where α is the statistical significance level concerned 2 5 performance metrics pearson s correlation r2 root mean squared error rmse and mean relative error mre were adopted in this study to evaluate the sebalr performance and to compare sebalr with other models 3 results 3 1 rice growth period according to the modified effective flooding signal method the paddy fields were successfully distinguished where the three opec systems are located after the paddy field maps were generated the spr and epr were detected through the above method and compared with the actual growth period of paddy rice one year results were randomly selected for each site and all the recorded data were compared with the simulated results fig 3 the estimated rgp coincided with the observed one with r2 0 931 vegetation and water indexes peaked between may and august and showed a synchronous change for each site vegetation indexes were higher than the water index in the year except for the rice transplanting phase which was reflected in eq 5 double paddy rice was planted at chn nc while single paddy rice was cultivated at the other sites so the spectral index profiles displayed a dual peak for chn nc but a single peak for the other sites the actual rgp for us twt was longer than that for kr crk because direct seeding was conducted at us twt but transplanting was carried out at kr crk in general the estimated rgp has a high degree of consistency with the actual rgp for the three sites however the estimated spr was later than the actual spr at us twt where the paddy field was flooded 45 60 days after planting 3 2 validation of evapotranspiration for paddy fields the difference between the et estimated against sebal and the observed et and its statistic s were used to analyze the wind speed threshold ζ at the three sites in fig 4 the error value shows an increasing trend to a negative value with the increase in wind speed u2 demonstrating that sebal underestimated et with the u2 increase a logistic model fits the statistics s and u2 showing good performance r2 0 993 this model shows that the error remains stable fluctuating around zero before u2 reaches the threshold the end of the curve flattens out caused by the low data volume of high wind speed the curve s might keep decreasing if the data volume is adequate the statistic s decreases sharply where u2 is more significant than 1 0 m s 1 indicating an accumulation of underestimations to have a robust performance avoiding overuse of the advection factor ζ was set as 1 5 m s 1 and was adopted at three sites overall the estimated et from sebalr showed high accuracy at three sites fig 5 and table 3 with a total rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 compared to the observed et from opec ranging between 0 97 and 1 14 mm d 1 the total mre and r2 generated from sebalr were 22 97 and 0 790 respectively from table 3 the estimation results from sebalr are superior to those of sebala and sebal at chn nc and us twt and show similar performance to sebal at kr crk just 6 8 8 117 of data are corrected by the advection factor in kr crk due to the restricted condition from eq 13 but more than 36 of data are updated in other sites which is why sebalr and sebal did not show appearance differences in kr crk but did at other sites as shown in fig 5 the dots of observations and simulations from seblar are scattered around the line of 1 1 demonstrating that sebalr can accurately reflect the rice paddy et trend sebal regularly underestimates the high value at chn cn and us twt probably due to the omission of the advection effect however overusing the advection factor leads sebala to overestimate rice paddy et therefore overusing or not applying the advection factor regularly magnifies the et estimation calculation error in agricultural practice period et also attracts much attention so the annual average monthly et was calculated through sebalr at three sites and compared with opec data fig 6 the maximum and minimum monthly et occurred from june to august and january respectively the results indicate a high accuracy for the sebalr estimation of monthly et with an average rmse and mre of 14 48 mm month 1 ranging from 10 73 to 16 94 mm month 1 and 13 35 ranging from 12 26 to 14 52 respectively there might be three sources for the monthly et estimation error 1 the daily et calculation error from the model structure 2 the et0 calculation error from the uncertainty of the era5 datasets and 3 sampling issues in the proposed method et was calculated only for clear days when satellite images were available so the estimated monthly et was higher than that observed in some months 3 3 long term et monitoring of paddy field et in nanchang city china the sebalr model was used to quantify the paddy field et from 2001 to 2019 in nanchang city nc china what is striking in fig 7 is that an apparent spatial difference existed in the annual paddy field et in nc specifically the low value was always concentrated in the northwest where the water supplementation is insufficient away from rivers and lakes compared to other regions however the high value was scattered in different parts the et did not show an apparent spatial pattern in 2010 2015 2016 and 2017 when the yearly et was lower than in other years demonstrating that the soil moisture water supplementation might not be the restriction of et the annual et the average of all pixels identified as paddy fields was 1161 mm year 1 from 2001 to 2019 mainly ranging between 950 and 1200 mm year 1 although the pixel et had a wide range for one year it always showed a normal distribution and most pixels were concentrated at approximately 1100 mm year 1 fig 8 however approximately 0 9 of abnormal data were shown tiny data 800 mm year 1 which might be caused by the poor quality of the remote sensing images or commission errors from paddy rice mapping some upland fields were identified as paddy fields after analyzing the circumstance factors fig 9 et showed apparent positive relevance to the lst vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature at 2 m height ta and net radiation rn nevertheless the relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m u2 did not appear to have patent relevance to et ta possesses the largest determination coefficient 0 803 with et followed by vpd 0 758 lst 0 707 and rn 0 558 the results of the mk test table 4 demonstrate that et showed an increasing trend with increasing vpd lst rn and ta and other factors were the opposite a higher rn means that more available energy can be supplied so the et might be higher when other factors are consistent or similar in addition higher lst ta can improve et under some conditions olivera guerra et al 2017 sun et al 2016 vpd is the difference between the saturated vapor at the current air temperature and the actual vapor which describes the air dryness in other words a higher vpd means that the air has a greater ability to absorb water therefore the et displays a consistent trend with vpd contrary to common sense the opposite trend between u2 and et is presented in fig 9 and table 4 et is affected by a complex interaction among climate vegetation and soil zhang et al 2001 and the circumstance factors are constantly in flux therefore it might be unreliable to conclude that et was inhibited by u2 when just a single element u2 is analyzed ta and u2 were analyzed with the mk test and u2 displayed a decreasing trend with increasing ta demonstrating that ta decreases with increasing u2 on the other hand the positive effect of u2 on et is weakened by the negative impact of ta on u2 nevertheless it should be noted that the above trend between ta and u2 is just in statistical significance and does not represent the physical reality because the meteorological factor has a complex interaction 4 discussion 4 1 performance of sebalr when the advection factor was considered with its applicable conditions the estimated et from sebalr was in better agreement with the opec datasets than the original sebal model on a daily scale this improvement is consistent with the suggestion of underestimating sebal compared with the actual et value long and singh 2012 mhawej et al 2020 singh et al 2008 rgp detection based on the modified fse and vegetation index showed good performance and can be applied in different districts and planting patterns direct seeding and transplanting this method distinct from the threshold algorithms ishikawa et al 2015 liao et al 2018 is independent of the rice varieties and specific planting dates jiang et al 2021 applied the decision tree method with the red edge band to monitor the rgp in china and obtained good results the machine learning method was chosen by ramadhani et al 2020 to detect the rice growth phase and showed good performance however these methods rely on the sample number and quality when this sample is limited or of low quality the rgp detection method based on fse can be a choice compared to sebala and sebal the sebalr model performs better for paddy rice et estimation in different climate zones with a mean rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 paddy rice requires more irrigation practices than other upland crops and this unique water management method can amplify the advection effect for its moist conditions alberto et al 2011 gao di long 2008 therefore considering the advection effect for paddy fields during the growing season not the fallow season might be reasonable given that advection does not occur all the time u2 was introduced into sebalr as a limitation combining rgp detection and the threshold of u2 the results of sebalr were better than those of sebala nevertheless due to the complex water condition changes for paddy fields the calculation accuracy of sebalr might be lower than that in some research concentrating on upland crops and vegetation bhattarai et al 2017 but higher than that in many previous studies rahimzadegan and janani 2019 sun et al 2020 zhou et al 2014 fig 10 shows a comparison between monthly et from multimodel and opec systems at three sites the results indicated that sebalr had higher accuracy in paddy rice et estimation than the other models at the three sites yielding an average error from 7 9 5 2 mm month 1 and an r2 value higher than 0 78 in general the ts based models sebalr sebali and ssebop show better performance at most sites than the vi based model mod16 however sebali showed apparent uncertainty with an mbe of 166 28 at kr crk an evident overestimation which might be overcome by local ground data calibration mhawej and faour 2020 meanwhile ssebop accuracy could be increased through local calibration and parameterization bhattarai et al 2016 unfortunately the calibration of sebali and parameterization of ssebop were not conduct in this study compared to previous sebal models such as sebali ssebop does not need to determine the endmember pixels eliminating the subjective error introduced by endmember selection nevertheless the automatic selection method the inverse modeling at extreme conditions algorithm allen et al 2013 was adopted in sebalr which could alleviate the uncertainty introduced by endmember selection mod16 showed a lower accuracy than other models when compared to opec data for paddy fields with obvious underestimation as observed in previous studies xue and ko 2022 but with higher accuracy in homogeneous grassland khan et al 2018 for mod16 the mixture of water and crop pixels compromised et estimation accuracy during the beginning of the rice cropping growing season souza et al 2019 the low spatial resolution of global meteorological reanalysis data yang et al 2015 and landcover maps kim et al 2012 kiptala et al 2013 might be another reason for low accuracy therefore sebalr is much more applicable for paddy field et estimation 4 2 model structure and uncertainty of sebalr sebalr mainly consists of two modules rgp detection and et retrieval compared to the original sebal sebalr couples the advection effect corrected algorithms yielding a higher et calculation accuracy meanwhile sebalr has advection limits rgp detection and wind speed threshold which are not contained in sebala eliminating the overuse of the advection factor singh and senay 2016 highlighted that the performance in estimating et is not necessarily associated with model complexity however model uncertainty is typically associated with input data and model structure the influence of bad weather conditions might lead to remote sensing imagery being unavailable for some months hindering et estimations additionally the pixels missed entirely during the flooding period of paddy rice might result in the omission of rice paddies as shown in fig 11 the usable images for us twt mean 2 5 images month 1 and kr crk mean 2 4 images month 1 are more than those for chn nc mean 1 6 images month 1 where conditions are more humid and susceptible to clouds more than one image can be used to calculate the et for most months but the quantity might be insufficient when paddy rice development changes drastically the lack of remote sensing images might be one source of calculation error uncertainty about the rice growth period rgp detection module might also result in some et misestimations the starting point of the rice growth period spr detection could be impacted by rainfall in some scenarios although the precipitation threshold 0 was used to exclude some misidentifications specifically precipitation occurs during the actual rice paddy flooding period and the detected spr is delayed beyond the actual flooding period due to the discarding of fse however when the precipitation threshold is not applied the spr is moved ahead of the actual flooding period if precipitation occurs given the greater probability of the first error occurring than the latter the precipitation threshold was used in rgp detection the algorithm of rgp detection for paddy rice was constructed to account for the most common water management practices in flooded paddies pereira et al 2021 and this method is helpful for other paddy rice water management practices such as flooding before transplanting however for aerobic rice choudhury et al 2013 moratiel and martínez cob 2013 rgp detection might fail due to the low value of lswi from the absence of a water layer rgp detection for different water management practices or breeds should be considered in future studies different agronomic measures for paddy fields might weaken the effectiveness of rgp detection including straw mulching after harvest qin et al 2006 and rotation ghosh et al 2020 kadiyala et al 2012 and the extent of their impact could be explored in subsequent research for the et estimation module the advection effect was considered in sebalr compared to the original sebal it is evident that advection is an energy transport between the adjacent pixels however analyzing the interaction of the pixels might be difficult due to calculation complexities from the energy component land cover and transmission mechanism alfieri et al 2012 therefore this study applied only the individual pixel based correction factor not the interaction between the pixels additionally sebalr has supplemented the applicable conditions of advection compared to sebala diminishing the overuse of advection correction and the overestimation of rice paddy et previous studies liu et al 2016 mkhwanazi et al 2015 quantified the advection effect based on in situ observation data producing good results while sebalr requires no ground measured data hence the application of sebalr will not be limited by primary data in the future a more precise description of the interaction of different pixels should be given to further explore the advection effect on et meanwhile irrigation practices might affect et estimation for instance the land surface temperature of drywet alternate irrigation fields is sometimes higher than that of flood irrigation paddy fields but there are no significant differences in et reavis et al 2021 however sebal sebalr is sensitive to lst so sebal sebalr might misestimate the paddy rice field et when drywet alternating irrigation is conducted the effect of different agronomic measures on et estimation based on remote sensing is expected to be explored in the future 5 conclusion with no ground measured data the regional paddy field et was obtained through sebalr in nanchang city china and the model was validated in different climate zones cfa csa and dwa compared to the sebalf and sebala models the advection factor and its limitations rgp detection and wind speed threshold were considered in sebalr yielding better performance in different climate zones the rgp detection module can accurately monitor the paddy rice planting and harvest dates in different zones which shows good portability through specific planting date detections the temporal scheduling of agricultural water management could be more straightforward and effective meanwhile ζ 1 5 m s 1 is recommended to diminish the overuse of the advection factor the comparison between the sebalr estimated et and the opec data demonstrates the accuracy of sebalr over different climate zones yielding a total rmse of 1 02 mm d 1 a total mre of 22 97 and r2 values higher than 0 75 for all the sites where flooding irrigation practices are adopted the estimation results from sebalr show higher consistency with the opec data than the sebala sebalf model over the paddy fields demonstrating that consideration of the advection factor and its limiting is reliable this model can provide information about the paddy rice growth stage and more accurate results for the paddy field et where flooding irrigation practices are conducted with limited data since sebalr requires no ground measured data it is expected to provide meaningful worldwide

9082,paddy field is a major global land use form however frequent fluctuations in soil water content make paddy fields important n2o emission sources the contribution of n2o uptake to the reduction in net n2o emission from paddy soil varies with water content nevertheless little is known about the impact of physicochemical factors microbial regulatory mechanisms and water content on n2o uptake in paddy soil we designed and conducted a microcosm experiment controlled for gravimetric water content and applied exogenous n2o to three paddy soils differing in texture and parent material during the incubation period we monitored the headspace n2o content measured the ammonia n nitrate n and dissolved organic carbon content and analyzed the number of nosz containing microorganisms for all three paddy soils the total n2o uptake was 50 71 at 20 gravimetric water content the total n2o uptake increased exponentially r2 0 96 with water content throughout the incubation period the highest n2o uptake range 73 94 78 44 was detected at 70 gravimetric water content hence paddy soil can absorb and consume abundant n2o at different water content and prolonging the flooding period in the field could enhance the total n2o uptake furthermore n2o uptake was strongly positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon consumption and increase in nosz gene abundance p 0 001 under various water content the average n2o uptake in silty clay loam soil was 385 20 μg kg 1 which was significantly higher than those for loam and sandy loam soils 351 98 μg kg 1 p 0 05 moreover nosz gene abundance was substantially higher in scl than the other soils future research should endeavor to determine the mechanisms by which nh4 n content ph and organic carbon content affect n2o uptake in different types of paddy soil keywords nitrous oxide uptake nitrous oxide reductase gene paddy soil soil water content soil parent material data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrous oxide is the third major greenhouse gas ghg after carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 stocker 2014 n2o has 298 fold higher warming potential than co2 tian et al 2020 soil is the principal n2o emission source and accounts for 50 60 of the total atmospheric n2o however it was empirically determined that soil is also a sink of n2o soil n2o absorption and consumption were first observed in laboratory experiments in 1976 blackmer and bremner 1976 subsequent field trials on soil n2o uptake and consumption corroborated the hypothesis of blackmer and bremner stating that soil is a potential atmospheric n2o sink verchot et al 1999 prior studies reported net negative n2o flux but few of them explored the potential causes stuchiner and von fischer 2022 tangen and bansal 2022 tian et al 2020 the quantities of n2o that soils uptake and consume may be more important than previously assumed yang and silver 2016 in both natural and artificial ecosystems of temperate and tropical regions the net rate of n2o consumption is in the range of 1 0 207 μg n m 2 h 1 chapuis lardy et al 2007 schlesinger 2013 the international atomic energy agency ieae 1992 estimated that the global soil n2o uptake is in the range of 7 13 tg n2o n y 1 which is similar to the amount of n2o consumed by photolysis in the stratosphere 9 tg n2o n y 1 majumdar 2013 soil n2o uptake was first designated an important potential n2o sink in the 2013 ipcc working report stocker 2014 therefore soil n2o uptake could substantially reduce atmospheric n2o and merits further investigation n2o is uptake and consumed in the soil mainly via nitrous oxide reductase nosz containing denitrifying microorganisms that reduce n2o to n2 this reaction is considered the only effective biotransformation mechanism in this process qin et al 2021 several studies revealed the relationship between soil n2o reduction and the abundance gao et al 2017 hallin et al 2018 qin et al 2021 structure and gene expression kern and simon 2016 mania et al 2016 spiro 2012 of nosz containing microorganisms negative soil n2o emission is regulated by nosz containing microorganisms and is affected by soil water content soil nitrogen content dissolve organic carbon doc ph soil parent material soil temperature soil aeration and soil c n ratio liu et al 2022a majumdar 2013 soil water content is significantly positively correlated with soil n2o uptake and consumption soil water content and soil physical properties largely determine soil porosity pore distribution liu et al 2022b soil o2 diffusion and by extension microbial denitrification intensity n2o uptake and n2o consumption soils with very high water content are extremely anoxic under this condition ammonia mono oxygenase amo activity is inhibited n2o reductase activity is promoted n2o is reduced to n2 juhanson et al 2017 liu et al 2022b and n2o emission is negative castro barros et al 2017 siljanen et al 2020 soil n2o uptake tends to increase with soil water content schlesinger 2013 compared n2o uptake rates among different soil types and found that n2o uptake in paddies wetland and other soil ecosystems with high water content was in the range of 100 207 μg n m 2 h 1 however it was also reported that upland soil with lower water content had strong n2o uptake and consumption capacity goldberg and gebauer 2009 found that during the dry season forest soil exhibited significant negative n2o emission hence it was a temporary n2o sink nevertheless increasing the water content turned the forest soil into a transient n2o source wu et al 2013 stated that in corn fields n2o uptake and consumption were highest at low water content 5 20 wfps thus an anaerobic environment with high water content may not necessarily be required for converting n2o to inert n2 the n2o uptake and consumption pathways and rates and the response patterns of n2o reducing microorganisms may vary among agricultural soils differing in water content rice paddy is a vital form of agricultural utilization it covers an area of 1 35 million ha worldwide and 20 of it is in china li et al 2014 qin et al 2021 the n2o emissions from paddy soil in china account for 20 of the global total yue et al 2019 the unique water management pattern of paddy soil causes it to undergo frequently alternating wetting and drying clarifying n2o uptake and consumption and their microbial mechanisms in paddy soil under different water content may provide an important reference for the mitigation of n2o emission in paddy fields in this study three typical paddy soils with different parent materials in subtropical agricultural areas of china were selected as research objects we then designed and performed microcosm experiments using four different water gradients and added exogenous n2o to the soil surfaces the aims of the study were to determine 1 the uptake of headspace n2o by paddy soil under different moisture conditions 2 the response of nosz gene abundance to various moisture contents in paddy soils and 3 the relationships among n2o uptake nosz gene abundance and other physicochemical factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sample collection and pretreatment soils with three contrasting textures were evaluated they are typically distributed in subtropical regions the silty clay loam scl was derived from river alluvial parent material the sandy loam sl originated from lake deposits and the loam l formed from quaternary red loam the paddy fields were double cropping rice planting soils 50 y old traditional water management was implemented for them all during the rice growing period the traditional water management of paddy fields was flooding in the early stage drying in the middle stage and drying and wetting alternately in the late stage the 0 5 cm surface paddy soil was collected on december 2016 by the multipoint sampling method wang et al 2019 mixed air dried passed through a 5 mm sieve and used in a laboratory microcosm experiment basic physicochemical data for the three soil types are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experimental device was a 1 l d 9 5 cm wide mouth bottle fitted with a rubber

soil at the highest n2o consumption rate determined from preliminary experiments 2 2 1 microcosm experiment air dried sieved scl sl and l soil samples were weighed out 50 0 5 g and placed evenly on the bottom of the bottle sterilized water was added to the soil surface until the target water content was attained the bottle mouth was sealed with plastic wrap and the vessel was placed in the laboratory at 25 c for 7 d to activate the soil microorganisms xing et al 2021 the bottle was then sealed with a rubber stopper for the n2o treatment 30 ml n2o at a concentration of 1000 μmol mol 1

ml gas samples were injected by syringe into a 12 ml vacuum glass cylinder and 27 ml high purity he was added to maintain high gas pressure for the control ck 20 ml gas samples were injected by syringe into a 12 ml vacuum glass cylinder before each gas sample collection the syringe connected to the three way valve was struck 15 20 times to blend the gas in the headspace after gas collection

mean sem of three replicates 3 results 3 1 n2o uptake and consumption dynamics in paddy soils with various water content temporal variations in the headspace n2o content were essentially equal for all three paddy soils figs 1a c for ck the headspace n2o content was consistently low average 0 86 μg at all water content throughout the incubation period for the n2o added group the headspace n2o content decreased with increasing incubation time at all water content conditions the n2o content in scl sl and l at 70 water content had decreased significantly more than those for the three soil types at the other water content p 0 001 their n2o content at 125 h were 21 56 26 06 and 25 9 of those at 0 h respectively according to table 2 the n2o uptake were significantly affected by n2o treatment soil type and soil water content p 0 001 and the interactions of n2o treatment vs soil type and n2o treatment vs soil water content cause extremely effects on the n2o uptake p 0 001 the total n2o uptake was highest at 70 water and accounted for 73 94 78 44 of the n2o added group the total n2o uptake was lowest at 20 water and accounted for 50 71 57 19 of the n2o added group the rate of decrease in headspace n2o content gradually decreased with time figs 1a 1c decrease in the n2o content slope reached its maximum between 0 h and 3 h and the averages were 1 066 0 903 and 0 779 for scl sl and l respectively fig 1 shows that the n2o uptake rates within 3 h in scl sl and l were 19 26 18 06 and 15 58 μg kg 1 h 1 these values were significantly p 0 05 higher than the average within 125 h fig 1d shows that the total n2o uptake in scl sl and l increased with soil water content there was an exponential regression between n2o uptake and water content r2 0 96 under various water

consumption increased with soil water content in the n2o added groups of scl sl and l the highest values were in range of 115 69 126 33 mg kg 1 in scl the no3 n consumption significantly differ between the n2o added group and ck at 70 water content fig 2b the no3 n content increased at an average of 4 56 mg kg 1 at 20 35 and 50 water content at 70 water content the no3 n consumption rates were 1 31 and 4 40 mg kg 1 in the n2o added group and ck for sl no3 n increased by 3 54 mg kg 1 at 20 35 and 50 water content in the n2o added group no3 n consumption was in the range of 0 39 0 46 mg kg 1 for all other treatments for l the no3 n content at 20 35 50 and 70 water content decreased in the n2o added group by an average of 0 88 mg kg 1 for ck the no3 n content slightly increased at 20 and 35 water content and decreased to 1 56 mg kg 1 at 50 and 70 water content fig 2c shows that over the 125 h incubation period the nh4 n content of all three paddy soils at various water content increased for both ck and the n2o added group the nh4 n content in both groups initially increased and then decreased with increasing water content the maximum increases in nh4 n content in scl cl and l occurred at 50 water content and 113 26 138 47 and 211 45 mg kg 1 respectively 3 3 nosz gene abundance at 125 h in three soils with different water content fig 3a showed that the abundance of the nosz gene in ck and the n2o added group significantly increased with water content p 0 05 compared with ck the nosz gene abundance in n2o added group had increased by 32 473 31 2 34 03 and 35 74 on

consumption p 0 05 the maximum n2o uptake rate was strongly positively correlated with soil water content increase in nosz gene abundance and doc consumption p 0 001 the increase in nosz gene abundance was strongly positively correlated with soil water content and doc consumption p 0 001 and positively correlated with no3 n consumption and nh4 n production p 0 05 fig 4b shows that the variance explanation rates for the two extracted principal components were 47 7 and 30 5 and the cumulative variance explanation rate was 78 2 clay and silt percentage significantly increased n2o

uptake in l soil 4 discussion 4 1 abundant n2o could be absorbed by paddy soil with different water content soil is an important atmospheric n2o emission source however it can also uptake and consume atmospheric n2o wu et al 2013 in 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc working report listed soil n2o uptake as an important potential global n2o stocker 2014 subsequent studies focused on soil n2o uptake and consumption wang et al 2021 n2o uptake is widespread among various soil types and is in the ranging of 0 13 207 μg m2 h 1 majumdar 2013 schlesinger 2013 ye and horwath 2016 nevertheless n2o uptake is relatively low in dryland soils 4 μg m2 h 1 chapuis lardy et al 2007 siljanen et al 2020 measured n2o flux in the boreal forests of finland and found that the average n2o uptake for 25 measurement points was 3 525 μg m2 h 1 shvaleva et al 2015 reported that the maximum net n2o uptake in the 0 20 cm layer of mediterranean oak forest soil was 6 5 μg m2 h 1 the present study showed that the proportion of n2o uptake was 50 71 in three paddy soils with 20 water content and the maximum n2o uptake and consumption rate was in the range of 80 34 114 10 μg m2 h 1 the latter was significantly higher than that for forest soil hence paddy soil with lower water content had high n2o uptake and consumption capacity this phenomenon may be associated with the unique water management patterns characteristic of paddy soils long term flooding intermittent drying and wetting significantly increase the abundance of denitrifying and especially nosz containing microorganisms compared to that of dryland soil banerjee et al 2016 the n2o uptake rates of all three paddy soils increased with water content the maximum n2o uptake rates were 104 30 127 81 and 171 76 μg m2 h 1 at 35 50 and 70 water content respectively the total n2o uptake exponentially increased r2 0 96 with water content throughout the incubation period fig 1d liu et al 2022b analyzed the effects of 20 40 60 80 and 100 whc on n2o production and uptake in a fluventic ustochrept soil and found that its n2o uptake increased with water content and attained a maximum of 4 17 2 74 μg m2 h 1 at 80 whc wu et al 2013 found that under aerobic conditions exogenous n2o uptake and consumption by paddy soils was not significant at 2 10 or 20 gwc but was significant at 40 and 50 gwc the n2o uptake and consumption rate was 48 therefore n2o uptake and consumption generally increase with water content in different soils and environments here we observed the highest n2o uptake at 70 water content in all three paddy soils the scl sl and l uptake and consumed 78 44 73 94 and 74 10 respectively of the n2o in a 125 h incubation period water saturated soils had relatively higher n2o uptake and consumption rates such as the paddy field n2o uptake and consumption rates were in the range of 0 13 191 μg m2 h 1 whereas those of the wetlands and peatlands were in the range of 17 207 μg m2 h 1 majumdar 2013 schlesinger 2013 ye and horwath 2016 as the soil water content increases the pores are filled with water anaerobic microenvironments are created and the n2o is reduced to n2 liu et al 2022a under these conditions soil diffusion coefficients are low and solubility is high low diffusivity prolongs soil n2o retention and facilitates denitrifying bacteria mediated n2o reduction to n2 yano et al 2014 several studies showed that the soil water content regulates soil production and emission dynamics by influencing the activity of denitrifying microorganism and their related enzymes heincke and kaupenjohann 1999 majumdar 2013 doc mineralization and utilization by microorganisms also increase with soil water content liu et al 2022b particularly when the latter is 60 70 wfps and denitrifying microorganisms proliferate bateman and baggs 2005 liu et al 2022b qin et al 2021 the present study showed that 35 gwc is roughly equivalent to 70 wfps de hofman 2002 the abundances of the nosz gene in the three soils at 35 50 and 70 water content were significantly higher than those of the same soils at 20 water content p 0 05 fig 3a qin et al 2021 reported that 75 125 wfps promoted nosz genes to a significantly higher activity than 25 or 50 wfps the relationships among the increases in nosz gene abundance and the water gradients in the scl sl and l soils fit a linear regression equation fig 3b similar positive relationship between the abundance of nitrous oxide reducing bacteria noszi and noszii and soil moisture content was reported by liu et al 2022b with wheat maize rotational cropping soil therefore the close link between nosz gene abundance and soil water content is common in dryland soil or paddy soil which is closely related to the n2o uptake moreover the soil doc content regulates denitrifying microorganism activity wang et al 2022 most microorganisms harboring the nosz gene are complete and chemoheterotrophic denitrifiers thus they require additional carbon containing compounds as electron donors in redox reactions and for their own reproductive metabolism morley and baggs 2010 doc consumption throughout the incubation period was strongly positively correlated with nosz gene abundance and n2o consumption p 0 001 fig 4a other studies showed that readily degradable organic carbon promotes the reduction of n2o to n2 and increases nosz gene abundance and n2 n2o n2 mathieu et al 2006 wang et al 2022 ye and horwath 2016 here doc consumption in all three soils of the n2o added group increased with water content fig 2a these findings were consistent with the dynamics of nosz gene abundance fig 3b the soil water content directly affects available carbon utilization by nosz containing functional microorganisms and regulates total n2o uptake and consumption adequate doc also stimulates respiration in soil microorganisms accelerates oxygen consumption and creates hypoxic or anoxic environments conducive to the complete reduction of n2o to n2 by denitrifying microorganisms sanchez martin et al 2008 the results from these controlled environmental conditions with disturbed soil showed abundant n2o could be absorbed by paddy soil with different water content and the maximum n2o uptake rates were at 70 gwc in order to guide the water management in rice field to promote atmospheric n2o uptake and reduce total n2o emissions more field studies are needed to confirm the strong n2o uptake capacity in paddy soil at different water content 4 2 n2o uptake capacity of different types of paddy soil paddy rice is a major food crop in southern china paddy soils have a wide geographical distribution and originated from various parent materials sheng et al 2015 different parent materials form a wide array of soil textures and influence soil permeability fertility status porosity and water retention mazza et al 2018 wlodarczyk et al 2011 these physicochemical differences create wide variation in denitrifying microorganism species and abundance and therefore n2o uptake among soil types lan et al 2013 liu et al 2022a previous studies showed that the air permeability of soil decreases with increasing soil particle size low air permeability favors anoxia which in turn promotes denitrifying microorganism growth mangalassery et al 2013 all three types of paddy soils absorbed abundant n2o however n2o uptake was significantly higher in the scl than the l and sl soils at various water content p 0 05 the soil n2o uptake order was scl l sl fig 2 the relative increase in nosz gene abundance after 96 h also followed the sequence scl l sl fig 3a hence the nosz gene bearing microorganisms in the scl soil most effectively used n2o for growth and reproduction possibly because the scl soil has the highest clay content table 1 clay provides anaerobic microsites conducive to the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and denitrification thus the denitrifiers consume more n2o in scl than l or sl soil wlodarczyk t et al 2011 conducted a 34 d anaerobic closed incubation experiment and found that the total n2o consumption in eutric cambisols accounted for 32 9 99 2 and 100 of the n2o production in sandy soil loam soil and silty loam respectively lan et al 2013 found that n2o uptake and consumption in soil derived from alluvial parent material was higher in clay loams than silty loams the n2o diffusion time was prolonged in finer textured soils this environment was conducive to n2o reduction by denitrifying bacteria and enhanced n2o uptake and consumption our principal component analysis pca disclosed that clay content affected n2o uptake in scl soils whereas sand content affected n2o uptake in sl soils fig 4b therefore soil texture strongly affects n2o uptake in different paddy soils total nitrogen organic carbon sand content and doc consumption also markedly influenced n2o uptake in sl soil because anaerobic environments only partially form in soil structures with large particles abundant supplies of available and stored carbon for the microorganisms in this soil type substantially limit n2o consumption soils with large particles are well ventilated and have unstable carbon high c n ratios and abundant oxygen compared to those with fine particles hence the former soil texture facilitates the growth and reproduction of aerobic microorganisms liu et al 2022b six et al 2004 hassink et al 1993 concluded that microbial biomass c n ratios were higher in sandy than loamy or clayey soils therefore we speculated that the c n ratio of organic matter was higher in sl soil than in scl or l soils which was more conducive to the aerobic microorganisms in sl soil soil available potassium ak and ph influenced n2o uptake and consumption in l fig 4b the ph affects microbial functions in loamy soil with better air permeability and water permeability by appropriate sand and silt percentage n2o reductase activity decreases at ph 5 but increases as the ph rises saleh lakha et al 2009 hence higher ph promotes n2o reduction to n2 and favors negative n2o emission liu et al 2022a saleh lakha et al 2009 there is a close association between soil ak content and the abundance of typical n2o reducing microorganisms juhanson et al 2017 and wang et al 2022 reported that the abundance of the nosz gene population was significantly positively correlated with ak numerous physicochemical factors influence n2o absorption and consumption in the soil moreover the effect of a single factor may vary among different soil types based on our incubation results further studies should focus on the measurement of n2o uptake in rice field and try to figure out the main factors affecting the n2o uptake in various paddy soils 5 conclusion paddy soils originating from three different parent materials scl sl and l uptake abundant n2o from the soil surface at different water content the n2o uptake rates at 20 gravimetric water content were 57 19 51 65 and 50 71 in the scl sl and l soils respectively these values were significantly higher than those for other types of uplands total n2o uptake throughout the incubation period exponentially increased with water content r2 0 95 total n2o uptake reached its highest values at 70 gravimetric water content namely 470 63 443 63and 444 59 μg kg 1 in the scl sl and l soils respectively possibly because paddy soils have high doc low no3 n and abundant nosz containing microorganisms the three soils derived from different parent materials markedly varied in texture n2o uptake was significantly higher for scl soil mean 385 20 μg kg 1 than sl soil mean 351 52 μg kg 1 and l soil mean 352 43 μg kg 1 soil soils composed primarily of small particles form anaerobic microdomains conducive to nosz containing microorganism proliferation and activity the average increase in nosz gene in scl soil was 8 98 107 copies g 1 and was 1 27 107 and 2 26 107 copies g 1 higher than those in sl and l soil respectively hence the elevated nosz gene abundance in scl soil favored n2o uptake and consumption there moreover ph and nh4 n and organic carbon content dramatically influence n2o uptake in various soil types future research should endeavor to elucidate the mechanisms by which these factors differentially affect the uptake of n2o in various paddy soils funding sources this research was funded by the national

9082,paddy field is a major global land use form however frequent fluctuations in soil water content make paddy fields important n2o emission sources the contribution of n2o uptake to the reduction in net n2o emission from paddy soil varies with water content nevertheless little is known about the impact of physicochemical factors microbial regulatory mechanisms and water content on n2o uptake in paddy soil we designed and conducted a microcosm experiment controlled for gravimetric water content and applied exogenous n2o to three paddy soils differing in texture and parent material during the incubation period we monitored the headspace n2o content measured the ammonia n nitrate n and dissolved organic carbon content and analyzed the number of nosz containing microorganisms for all three paddy soils the total n2o uptake was 50 71 at 20 gravimetric water content the total n2o uptake increased exponentially r2 0 96 with water content throughout the incubation period the highest n2o uptake range 73 94 78 44 was detected at 70 gravimetric water content hence paddy soil can absorb and consume abundant n2o at different water content and prolonging the flooding period in the field could enhance the total n2o uptake furthermore n2o uptake was strongly positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon consumption and increase in nosz gene abundance p 0 001 under various water content the average n2o uptake in silty clay loam soil was 385 20 μg kg 1 which was significantly higher than those for loam and sandy loam soils 351 98 μg kg 1 p 0 05 moreover nosz gene abundance was substantially higher in scl than the other soils future research should endeavor to determine the mechanisms by which nh4 n content ph and organic carbon content affect n2o uptake in different types of paddy soil keywords nitrous oxide uptake nitrous oxide reductase gene paddy soil soil water content soil parent material data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrous oxide is the third major greenhouse gas ghg after carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 stocker 2014 n2o has 298 fold higher warming potential than co2 tian et al 2020 soil is the principal n2o emission source and accounts for 50 60 of the total atmospheric n2o however it was empirically determined that soil is also a sink of n2o soil n2o absorption and consumption were first observed in laboratory experiments in 1976 blackmer and bremner 1976 subsequent field trials on soil n2o uptake and consumption corroborated the hypothesis of blackmer and bremner stating that soil is a potential atmospheric n2o sink verchot et al 1999 prior studies reported net negative n2o flux but few of them explored the potential causes stuchiner and von fischer 2022 tangen and bansal 2022 tian et al 2020 the quantities of n2o that soils uptake and consume may be more important than previously assumed yang and silver 2016 in both natural and artificial ecosystems of temperate and tropical regions the net rate of n2o consumption is in the range of 1 0 207 μg n m 2 h 1 chapuis lardy et al 2007 schlesinger 2013 the international atomic energy agency ieae 1992 estimated that the global soil n2o uptake is in the range of 7 13 tg n2o n y 1 which is similar to the amount of n2o consumed by photolysis in the stratosphere 9 tg n2o n y 1 majumdar 2013 soil n2o uptake was first designated an important potential n2o sink in the 2013 ipcc working report stocker 2014 therefore soil n2o uptake could substantially reduce atmospheric n2o and merits further investigation n2o is uptake and consumed in the soil mainly via nitrous oxide reductase nosz containing denitrifying microorganisms that reduce n2o to n2 this reaction is considered the only effective biotransformation mechanism in this process qin et al 2021 several studies revealed the relationship between soil n2o reduction and the abundance gao et al 2017 hallin et al 2018 qin et al 2021 structure and gene expression kern and simon 2016

dissolve organic carbon doc ph soil parent material soil temperature soil aeration and soil c n ratio liu et al 2022a majumdar 2013 soil water content is significantly positively correlated with soil n2o uptake and consumption soil water content and soil physical properties largely determine soil porosity pore distribution liu et al 2022b soil o2 diffusion and by extension microbial denitrification intensity n2o uptake and n2o consumption soils with very high water content are extremely anoxic under this condition ammonia mono oxygenase amo activity is inhibited n2o reductase activity is promoted n2o is reduced to n2 juhanson et al 2017 liu et al 2022b and n2o emission is negative castro barros et al 2017 siljanen et al 2020 soil n2o uptake tends to increase with soil water content schlesinger 2013 compared n2o uptake rates among different soil types and found that n2o uptake in paddies wetland and other soil ecosystems with high water content was in the range of 100 207 μg n m 2 h 1 however it was also reported that upland soil with lower water content had strong n2o uptake and consumption capacity goldberg and gebauer 2009 found that during the dry season forest soil exhibited significant negative n2o emission hence it was a temporary n2o sink nevertheless increasing the water content turned the forest soil into a transient n2o source wu et al 2013 stated that in corn fields n2o uptake and consumption were highest at low water content 5 20 wfps thus an anaerobic environment with high water content may not necessarily be required for converting n2o to inert n2 the n2o uptake and consumption pathways and rates and the response patterns of n2o reducing microorganisms may vary among agricultural soils differing in water content rice paddy is a vital form of agricultural utilization it covers an area of 1 35 million ha worldwide and 20 of it is in china li et al 2014 qin et al 2021 the n2o emissions from paddy soil in china account for 20 of the global total yue et al 2019 the unique water management pattern of paddy soil causes it to undergo frequently alternating wetting and drying clarifying n2o uptake and consumption and their microbial mechanisms in paddy soil under different water content may provide an important reference for the mitigation of n2o emission in paddy fields in this study three typical paddy soils with different parent materials in subtropical agricultural areas of china were selected as research objects we then designed and performed microcosm experiments using four different water gradients and added exogenous n2o to the soil surfaces the aims of the study were to determine 1 the uptake of headspace n2o by paddy soil under different moisture conditions 2 the response of nosz gene abundance to various moisture contents in paddy soils and 3 the relationships among n2o uptake nosz gene abundance and other physicochemical factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sample collection and pretreatment soils with three contrasting textures were evaluated they are typically distributed in subtropical regions the silty clay loam scl was derived from river alluvial parent material the sandy loam sl originated from lake deposits and the loam l formed from quaternary red loam the paddy fields were double cropping rice planting soils 50 y old traditional water management was implemented for them all during the rice growing period the traditional water management of paddy fields was flooding in the early stage drying in the middle stage and drying and wetting alternately in the late stage the 0 5 cm surface paddy soil was collected on december 2016 by the multipoint sampling method wang et al 2019 mixed air dried passed through a 5 mm sieve and used in a laboratory microcosm experiment basic physicochemical data for the three soil types are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experimental device was a 1 l d 9 5 cm wide mouth bottle fitted with a rubber

mean sem of three replicates 3 results 3 1 n2o uptake and consumption dynamics in paddy soils with various water content temporal variations in the headspace n2o content were essentially equal for all three paddy soils figs 1a c for ck the headspace n2o content was consistently low average 0 86 μg at all water content throughout the incubation period for the n2o added group the headspace n2o content decreased with increasing incubation time at all water content conditions the n2o content in scl sl and l at 70 water content had decreased significantly more than those for the three soil types at the other water content p 0 001 their n2o content at 125 h were 21 56 26 06 and 25 9 of those at 0 h respectively according to table 2 the n2o uptake were significantly affected by n2o treatment soil type and soil water content p 0 001 and the interactions of n2o treatment vs soil type and n2o treatment vs soil water content cause extremely effects on the n2o uptake p 0 001 the total n2o uptake was highest at 70 water and accounted for 73 94 78 44 of the n2o added group the total n2o uptake was lowest at 20 water and accounted for 50 71 57 19 of the n2o added group the rate of decrease in headspace n2o content gradually decreased with time figs 1a 1c decrease in the n2o content slope reached its maximum between 0 h and 3 h and the averages were 1 066 0 903 and 0 779 for scl sl and l respectively fig 1 shows that the n2o uptake rates within 3 h in scl sl and l were 19 26 18 06 and 15 58 μg kg 1 h 1 these values were significantly p 0 05 higher than the average within 125 h fig 1d shows that the total n2o uptake in scl sl and l increased with soil water content there was an exponential regression between n2o uptake and water content r2 0 96 under various water

between the n2o added group and ck at 70 water content fig 2b the no3 n content increased at an average of 4 56 mg kg 1 at 20 35 and 50 water content at 70 water content the no3 n consumption rates were 1 31 and 4 40 mg kg 1 in the n2o added group and ck for sl no3 n increased by 3 54 mg kg 1 at 20 35 and 50 water content in the n2o added group no3 n consumption was in the range of 0 39 0 46 mg kg 1 for all other treatments for l the no3 n content at 20 35 50 and 70 water content decreased in the n2o added group by an average of 0 88 mg kg 1 for ck the no3 n content slightly increased at 20 and 35 water content and decreased to 1 56 mg kg 1 at 50 and 70 water content fig 2c shows that over the 125 h incubation period the nh4 n content of all three paddy soils at various water content increased for both ck and the n2o added group the nh4 n content in both groups initially increased and then decreased with increasing water content the maximum increases in nh4 n content in scl cl and l occurred at 50 water content and 113 26 138 47 and 211 45 mg kg 1 respectively 3 3 nosz gene abundance at 125 h in three soils with different water content fig 3a showed that the abundance of the nosz gene in ck and the n2o added group significantly increased with water content p 0 05 compared with ck the nosz gene abundance in n2o added group had increased by 32 473 31 2 34 03 and 35 74 on average at 20 35 50 and 70 water content respectively there was a significant linear correlation between the increase of nosz gene abundance and the water gradient in scl sl and l throughout the incubation period r2 0 73 fig 3b at 50 and 70 water content the increase in nosz gene abundance was significantly higher in scl than sl or l p 0 05 at 70 water content there were significant

uptake in l soil 4 discussion 4 1 abundant n2o could be absorbed by paddy soil with different water content soil is an important atmospheric n2o emission source however it can also uptake and consume atmospheric n2o wu et al 2013 in 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc working report listed soil n2o uptake as an important potential global n2o stocker 2014 subsequent studies focused on soil n2o uptake and consumption wang et al 2021 n2o uptake is widespread among various soil types and is in the ranging of 0 13 207 μg m2 h 1 majumdar 2013 schlesinger 2013 ye and horwath 2016 nevertheless n2o uptake is relatively low in dryland soils 4 μg m2 h 1 chapuis lardy et al 2007 siljanen et al 2020 measured n2o flux in the boreal forests of finland and found that the average n2o uptake for 25 measurement points was 3 525 μg m2 h 1 shvaleva et al 2015 reported that the maximum net n2o uptake in the 0 20 cm layer of mediterranean oak forest soil was 6 5 μg m2 h 1 the present study showed that the proportion of n2o uptake was 50 71 in three paddy soils with 20 water content and the maximum n2o uptake and consumption rate was in the range of 80 34 114 10 μg m2 h 1 the latter was significantly higher than that for forest soil hence paddy soil with lower water content had high n2o uptake and consumption capacity this phenomenon may be associated with the unique water management patterns characteristic of paddy soils long term flooding intermittent drying and wetting significantly increase the abundance of denitrifying and especially nosz containing microorganisms compared to that of dryland soil banerjee et al 2016 the n2o uptake rates of all three paddy soils increased with water content the maximum n2o uptake rates were 104 30 127 81 and 171 76 μg m2 h 1 at 35 50 and 70 water content respectively the total n2o uptake exponentially increased r2 0 96 with water content throughout the incubation period fig 1d liu et al 2022b analyzed the effects of 20 40 60 80 and 100 whc on n2o production and uptake in a fluventic ustochrept soil and found that its n2o uptake increased with water content and attained a maximum of 4 17 2 74 μg m2 h 1 at 80 whc wu et al 2013 found that under aerobic conditions exogenous n2o uptake and consumption by paddy soils was not significant at 2 10 or 20 gwc but was significant at 40 and 50 gwc the n2o uptake and consumption rate was 48 therefore n2o uptake and consumption generally increase with water content in different soils and environments here we observed the highest n2o uptake at 70 water content in all three paddy soils the scl sl and l uptake and consumed 78 44 73 94 and 74 10 respectively of the n2o in a 125 h incubation period water saturated soils had relatively higher n2o uptake and consumption rates such as the paddy field n2o uptake and consumption rates were in the range of 0 13 191 μg m2 h 1 whereas those of the wetlands and peatlands were in the range of 17 207 μg m2 h 1 majumdar 2013 schlesinger 2013 ye and horwath 2016 as the soil water content increases the pores are filled with water anaerobic microenvironments are created and the n2o is reduced to n2 liu et al 2022a under these conditions soil diffusion coefficients are low and solubility is high low diffusivity prolongs soil n2o retention and facilitates denitrifying bacteria mediated n2o reduction to n2 yano et al 2014 several studies showed that the soil water content regulates soil production and emission dynamics by influencing the activity of denitrifying microorganism and their related enzymes heincke and kaupenjohann 1999 majumdar 2013 doc mineralization and utilization by microorganisms also increase with soil water content liu et al 2022b particularly when the latter is 60 70 wfps and denitrifying microorganisms proliferate bateman and baggs 2005 liu et al 2022b qin et al 2021 the present study showed that 35 gwc is roughly equivalent to 70 wfps de hofman 2002 the abundances of the nosz gene in the three soils at 35 50 and 70 water content were significantly higher than those of the same soils at 20 water content p 0 05 fig 3a qin et al 2021 reported that 75 125 wfps promoted nosz genes to a significantly higher activity than 25 or 50 wfps the relationships among the increases in nosz gene abundance and the water gradients in the scl sl and l soils fit a linear regression equation fig 3b similar positive relationship between the abundance of nitrous oxide reducing bacteria noszi and noszii and soil moisture content was reported by liu et al 2022b with wheat maize rotational cropping soil therefore the close link between nosz gene abundance and soil water content is common in dryland soil or paddy soil which is closely related to the n2o uptake moreover the soil doc content regulates denitrifying microorganism activity wang et al 2022 most microorganisms harboring the nosz gene are complete and chemoheterotrophic denitrifiers thus they require additional carbon containing compounds as electron donors in redox reactions and for their own reproductive metabolism morley and baggs 2010 doc consumption throughout the incubation period was strongly positively correlated with nosz gene abundance and n2o consumption p 0 001 fig 4a other studies showed that readily degradable organic carbon promotes the reduction of n2o to n2 and increases nosz gene abundance and n2 n2o n2 mathieu et al 2006 wang et al 2022 ye and horwath 2016 here doc consumption in all three soils of the n2o added group increased with water content fig 2a these findings were consistent with the dynamics of nosz gene abundance fig 3b the soil water content directly affects available carbon utilization by nosz containing functional microorganisms and regulates total n2o uptake and consumption adequate doc also stimulates respiration in soil microorganisms accelerates oxygen consumption and creates hypoxic or anoxic environments conducive to the complete reduction of n2o to n2 by denitrifying microorganisms sanchez martin et al 2008 the results from these controlled environmental conditions with disturbed soil showed abundant n2o could be absorbed by paddy soil with different water content and the maximum n2o uptake rates were at 70 gwc in order to guide the water management in rice field to promote atmospheric n2o uptake and reduce total n2o emissions more field studies are needed to confirm the strong n2o uptake capacity in paddy soil at different water content 4 2 n2o uptake capacity of different types of paddy soil paddy rice is a major food crop in southern china paddy soils have a wide geographical distribution and originated from various parent materials sheng et al 2015 different parent materials form a wide array of soil textures and influence soil permeability fertility status porosity and water retention mazza et al 2018 wlodarczyk et al 2011 these physicochemical differences create wide variation in denitrifying microorganism species and abundance and therefore n2o uptake among soil types lan et al 2013 liu et al 2022a previous studies showed that the air permeability of soil decreases with increasing soil particle size low air permeability favors anoxia which in turn promotes denitrifying microorganism growth mangalassery et al 2013 all three types of paddy soils absorbed abundant n2o however n2o uptake was significantly higher in the scl than the l and sl soils at various water content p 0 05 the soil n2o uptake order was scl l sl fig 2 the relative increase in nosz gene abundance after 96 h also followed the sequence scl l sl fig 3a hence the nosz gene bearing microorganisms in the scl soil most effectively used n2o for growth and reproduction possibly because the scl soil has the highest clay content table 1 clay provides anaerobic microsites conducive to the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and denitrification thus the denitrifiers consume more n2o in scl than l or sl soil wlodarczyk t et al 2011 conducted a 34 d anaerobic closed incubation experiment and found that the total n2o consumption in eutric cambisols accounted for 32 9 99 2 and 100 of the n2o production in sandy soil loam soil and silty loam respectively lan et al 2013 found that n2o uptake and consumption in soil derived from alluvial parent material was higher in clay loams than silty loams the n2o diffusion time was prolonged in finer textured soils this environment was conducive to n2o reduction by denitrifying bacteria and enhanced n2o uptake and consumption our principal component analysis pca disclosed that clay content affected n2o uptake in scl soils whereas sand content affected n2o uptake in sl soils fig 4b therefore soil texture strongly affects n2o uptake in different paddy soils total nitrogen organic carbon sand content and doc consumption also markedly influenced n2o uptake in sl soil because anaerobic environments only partially form in soil structures with large particles abundant supplies of available and stored carbon for the microorganisms in this soil type substantially limit n2o consumption soils with large particles are well ventilated and have unstable carbon high c n ratios and abundant oxygen compared to those with fine particles hence the former soil texture facilitates the growth and reproduction of aerobic microorganisms liu et al 2022b six et al 2004 hassink et al 1993 concluded that microbial biomass c n ratios were higher in sandy than loamy or clayey soils therefore we speculated that the c n ratio of organic matter was higher in sl soil than in scl or l soils which was more conducive to the aerobic microorganisms in sl soil soil available potassium ak and ph influenced n2o uptake and consumption in l fig 4b the ph affects microbial functions in loamy soil with better air permeability and water permeability by appropriate sand and silt percentage n2o reductase activity decreases at ph 5 but increases as the ph rises saleh lakha et al 2009 hence higher ph promotes n2o reduction to n2 and favors negative n2o emission liu et al 2022a saleh lakha et al 2009 there is a close association between soil ak content and the abundance of typical n2o reducing microorganisms juhanson et al 2017 and wang et al 2022 reported that the abundance of the nosz gene population was significantly positively correlated with ak numerous physicochemical factors influence n2o absorption and consumption in the soil moreover the effect of a single factor may vary among different soil types based on our incubation results further studies should focus on the measurement of n2o uptake in rice field and try to figure out the main factors affecting the n2o uptake in various paddy soils 5 conclusion paddy soils originating from three different parent materials scl sl and l uptake abundant n2o from the soil surface at different water content the n2o uptake rates at 20 gravimetric water content were 57 19 51 65 and 50 71 in the scl sl and l soils respectively these values were significantly higher than those for other types of uplands total n2o uptake throughout the incubation period exponentially increased with water content r2 0 95 total n2o uptake reached its highest values at 70 gravimetric water content namely 470 63 443 63and 444 59 μg kg 1 in the scl sl and l soils respectively possibly because paddy soils have high doc low no3 n and abundant nosz containing microorganisms the three soils derived from different parent materials markedly varied in texture n2o uptake was significantly higher for scl soil mean 385 20 μg kg 1 than sl soil mean 351 52 μg kg 1 and l soil mean 352 43 μg kg 1 soil soils composed primarily of small particles form anaerobic microdomains conducive to nosz containing microorganism proliferation and activity the average increase in nosz gene in scl soil was 8 98 107 copies g 1 and was 1 27 107 and 2 26 107 copies g 1 higher than those in sl and l soil respectively hence the elevated nosz gene abundance in scl soil favored n2o uptake and consumption there moreover ph and nh4 n and organic carbon content dramatically influence n2o uptake in various soil types future research should endeavor to elucidate the mechanisms by which these factors differentially affect the uptake of n2o in various paddy soils funding sources this research was funded by the national

9083,accurate quantification of land surface evapotranspiration et is desperately crucial for agricultural irrigation strategy drought monitoring and water resource management in semiarid and arid regions the two source energy balance tseb model is an appropriate method for estimating et over the mixed surface of vegetation and soil since it considers both energy contributions from soil and vegetation the key parameters of the tseb model additional heat transfer resistance kb 1 and soil resistance are vital to the estimation of water vapor and heat fluxes over the heterogeneous surface in this study the kb 1 parameterization and soil resistance formulation with different coefficients were integrated into the tseb model to improve the original model performance over the heterogeneous surface in the midstream area of the heihe river basin hrb the effect of kb 1 on the tseb model performance was greater than the soil resistance coefficient by validating the model output using the eddy covariance ec measurement installed at vegetables maize residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe surface the optimized tseb model would significantly reduce the uncertainty of the original model and improve the consistency between the simulated and observed sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le over the heterogeneous surfaces rmse values of h and le decreased to 53 and 78 w m 2 from 67 and 104 w m 2 for seven sites average in 2012 the daily et of this study area ranged from 0 69 to 6 48 mm day 1 during the growing period it agreed well with ec flux observations for the vegetated area especially irrigated cropland with mbe rmse and mape values of 0 21 mm d 1 1 02 mm d 1 and 14 62 at maize site 0 39 mm d 1 1 14 mm d 1 and 20 25 at vegetables site this research enhances the utility of tseb in flux estimation over heterogeneous landscapes and thus is of great help in formulating sustainable water resource management schemes keywords evapotranspiration two source energy balance additional heat transfer resistance soil resistance heihe river basin heterogeneous surface data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important process of water energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere it does not only affect the growth and production of plants but also affect the water cycles and plays a role in regulating the climate wang and dickinson 2012 quantitatively estimating et is essential for understanding energy balance issues and comprehending hydrological processes the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest endorheic river basin in the arid area of northwest china the midstream area of hbr are the settlements of human beings and the well known food production base in china where water consumption is mainly from agricultural irrigation and residential drinking water in recent years the allocation of water resources in the hrb has been optimized but the midstream of hrb is still suffering from the imbalance between irrigation and ecological water consumption cheng et al 2014 li et al 2018 quantitative et value can be used as an indicator for monitoring crop drought assessing water use efficiency in farmland and providing decision making for irrigation and water resources conservation ground observations and model based estimation are the main ways to obtain et conventional ground observation methods include the weighing lysimeter bowen ratio approach eddy covariance system and scintillometer baldocchi et al 2001 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a ward 2017 it is difficult for ground observation technology to meet the needs of watershed and global scale applications due to spatial heterogeneity thus various model based methods have been proposed for estimating et which can be classified into two categories according to the driving force of the model 1 data driven method for example empirical methods wang and dickinson 2012 and machine learning methods jung et al 2010 2019 bai et al 2021 xu et al 2018 kumar et al 2002 2 physical method based on process driven such as surface energy balance models seb su 2002 kustas and norman 1999 bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 1995 shuttleworth 1989 penman monteith or priestley taylor formula yao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 2016b fisher et al 2008 monteith 1965 penman 1948 feature space method tang and li 2017 long and singh 2012 currently seb method is widely used in different countries and climatic regions song et al 2016a 2016b qiu et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 hu and jia 2015 vinukollu et al 2011 this study concentrates on the seb model in which latent heat flux le equals the difference of available energy i e net radiation rn minus soil heat flux g0 and sensible heat flux h kustas and anderson 2009 the seb model can be classified into single source and dual source models the single source model treats the land surface as a single system but two source model distinguishes energy fluxes from soil and vegetation elements when estimating h and le kustas and norman 1999 the single source model can obtain satisfactory results especially in places with dense vegetation coverage huang et al 2015 elhag et al 2011 the dual model for instance two source energy balance model tseb is more practical in the vegetation soil mixed surface because it estimates soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration respectively katimbo et al 2022 song et al 2016a 2016b 2020 2022 colaizzi et al 2012a 2012b 2017 kustas et al 2012 kustas and anderson 2009 however the core of the tseb model is to calculate le as the residual of the energy balance equation i e rn g0 h le thus the calculation accuracy of rn h and g0 affects the result of the model morillas et al 2013 showed that the tseb model notably underestimated h for grassland in the semi arid mediterranean and lead to an overestimation of le therefore the accuracy of h estimates is critical to the results of le in the tseb model the application of the bulk transfer equation for the estimation of h gave an unsatisfactory result in seb modeling kustas et al 1989 this is due to the inability of the existing data to correctly evaluate the aerodynamic roughness length of heat transfer z0 h z0 h is generally calculated by the empirical relationship between aerodynamic roughness length for momentum transport z0 m and the additional resistance to heat transfer kb 1 which is z0 h z0 m exp kb 1 however kb 1 cannot generally be obtained directly and require multiple elements to calculate so it is affected by some input variables kb 1 was set to 0 in the original tseb model norman 1995 kustas and norman 1999 namely z0 h z0 m and it is generally considered that z0 h 0 1 z0 m i e kb 1 2 3 for the homogeneous surface while z0 h 0 1 z0 m i e kb 1 2 3 for the heterogeneous surface verma 1989 this assumption may affect the result of aerodynamic resistance which in turn affects the estimation accuracy of h to some extent the researchers pointed out that kb 1 of the same sparse crop surface is different in different years so it is neither accurate nor practical to set a constant for heterogeneous surfaces troufleou et al 1997 yang et al 2007 additionally the kb 1 value can reflect the thermodynamic and momentumic characteristics of the surface in recent decades substantial efforts have been made to develop schemes for the calculation of kb 1 sheppard p a 1958 owen and thomson 1963 brutsaert 1982 kustas et al 1989 su 2002 yang et al 2003 2007 some of these models have a simple relationship between the rough reynolds number re or the friction speed u and the experimental results and these parameterized schemes have a certain theoretical basis owen and thomson 1963 the scheme proposed by su 2002 combined the localized near field lnf theoretical model massman w j 1999 with the vegetation canopy model choudhury and monteith 1988 and the bare soil model brutsaert 1982 kustas et al 1989 proposed the parameterization scheme of kb 1 considering the momentum transmission and the heat transmission when the wind speed increased yang 2003 2007 considered both the efficiency of momentum transmission and the driving factors of heat transmission however the parameterization schemes of kb 1 have not been effectively exploited to improve the performance of seb models in previous studies soil resistance r s another key of the tseb model is critical to h the parametric scheme of r s originally proposed by sauer et al 1995 has undergone a series of refinements norman et al 1995 kondo and ishida 1997 kustas and norman 1999 kool et al 2014 the formula of r s used in the tseb model was revised by kustas and norman 1999 this formula performed well on moderately rough surfaces xia et al 2016 but not on sparsely vegetated surfaces kustas et al 2016 sensitivity analysis demonstrated the high sensitivity of the tseb model to soil resistance coefficients over sparsely vegetated semi arid and arid landscapes li et al 2019 sauer et al 1995 and kondo and ishida 1997 summarized that soil resistance coefficients were different for various surface roughness by observing heat flux temperature and moisture gradients from soil surface to canopy air space however such detailed measurement information on soil roughness and vegetation distribution and architecture is not routinely available so that refining the soil resistance coefficients may be difficult to implement operationally recent researches simply use some existing empirical coefficients based on the type of surface roughness burchard levine et al 2021 li et al 2019 xia et al 2016 this research aims to improve the performance of the tseb model and enhance its utility in surface heat and water vapor fluxes estimation over the heterogeneous surface in the semi arid and arid region by integrating the kb 1 parameterization scheme and different soil resistance coefficients into the original model the main goals were 1 the kb 1 value for the heterogeneous surface covered by maize vegetables residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe in the middle reaches of hrb were calculated by the kb 1 parameterization scheme 2 to assess the performance of the original and modified tseb model using ec observation installed at different land cover types 3 to evaluate the applicability of the improved tseb model using multiple years of experimental data 4 the daily et over the heterogeneous surface in the middle reaches of hrb was estimated by le from the improved tseb model 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the middle reaches of heihe river basin hrb were selected to evaluate the performance of the tseb model the study area is a typical irrigated crop ecosystem covered by maize vegetables and orchard and surrounded by residential wetland gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe fig 1 the maize is the dominant crop type in the study area which is often sown in late april and it is planted in rows with eight plants per square meter the prevailing wind direction was north and northwest in this study area xu et al 2013 the annual precipitation is about 100 250 mm li et al 2018 but the annual potential evaporation is as high as 1200 1800 mm li et al 2013 therefore irrigation is the main source of water for crops during the whole growing season from may to september there are four rounds of irrigation i e early june early july late july and late august a comprehensive eco hydrological experiment heihe water allied telemetry experimental research hiwater was carried out in the middle reaches of the hrb in 2012 liu et al 2016 li et al 2013 a total of 21 sites representing the dominant land cover use types i e maize vegetable residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert desert steppe and wetland were installed in the middle reaches of hrb during hiwater experiment seven sites have been selected in this study to evaluate the performance of the model details of sites were shown in fig 1 automatic weather station aws eddy covariance system ec soil moisture and temperature measurement system smtms and soil heat flux plate were set up at each site vegetable residential and orchard sites were dismantled after 2012 gobi desert and sandy desert sites were remained from 2012 to 2014 while maize and desert steppe sites are operating from 2012 until now in this study the observations for seven sites in 2012 were used to optimize the original model and the observations for maize gobi desert sandy desert in 2013 and 2014 desert steppe in 2014 and 2015 were applied to evaluate the applicability of the improved model 2 2 data collection processing and quality control 2 2 1 meteorological data the

flux were evaluated using the surface energy balance components ebr h le rn g0 foken et al 2010 in which h and le are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively rn is the net radiation g0 is the soil surface heat flux the soil surface heat flux g0 was calculated using the one dimensional equation of soil thermal diffusion combined with the soil moisture and soil temperature at depths of 2 cm and 4 cm xu et al 2017a yang and wang 2008 the ebr values for seven sites are 1 01 vegetables 0 89 maize 0 84 residential 0 78 orchard 0 90 gobi desert 0 81 sandy desert and 1 01 desert steppe respectively the heat storage in canopies land heterogeneous surface and the advection or secondary circulation had a significant effect on the ebr allen et al 2011a xu et al 2017a in this study to evaluate the performance of the tseb model half hourly turbulent fluxes from ec were implemented to achieve energy balance closure by the residual approach falge et al 2005 the turbulent fluxes obtained from the ec measurements reflect the influence of the underlying surface on the turbulent exchange schmid 2002 it is necessary to determine the source area of the ec using the footprint model before analyzing the characteristics of the captured fluxes in this study the eulerian analytic flux footprint model kormann and meixner 2001 was used to obtain the flux footprint of a single point vertical flux measurement the flux contribution of the chosen total source area was set at 90 the footprint estimates of ecs from 90 flux contribution were generally representative of the dominated surface types xu et al 2017b 2 2 3 vegetation biophysical variables land surface characteristic parameters required by the tseb model were manually measured such as leaf area index lai was measured by lai2200 plant canopy analyzer fraction of vegetation coverage fvc was obtained by calculating the proportion of vegetation with the sample matrix li et al 2013 and canopy height h c near the observation sites was observed regularly h c at vegetable maize desert steppe gobi desert and sandy desert surface were measured using the steel tape and h c at orchard surface was measured by the box staff 3 methodology 3 1 description of the tseb model the tseb model was established originally by norman et al 1995 for estimating the surface energy fluxes from vegetation and soil by partitioning the composite surface radiometric temperature trad into soil and canopy temperatures ts and tc the corresponding expression is as follows 1 t r a d θ f c θ t c 4 1 f c θ t s 4 1 4 where f c θ is the fraction of vegetation coverage observed at the view zenith angle θ s and c are soil and vegetation scene components respectively ts and tc are soil and vegetation canopy temperature k respectively the associated h and le from soil and canopy elements in the tseb model can be calculated using the available energy combined with soil and vegetation temperature as follows 2 r n c h c l e c 3 r n s h s l e s g 0 4 r n s τ l o n g w a v e l 1 τ l o n g w a v e ε c σ t c 4 ε s σ t s 4 τ s o l a r 1 α s s 5 r n c 1 τ l o n g w a v e l ε s σ t s 4 2 ε c σ t c 4 1 τ s o l a r 1 α c s where r n represents net radiation h and le are sensible and latent heat flux and g0 is surface soil heat flux all in w m 2 ε and α are the emissivity and albedo respectively s and l are the incoming shortwave and longwave radiation from the sky w m 2 τ l o n g w a v e and τ s o l a r are the longwave and shortwave radiation transmittances through the canopy respectively the g0 can be expressed as a function of r ns 6 g 0 γ r n s where г is an empirical coefficient equal to 0 35 choudhury et al 1987 the series version of the tseb model kustas and norman et al 1999 applied in this study has more applicable parameters due to the energy exchange between the soil and vegetation by allowing for interactions h hs and hc can be specifically defined as 7 h h s h c ρ c p t a c t c r a with 8 h s ρ c p t s t a c r s 9 h c ρ c p t c t a c r x where ρ is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of air j kg 1 k 1 tac is the temperature in the canopy air space k r a is the bulk aerodynamic resistance s m 1 the term r x is the boundary layer resistance associated with canopy s m 1 r s is the resistance to heat flow in the boundary layer directly above the soil surface s m 1 the r a is computed from the aerodynamic resistance r a h s m 1 while r a h can be affected by several factors such as the height and distribution of rough surface elements i e vegetation height and structure etc wind direction and atmospheric stability and so on kustas and norman 1999 the r a h formula norman et al 1995 has undergone several refinements kustas and norman 1999 brutsaert 1999 li et al 2005 and was formally proposed the corresponding calculation expression as follows 10 r a h ln z u d 0 z 0 m ψ m z u d 0 l ln z t d 0 z 0 h ψ h z t d 0 l k 2 u where d 0 is zero plane displacement k is the von karman constant 0 41 zu and zt are the observed heights of u and ta l is the length of monin obukhov ψ m and ψ h are the diabatic correction factors for momentum and heat z0 m and z0 h represent aerodynamic roughness length for momentum and heat transport in which z0 m can be calculated by canopy height brutsaert 1982 z0 h can be calculated by the empirical formula proposed by brutsaert 1982 as follows 11 k b 1 ln z 0 m z 0 h the r s is generally determined on the basis of certain empirical analysis sauer et al 1995 made an in depth statistical analysis based on measured data in the corn field and set up an estimation formula after some simplification after that kustas and norman 1999 appropriately improved and optimized this model to better meet the relevant application requirements the corresponding expression is 12 r s 1 c t s t c 1 3 b u s where u s is wind speed near soil surface m s 1 b and c m s 1 k 1 3 are soil resistance coefficients respectively kondo and ishida 1997 indicated that c ranges from 0 0011 for a smooth surface to 0 0038 for a rough surface based on both laboratory and field experiments coefficient b ranges from 0 025 to 0 087 during a whole growing season sauer et al 1995 for moderately rough soil surfaces default values for b and c are 0 012 and 0 0025 respectively in the tseb model kustas and norman 1999 for rough soil surfaces with sparse vegetation however the value of b and c are up to 0 087 and 0 0038 kondo and ishida 1997 sauer et al 1995 besides kustas et al 2016 concluded that soil resistance coefficients b 0 012 and c 0 025 in the tseb model caused a large deviation in estimates of h in semi arid areas with sparse vegetation while coefficients b 0 065 and c 0 0038 have been proved to make model yield good agreement with measured h this result is due to the fact that an accurate estimate of hs is critical since it is the main contributor to h in sparsely vegetated semi arid and arid landscapes jacobs et al 1996 the r x can be determined as 13 r x c l a i s u d 0 z 0 m 1 2 where c is the adjustment parameter of the model and can be set to 90 s0 5 m 1 lai is the leaf area index s represents the size of the plant leaf and is calculated using the area of the leaf divided by the circumference of the leaf u d 0 z 0 m is the wind speed at the height of d 0 z0 m the most important issue for the tseb model is to determine the temperature related to canopy and soil temperature kustas et al 2007 to estimate the component surface fluxes from the soil and vegetation priestly taylor formula priestley taylor 1972 and parallel resistance formulations are combined and the initial vegetation temperature is computed as norman et al 1995 14 t c i t a r n c r a h ρ c p 1 α p t f g δ δ γ where tci is the initial estimate of tc ta is the air temperature at the reference height r ah is the aerodynamic resistance to turbulent heat transport between the canopy source height α p t is the priestley taylor coefficient for the canopy 1 26 γ represents the psychrometric constant 0 06 f g is the fraction of green vegetation is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relation kpa k 1 then ts can be calculated by the formula 1 thus les and lec are computed as a residual of eqs 2 and 3 and h and le can be determined by eqs 15 and 16 15 h h c h s 16 l e l e c l e s 3 2 the parameterization scheme of kb 1 the kb 1 parameterization proposed by kustas et al 1989 has a close relationship with micrometeorological and surface feature parameters kb 1 can be expressed as a function of u lst and ta the corresponding formula is as follows 17 k b 1 a u l s t t a where u is wind speed m s 1 lst is land surface temperature k ta is air temperature k and a is the constant 0 17 3 3 the improved tseb model this study integrates the kb 1 parameterization scheme into the tseb model in an attempt to optimize the performance of the original model in a semi arid and arid region simultaneously the performance of the tseb model with soil resistance formulation using typical coefficients b 0 012 c 0 0025 kustas and norman 1999 and modified coefficients for semiarid clumped vegetation b 0 065 c 0 0038 kustas et al 2016 was assessed four combination scenarios of kb 1 b and c in the tseb model were implemented in this study including 1 tseb 1 the original tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 012 c 0 0025 and kb 1 0 2 tseb new1 the tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 012 c 0 0025 coupled with the kb 1 value of the parameterization scheme 3 tseb 2 the tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 065 c 0 0038 and kb 1 0 4 tseb new2 the tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 065 c 0 0038 coupled with the kb 1 value of the parameterization scheme tseb 1 is the original model which is used as the benchmark for the comparison of the other three improved models 3 4 the evaluation metrics the root mean squared error rmse mean bias error mbe and mean absolute percentage error mape were used as error metrics to evaluate kb 1 h le and le estimates these statistics are defined as follows 18 r m s e i 1 n y e y m 2 n 19 m b e i 1 n y e y m n 20 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y e y m y m where ye is the estimated kb 1 h le and et respectively ym is the measured kb 1 h le and et respectively n is the number of samples for the above variables rmse provides information on the deviation by allowing a term by term comparison of the actual difference between the predicted and the observed value mbe reflects the magnitude of deviation of the predicted from the measured value the positive value gives the average amount of overestimation in the predicted values and vice versa mape is a relative error standard avoiding the mutual cancellation of positive and negative errors the smaller the rmse and mape values the better the estimated the closer the mbe value is to 0 the better the estimated 4 results 4 1 the kb 1 for heterogeneous surface the results of the kb 1 parameterization from 8 00 18 00 the local time over the heterogeneous surface during the whole growing season from june and september in 2012 were shown in table 3 the kb 1 varied remarkably with land cover types the value of kb 1 for cropland was from 0 02 to 3 21 on maize surface and 1 30 3 02 on vegetables surface respectively the orchards surface exhibited relatively low kb 1 with values generally ranging from 0 64 1 21 the kb 1 value for residential areas varied from 0 49 3 45 instead kb 1 generally had higher values between 0 85 and 4 57 on the surface where the canopy was characterized by uneven and sparse roughness elements such as gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe it indicated that the z0 m on the sparsely vegetated surfaces was significantly greater than the z0 h the rough elements of the vegetation soil mixed surface were scattered blocky or discontinuously distributed and drag on the wind was greater for these rough elements the rough elements can cause z0 m to become stronger but has little effect on z0 h in general z0 h was mainly related to the thermal diffusion of molecules therefore the value of kb 1 was relatively large on the sparsely vegetated surface the kb 1 had a negative value under certain circumstances particularly in the morning and nightfall the main reason is that the aerodynamic resistance was large in the morning and nightfall and the heat transfer exceeded the momentum transmission the daily variation of kb 1 over different underlying surfaces in the early growing season june flourishing period july and subsequent senescent stage september were shown in fig 2 the kb 1 values increased slowly at 9 00 in the morning reached the maximum between 13 00 15 00 and then declined gradually after 15 30 this finding was consistent with the results of previous studies troufleou et al 1997 osamu et al 2002 yang et al 2007 land surfaces covered by sparse vegetation exhibited a large diurnal variation in kb 1 due to the large temperature difference between the lst and ta as well as the influence of wind drag it further showed that kb 1 was greatly affected by the condition of the underlying surface for example the kb 1 value on the maize surface had a large daily variation in the early growing season as fig 2 a because vegetation soil mixed surface when the soil surface was fully covered by maize crops the kb 1 value gradually became stable fig 2 b and c the results showed that surface parameters such as roughness temperature and heat transport were various since surface was covered by different land cover types therefore the value of kb 1 should be considered when obtaining regional scale et particularly for heterogeneous surfaces by using the tseb model 4 2 comparison of kb 1 between parameterization and observation the kb 1 obtained based on aerodynamic resistance r a h brutsaert 1999 1982 was regarded as the observation to verify the kb 1 parameterization comparisons of parameterized value versus observation of kb 1 were shown in fig 3 a better consistency between parameterized and measured kb 1 was found with rmse 1 15 under various surface types the parameterized kb 1 for vegetables residential maize and orchard surfaces in the irrigation region was greater than observations while it was the opposite for gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe surface outside the irrigation region in general the deviation of parameterized kb 1 for orchard vegetables surface was the smallest largest with the mbe value of 0 06 0 79 the deviations for kb 1 parameterization were attributed to the uncertainties in lst ta and u a more detailed analysis was made in the following discussion section 4 3 evaluation of modeled h and le from the original and improved tseb model comparisons of the model estimated h versus ec flux measurements over seven different underlying surfaces were presented in fig 4 comparatively h estimated by the tseb model with different parameters exhibited various results the tseb 1 underestimated h as shown in fig 4 a1 e1 f1 and g1 for surface types of vegetables gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe while it overestimated h for surface types of maize residential and orchard as shown in fig 4 b1 c1 and d1 the h estimates for vegetables residential and desert steppe surfaces agreed well with fluxes observations in fig 4 a3 c3 and g3 but the larger bias of h estimates produced for orchard gobi desert and sandy desert surface in fig 4 d3 e3 and f3 using tseb 2 model to a certain extent the larger values of soil resistance coefficients b 0 065 c 0 0038 lead to overestimation of h this shows that simply modified the soil resistance coefficient cannot effectively improve the estimation accuracy of the tseb model the results for the h and le estimation based on the tseb model with the kb 1 parameterization scheme tseb new1 and tseb new2 are shown in fig 4 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 f2 g2 a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 f4 and g4 it indicated that h estimated by tseb with the kb 1 parameterization scheme was close to the flux observations which significantly improved the problem of underestimation or overestimation of h compared to tseb 1 h estimated by the tseb new1 was most close to the ground observations for residential maize and orchard and the mape values decreased by about 84 7 21 respectively except for maize and residential tseb new1 underestimated h mbe 20 w m 2 for vegetables mbe 13 w m 2 for orchard mbe 54 w m 2 for gobi desert mbe 27 w m 2 for sandy desert and mbe 67 w m 2 for desert steppe h modeled by tseb new1 produced a larger bias over the surfaces covered by vegetables and desert steppe the value of rmse was 43 w m 2 and 86 w m 2 respectively while estimates of h from the tseb new2 produced a small deviation rmse mbe and mape are 53 w m 2 11 w m 2 and 60 generally tseb new1 performed relatively better than tseb new2 for residential maize and orchard surface while tseb new2 performed better than tseb new1 for vegetable gobi desert and desert steppe surfaces the scatterplot between le output from tseb 1 tseb 2 tseb new1 and tseb new2 versus ec observations were shown in fig 5 le estimates from tseb new1 and tseb new2 had a good consistency with the ec flux observations and a similar agreement was found for the modeled h the estimates of le over the densely vegetated surfaces agreed well with the ec flux observations tseb 1 tseb 2 tseb new1 and tseb new2 produced mape of 26 29 26 12 28 26 49 32 and 26 31 for le over maize orchard surface besides the bias of le estimates in the vegetation soil mixed surface was larger the mape value of le modeled by four versions of tseb models was greater than 70 for gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe and greater than 48 for residential tseb 1 tseb 2 tseb new1 and tseb new2 overestimated le except for residential surface the results suggested that compared to the other three models the tseb new2 obtain finer estimates of le over the heterogeneous surfaces with the rmse mbe and mape values of 78 w m 2 11 w m 2 and 49 respectively the deviation of modeled and observed turbulent flux was to some extent due to the uncertainties of observation and model inputs song et al 2018 kustas et al 2012 mainly in the influence of advection or secondary circulation on ec flux observation in irrigated cropland the observational bias of model input lai lst and h c affected the modeled output a more detailed analysis was shown in section 5 3 in general the influence of kb 1 on the tseb model performance was greater than the soil resistance coefficient as evidenced by the results of the four models tseb 1 tseb new1 tseb 2 and tseb new2 compared to the original model i e tseb 1 tseb 2 was revised by changing the soil resistance coefficient i e b and c and remaining the value of kb 1 unchanged but there is no significant improvement in the performance of tseb 2 table 4 compared to tseb 1 tseb new1 was altered by changing the value of kb 1 and remaining the soil resistance coefficient unchanged but the tseb new1 outperformed the tseb 1 similarly compared to tseb 2 tseb new2 was revised by changing the value of kb 1 and remaining the soil resistance coefficient unchanged the tseb new2 outperformed tseb 2 therefore modifying the soil resistance coefficient of the original model was not effective in improving the performance of the model while integrating the kb 1 parameterization into the tseb can reduce the uncertainty of the original model 4 4 evaluating the applicability of the improved tseb model the tseb new2 model was utilized to estimate turbulent fluxes at maize gobi desert sandy desert surface in 2013 and 2014 respectively and desert steppe surface in 2014 and 2015 respectively further to verify the applicability of the improved tseb model the scatterplots of h and le estimates and ec observations were shown in fig 6 and fig 7 h estimates agreed with observation for four sites particularly for these sites covered by spare vegetation such as gobi desert mape values were 23 and 30 in 2013 and 2014 respectively sandy desert mape values were 24 and 26 in 2013 and 2014 respectively and desert steppe mape values were 32 and 22 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the result indicated that modeled le was slightly close to the 1 1 line with ec observations the magnitude of the bias for each site in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 was similar to that of 2012 the modeled le may be influenced by other factors as shown in the discussion section 4 5 daily et over the whole growing season the half hourly et value can be calculated by half hourly le from the improved tseb model combined with formula i e λ e t l e in which λ mj m 3 is the latent heat of vaporization λ 2 501 0 02361 t 0 10 3 where t0 is the average air temperature in half hourly then the daily et was calculated by summing the half hourly et to 24 h totals the temporal variations of the observed and estimated daily et over different land surface types during the whole growing season were similar fig 8 et was closely related to the status of vegetation coverage the daily average et values over the whole growing season for maize vegetables residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe were 5 12 mm 5 62 mm 2 14 mm 6 48 mm 1 03 mm 0 69 mm and 2 07 mm respectively in comparison the daily et for sandy desert with non vegetated coverage was small the et estimates agreed with ec flux observations particularly for cropland mbe 0 21 mm d 1 for maize mbe 0 39 mm d 1 for vegetables respectively the estimated et had a larger deviation in the sparse vegetated or non vegetated surface mape 42 73 for residential mape 48 87 for gobi desert mape 49 11 for sandy desert and mape 41 35 for desert steppe respectively table 5 the modeled et showed a much stronger response to the precipitation producing a significantly low et on days when rain events occurred and et increased rapidly after the rainfall the et in each site over cropland increased after irrigation but the value of et among each site in irrigated region also differed considerably during the irrigation periods 5 discussion 5 1 the relationship between kb 1 and its influencing variables kustas et al 1989 found that the magnitude of kb 1 was related to wind speed u and the difference between lst and ta i e lst ta and concluded that kb 1 had a linear relationship with u lst t a the linear relationship between kb 1 and u and lst ta for vegetated surface e g maize and vegetated soil mixed surface e g desert steppe from june to september in 2012 was found in this study as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 compared to maize surface the kb 1 for desert steppe surface had a stronger correlation with u and lst ta this finding proved that the kb 1 value was influenced by significantly land cover type rigden et al 2018 it can be seen from fig 9 and fig 10 that the correlation between kb 1 and lst ta was stronger than that of u this means that kb 1 was more affected by the thermal gradient than the momentum transfer on the other hand friction wind speed rigden et al 2018 phenology young et al 2021 and environmental variables brutsaert 1982 were other factors that affected kb 1 in the semi arid and arid regions furthermore the kb 1 observation based on aerodynamic resistance includes many parameters such as atmospheric data e g air pressure wind speed and temperature and surface characteristic parameters e g land surface temperature leaf area index and canopy height thus the uncertainty in flux and meteorological measurements affects the accuracy of the kb 1 verification data calculated from ec and aws 5 2 comparison with similar studies at present the tseb model has been utilized extensively to estimate h and le in the middle reaches of hrb yang et al 2015 xu et al 2016 song et al 2016a 2016b 2018 2020 2022 yao et al 2017 2021 li et al 2019 2020 feng et al 2020 cui et al 2021 short term mid term and long term et estimates have been conducted spatial scale for fluxes based on tseb model from point to field and landscape scale the tentative improvement of the tseb model has been considered including the refinement of soil resistance formulations li et al 2019 and priestley taylor coefficient song b et al 2016 in these studies the rmse value of h was about 32 70 w m 2 and the rmse value of le was about 53 132 w m 2 the tseb model combined with the kb 1 parameterization was first applied in this study to estimate h and le thus to et the results also showed that h and le agreed well with the flux observations from ec systems installed at all representative land cover types particularly for the le its estimates produced rmse of 78 w m 2 for the heterogeneous surfaces 5 3 uncertainty introduced by flux observation and model inputs the uncertainty in ec fluxes affected the mismatch between model output and observations which was mainly reflected in energy imbalance of observation the energy balance closure ratios ebr for ec flux ranged from 0 78 to 1 01 in this study area strong advection usually occurred during the afternoon when le was greater than available energy i e rn g0 in the experimental area fig 11 which broke the closed system of the energy balance xu et al 2017a from fig 11 a and d the ebr increases when advection occurs besides the ebr was maintained at the maximum value and it did not change with increasing averaging period under the advection conditions de bruin et al 2005 xu et al 2017a therefore the effect of advection on ebr cannot be ignored in this oasis desert area particularly in the irrigated cropland from fig 11 b c e and f the deviation between modeled and observed turbulent fluxes became larger when advection occurs particularly for h additionally the heat storage in canopies and land heterogeneous surfaces had a significant effect on the ebr thus it is difficult to quantify the effect of advection on energy flux for ec observation and modeled if possible these questions will be addressed in future studies additionally the ec flux observations corrected by the residual approach were applied to verify the results of the tseb model in this study energy balance closure correction methods have a certain effect on the statistical results song et al 2016b foken 2008 the accuracy for h estimated by tseb new1 was the best while the accuracy of le estimates from tseb new2 improved in this study the reason is that the le was affected by model inputs because it has been calculated as the residual of the surface energy balance equation its estimation accuracy was significantly affected by the following factors 1 the errors of the components e g rn h g0 in the surface energy balance equation would be propagated to the le and the uncertainty of error lead to the calculation deviation of the le 2 the result of lst decomposition based on the tseb models may be undesirable as in discussed by song et al 2016a they concluded that the results of decomposed soil and vegetation component temperatures lst outperform composite lst when the tseb model based on temperature was used to calculate the turbulent flux however due to the limitation of observation for component temperatures this study did not deeply analyze this reason 3 the leaf area index lai was the most critical surface characteristic parameter of the tseb model song et al 2020 kustas et al 2012 the observational bias of lai had certain implications on et over the heterogenous surface 4 g0 was an important component of the surface energy balance equation which accounts for 20 40 of net radiation in arid and semi arid areas covered by sparse vegetation idso et al 1975 the le estimates for gobi sandy desert and desert steppe surface were affected by the results of g0 5 4 advantages disadvantages and prospects the tseb model combined with the kb 1 parameterization provides the basis for regional scale surface fluxes and evapotranspiration using atmospheric numerical modeling and remote sensing based model the kb 1 reflects the thermal condition of the surface the results section 4 1 indicated the kb 1 values were different for different land cover types besides the kb 1 as a key parameter of tseb was critical to the calculation of water vapor and heat fluxes over the heterogeneous surface the tseb model coupled with the kb 1 parameterization was successfully applied in this study to estimate h and le thus to et in summary this study significantly improves the performance of the original model section 4 3 nevertheless the coefficient a 0 17 of the parameterization scheme of kb 1 may be not constant it needs to be calibrated to local meteorological conditions and surface parameters this work will be continued in the next study the improved model was evaluated using observations in the growing season the performance of the model in the non growing season has to be further investigated in the future the performance of improved tseb indicates that there is still some room for improvement in the original model including the model structure field observation and validation strategy cui et al 2021 the performance of the improved tseb model was evaluated and analyzed only for heterogeneous surfaces in the semi arid arid area its performance in other surfaces of different climatic regions e g humid and semi humid areas will be conducted in the future additionally deep learning as an emerging technology will be incorporated into the tseb to optimize model structure and improve model performance reichstein et al 2019 proposed that the fusion of a physical processed based model and deep learning was the most potential method in the earth science field hybrid models i e the fusion of the tseb model and deep learning not only has advantages in dealing with huge amounts of data but also in reducing the uncertainty of physical process models at present only a few studies have attempted to build a new hybrid model cui et al 2021 a large amount of work needs to be conducted on the development of the hybrid model to predict et in the future for instance 1 the physical equation of the tseb model has been packaged into loss function of deep learning to enhance the interpretability of deep learning 2 deep learning is used to optimize the key parameters e g surface roughness and soil resistance and variables e g lst and ta of the tseb model 3 the errors in model structure are corrected by deep learning 6 conclusion in this study the value of kb 1 for heterogeneous surfaces has been calculated using a parameterization scheme of kb 1 and further it was incorporated into the tseb model to improve the model performance in the semi arid and arid regions simultaneously different coefficients of soil resistance formulation in the tseb model also have been evaluated h and le estimates for heterogeneous surfaces modeled by the original and improved tseb were validated by ec flux observations the daily et was calculated by le from the improved tseb new2 model summarily the parameterized kb 1 estimates agreed with observations with mbe values was between 0 49 and 0 79 for seven sites the kb 1 was closely related to the type of surface cover the kb 1 value over the land covered by vegetated surface i e maize vegetables and orchard ranged from 1 30 3 21 while that of the sparse vegetation surface desert steppe sandy desert and gobi desert was varied from 0 85 4 57 also the kb 1 had obvious diurnal variation characteristics for different land cover types the improved tseb new1 and tseb new2 outperformed the tseb 1 and tseb 2 this result concluded that the effect of kb 1 on the results of the tseb model was greater than the soil resistance coefficient the tseb model coupled with the parameterization scheme of kb 1 improved the estimation accuracy of the original model which h and le obtained by the tseb new1 and tseb new2 were in good agreement with the ec flux observation the improved tseb new2 was more suitable for estimating et of the heterogeneous surface the et value over the heterogeneous surface ranged from 0 69 to 6 48 mm day 1 during the growing period the daily et for different land cover types were in descending order orchard maize vegetables residential desert steppe gobi desert and sandy desert the daily et in irrigated cropland region had a better consistency with observations than outside the irrigation area besides et stronger responded to precipitation this research significantly reduced the uncertainty of et simulation based on the tseb model in the semi arid and arid regions by coupling the original model with the kb 1 parameterization scheme the improved tseb model has important

9083,accurate quantification of land surface evapotranspiration et is desperately crucial for agricultural irrigation strategy drought monitoring and water resource management in semiarid and arid regions the two source energy balance tseb model is an appropriate method for estimating et over the mixed surface of vegetation and soil since it considers both energy contributions from soil and vegetation the key parameters of the tseb model additional heat transfer resistance kb 1 and soil resistance are vital to the estimation of water vapor and heat fluxes over the heterogeneous surface in this study the kb 1 parameterization and soil resistance formulation with different coefficients were integrated into the tseb model to improve the original model performance over the heterogeneous surface in the midstream area of the heihe river basin hrb the effect of kb 1 on the tseb model performance was greater than the soil resistance coefficient by validating the model output using the eddy covariance ec measurement installed at vegetables maize residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe surface the optimized tseb model would significantly reduce the uncertainty of the original model and improve the consistency between the simulated and observed sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le over the heterogeneous surfaces rmse values of h and le decreased to 53 and 78 w m 2 from 67 and 104 w m 2 for seven sites average in 2012 the daily et of this study area ranged from 0 69 to 6 48 mm day 1 during the growing period it agreed well with ec flux observations for the vegetated area especially irrigated cropland with mbe rmse and mape values of 0 21 mm d 1 1 02 mm d 1 and 14 62 at maize site 0 39 mm d 1 1 14 mm d 1 and 20 25 at vegetables site this research enhances the utility of tseb in flux estimation over heterogeneous landscapes and thus is of great help in formulating sustainable water resource management schemes keywords evapotranspiration two source energy balance additional heat transfer resistance soil resistance heihe river basin heterogeneous surface data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important process of water energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere it does not only affect the growth and production of plants but also affect the water cycles and plays a role in regulating the climate wang and dickinson 2012 quantitatively estimating et is essential for understanding energy balance issues and comprehending hydrological processes the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest endorheic river basin in the arid area of northwest china the midstream area of hbr are the settlements of human beings and the well known food production base in china where water consumption is mainly from agricultural irrigation and residential drinking water in recent years the allocation of water resources in the hrb has been optimized but the midstream of hrb is still suffering from the imbalance between irrigation and ecological water consumption cheng et al 2014 li et al 2018 quantitative et value can be used as an indicator for monitoring crop drought assessing water use efficiency in farmland and providing decision making for irrigation and water resources conservation ground observations and model based estimation are the main ways to obtain et conventional ground observation methods include the weighing lysimeter bowen ratio approach eddy covariance system and scintillometer baldocchi et al 2001 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a ward 2017 it is difficult for ground observation technology to meet the needs of watershed and global scale applications due to spatial heterogeneity thus various model based methods have been proposed for estimating et which can be classified into two categories according to the driving force of the model 1 data driven method for example empirical methods wang and dickinson 2012 and machine learning methods jung et al 2010 2019 bai et al 2021 xu et al 2018 kumar et al 2002 2 physical method based on process driven such as surface energy balance models seb su 2002 kustas and norman 1999 bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 1995 shuttleworth 1989 penman monteith or priestley taylor formula yao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 2016b fisher et al 2008 monteith 1965 penman 1948 feature space method tang and li 2017 long and singh 2012 currently seb method is widely used in different countries and climatic regions song et al 2016a 2016b qiu et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 hu and jia 2015 vinukollu et al 2011 this study concentrates on the seb model in which latent heat flux le equals the difference of available energy i e net radiation rn minus soil heat flux g0 and sensible heat flux h kustas and anderson 2009 the seb model can be classified into single source and dual source models the single source model treats the land surface as a single system but two source model distinguishes energy fluxes from soil and vegetation elements when estimating h and le kustas and norman 1999 the single source model can obtain satisfactory results especially in places with dense vegetation coverage huang et al 2015 elhag et al 2011 the dual model for instance two source energy balance model tseb is more practical in the vegetation soil mixed surface because it estimates soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration respectively katimbo et al 2022 song et al 2016a 2016b 2020 2022 colaizzi et al 2012a 2012b 2017 kustas et al 2012 kustas and anderson 2009 however the core of the tseb model is to calculate le as the residual of the energy balance equation i e rn g0 h le thus the calculation accuracy of rn h and g0 affects the result of the model morillas et al 2013 showed that the tseb model notably underestimated h for grassland in the semi arid mediterranean and lead to an overestimation of le therefore the accuracy of h estimates is critical to the results of le in the tseb model the application of the bulk transfer equation for the estimation of h gave an unsatisfactory result in seb modeling kustas et al 1989 this is due to the inability of the existing data to correctly evaluate the aerodynamic roughness length of heat transfer z0 h z0 h is generally calculated by the empirical relationship between aerodynamic roughness length for momentum transport z0 m and the additional resistance to heat transfer kb 1 which is z0 h z0 m exp kb 1 however kb 1 cannot generally be obtained directly and require multiple elements to calculate so it is affected by some input variables kb 1 was set to 0 in the original tseb model norman 1995 kustas and norman 1999 namely z0 h z0 m and it is generally considered that z0 h 0 1 z0 m i e kb 1 2 3 for the homogeneous surface while z0 h 0 1 z0 m i e kb 1 2 3 for the heterogeneous surface verma 1989 this assumption may affect the result of aerodynamic resistance which in turn affects the estimation accuracy of h to some extent the researchers pointed out that kb 1 of the same sparse crop surface is different in different years so it is neither accurate nor practical to set a constant for heterogeneous surfaces troufleou et al 1997 yang et al 2007 additionally the kb 1 value can reflect the thermodynamic and momentumic characteristics of the surface in recent decades substantial efforts have been made to develop schemes for the calculation of kb 1 sheppard p a 1958 owen and thomson 1963 brutsaert 1982 kustas et al 1989 su 2002 yang et al 2003 2007 some of these models have a simple relationship between the rough reynolds number re or the friction speed u and the experimental results and these parameterized schemes have a certain theoretical basis owen and thomson 1963 the scheme proposed by su 2002 combined the localized near field lnf theoretical model massman w j 1999 with the vegetation canopy model choudhury and monteith 1988 and the bare soil model brutsaert 1982 kustas et al 1989 proposed the parameterization scheme of kb 1 considering the momentum transmission and the heat transmission when the wind speed increased yang 2003 2007 considered both the efficiency of momentum transmission and the driving factors of heat transmission however the parameterization schemes of kb 1 have not been effectively exploited to improve the performance of seb models in previous studies soil resistance r s another key of the tseb model is critical to h the parametric scheme of r s originally proposed by sauer et al 1995 has undergone a series of refinements norman et al 1995 kondo and ishida 1997 kustas and norman 1999 kool et al 2014 the formula of r s used in the tseb model was revised by kustas and norman 1999 this formula performed well on moderately rough surfaces xia et al 2016 but not on sparsely vegetated surfaces kustas et al 2016 sensitivity analysis demonstrated the high sensitivity of the tseb model to soil resistance coefficients over sparsely vegetated semi arid and arid landscapes li et al 2019 sauer et al 1995 and kondo and ishida 1997 summarized that soil resistance coefficients were different for various surface roughness by observing heat flux temperature and moisture gradients from soil surface to canopy air space however such detailed measurement information on soil roughness and vegetation distribution and architecture is not routinely available so that refining the soil resistance coefficients may be difficult to implement operationally recent researches simply use some existing empirical coefficients based on the type of surface roughness burchard levine et al 2021 li et al 2019 xia et al 2016 this research aims to improve the performance of the tseb model and enhance its utility in surface heat and water vapor fluxes estimation over the heterogeneous surface in the semi arid and arid region by integrating the kb 1 parameterization scheme and different soil resistance coefficients into the original model the main goals were 1 the kb 1 value for the heterogeneous surface covered by maize vegetables residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe in the middle reaches of hrb were calculated by the kb 1 parameterization scheme 2 to assess the performance of the original and modified tseb model using ec observation installed at different land cover types 3 to evaluate the applicability of the improved tseb model using multiple years of experimental data 4 the daily et over the heterogeneous surface in the middle reaches of hrb was estimated by le from the improved tseb model 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the middle reaches of heihe river basin hrb were selected to evaluate the performance of the tseb model the study area is a typical irrigated crop ecosystem covered by maize vegetables and orchard and surrounded by residential wetland gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe fig 1 the maize is the dominant crop type in the study area which is often sown in late april and it is planted in rows with eight plants per square meter the prevailing wind direction was north and northwest in this study area xu et al 2013 the annual precipitation is about 100 250 mm li et al 2018 but the annual potential evaporation is as high as 1200 1800 mm li et al 2013 therefore irrigation is the main source of water for crops during the whole growing season from may to september there are four rounds of irrigation i e early june early july late july and late august a comprehensive eco hydrological experiment heihe water allied telemetry experimental research hiwater was carried out in the middle reaches of the hrb in 2012 liu et al 2016 li et al 2013 a total of 21 sites representing the dominant land cover use types i e maize vegetable residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert desert steppe and wetland were installed in the middle reaches of hrb during hiwater experiment seven sites have been selected in this study to evaluate the performance of the model details of sites were shown in fig 1 automatic weather station aws eddy covariance system ec soil moisture and temperature measurement system smtms and soil heat flux plate were set up at each site vegetable residential and orchard sites were dismantled after 2012 gobi desert and sandy desert sites were remained from 2012 to 2014 while maize and desert steppe sites are operating from 2012 until now in this study the observations for seven sites in 2012 were used to optimize the original model and the observations for maize gobi desert sandy desert in 2013 and 2014 desert steppe in 2014 and 2015 were applied to evaluate the applicability of the improved model 2 2 data collection processing and quality control 2 2 1 meteorological data the observation items mainly include wind speed wind direction air temperature four component radiation infrared temperature air pressure rainfall soil temperature and moisture depth profile and soil heat flux details of each observation item including equipment manufacturer and observation height or depth are shown in table 1 quality assessment of meteorological data is essential to the calculation of

xu et al 2013 the processed data was assessed for data quality using the flagging system with three different levels 0 1 2 mauder and foken 2015 detailed information on the processing steps can be found in wang et al 2015 and xu et al 2013 the flux data of flags 0 and 1 were used in the latter analysis flux data of flag 2 and data within 1 h of precipitation were discarded to calculate the cumulative daily et the missing data in the half hourly latent heat flux series were interpolated using a simple gap filling method xu et al 2017a the average energy balance closure ratios ebr for ec flux were evaluated using the surface energy balance components ebr h le rn g0 foken et al 2010 in which h and le are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively rn is the net radiation g0 is the soil surface heat flux the soil surface heat flux g0 was calculated using the one dimensional equation of soil thermal diffusion combined with the soil moisture and soil temperature at depths of 2 cm and 4 cm xu et al 2017a yang and wang 2008 the ebr values for seven sites are 1 01 vegetables 0 89 maize 0 84 residential 0 78 orchard 0 90 gobi desert 0 81 sandy desert and 1 01 desert steppe respectively the heat storage in canopies land heterogeneous surface and the advection or secondary circulation had a significant effect on the ebr allen et al 2011a xu et al 2017a in this study to evaluate the performance of the tseb model half hourly turbulent fluxes from ec were implemented to achieve energy balance closure by the residual approach falge et al 2005 the turbulent fluxes obtained from the ec measurements reflect the influence of the underlying surface on the turbulent exchange schmid 2002 it is necessary to determine the source area of the ec using the footprint model before analyzing the characteristics of the captured fluxes in this study the eulerian analytic flux footprint model kormann and meixner 2001 was used to obtain the flux footprint of a single point vertical flux measurement the flux contribution of the chosen total source area was set at 90 the footprint estimates of ecs from 90 flux contribution were generally representative of the dominated surface types xu et al 2017b 2 2 3 vegetation biophysical variables land surface characteristic parameters required by the tseb model were manually measured such as leaf area index lai was measured by lai2200 plant canopy analyzer fraction of vegetation coverage fvc was obtained by calculating the proportion of vegetation with the sample matrix li et al 2013 and canopy height h c near the observation sites was observed regularly h c at vegetable maize desert steppe gobi desert and sandy desert surface were measured using the steel tape and h c at orchard surface was measured by the box staff 3 methodology 3 1 description of the tseb model the tseb model was established originally by norman et al 1995 for estimating the surface energy fluxes from vegetation and soil by partitioning the composite surface radiometric temperature trad into soil and canopy temperatures ts and tc the corresponding expression is as follows 1 t r a d θ f c θ t c 4 1 f c θ t s 4 1 4 where f c θ is the fraction of vegetation coverage observed at the view zenith angle θ s and c are soil and vegetation scene components respectively ts and tc are soil and vegetation canopy temperature k respectively the associated h and le from soil and canopy elements in the tseb model can be calculated using the available energy combined with soil and vegetation temperature as follows 2 r n c h c l e c 3 r n s h s l e s g 0 4 r n s τ l o n g w a v e l 1 τ l o n g w a v e ε c σ t c 4 ε s σ t s 4 τ s o l a r 1 α s s 5 r n c 1 τ l o n g w a v e l ε s σ t s 4 2 ε c σ t c 4 1 τ s o l a r 1 α c s where r n represents net radiation h and le are sensible and latent heat flux and g0 is surface soil heat flux all in w m 2 ε and α are the emissivity and albedo respectively s and l are the incoming shortwave and longwave radiation from the sky w m 2 τ l o n g w a v e and τ s o l a r are the longwave and shortwave radiation transmittances through the canopy respectively the g0 can be expressed as a function of r ns 6 g 0 γ r n s where г is an empirical coefficient equal to 0 35 choudhury et al 1987 the series version of the tseb model kustas and norman et al 1999 applied in this study has more applicable parameters due to the energy exchange between the soil and vegetation by allowing for interactions h hs and hc can be specifically defined as 7 h h s h c ρ c p t a c t c r a with 8 h s ρ c p t s t a c r s 9 h c ρ c p t c t a c r x where ρ is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of air j kg 1 k 1 tac is the temperature in the canopy air space k r a is the bulk aerodynamic resistance s m 1 the term r x is the boundary layer resistance associated with canopy s m 1 r s is the resistance to heat flow in the boundary layer directly above the soil surface s m 1 the r a is computed from the aerodynamic resistance r a h s m 1 while r a h can be affected by several factors such as the height and distribution of rough surface elements i e vegetation height and structure etc wind direction and atmospheric stability and so on kustas and norman 1999 the r a h formula norman et al 1995 has undergone several refinements kustas and norman 1999 brutsaert 1999 li et al 2005 and was formally proposed the corresponding calculation expression as follows 10 r a h ln z u d 0 z 0 m ψ m z u d 0 l ln z t d 0 z 0 h ψ h z t d 0 l k 2 u where d 0 is zero plane displacement k is the von karman constant 0 41 zu and zt are the observed heights of u and ta l is the length of monin obukhov ψ m and ψ h are the diabatic correction factors for momentum and heat z0 m and z0 h represent aerodynamic roughness length for momentum and heat transport in which z0 m can be calculated by canopy height brutsaert 1982 z0 h can be calculated by the empirical formula proposed by brutsaert 1982 as follows 11 k b 1 ln z 0 m z 0 h the r s is generally determined on the basis of certain empirical analysis sauer et al 1995 made an in depth statistical analysis based on measured data in the corn field and set up an estimation formula after some simplification after that kustas and norman 1999 appropriately improved and optimized this model to better meet the relevant application requirements the corresponding expression is 12 r s 1 c t s t c 1 3 b u s where u s is wind speed near soil surface m s 1 b and c m s 1 k 1 3 are soil resistance coefficients respectively kondo and ishida 1997 indicated that c ranges from 0 0011 for a smooth surface to 0 0038 for a rough surface based on both laboratory and field experiments coefficient b ranges from 0 025 to 0 087 during a whole growing season sauer et al 1995 for moderately rough soil surfaces default values for b and c are 0 012 and 0 0025 respectively in the tseb model kustas and norman 1999 for rough soil surfaces with sparse vegetation however the value of b and c are up to 0 087 and 0 0038 kondo and ishida 1997 sauer et al 1995 besides kustas et al 2016 concluded that soil resistance coefficients b 0 012 and c 0 025 in the tseb model caused a large deviation in estimates of h in semi arid areas with sparse vegetation while coefficients b 0 065 and c 0 0038 have been proved to make model yield good agreement with measured h this result is due to the fact that an accurate estimate of hs is critical since it is the main contributor to h in sparsely vegetated semi arid and arid landscapes jacobs et al 1996 the r x can be determined as 13 r x c l a i s u d 0 z 0 m 1 2 where c is the adjustment parameter of the model and can be set to 90 s0 5 m 1 lai is the leaf area index s represents the size of the plant leaf and is calculated using the area of the leaf divided by the circumference of the leaf u d 0 z 0 m is the wind speed at the height of d 0 z0 m the most important issue for the tseb model is to determine the temperature related to canopy and soil temperature kustas et al 2007 to estimate the component surface fluxes from the soil and vegetation priestly taylor formula priestley taylor 1972 and parallel resistance formulations are combined and the initial vegetation temperature is computed as norman et al 1995 14 t c i t a r n c r a h ρ c p 1 α p t f g δ δ γ where tci is the initial estimate of tc ta is the air temperature at the reference height r ah is the aerodynamic resistance to turbulent heat transport between the canopy source height α p t is the priestley taylor coefficient for the canopy 1 26 γ represents the psychrometric constant 0 06 f g is the fraction of green vegetation is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relation kpa k 1 then ts can be calculated by the formula 1 thus les and lec are computed as a residual of eqs 2 and 3 and h and le can be determined by eqs 15 and 16 15 h h c h s 16 l e l e c l e s 3 2 the parameterization scheme of kb 1 the kb 1 parameterization proposed by kustas et al 1989 has a close relationship with micrometeorological and surface feature parameters kb 1 can be expressed as a function of u lst and ta the corresponding formula is as follows 17 k b 1 a u l s t t a where u is wind speed m s 1 lst is land surface temperature k ta is air temperature k and a is the constant 0 17 3 3 the improved tseb model this study integrates the kb 1 parameterization scheme into the tseb model in an attempt to optimize the performance of the original model in a semi arid and arid region simultaneously the performance of the tseb model with soil resistance formulation using typical coefficients b 0 012 c 0 0025 kustas and norman 1999 and modified coefficients for semiarid clumped vegetation b 0 065 c 0 0038 kustas et al 2016 was assessed four combination scenarios of kb 1 b and c in the tseb model were implemented in this study including 1 tseb 1 the original tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 012 c 0 0025 and kb 1 0 2 tseb new1 the tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 012 c 0 0025 coupled with the kb 1 value of the parameterization scheme 3 tseb 2 the tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 065 c 0 0038 and kb 1 0 4 tseb new2 the tseb model with soil resistance coefficients b 0 065 c 0 0038 coupled with the kb 1 value of the parameterization scheme tseb 1 is the original model which is used as the benchmark for the comparison of the other three improved models 3 4 the evaluation metrics the root mean squared error rmse mean bias error mbe and mean absolute percentage error mape were used as error metrics to evaluate kb 1 h le and le estimates these statistics are defined as follows 18 r m s e i 1 n y e y m 2 n 19 m b e i 1 n y e y m n 20 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y e y m y m where ye is the estimated kb 1 h le and et respectively ym is the measured kb 1 h le and et respectively n is the number of samples for the above variables rmse provides information on the deviation by allowing a term by term comparison of the actual difference between the predicted and the observed value mbe reflects the magnitude of deviation of the predicted from the measured value the positive value gives the average amount of overestimation in the predicted values and vice versa mape is a relative error standard avoiding the mutual cancellation of positive and negative errors the smaller the rmse and mape values the better the estimated the closer the mbe value is to 0 the better the estimated 4 results 4 1 the kb 1 for heterogeneous surface the results of the kb 1 parameterization from 8 00 18 00 the local time over the heterogeneous surface during the whole growing season from june and september in 2012 were shown in table 3 the kb 1 varied remarkably with land cover types the value of kb 1 for cropland was from 0 02 to 3 21 on maize surface and 1 30 3 02 on vegetables surface respectively the orchards surface exhibited relatively low kb 1 with values generally ranging from 0 64 1 21 the kb 1 value for residential areas varied from 0 49 3 45 instead kb 1 generally had higher values between 0 85 and 4 57 on the surface where the canopy was characterized by uneven and sparse roughness elements such as gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe it indicated that the z0 m on the sparsely vegetated surfaces was significantly greater than the z0 h the rough elements of the vegetation soil mixed surface were scattered blocky or discontinuously distributed and drag on the wind was greater for these rough elements the rough elements can cause z0 m to become stronger but has little effect on z0 h in general z0 h was mainly related to the thermal diffusion of molecules therefore the value of kb 1 was relatively large on the sparsely vegetated surface the kb 1 had a negative value under certain circumstances particularly in the morning and nightfall the main reason is that the aerodynamic resistance was large in the morning and nightfall and the heat transfer exceeded the momentum transmission the daily variation of kb 1 over different underlying surfaces in the early growing season june flourishing period july and subsequent senescent stage september were shown in fig 2 the kb 1 values increased slowly at 9 00 in the morning reached the maximum between 13 00 15 00 and then declined gradually after 15 30 this finding was consistent with the results of previous studies troufleou et al 1997 osamu et al 2002 yang et al 2007 land surfaces covered by sparse vegetation exhibited a large diurnal variation in kb 1 due to the large temperature difference between the lst and ta as well as the influence of wind drag it further showed that kb 1 was greatly affected by the condition of the underlying surface for example the kb 1 value on the maize surface had a large daily variation in the early growing season as fig 2 a because vegetation soil mixed surface when the soil surface was fully covered by maize crops the kb 1 value gradually became stable fig 2 b and c the results showed that surface parameters such as roughness temperature and heat transport were various since surface was covered by different land cover types therefore the value of kb 1 should be considered when obtaining regional scale et particularly for heterogeneous surfaces by using the tseb model 4 2 comparison of kb 1 between parameterization and observation the kb 1 obtained based on aerodynamic resistance r a h brutsaert 1999 1982 was regarded as the observation to verify the kb 1 parameterization comparisons of parameterized value versus observation of kb 1 were shown in fig 3 a better consistency between parameterized and measured kb 1 was found with rmse 1 15 under various surface types the parameterized kb 1 for vegetables residential maize and orchard surfaces in the irrigation region was greater than observations while it was the opposite for gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe surface outside the irrigation region in general the deviation of parameterized kb 1 for orchard vegetables surface was the smallest largest with the mbe value of 0 06 0 79 the deviations for kb 1 parameterization were attributed to the uncertainties in lst ta and u a more detailed analysis was made in the following discussion section 4 3 evaluation of modeled h and le from the original and improved tseb model comparisons of the model estimated h versus ec flux measurements over seven different underlying surfaces were presented in fig 4 comparatively h estimated by the tseb model with different parameters exhibited various results the tseb 1 underestimated h as shown in fig 4 a1 e1 f1 and g1 for surface types of vegetables gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe while it overestimated h for surface types of maize residential and orchard as shown in fig 4 b1 c1 and d1 the h estimates for vegetables residential and desert steppe surfaces agreed well with fluxes observations in fig 4 a3 c3 and g3 but the larger bias of h estimates produced for orchard gobi desert and sandy desert surface in fig 4 d3 e3 and f3 using tseb 2 model to a certain extent the larger values of soil resistance coefficients b 0 065 c 0 0038 lead to overestimation of h this shows that simply modified the soil resistance coefficient cannot effectively improve the estimation accuracy of the tseb model the results for the h and le estimation based on the tseb model with the kb 1 parameterization scheme tseb new1 and tseb new2 are shown in fig 4 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 f2 g2 a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 f4 and g4 it indicated that h estimated by tseb with the kb 1 parameterization scheme was close to the flux observations which significantly improved the problem of underestimation or overestimation of h compared to tseb 1 h estimated by the tseb new1 was most close to the ground observations for residential maize and orchard and the mape values decreased by about 84 7 21 respectively except for maize and residential tseb new1 underestimated h mbe 20 w m 2 for vegetables mbe 13 w m 2 for orchard mbe 54 w m 2 for gobi desert mbe 27 w m 2 for sandy desert and mbe 67 w m 2 for desert steppe h modeled by tseb new1 produced a larger bias over the surfaces covered by vegetables and desert steppe the value of rmse was 43 w m 2 and 86 w m 2 respectively while estimates of h from the tseb new2 produced a small deviation rmse mbe and mape are 53 w m 2 11 w m 2 and 60 generally tseb new1 performed relatively better than tseb new2 for residential maize and orchard surface while tseb new2 performed better than tseb new1 for vegetable gobi desert and desert steppe surfaces the scatterplot between le output from tseb 1 tseb 2 tseb new1 and tseb new2 versus ec observations were shown in fig 5 le estimates from tseb new1 and tseb new2 had a good consistency with the ec flux observations and a similar agreement was found for the modeled h the estimates of le over the densely vegetated surfaces agreed well with the ec flux observations tseb 1 tseb 2 tseb new1 and tseb new2 produced mape of 26 29 26 12 28 26 49 32 and 26 31 for le over maize orchard surface besides the bias of le estimates in the vegetation soil mixed surface was larger the mape value of le modeled by four versions of tseb models was greater than 70 for gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe and greater than 48 for residential tseb 1 tseb 2 tseb new1 and tseb new2 overestimated le except for residential surface the results suggested that compared to the other three models the tseb new2 obtain finer estimates of le over the heterogeneous surfaces with the rmse mbe and mape values of 78 w m 2 11 w m 2 and 49 respectively the deviation of modeled and observed turbulent flux was to some extent due to the uncertainties of observation and model inputs song et al 2018 kustas et al 2012 mainly in the influence of advection or secondary circulation on ec flux observation in irrigated cropland the observational bias of model input lai lst and h c affected the modeled output a more detailed analysis was shown in section 5 3 in general the influence of kb 1 on the tseb model performance was greater than the soil resistance coefficient as evidenced by the results of the four models tseb 1 tseb new1 tseb 2 and tseb new2 compared to the original model i e tseb 1 tseb 2 was revised by changing the soil resistance coefficient i e b and c and remaining the value of kb 1 unchanged but there is no significant improvement in the performance of tseb 2 table 4 compared to tseb 1 tseb new1 was altered by changing the value of kb 1 and remaining the soil resistance coefficient unchanged but the tseb new1 outperformed the tseb 1 similarly compared to tseb 2 tseb new2 was revised by changing the value of kb 1 and remaining the soil resistance coefficient unchanged the tseb new2 outperformed tseb 2 therefore modifying the soil resistance coefficient of the original model was not effective in improving the performance of the model while integrating the kb 1 parameterization into the tseb can reduce the uncertainty of the original model 4 4 evaluating the applicability of the improved tseb model the tseb new2 model was utilized to estimate turbulent fluxes at maize gobi desert sandy desert surface in 2013 and 2014 respectively and desert steppe surface in 2014 and 2015 respectively further to verify the applicability of the improved tseb model the scatterplots of h and le estimates and ec observations were shown in fig 6 and fig 7 h estimates agreed with observation for four sites particularly for these sites covered by spare vegetation such as gobi desert mape values were 23 and 30 in 2013 and 2014 respectively sandy desert mape values were 24 and 26 in 2013 and 2014 respectively and desert steppe mape values were 32 and 22 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the result indicated that modeled le was slightly close to the 1 1 line with ec observations the magnitude of the bias for each site in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 was similar to that of 2012 the modeled le may be influenced by other factors as shown in the discussion section 4 5 daily et over the whole growing season the half hourly et value can be calculated by half hourly le from the improved tseb model combined with formula i e λ e t l e in which λ mj m 3 is the latent heat of vaporization λ 2 501 0 02361 t 0 10 3 where t0 is the average air temperature in half hourly then the daily et was calculated by summing the half hourly et to 24 h totals the temporal variations of the observed and estimated daily et over different land surface types during the whole growing season were similar fig 8 et was closely related to the status of vegetation coverage the daily average et values over the whole growing season for maize vegetables residential orchard gobi desert sandy desert and desert steppe were 5 12 mm 5 62 mm 2 14 mm 6 48 mm 1 03 mm 0 69 mm and 2 07 mm respectively in comparison the daily et for sandy desert with non vegetated coverage was small the et estimates agreed with ec flux observations particularly for cropland mbe 0 21 mm d 1 for maize mbe 0 39 mm d 1 for vegetables respectively the estimated et had a larger deviation in the sparse vegetated or non vegetated surface mape 42 73 for residential mape 48 87 for gobi desert mape 49 11 for sandy desert and mape 41 35 for desert steppe respectively table 5 the modeled et showed a much stronger response to the precipitation producing a significantly low et on days when rain events occurred and et increased rapidly after the rainfall the et in each site over cropland increased after irrigation but the value of et among each site in irrigated region also differed considerably during the irrigation periods 5 discussion 5 1 the relationship between kb 1 and its influencing variables kustas et al 1989 found that the magnitude of kb 1 was related to wind speed u and the difference between lst and ta i e lst ta and concluded that kb 1 had a linear relationship with u lst t a the linear relationship between kb 1 and u and lst ta for vegetated surface e g maize and vegetated soil mixed surface e g desert steppe from june to september in 2012 was found in this study as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 compared to maize surface the kb 1 for desert steppe surface had a stronger correlation with u and lst ta this finding proved that the kb 1 value was influenced by significantly land cover type rigden et al 2018 it can be seen from fig 9 and fig 10 that the correlation between kb 1 and lst ta was stronger than that of u this means that kb 1 was more affected by the thermal gradient than the momentum transfer on the other hand friction wind speed rigden et al 2018 phenology young et al 2021 and environmental variables brutsaert 1982 were other factors that affected kb 1 in the semi arid and arid regions furthermore the kb 1 observation based on aerodynamic resistance includes many parameters such as atmospheric data e g air pressure wind speed and temperature and surface characteristic parameters e g land surface temperature leaf area index and canopy height thus the uncertainty in flux and meteorological measurements affects the accuracy of the kb 1 verification data calculated from ec and aws 5 2 comparison with similar studies at present the tseb model has been utilized extensively to estimate h and le in the middle reaches of hrb yang et al 2015 xu et al 2016 song et al 2016a 2016b 2018 2020 2022 yao et al 2017 2021 li et al 2019 2020 feng et al 2020 cui et al 2021 short term mid term and long term et estimates have been conducted spatial scale for fluxes based on tseb model from point to field and landscape scale the tentative improvement of the tseb model has been considered including the refinement of soil resistance formulations li et al 2019 and priestley taylor coefficient song b et al 2016 in these studies the rmse value of h was about 32 70 w m 2 and the rmse value of le was about 53 132 w m 2 the tseb model combined with the kb 1 parameterization was first applied in this study to estimate h and le thus to et the results also showed that h and le agreed well with the flux observations from ec systems installed at all representative land cover types particularly for the le its estimates produced rmse of 78 w m 2 for the heterogeneous surfaces 5 3 uncertainty introduced by flux observation and model inputs the uncertainty in ec fluxes affected the mismatch between model output and observations which was mainly reflected in energy imbalance of observation the energy balance closure ratios ebr for ec flux ranged from 0 78 to 1 01 in this study area strong advection usually occurred during the afternoon when le was greater than available energy i e rn g0 in the experimental area fig 11 which broke the closed system of the energy balance xu et al 2017a from fig 11 a and d the ebr increases when advection occurs besides the ebr was maintained at the maximum value and it did not change with increasing averaging period under the advection conditions de bruin et al 2005 xu et al 2017a therefore the effect of advection on ebr cannot be ignored in this oasis desert area particularly in the irrigated cropland from fig 11 b c e and f the deviation between modeled and observed turbulent fluxes became larger when advection occurs particularly for h additionally the heat storage in canopies and land heterogeneous surfaces had a significant effect on the ebr thus it is difficult to quantify the effect of advection on energy flux for ec observation and modeled if possible these questions will be addressed in future studies additionally the ec flux observations corrected by the residual approach were applied to verify the results of the tseb model in this study energy balance closure correction methods have a certain effect on the statistical results song et al 2016b foken 2008 the accuracy for h estimated by tseb new1 was the best while the accuracy of le estimates from tseb new2 improved in this study the reason is that the le was affected by model inputs because it has been calculated as the residual of the surface energy balance equation its estimation accuracy was significantly affected by the following factors 1 the errors of the components e g rn h g0 in the surface energy balance equation would be propagated to the le and the uncertainty of error lead to the calculation deviation of the le 2 the result of lst decomposition based on the tseb models may be undesirable as in discussed by song et al 2016a they concluded that the results of decomposed soil and vegetation component temperatures lst outperform composite lst when the tseb model based on temperature was used to calculate the turbulent flux however due to the limitation of observation for component temperatures this study did not deeply analyze this reason 3 the leaf area index lai was the most critical surface characteristic parameter of the tseb model song et al 2020 kustas et al 2012 the observational bias of lai had certain implications on et over the heterogenous surface 4 g0 was an important component of the surface energy balance equation which accounts for 20 40 of net radiation in arid and semi arid areas covered by sparse vegetation idso et al 1975 the le estimates for gobi sandy desert and desert steppe surface were affected by the results of g0 5 4 advantages disadvantages and prospects the tseb model combined with the kb 1 parameterization provides the basis for regional scale surface fluxes and evapotranspiration using atmospheric numerical modeling and remote sensing based model the kb 1 reflects the thermal condition of the surface the results section 4 1 indicated the kb 1 values were different for different land cover types besides the kb 1 as a key parameter of tseb was critical to the calculation of water vapor and heat fluxes over the heterogeneous surface the tseb model coupled with the kb 1 parameterization was successfully applied in this study to estimate h and le thus to et in summary this study significantly improves the performance of the original model section 4 3 nevertheless the coefficient a 0 17 of the parameterization scheme of kb 1 may be not constant it needs to be calibrated to local meteorological conditions and surface parameters this work will be continued in the next study the improved model was evaluated using observations in the growing season the performance of the model in the non growing season has to be further investigated in the future the performance of improved tseb indicates that there is still some room for improvement in the original model including the model structure field observation and validation strategy cui et al 2021 the performance of the improved tseb model was evaluated and analyzed only for heterogeneous surfaces in the semi arid arid area its performance in other surfaces of different climatic regions e g humid and semi humid areas will be conducted in the future additionally deep learning as an emerging technology will be incorporated into the tseb to optimize model structure and improve model performance reichstein et al 2019 proposed that the fusion of a physical processed based model and deep learning was the most potential method in the earth science field hybrid models i e the fusion of the tseb model and deep learning not only has advantages in dealing with huge amounts of data but also in reducing the uncertainty of physical process models at present only a few studies have attempted to build a new hybrid model cui et al 2021 a large amount of work needs to be conducted on the development of the hybrid model to predict et in the future for instance 1 the physical equation of the tseb model has been packaged into loss function of deep learning to enhance the interpretability of deep learning 2 deep learning is used to optimize the key parameters e g surface roughness and soil resistance and variables e g lst and ta of the tseb model 3 the errors in model structure are corrected by deep learning 6 conclusion in this study the value of kb 1 for heterogeneous surfaces has been calculated using a parameterization scheme of kb 1 and further it was incorporated into the tseb model to improve the model performance in the semi arid and arid regions simultaneously different coefficients of soil resistance formulation in the tseb model also have been evaluated h and le estimates for heterogeneous surfaces modeled by the original and improved tseb were validated by ec flux observations the daily et was calculated by le from the improved tseb new2 model summarily the parameterized kb 1 estimates agreed with observations with mbe values was between 0 49 and 0 79 for seven sites the kb 1 was closely related to the type of surface cover the kb 1 value over the land covered by vegetated surface i e maize vegetables and orchard ranged from 1 30 3 21 while that of the sparse vegetation surface desert steppe sandy desert and gobi desert was varied from 0 85 4 57 also the kb 1 had obvious diurnal variation characteristics for different land cover types the improved tseb new1 and tseb new2 outperformed the tseb 1 and tseb 2 this result concluded that the effect of kb 1 on the results of the tseb model was greater than the soil resistance coefficient the tseb model coupled with the parameterization scheme of kb 1 improved the estimation accuracy of the original model which h and le obtained by the tseb new1 and tseb new2 were in good agreement with the ec flux observation the improved tseb new2 was more suitable for estimating et of the heterogeneous surface the et value over the heterogeneous surface ranged from 0 69 to 6 48 mm day 1 during the growing period the daily et for different land cover types were in descending order orchard maize vegetables residential desert steppe gobi desert and sandy desert the daily et in irrigated cropland region had a better consistency with observations than outside the irrigation area besides et stronger responded to precipitation this research significantly reduced the uncertainty of et simulation based on the tseb model in the semi arid and arid regions by coupling the original model with the kb 1 parameterization scheme the improved tseb model has important

9084,methane ch4 as a important source of greenhouse gases from paddy ecosystem was overestimated under multi year straw incorporation however how ch4 can be affected by multi year straw incorporation under different water saving techniques is little known in this study the effects of straw incorporation years and irrigation regime on ch4 emission and its potential mechanism in mollisols were investigated by conducting a multi year in situ experiment the following 4 treatments were included controlled irrigation straw incorporation for 1 year c1 controlled irrigation straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years c5 flooded irrigation straw incorporation for 1 year f1 and flooded irrigation straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years f5 methane fluxes soil microbial biomass carbon mbc microbial biomass nitrogen mbn dissolved organic carbon doc the relative abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs were determined the results showed that straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased nh4 n no3 n doc mbc which led a increased in rice yield by 4 42 5 84 compared with 1 year straw incorporation controlled irrigation significantly reduced ch4 emission in mollisols by 70 2 79 7 compared with flooded irrigation and this reduction was more obvious under 5 year straw incorporation the consequence of decreased ch4 emission was mainly affect by the decrease in doc content another key reason of decreasing ch4 emissions under controlled irrigation was the relative abundance difference between methanogens and methanogens which decreased from 266 7 to 19 3 the present study provides a further detailed understanding of the ch4 emission mechanism for straw and irrigation management in mollisols keywords mollisols methane emission straw incorporation water saving irrigation methanogens methanotrophs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the concentration of ch4 in the atmosphere has increased rapidly at an annual rate of 1 1 guo and zhou 2007 as the second largest greenhouse gas ghg in the atmosphere its ability to capture heat is more than 25 times that of co2 and its contribution to global warming accounts for about one quarter of the total ghg ipcc 2013 since pre industrial times the temperature rise caused by ch4 has been as high as 0 5 c second only to co2 in may 2021 the global methane assessment report published jointly by the climate and clean air coalition and the united nations environment programme noted that 40 of anthropogenic ch4 emissions came from agriculture including livestock and rice cultivation unep 2021 as an essential source of atmospheric ch4 paddy fields emitted 10 20 of global ch4 emissions kirschke et al 2013 therefore mitigating ch4 emissions from paddy rice cultivation is a significant direction for ghg reduction currently about 154 million hectares of land are specially used for rice cultivation in the world while china a major rice producer accounts for 25 8 of the grain planting area fao 2016 for a long time flooded irrigation has been practiced in most paddy fields in china huang et al 2022 water saving irrigation was given more and more attention as a result of the traditional flooded irrigation s high water consumption and the uneven supply and demand of agricultural water yao et al 2012 ye et al 2013 different water saving irrigation practices such as shallow wet irrigation controlled irrigation intermittent irrigation and rain gathering irrigation have been widely implemented to assure food security and address the issue of diminishing accessible water resources du et al 2015 xu et al 2015 indeed water saving irrigation typically reduces irrigation water by 60 compared to flooded irrigation without affecting or even increasing rice yield xu et al 2015 water saving irrigation practices usually included one or more drainage periods which effectively inhibited the development of soil reduction conditions and significantly reduced ch4 emissions related studies have found that mid season drainage reduced 35 70 of ch4 emissions in paddy fields xu et al 2015 zou et al 2005 the improvement of paddy water management practice has achieved the effect of saving water and reducing ch4 emissions the expansion of rice planting area leads to more straw production every year according to the data released by the second national pollution source census report china s crop straw production in 2017 was 805 million tons with great processing demand mee 2020 straw incorporation a vital agricultural practice offers positive environmental and economic advantages under the policy prohibiting burning straw yin et al 2018 zou et al 2005 straw is abundant in nitrogen phosphorus and potassium which can be used as organic fertilizer to improve soil fertility and crop yield xu et al 2019 however straw incorporation also increased soil organic carbon content which provided additional substrate sources for methanogens and promoted ch4 emission yang et al 2022 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc used the straw application rate as the primary indicator to estimate the impact of straw incorporation on regional and global ch4 emissions jiang et al 2019 the ipcc method estimated that the average ch4 emission caused by straw incorporation increased by 193 jiang et al 2019 however this method assumes that straw incorporation years will not affect ch4 emission yan et al 2005 studies have shown that under the condition of long term straw incorporation the ipcc report overestimated the ch4 emission caused by straw incorporation by about 91 yang et al 2022 their results showed that with the extension of straw incorporation years straw improved the growth of methanotrophs stimulated by soil aeration and increased the ch4 oxidation potential so far limited evidence supports that water saving irrigation still contributes to reducing ch4 emissions under multi year straw incorporation from paddy fields therefore we conducted a long term in situ experiment to study the effects of controlled irrigation and flooded irrigation on ch4 emission and ch4 related microorganisms under different straw incorporation years aiming to clarify the potential mechanism of the effect of water saving practice on ch4 emission multi year straw incorporation in mollisols and to provide a reliable water management for mitigating ch4 emission in rice ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was performed at the state key station for

a 0 30 mm shallow water layer during rice re greening stage and natural drying during the mature stage under controlled irrigation there was no water layer during the rice growth period chen et al 2019a the irrigation time and quota were controlled by taking the root soil moisture content as the index the upper limit of irrigation was the saturated water content of the soil and the lower limit of soil water content at each growth stage was the percentage of saturated water content trime pico64 32 imko germany soil moisture analyzer was used to measure soil moisture content at 7 00 a m and 6 00 p m when the soil water content was close to or lower than the lower limit of irrigation irrigation was established in this way the soil water content can be maintained between the upper and lower limits of soil water content at the corresponding growth stage through artificial irrigation unlike controlled irrigation the ponded water depth of rice was maintained at 30 50 mm throughout the

affected by different irrigation management and straw incorporation years the ch4 fluxes of c1 c5 and f1 increased steadily and reached the peak at about 49 days after transplanting which were 23 10 6 24 44 83 2 49 and 66 99 3 69 mg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3 however ch4 fluxes of f5 increased sharply after applying tillering fertilizer and reached the peak value of 125 09 6 54 mg m 2 h 1 on 27 days after transplanting p 0 05 compared with other treatments the ch4 fluxes of all treatments began to decrease after applying fertilizer in booting stage at the end of milk stage the ch4 flux of each treatment was stable at a low level until the end of the rice growth period irrigation regime straw incorporation year and interaction between them significantly affected the mean ch4 fluxes p 0

irrigation the cumulative ch4 emission of controlled irrigation significantly decreased by 70 2 79 7 p 0 05 compared with c1 and f1 the cumulative ch4 emissions of c5 and f5 significantly increased by 101 7 and 195 8 respectively p 0 05 fig 3 3 2 soil physiochemical properties the dynamic changes of doc nh4 n no3 n mbc and mbn during the experiment were shown in fig 5 in general the doc contents under straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years were increased 11 8 on average compared with 1 year straw incorporation the average content of nh4 n and no3 n under controlled irrigation was relatively high the average content of nh4 n and no3 n in c1 were 38 5 and 13 6 higher than that in f1 and those in c5 were 75 8 and 7 3 higher than that in f5 respectively p 0 05 straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased the mbc content with an average increase of 22 3 in c5 compared to c1 and an average increase of 40 6 in f5 compared to f1 likewise straw incorporation increased mbn content for 5 consecutive years the average mbn content of f5 was 20 6 higher than that of f1 and that of c5 was 18 0 higher than that of c1 p 0 05 pearson correlation analysis showed that ch4 emission was significantly and positively correlated with soil doc and mbc table 4 3 3 abundance changes of methanogens and methanotrophs according to fig 6 the relative abundance of methanotrophs and methanogens were significantly affected by irrigation regime and straw incorporation year p 0 05 compared with 1 year straw incorporation the relative abundance of methanotrophs of controlled irrigation and flooded irrigation with rice straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased by 52 2 and 22 6 respectively while the relative abundance of methanogens increased by 367 7 and 95 2 accordingly the relative abundance of methanotrophs among all treatments was higher than that of methanogens except f5 under controlled irrigation the difference between the relative abundance of methanotrophs and methanogens decreased from 266 7 to 19 3 whereas in f5 the relative abundance of methanogens was significantly higher than methanotrophs by 33 p 0 05 methanosaeta and methanosarcina were the two most essential methanogens at the genus level accounting for 64 96 and 93 of c5 f1 and f5 in c1 we only found methanosaeta a methanogen after 5 year straw incorporation two new methanogens methanosarcina and methanomassiliicoccus were added to the controlled irrigation treatments fig 7 in contrast the methanogens community composition was reduced in the flooded irrigation in the observed methanotroph community the main methanotrophs were methylibium and methylosinus and the sum of their relative abundance accounted for 71 67 75 and 69 of c1 c5 f1 and f5 after straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years the number of methanotroph communities in c5 and f5 decreased fig 8 3 4 grain yield the yield of each treatment was shown in fig 9 which decreases in the following order c5 c1 f5 f1 under the same straw incorporation year the yield of controlled irrigation was higher c1 was 11 49 higher than f1 and c5 was 9 99 higher than f5 p 0 05 in the same irrigation regime the rice yield of straw incorporation in 5 years was higher c5 was 4 42 higher than c1 and f5 was 5 84 higher than f1 p 0 05 4 discussion mollisols have drawn researchers attention since they are a limited resource its high soil organic matter content and carbon sink density are crucial for reducing climate change and global carbon emissions chen et al 2022a li et al 2018 we conducted a multi year in situ experiment to study the effects of different irrigation regimes and straw incorporation years on ch4 emission in mollisols we found that controlled irrigation as a water saving irrigation method significantly reduced ch4 emissions this was mainly due to the controlled irrigation water management pattern after the rice re greening period table 3 cai et al 2003 carlson et al 2017 chen et al 2019a the paddy field environment under controlled irrigation gradually tended to be aerobic which provided a better living environment for methanotrophs and inhibited the activity of methanogens in the soil chen et al 2019b xu et al 2012 thereby reducing the production of ch4 on the contrary long term flooded paddy fields created a good anaerobic environment which was essential for the growth of methanogens honma et al 2016 buendia et al 1997 there have been reports of significant increases in ch4 emission in the presence of increased soil moisture hou et al 2016 song et al 2021 increased soil moisture hindered oxygen exchange resulting in anaerobic soil conditions that promoted the activity of methanogens uprety et al 2011 by reducing the soil oxidation zone the activity of methanotrophs was reduced patel et al 2021 in addition the role of straw incorporation cannot be ignored qin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the addition of exogenous c via straw incorporation tends to enhance the soil s c n ratio which significantly impacts changes in the composition of the soil s microbial community accounting for 18 28 of the overall change impact wang et al 2018b the greater doc content of f5 and c5 in our studies also proved that multi year straw incorporation supplied more c substrate furthermore the average doc content of c5 increased by 22 2 over c1 whereas f5 only increased by 1 3 over f1 this demonstrated that while the soil doc stability was greater under the flooded irrigation the straw decomposed more rapidly under the controlled irrigation trinh et al 2018 straw incorporation applied in soil without straw incorporation history significantly promoted the growth of soil methanogens and ch4 emissions shrestha et al 2011 however the addition of rice straw usually lasts for years and the roles of methanogens and methanotrophs in regulating ch4 emission under long term straw incorporation were not well recognized in our study methanosacta and methanosarcina were the predominant methanogen genera in all treatments while methylibium and methylosinus were the predominant methanotroph genera observed the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs in mollisols increased significantly under straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years especially in the control irrigation treatments this was because the controlled irrigation s aerobic conditions enabled the straw to decompose more quickly than it would have under flooded irrigation chen et al 2018 and more reaction substrates stimulated the activity of microorganisms and nitrogen mineralization yang et al 2022 in addition multi year straw incorporation boosted soil microbial activity as evidenced by the higher average contents of mbc and mbn in the c5 and f5 treatments wu et al 2020 yang et al 2022 moreover a higher mbc content was also a more significant and important influencing factor of ch4 emission according to the correlation analysis table 3 the aerobic environment of controlled irrigation however significantly increased the abundance of methanotrophs even though both the relative abundance of microorganisms in c5 and f5 increased we speculated that the difference in relative abundance between the two microorganisms was an essential reason for the marginally higher ch4 emission of c5 than c1 jiang et al 2019 yang et al 2022 the significant effect of straw incorporation year and irrigation regime on rice yield may be related to the n transformation in the soil when the fertilizer was broadcasted into the fields in this experiment some of the nitrogen was lost via the ammonia volatilization pathway related research revealed that compared to paddy fields with flooded irrigation ammonia volatilization losses from paddy fields with controlled irrigation were less responsive to surface ammonium nitrogen content the wet dry cycle under controlled irrigation resulted in lower ammonia volatilization losses during most growth stages of rice this implied that controlled irrigation retained more nitrogen in the soil which is advantageous for increasing yield xu et al 2012 in addition straw incorporation tends to increase the c n ratio in the soil the higher c content in the soil encouraged n mineralization to maintain a stable c n ratio which on the other hand promoted yield growth yan et al 2019 moreover it has been found that water saving irrigation promoted the rate of n release from straw and increased the efficiency of straw n utilization by the crop chen et al 2022b which explains the higher yields of controlled irrigation treatments compared to flood irrigation treatments it is worth noting that our study on the ch4 emission characteristics of mollisols was carried out during the rice growth period which is the same as the ipcc method still the emission characteristics of mollisols ch4 in the non growth period are unclear however since the paddy water was discharged during the fallow season ch4 emission would be greatly limited in addition multi year straw incorporation increased soil carbon storage which would offset the positive impact of ch4 emission torres alvarado and fernández 2013 yuan et al 2020 for example in our experiment the doc contents of c5 and f5 were 22 2 and 1 3 higher than those of c1 and f1 respectively fig 4 since straw contributed some fertility for soil less chemical fertilizers will be needed to maintain soil fertility which can lower the indirect ch4 emissions brought on by fertilizer li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 finally it should be noted that in this study controlled irrigation resulted in a 79 7 decrease in ch4 emissions under rice straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years this finding suggests that controlled irrigation has great potential to reduce ch4 emission in mollisols under multi year straw incorporation the putative mechanism underlying the controlled irrigation s inhibitory impact on ch4 emission during a prolonged period of straw incorporation must thus be further investigated 5 conclusions straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased the contents of mbc and doc in mollisols which promoted ch4 emission however in this circumstance lower ch4 emissions were obtained under controlled irrigation due to two aspects on the one hand doc content was positive correlated with ch4 emissions with controlled irrigation exhibiting a lower doc content than flooded irrigation on the other hand under controlled irrigation methanotrophs were more abundant than methanogens while the abundance of methanogens was higher under flooded irrigation our study suggested that controlled irrigation has a superior potential for reducing ch4 emissions and increasing yield under multi year straw incorporation in

9084,methane ch4 as a important source of greenhouse gases from paddy ecosystem was overestimated under multi year straw incorporation however how ch4 can be affected by multi year straw incorporation under different water saving techniques is little known in this study the effects of straw incorporation years and irrigation regime on ch4 emission and its potential mechanism in mollisols were investigated by conducting a multi year in situ experiment the following 4 treatments were included controlled irrigation straw incorporation for 1 year c1 controlled irrigation straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years c5 flooded irrigation straw incorporation for 1 year f1 and flooded irrigation straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years f5 methane fluxes soil microbial biomass carbon mbc microbial biomass nitrogen mbn dissolved organic carbon doc the relative abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs were determined the results showed that straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased nh4 n no3 n doc mbc which led a increased in rice yield by 4 42 5 84 compared with 1 year straw incorporation controlled irrigation significantly reduced ch4 emission in mollisols by 70 2 79 7 compared with flooded irrigation and this reduction was more obvious under 5 year straw incorporation the consequence of decreased ch4 emission was mainly affect by the decrease in doc content another key reason of decreasing ch4 emissions under controlled irrigation was the relative abundance difference between methanogens and methanogens which decreased from 266 7 to 19 3 the present study provides a further detailed understanding of the ch4 emission mechanism for straw and irrigation management in mollisols keywords mollisols methane emission straw incorporation water saving irrigation methanogens methanotrophs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the concentration of ch4 in the atmosphere has increased rapidly at an annual rate of 1 1 guo and zhou 2007 as the second largest greenhouse gas ghg in the atmosphere its ability to capture heat is more than 25 times that of co2 and its contribution to global warming accounts for about one quarter of the total ghg ipcc 2013 since pre industrial times the temperature rise caused by ch4 has been as high as 0 5 c second only to co2 in may 2021 the global methane assessment report published jointly by the climate and clean air coalition and the united nations environment programme noted that 40 of anthropogenic ch4 emissions came from agriculture including livestock and rice cultivation unep 2021 as an essential source of atmospheric ch4 paddy fields emitted 10 20 of global ch4 emissions kirschke et al 2013 therefore mitigating ch4 emissions from paddy rice cultivation is a significant direction for ghg reduction currently about 154 million hectares of land are specially used for rice cultivation in the world while china a major rice producer accounts for 25 8 of the grain planting area fao 2016 for a long time flooded irrigation has been practiced in most paddy fields in china huang et al 2022 water saving irrigation was given more and more attention as a result of the traditional flooded irrigation s high water consumption and the uneven supply and demand of agricultural water yao et al 2012 ye et al 2013 different water saving irrigation practices such as shallow wet irrigation controlled irrigation intermittent irrigation and rain gathering irrigation have been widely implemented to assure food security and address the issue of diminishing accessible water resources du et al 2015 xu et al 2015 indeed water saving irrigation typically reduces irrigation water by 60 compared to flooded irrigation without affecting or even increasing rice yield xu et al 2015 water saving irrigation practices usually included one or more drainage periods which effectively inhibited the development of soil reduction conditions and significantly reduced ch4 emissions related studies have found that mid season drainage reduced 35 70 of ch4 emissions in paddy fields xu et al 2015 zou et al 2005 the improvement of paddy water management practice has achieved the effect of saving water and reducing ch4 emissions the expansion of rice planting area leads to more straw production every year according to the data released by the second national pollution source census report china s crop straw production in 2017 was 805 million tons with great processing demand mee 2020 straw incorporation a vital agricultural practice offers positive environmental and economic advantages under the policy prohibiting burning straw yin et al 2018 zou et al 2005 straw is abundant in nitrogen phosphorus and potassium which can be used as organic fertilizer to improve soil fertility and crop yield xu et al 2019 however straw incorporation also increased soil organic carbon content which provided additional substrate sources for methanogens and promoted ch4 emission yang et al 2022 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc used the straw application rate as the primary indicator to estimate the impact of straw incorporation on regional and global ch4 emissions jiang et al 2019 the ipcc method estimated that the average ch4 emission caused by straw incorporation increased by 193 jiang et al 2019 however this method assumes that straw incorporation years will not affect ch4 emission yan et al 2005 studies have shown that under the condition of long term straw incorporation the ipcc report overestimated the ch4 emission caused by straw incorporation by about 91 yang et al 2022 their results showed that with the extension of straw incorporation years straw improved the growth of methanotrophs stimulated by soil aeration and increased the ch4 oxidation potential so far limited evidence supports that water saving irrigation still contributes to reducing ch4 emissions under multi year straw incorporation from paddy fields therefore we conducted a long term in situ experiment to study the effects of controlled irrigation and flooded irrigation on ch4 emission and ch4 related microorganisms under different straw incorporation years aiming to clarify the potential mechanism of the effect of water saving practice on ch4 emission multi year straw incorporation in mollisols and to provide a reliable water management for mitigating ch4 emission in rice ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was performed at the state key station for

days after transplanting p 0 05 compared with other treatments the ch4 fluxes of all treatments began to decrease after applying fertilizer in booting stage at the end of milk stage the ch4 flux of each treatment was stable at a low level until the end of the rice growth period irrigation regime straw incorporation year and interaction between them significantly affected the mean ch4 fluxes p 0

irrigation the cumulative ch4 emission of controlled irrigation significantly decreased by 70 2 79 7 p 0 05 compared with c1 and f1 the cumulative ch4 emissions of c5 and f5 significantly increased by

relatively high the average content of nh4 n and no3 n in c1 were 38 5 and 13 6 higher than that in f1 and those in c5 were 75 8 and 7 3 higher than that in f5 respectively p 0 05 straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased the mbc content with an average increase of 22 3 in c5 compared to c1 and an average increase of 40 6 in f5 compared to f1 likewise straw incorporation increased mbn content for 5 consecutive years the average mbn content of f5 was 20 6 higher than that of f1 and that of c5 was 18 0 higher than that of c1 p 0 05 pearson correlation analysis showed that ch4 emission was significantly and positively correlated with soil doc and mbc table 4 3 3 abundance changes of methanogens and methanotrophs according to fig 6 the relative abundance of methanotrophs and methanogens were significantly affected by irrigation regime and straw incorporation year p 0 05 compared with 1 year straw incorporation the relative abundance of methanotrophs of controlled irrigation and flooded irrigation with rice straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased by 52 2 and 22 6 respectively while the relative abundance of methanogens increased by 367 7 and 95 2 accordingly the relative abundance of methanotrophs among all treatments was higher than that of methanogens except f5 under controlled irrigation the difference between the relative abundance of methanotrophs and methanogens decreased from 266 7 to 19 3 whereas in f5 the relative abundance of methanogens was significantly higher than methanotrophs by 33 p 0 05 methanosaeta and methanosarcina were the two most essential methanogens at the genus level accounting for 64 96 and 93 of c5 f1 and f5 in c1 we only found methanosaeta a methanogen after 5 year straw incorporation two new methanogens methanosarcina and methanomassiliicoccus were added to the controlled irrigation treatments fig 7 in contrast the methanogens community composition was reduced in the flooded irrigation in the observed methanotroph community the main methanotrophs were methylibium and methylosinus and the sum of their relative abundance accounted for 71 67 75 and 69 of c1 c5 f1 and f5 after straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years the number of methanotroph communities in c5 and f5 decreased fig 8 3 4 grain yield the yield of each treatment was shown in fig 9 which decreases in the following order c5 c1 f5 f1 under the same straw incorporation year the yield of controlled irrigation was higher c1 was 11 49 higher than f1 and c5 was 9 99 higher than f5 p 0 05 in the same irrigation regime the rice yield of straw incorporation in 5 years was higher c5 was 4 42 higher than c1 and f5 was 5 84 higher than f1 p 0 05 4 discussion mollisols have drawn researchers attention since they are a limited resource its high soil organic matter content and carbon sink density are crucial for reducing climate change and global carbon emissions chen et al 2022a li et al 2018 we conducted a multi year in situ experiment to study the effects of different irrigation regimes and straw incorporation years on ch4 emission in mollisols we found that controlled irrigation as a water saving irrigation method significantly reduced ch4 emissions this was mainly due to the controlled irrigation water management pattern after the rice re greening period table 3 cai et al 2003 carlson et al 2017 chen et al 2019a the paddy field environment under controlled irrigation gradually tended to be aerobic which provided a better living environment for methanotrophs and inhibited the activity of methanogens in the soil chen et al 2019b xu et al 2012 thereby reducing the production of ch4 on the contrary long term flooded paddy fields created a good anaerobic environment which was essential for the growth of methanogens honma et al 2016 buendia et al 1997 there have been reports of significant increases in ch4 emission in the presence of increased soil moisture hou et al 2016 song et al 2021 increased soil moisture hindered oxygen exchange resulting in anaerobic soil conditions that promoted the activity of methanogens uprety et al 2011 by reducing the soil oxidation zone the activity of methanotrophs was reduced patel et al 2021 in addition the role of straw incorporation cannot be ignored qin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the addition of exogenous c via straw incorporation tends to enhance the soil s c n ratio which significantly impacts changes in the composition of the soil s microbial community accounting for 18 28 of the overall change impact wang et al 2018b the greater doc content of f5 and c5 in our studies also proved that multi year straw incorporation supplied more c substrate furthermore the average doc content of c5 increased by 22 2 over c1 whereas f5 only increased by 1 3 over f1 this demonstrated that while the soil doc stability was greater under the flooded irrigation the straw decomposed more rapidly under the controlled irrigation trinh et al 2018 straw incorporation applied in soil without straw incorporation history significantly promoted the growth of soil methanogens and ch4 emissions shrestha et al 2011 however the addition of rice straw usually lasts for years and the roles of methanogens and methanotrophs in regulating ch4 emission under long term straw incorporation were not well recognized in our study methanosacta and methanosarcina were the predominant methanogen genera in all treatments while methylibium and methylosinus were the predominant methanotroph genera observed the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs in mollisols increased significantly under straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years especially in the control irrigation treatments this was because the controlled irrigation s aerobic conditions enabled the straw to decompose more quickly than it would have under flooded irrigation chen et al 2018 and more reaction substrates stimulated the activity of microorganisms and nitrogen mineralization yang et al 2022 in addition multi year straw incorporation boosted soil microbial activity as evidenced by the higher average contents of mbc and mbn in the c5 and f5 treatments wu et al 2020 yang et al 2022 moreover a higher mbc content was also a more significant and important influencing factor of ch4 emission according to the correlation analysis table 3 the aerobic environment of controlled irrigation however significantly increased the abundance of methanotrophs even though both the relative abundance of microorganisms in c5 and f5 increased we speculated that the difference in relative abundance between the two microorganisms was an essential reason for the marginally higher ch4 emission of c5 than c1 jiang et al 2019 yang et al 2022 the significant effect of straw incorporation year and irrigation regime on rice yield may be related to the n transformation in the soil when the fertilizer was broadcasted into the fields in this experiment some of the nitrogen was lost via the ammonia volatilization pathway related research revealed that compared to paddy fields with flooded irrigation ammonia volatilization losses from paddy fields with controlled irrigation were less responsive to surface ammonium nitrogen content the wet dry cycle under controlled irrigation resulted in lower ammonia volatilization losses during most growth stages of rice this implied that controlled irrigation retained more nitrogen in the soil which is advantageous for increasing yield xu et al 2012 in addition straw incorporation tends to increase the c n ratio in the soil the higher c content in the soil encouraged n mineralization to maintain a stable c n ratio which on the other hand promoted yield growth yan et al 2019 moreover it has been found that water saving irrigation promoted the rate of n release from straw and increased the efficiency of straw n utilization by the crop chen et al 2022b which explains the higher yields of controlled irrigation treatments compared to flood irrigation treatments it is worth noting that our study on the ch4 emission characteristics of mollisols was carried out during the rice growth period which is the same as the ipcc method still the emission characteristics of mollisols ch4 in the non growth period are unclear however since the paddy water was discharged during the fallow season ch4 emission would be greatly limited in addition multi year straw incorporation increased soil carbon storage which would offset the positive impact of ch4 emission torres alvarado and fernández 2013 yuan et al 2020 for example in our experiment the doc contents of c5 and f5 were 22 2 and 1 3 higher than those of c1 and f1 respectively fig 4 since straw contributed some fertility for soil less chemical fertilizers will be needed to maintain soil fertility which can lower the indirect ch4 emissions brought on by fertilizer li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 finally it should be noted that in this study controlled irrigation resulted in a 79 7 decrease in ch4 emissions under rice straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years this finding suggests that controlled irrigation has great potential to reduce ch4 emission in mollisols under multi year straw incorporation the putative mechanism underlying the controlled irrigation s inhibitory impact on ch4 emission during a prolonged period of straw incorporation must thus be further investigated 5 conclusions straw incorporation for 5 consecutive years increased the contents of mbc and doc in mollisols which promoted ch4 emission however in this circumstance lower ch4 emissions were obtained under controlled irrigation due to two aspects on the one hand doc content was positive correlated with ch4 emissions with controlled irrigation exhibiting a lower doc content than flooded irrigation on the other hand under controlled irrigation methanotrophs were more abundant than methanogens while the abundance of methanogens was higher under flooded irrigation our study suggested that controlled irrigation has a superior potential for reducing ch4 emissions and increasing yield under multi year straw incorporation in mollisols than flooded irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
