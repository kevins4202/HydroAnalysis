as the percentage of experimental values of a certain variable that lies within the simulation band given by a simulation tolerance established by the user operator was established to test the capability of the model as objectively as possible regarding the full scale digester fed with thermally pretreated mixed sludge success rates of 65 for biogas production and 60 100 for other variables were achieved regarding the full scale digester in codigestion mode the model had a success rate of approximately 60 for predicting the biogas flow for the whole evaluation period while for the other variables values between 70 and 100 were attained the lowest success rates were observed for the volatile fatty acid vfa concentration in the digestate despite the lack of available data and the number of assumptions that had to be made the model was demonstrated to be capable of reproducing the behavior of the full scale reactors a proper up to date calibrated and validated model can aid in

the loading of two or more substrates of different characteristics and or origin in the same anaerobic reactor has also been implemented in wrrfs wrrfs are in an advantageous position regarding the implementation of codigestion because including additional wastes may require plant expansion but are far from requiring the level of investment that a new project would entail additionally many of the existing facilities were originally oversized to cope with the increasing production of sewage sludge so there is unused biomethanation capacity available for other residues labatut et al 2011 furthermore it has been demonstrated that in a wwtp the energy balance is clearly improved by performing codigestion mattioli et al 2017 modeling is a powerful tool for increasing the understanding of a process with a reduced number of experiments and can help in the decision making process in a wrrf however modeling still has not penetrated the wastewater treatment sector as much as one would have expected in part this can be explained by the overselling of expectations when using modeling which has led to operators being frequently disappointed by the outcomes of model applications the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 has been used to model full scale anaerobic digesters in wwtps under dynamic conditions using aquasim software for the treatment of mixed sewage sludge ozgun 2018 ozkan yucel and gökçay 2010 and only primary sludge ersahin 2018 the model has also been used to create steady state simulations of the treatment mixed sludge shang et al 2005 the adm1 was used to predict the pilot scale anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated sludge and mixed sewage sludge souza et al 2013 batstone et al 2009 evaluated the identifiability of key parameters of the adm1 by using data from two full scale anaerobic digesters treating thermally hydrolyzed was thermally hydrolyzed was is normally mixed with primary sludge prior to anaerobic digestion and to the best of our knowledge no studies have applied the adm1 model in a full scale plant under these conditions on the other hand the increasing presence of acod in wrrfs has awakened interest in modifying or even developing models to reproduce the acod process overall models based on the adm1 model show the most interesting results for applications in wrrf xie et al 2016 montecchio et al 2019 used the original adm1 for the acod of fw and with was at the lab scale the first study in which the differences between sewage sludge and other solid wastes were taken into account to develop a new approach for acod modeling was presented by zaher et al 2009 in the so called giscod model in that study a generalized interface to combine different waste streams was developed and implemented in the adm1 context this approach also includes a conversion node where practical experimental measurements are converted into an input vector for adm1 this modeling approach was calibrated at the lab scale with data from the codigestion of kitchen waste and manure arnell et al 2016 used the giscod approach with different cosubstrates in the framework of benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 the giscod model was used by nordlander et al 2017 to evaluate a full scale biogas plant for the acod of ofmsw grease trap waste and ley crop silage to the best of our knowledge the first acod model tested in a full scale plant other modeling approaches not based on the adm1 model have also been proposed for the acod of sewage sludge fitamo et al 2016 to obtain valuable information from models the models need to be properly implemented and to be calibrated and validated with real data donoso bravo et al 2011a despite the advantages in the technical literature regarding modeling of the ad process we have identified a lack of objective criteria to determine the capacity of models to reproduce digester behavior with a certain reliability the aim of this study is to foster the application of modeling in real and modern wrrfs as well as to improve the implementation approach the article s novelty lies in proposing practical applications and harnessing the options of a mathematical model of the anaerobic digestion process based on the adm1 model in a wrrf where both thermal hydrolysis of waste activated sludge and codigestion of mixed sewage sludge with industrial wastewater are performed in order to do so the capability of the adm1 model to reproduce data from full scale digesters operated in a wrrf was tested furthermore the potential uses of the model in a wrrf are also described with particular relevance for plant engineers operators 2 material and methods 2 1 full scale digester data two full scale digesters operating in mono and codigestion mode were considered for the model evaluation these digesters have a total volume of 13 600 m3 and working volume of 12 600 m3 and were operated in parallel at the wrrf biofactoría santiago chile for the monodigestion assessment data from a digester working under mesophilic conditions 37 1 0 7 c for a period of 6 months of operation were used for the model assessment for the whole period the digester was fed with hydrolyzed mixed sludge hms which was composed of thermally hydrolyzed was thermally pretreated at 6 bars and 170 c for 15 20 min in a cambi unit mixed with primary sludge ps the daily measured hms data at the plant comprised the inlet flow and the volatile suspended solid vss content in the case of the thermally hydrolyzed was soluble cod was also recorded for the evaluation period only monthly measurements of total cod were carried out in the lab the macromolecular content of the hms was measured once daily data on the outlet biogas flow and composition ch4 and co2 and the digestate characteristics in terms of soluble cod scod total ammonia nitrogen tan volatile fatty acid vfa content volatile solid vs content and ph were used to test the capability of the model the characteristics of the hms fed to the full scale digester throughout the model evaluation period are presented in table 1 in volumetric terms the hms was composed of 75 of ps and 25 thermally hydrolyzed was however the gap in proportion decreases when considering the ts content of the hms the most noticeable difference compared to conventional mixed sewage sludge is the high fraction of soluble cod with respect to the total cod which was above 60 because of cell breakdown as a result of the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment the vfa and tan contents were also higher than those of conventional mixed sludge which is also an effect of the thermal pretreatment process donoso bravo et al 2011b in regard to the parameters from the bmp test the hydrolytic constant k h and inert fraction remained stable throughout the model evaluation period for the codigestion assessment data from a full scale digester working under mesophilic conditions 35 5 0 7 c for a period of 8 months of operation were used for the model performance assessment the digester was fed with mixed sewage sludge mss which was composed of a mix of ps and was during the first 100 d of operation after that period beverage wastewater bw was added as a cosubstrate in discontinuous fashion for the following 100 d in the last stage of the operation of the digester dairy whey dw was incorporated into the cosubstrate pool the daily measured data on the mss generated at the plant comprised the inlet flow and volatile solid content vss in the case of the cosubstrates soluble cod was also recorded for the evaluation period only monthly measurements of total cod were carried out in the lab the macromolecular content carbohydrates lipids and proteins of the substrates and cosubstrates was measured once the biogas flow and composition ch4 and co2 from the biogas outlet and soluble cod tan vfa vss and ph from the digestate were used to test the capability of the model to predict the behavior of the digester the characteristics of the substrate and cosubstrates fed to the full scale digester throughout the model evaluation period are presented in table 2 the variation in the characteristics of the mss substrate was due to the different proportions of ps 78 15 as ts and was 22 13 as ts that were mixed every day in the plant bw showed a large variability in the solid content which shows that the wastewater generated in the beverage industry is not constant and is subjected to significant operational variation due to the water management process dw showed more stable properties than bw both cosubstrates possessed a high soluble organic matter content in regard to the parameters from the bmp test the hydrolytic constant and the inert fraction of mss remained stable as did the inert fraction of the cosubstrates 2 2 model application the adm1 as presented by batstone et al 2002 with the modifications suggested by rosen and jeppsson 2006 was implemented the disintegration reaction was eliminated as suggested by batstone et al 2015 due to all the identification and interdependency disadvantages of the two hydrolysis disintegration two step approach therefore in this new approach the composite concentration xc is set to zero so that the particulate material will enter the hydrolysis reaction directly partitioned as carbohydrates proteins and lipids in the case of the codigestion process a general diagram of the model approach is presented in fig 1 the model is implemented to process the sewage sludge and the cosubstrate by using two separate mass balances for the particulate compounds of each of them then the soluble products of the hydrolysis of each fraction are joined in the mass balance for the soluble compounds in this particular case the cosubstrates beverage and dairy wastewater had mostly soluble fraction so they enter directly in the soluble compound mass balance however the model must be generic and capable of processing other type of cosubstrate such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw where the particulate organic fraction makes up the biggest proportion the model was solved in matlab r2018b while the inlet and outlet data were loaded from an excel spreadsheet the parameters that were not calibrated by using the measured data were assigned values consistent with those suggested in the adm1 report 2 2 1 inlet characterization reliable characterization of the inlet has been one of the main challenges in the application of adm1 based models in wwtps to complete the inlet characterization of the substrate required by the model some assumptions had to be made to complete the required inlet vectors and adapt some of the real measured variables at the plant for incorporation in the model it is worth noting that in this study almost all the information that is measured daily at the plant was used to assess the model behavior for the monodigestion digester where hydrolyzed mixed sludge hms was used as the substrate the assumptions were as follows 1 the volatile solid content vs of the primary sludge was equal to its volatile suspended solid content vss the latter was the value measured daily at the wwtp 2 according to the characterization of the hms table 1 a vs cod ratio of 0 5 was established and then kept constant during the whole evaluation period it is worth noting that the model works on a cod basis 3 the macromolecular composition of the hms in terms of proteins lipids and carbohydrates was kept constant during the whole operation period at 45 35 and 20 respectively the same composition was applied for the particulate matter and the soluble fraction of the inlet cod 4 the hydrolysis constant k h was assumed to be the same for proteins carbohydrates and lipids for the codigestion digester where mixed sewage sludge mss was used as the substrate the assumptions related to the substrate were as follows 1 the volatile solid vs content of the mss was equal to its volatile suspended solid content vss 2 according to the characterization of the mss table 2 a vs cod ratio of 0 48 was established and then kept constant during the whole evaluation period 3 according to the characterization of the mss the soluble fraction of the cod represented on average 2 of the total cod 4 the soluble fraction of the cod was assumed to be the sum of the main vfas detected namely acetic propionic butyric and valeric acid which were equally distributed in the feed 5 the macromolecular composition in terms of carbohydrates lipids and proteins was kept constant during the whole operation period at 41 31 and 28 respectively this composition was considered to be the same for the particulate and soluble fractions of the inlet cod 6 the hydrolysis constant k h was assumed to be the same for proteins carbohydrates and lipids on the other hand the assumptions related to the cosubstrates were as follows 1 according to table 2 the particulate cod fraction calculated as the difference between total and soluble cod is 13 and 25 for bw and dw respectively according to our experience in the lab we think that fraction is above all colloidal material that did not pass through the filter during the soluble cod analysis therefore for the model application the total cod was assumed to be equal to the soluble cod 2 beverage wastewater bw was assumed to be composed of only carbohydrates and its inert fraction was zero this was demonstrated by the bmp test 3 dairy wastewater dw was composed of 80 carbohydrates and 20 lipids 4 no vfas were present in the cosubstrates bmp tests of the substrates and cosubstrates were performed throughout the evaluation period the biogas and methane contents were monitored throughout the test by a plug syringe and a naoh solution displacement device respectively the bmp test was used to obtain the hydrolytic coefficient kh for the substrates and the biodegradable fraction fd for the substrates and cosubstrates from the first order equation for parameters estimation matlab r2018b and single least squares criteria between simulated and experimental data were used for the minimization procedure both parameters were incorporated into the input data vector required by the model souza et al 2013 calibrated the three hydrolytic coefficients and the disintegration constant from the original adm1 model using the bmp test however obtaining 4 different parameters from an accumulated biogas production rate could be risky due to overparameterization and identification issues a table with a description of how the inlet vector was estimated for each substrate and cosubstrate can be found in supplementary material 2 2 2 parameter estimation calibration and validation part of the data from the full scale digesters was used for model calibration and another part was used for model validation the inlet conditions regarding the anions cations and inorganic carbon some model parameters such as the inorganic methane carbon yield c ch4 and the pipe resistance coefficient k p and a couple of experimental factors used to convert the results of routine experimental lab analysis of the digestate into useful model outputs such as vss and vfa were fitted during the calibration period an iterative manual calibration procedure was carried out in matlab focusing on all the variables from the biogas and the digestate see tables 4 and 6 different indicators with varying degrees of statistical basis can be chosen and estimated to assess the performance of the model during the calibration and validation period nordlander et al 2017 identified the exactly matched values between the experimental and simulated results however for the purpose of this study a more direct approach was chosen the performance of the calibration as well the validation was determined by establishing the simulation success rate as the number of experimental values that lies within a certain band of the simulation with a certain tolerance range carrera chapela et al 2016 donoso bravo et al 2018 adding a prediction band may help to make the application of this model more useful for plant operators and engineers because it provides a straightforward way of evaluating model success 2 3 analytical methods cod was measured by spectrophotometry and total and volatile solids were measured by a gravimetric method volatile fatty acids vfas were measured by the titration method with a result expressed as equivalent of acetic acid ph and total ammonium nitrogen tan were measured by selective electrodes all these measurements were carried out according to apha 2012 the protein content was calculated based on the assumption that the protein contained 16 w w nitrogen therefore the difference between the tkn and tan was multiplied by a factor of 6 25 to estimate the protein content lipids were measured by soxhlet extraction carbohydrate content was estimated based on the difference between the total cod and the specific cod contribution of lipids and proteins the estimated cod of proteins and lipids was 1 44 and 2 69 gcod gvs 1 respectively donoso bravo et al 2011c 3 results and discussion 3 1 full scale monodigester fed with hms fig 2 shows the inlet conditions in terms of the olr and hrt of the full scale digester during the evaluation period the data from day 1 to day 66 were used for parameter fitting model calibration during this period the organic loading rate olr was kept between 4 and 6 kgcod m 3 d 1 with a couple of exceptional olr drops below 3 kgcod m 3 d 1 the hydraulic retention time hrt increased steadily from 15 d to values above 20 d during the calibration period from day 67 to day 165 validation period the olr was kept between 5 and 6 5 kgcod m 3 d 1 whereas the hrt was kept below 20 d the results of the parameter fitting during the calibration period are presented in table 3 four missing inlet conditions were adjusted during the calibration period to provide estimated values since these parameters are not measured at the wrrf the bmp test data provided an estimation of the inert fraction of the particulate organic matter which limits biogas production however the inert fraction of the soluble fraction cannot be estimated from the bmp test and was thus estimated from the data from the full scale digester it was estimated that 5 of the soluble fraction of the substrate was inert which as expected was lower than the value for the particulate fraction table 2 only two parameters c ch4 and k p directly associated with the model were calibrated the first parameter as suggested by rosen and jeppsson 2006 is underestimated in the original adm1 parameter list and must be adjusted on a case by case basis likewise the k p parameter is related to the physical properties of the digester and its biogas line and must be adjusted on a case by case basis finally the two experimental conversion factors for vfa and vss of the digestate had to be determined to be able to use these measured output variables in the model evaluation the model simulations depicted in a prediction band with a tolerance of 10 for the calibration and validation periods with the gas and liquid variables can be seen in fig 3 visually one can see that the model captured the variation in the experimental data for both the biogas flow and the biogas composition a similar agreement can be observed for the variables measured in the liquid phase or digestate because the tolerance range is defined by the user operator the model performance based on the success rate is assessed for three different tolerance ranges of 5 10 and 20 for both the calibration and validation periods table 4 it is worth recalling that during the validation period none of the model parameters adjusted in the calibration period were modified as table 4 shows the success of the model improves as the tolerance increases because the prediction band is widened considering the 10 tolerance case the model has a clear capacity to properly generalize the behavior of the digester fed with hms except for the vfa in the digestate all the variables were reproduced by the model with above 50 success the disagreement can be explained by the experimental method used to estimate the total vfa concentration which is a titration based method that lumps together in a rough fashion the effects of all the vfas present in the digestate in this particular case the same error tolerance either 5 10 or 20 was used for all the variables however a specific error tolerance can be chosen for each measured variable depending on the estimated error of measurement or for any other practical reason 3 2 full scale digester in codigestion mode fig 4 shows the inlet conditions applied to the full scale digester during the 9 month operation evaluation period from day 1 59 the mono digestion of mss took place during the first half of this period the olr applied to the digester was approximately 3 kgcod m 3 d 1 at an hrt of 28 d on average in the second part of the monodigestion operation there was a significant drop in the olr to values below 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 which was due to a decrease in the inlet flow of mss which led to a rise in the hrt as well the addition of cosubstrate bw began on day 60 and the rate of addition was kept below 5 red line of the total olr applied yellow line in the reactor during this period the olr rose steadily to values of approximately 3 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 while a slight decreasing trend in the hrt occurred from day 159 on dw was incorporated into the cosubstrate line and the fraction of olr pertaining to the cosubstrates increased to values close to 24 of the olr on some days the highest olr values were attained during this period with peaks well above 4 kgcod m 3 d 1 similar to the second period the hrt decreased steadily throughout this operation phase in general greater variability in the curves for olr and hrt was observed after the addition of this second cosubstrate overall the inlet conditions to which the digester was subjected were quite variable therefore they are ideal for testing a model of the digester outputs similar variable behavior has been reported in full scale anaerobic codigestion plants nordlander et al 2017 the results of the parameter fitting during the calibration period are presented in table 5 the same parameters estimated in table 3 were also estimated for the codigestion digester the inert fraction of the soluble fraction was estimated to be 23 of the soluble content of the substrate which as expected was lower than the particulate fraction table 3 the model performance during the calibration and validation periods with an error tolerance band of 10 with the gas and liquid digestate variables can be seen in fig 5 visually one can see that the model captured the high variation of the experimental data during the entire evaluation period for both the biogas flow and biogas composition the incorporation of cosubstrate especially from 170 d on entailed a significant increase in biogas production but at the same time sharper variations in the daily biogas production which were captured by the model similar behaviors have been observed in the codigestion of sewage sludge with ofmsw at full scale mattioli et al 2017 these variations are caused by the fact that the cosubstrates are added discontinuously as freight trucks arrive at the wrrf the addition of the second cosubstrate also had an impact on the ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas which were overall also well represented by the model the variations in the liquid phase parameters due to the addition of the cosubstrate were less significant than those observed in the gas phase the values for ph and vss fell within the simulation band the vfa cod and total ammonia steadily increased after the addition of the second cosubstrate which was partially reproduced by the model this result is explained by the lack of characterization of these new inlet feeds that we know may change over time in our case due to the lack of data we assumed that the macromolecular composition and nitrogen content of the cosubstrates were constant on the other hand the rise in vfa concentration can be related to the accumulation of vfa during the storage of the cosubstrates due to warmer outdoor conditions the assessment of the model performance for the three different tolerance ranges of 5 10 and 20 and the three digester operation periods calibration validation 1 and validation 2 is shown in table 6 for all of the error tolerance values the capacity of the model was maintained at an appropriate level from calibration to validation 1 where even better results were attained for biogas soluble cod and vfas this result shows that the model can be properly generalized for conditions where a low fraction of cosubstrates are added in the following period validation 2 the capability of the model worsened compared to that in the previous period drops in biogas co2 and above all vfas and tan were observed this result can be directly related to the scarcity of inlet measurements since only the soluble cod was measured this relationship suggests that by adding couple more measurements such as tan and vfa into the daily experimental routine at the plant a more accurate model that represents the entire digester operation can be obtained 3 3 how can the model be used in the wwtp relying on a model to properly describe a process may be beneficial in different aspects as long as the specific goals and model limitations are well understood cook et al 2017 developed a stability indicator tool for acod based on the adm1 that compares the results of the simulation and real measured values the digester stability is assessed by determining the digester stability score from that comparison in the context of the present study there are some other issues that can be addressed by using this type of model application now we will describe potential applications of the model as a tool to aid in the decision making procedure 3 3 1 enhancing resilience by continuous process status follow up the continuous follow up or supervision of digester data with the model can have a direct impact on plant operation resilience fig 6 shows the benefit of undertaking real time process supervision with the model when the model properly predicts the behavior of a digester it is functioning as desired however when the model fails and its results diverge from the data generated in the plant valuable information can also be drawn when such a divergence takes place one can tell that there is an anomaly that may be related to the model or the process model issue if the problem lies in the model itself it may lead to a model parameter adjustment that may imply that some biological changes are taking place in the reactor on the other hand if the issue is related to the data data issue one may check the status of a specific sensor or whether an analytical method is being well performed however it is crucial to keep in mind that any trustworthy and reliable exploitation of this model must be accompanied by a continuous model updating with real data on a periodic basis as well as a complete understanding of the limitations of the tool 3 3 2 inlet condition determination reverse engineering as has been pointed out in general the traditional substrate and cosubstrate characterization carried out in a wrrf is insufficient to fully characterize the model inlet conditions this missing information and the assumptions that need to be established to complete the inlet information will inevitably increase the uncertainty of the model output and consequently harm the reliability of the model therefore one of the possible model applications could be the estimation of inlet conditions from a simulation of the model output variables that are measured this approach has been suggested by aichinger et al 2015 where the acod of thermally pretreated sludge and ofmsw was assessed in lab scale conditions was modeled by the platform sumo simulator in the case of the digester data used in this study the performance of the model can be enhanced by changing the inlet total nitrogen which we maintained constant due to a lack of information for instance by changing the tan inlet concentration from 1 0 to 1 5 g l 1 on day 159 and then to 2 75 g l 1 between days 210 and 221 the model performance improved from an 8 78 success rate therefore although tan is not measured at the plant the reverse engineering application of the model may suggest that there is an important addition of nitrogen to the digester coming from the cosubstrates which may indicate that the protein content rose over time it is interesting to note that not only the simulated tan concentration improved but also other parameters such as vfa from 17 6 to 29 and co2 from 66 to 80 which shows the complexity of the model and how the variables are interconnected in the model structure 3 3 3 knowledge of the general state of the unmeasured variables when the model is performing well in other words representing the measured output variables of a digester with a certain level of success one can expect that the rest of the model variables which are not measured and will probably never be can be tracked through the model as well for instance the evolution of the microbial populations or intermediate compounds during the ad process may be supervised and monitored 3 3 4 cosubstrate selection tool along with bmp tests and cosubstrate characterization which give a first screening of the best cosubstrates to be codigested in a wrrf the model can be used to explore the impact of the addition of a new cosubstrate to digesters without disturbing the real system and as the results here have demonstrated with highly reliable results therefore if cosubstrate characterization is available one may predict of the digester operation outcome under different possible scenarios such as different cosubstrate proportions feeding regimes overloads or famine by employing the model figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material show some possible scenarios that can be simulated with the model 3 3 5 cosubstrate addition planning a large portion of the studies found claim the selection of an optimum mix of substrates and cosubstrates as one of the main reasons to use a model in acod however according to plant operators the exact proportion of the substrates fed to a digester is not something that can be managed or controlled easily in the field operators must treat what they receive and there is little or no time or resources to screen the cosubstrates as well as a lack of space for storage and or mixing processes therefore the main advantages of having a model would be the ability to predict the outcome of a process before adding certain types and amounts of substrates to forecast the influence of certain mixing conditions or in other words to help with the decision making process one of the potential applications of the model is as a planning tool for the assessment of the timing of the addition of cosubstrates according to plant operators and managers it is generally desired to have a constant quantity of biogas accumulated in the gas meter so that electrical and thermal energy is produced in a constant fashion which enables the planning of energy exploitation and sale to the grid fig s3 in the supplementary material shows some possible scenarios that can be simulated with the model 4 conclusions a mathematical model based on the adm1 can be implemented in a full scale digester operation to reproduce the anaerobic degradation of hms as well as the anaerobic codigestion of sewage sludge with industrial effluents normal field inlet characterization and reasonable assumptions can be enough to achieve appropriate model behavior for both cases however the macromolecular composition of the substrates and cosubstrates should be incorporated every 3 4 months during the calibration procedure only two model parameters were estimated the yield of methane from inorganic carbon c ch4 and the gas pressure factor kp a simulation success rate was proposed to offer a simple and objective criterion to assess the model performance in hms monodigestion success rates of 65 for biogas production and 60 100 for other variables were achieved regarding the full scale digester in codigestion mode the model had a biogas flow prediction success rate of approximately 60 on average for the whole evaluation period while for the other variables values between 70 and 100 were attained in both cases the behavior of some variables in the digestate such as vfa and soluble cod can be improved further however such modifications must be done along with an improvement of the substrate and cosubstrate characterization routine the current model can be used as a tool to aid in the determination of some inlet conditions by reverse engineering to improve the resilience of the process by early possible fault detection and to elucidate the general state of the process likewise the model can be used to manage the timing of cosubstrate addition to keep the production of biogas and energy as stable as possible however it is crucial to keep in mind that the trustworthy and reliable exploitation of the model must be accompanied by continuous model updating with real data on a periodic basis as well as a complete understanding of the limitations of the tool declaration of

the loading of two or more substrates of different characteristics and or origin in the same anaerobic reactor has also been implemented in wrrfs wrrfs are in an advantageous position regarding the implementation of codigestion because including additional wastes may require plant expansion but are far from requiring the level of investment that a new project would entail additionally many of the existing facilities were originally oversized to cope with the increasing production of sewage sludge so there is unused biomethanation capacity available for other residues labatut et al 2011 furthermore it has been demonstrated that in a wwtp the energy balance is clearly improved by performing codigestion mattioli et al 2017 modeling is a powerful tool for increasing the understanding of a process with a reduced number of experiments and can help in the decision making process in a wrrf however modeling still has not penetrated the wastewater treatment sector as much as one would have expected in part this can be explained by the overselling of expectations when using modeling which has led to operators being frequently disappointed by the outcomes of model applications the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 has been used to model full scale anaerobic digesters in wwtps under dynamic conditions using aquasim software for the treatment of mixed sewage sludge ozgun 2018 ozkan yucel and gökçay 2010 and only primary sludge ersahin 2018 the model has also been used to create steady state simulations of the treatment mixed sludge shang et al 2005 the adm1 was used to predict the pilot scale anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated sludge and mixed sewage sludge souza et al 2013 batstone et al 2009 evaluated the identifiability of key parameters of the adm1 by using data from two full scale anaerobic digesters treating thermally hydrolyzed was thermally hydrolyzed was is normally mixed with primary sludge prior to anaerobic digestion and to the best of our knowledge no studies have applied the adm1 model in a full scale plant under these conditions on the other hand the increasing presence of acod in wrrfs has awakened interest in modifying or even developing models to reproduce the acod process overall models based on the adm1 model show the most interesting results for applications in wrrf xie et al 2016 montecchio et al 2019 used the original adm1 for the acod of fw and with was at the lab scale the first study in which the differences between sewage sludge and other solid wastes were taken into account to develop a new approach for acod modeling was presented by zaher et al 2009 in the so called giscod model in that study a generalized interface to combine different waste streams was developed and implemented in the adm1 context this approach also includes a conversion node where practical experimental measurements are converted into an input vector for adm1 this modeling approach was calibrated at the lab scale with data from the codigestion of kitchen waste and manure arnell et al 2016 used the giscod approach with different cosubstrates in the framework of benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 the giscod model was used by nordlander et al 2017 to evaluate a full scale biogas plant for the acod of ofmsw grease trap waste and ley crop silage to the best of our knowledge the first acod model tested in a full scale plant other modeling approaches not based on the adm1 model have also been proposed for the acod of sewage sludge fitamo et al 2016 to obtain valuable information from models the models need to be properly implemented and to be calibrated and validated with real data donoso bravo et al 2011a despite the advantages in the technical literature regarding modeling of the ad process we have identified a lack of objective criteria to determine the capacity of models to reproduce digester behavior with a certain reliability the aim of this study is to foster the application of modeling in real and modern wrrfs as well as to improve the implementation approach the article s novelty lies in proposing practical applications and harnessing the options of a mathematical model of the anaerobic digestion process based on the adm1 model in a wrrf where both thermal hydrolysis of waste activated sludge and codigestion of mixed sewage sludge with industrial wastewater are performed in order to do so the capability of the adm1 model to reproduce data from full scale digesters operated in a wrrf was tested furthermore the potential uses of the model in a wrrf are also described with particular relevance for plant engineers operators 2 material and methods 2 1 full scale digester data two full scale digesters operating in mono and codigestion mode were considered for the model evaluation these digesters have a total volume of 13 600 m3 and working volume of 12 600 m3 and were operated in parallel at the wrrf biofactoría santiago chile for the monodigestion assessment data from a digester working under mesophilic conditions 37 1 0 7 c for a period of 6 months of operation were used for the model assessment for the whole period the digester was fed with hydrolyzed mixed sludge hms which was composed of thermally hydrolyzed was thermally pretreated at 6 bars and 170 c for 15 20 min in a cambi unit mixed with primary sludge ps the daily measured hms data at the plant comprised the inlet flow and the volatile suspended solid vss content in the case of the thermally hydrolyzed was soluble cod was also recorded for the evaluation period only monthly measurements of total cod were carried out in the lab the macromolecular content of the hms was measured once daily data on the outlet biogas flow and composition ch4 and co2 and the digestate characteristics in terms of soluble cod scod total ammonia nitrogen tan volatile fatty acid vfa content volatile solid vs content and ph were used to test the capability of the model the characteristics of the hms fed to the full scale digester throughout the model evaluation period are presented in table 1 in volumetric terms the hms was composed of 75 of ps and 25 thermally hydrolyzed was however the gap in proportion decreases when considering the ts content of the hms the most noticeable difference compared to conventional mixed sewage sludge is the high fraction of soluble cod with respect to the total cod which was above 60 because of cell breakdown as a result of the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment the vfa and tan contents were also higher than those of conventional mixed sludge which is also an effect of the thermal pretreatment process donoso bravo et al 2011b in regard to the parameters from the bmp test the hydrolytic constant k h and inert fraction remained stable throughout the model evaluation period for the codigestion assessment data from a full scale digester working under mesophilic conditions 35 5 0 7 c for a period of 8 months of operation were used for the model performance assessment the digester was fed with mixed sewage sludge mss which was composed of a mix of ps and was during the first 100 d of operation after that period beverage wastewater bw was added as a cosubstrate in discontinuous fashion for the following 100 d in the last stage of the operation of the digester dairy whey dw was incorporated into the cosubstrate pool the daily measured data on the mss generated at the plant comprised the inlet flow and volatile solid content vss in the case of the cosubstrates soluble cod was also recorded for the evaluation period only monthly measurements of total cod were carried out in the lab the macromolecular content carbohydrates lipids and proteins of the substrates and cosubstrates was measured once the biogas flow and composition ch4 and co2 from the biogas outlet and soluble cod tan vfa vss and ph from the digestate were used to test the capability of the model to predict the behavior of the digester the characteristics of the substrate and cosubstrates fed to the full scale digester throughout the model evaluation period are presented in table 2 the variation in the characteristics of the mss substrate was due to the different proportions of ps 78 15 as ts and was 22 13 as ts that were mixed every day in the plant bw showed a large variability in the solid content which shows that the wastewater generated in the beverage industry is not constant and is subjected to significant operational variation due to the water management process dw showed more stable properties than bw both cosubstrates possessed a high soluble organic matter content in regard to the parameters from the bmp test the hydrolytic constant and the inert fraction of mss remained stable as did the inert fraction of the cosubstrates 2 2 model application the adm1 as presented by batstone et al 2002 with the modifications suggested by rosen and jeppsson 2006 was implemented the disintegration reaction was eliminated as suggested by batstone et al 2015 due to all the identification and interdependency disadvantages of the two hydrolysis disintegration two step approach therefore in this new approach the composite concentration xc is set to zero so that the particulate material will enter the hydrolysis reaction directly partitioned as carbohydrates proteins and lipids in the case of the codigestion process a general diagram of the model approach is presented in fig 1 the model is implemented to process the sewage sludge and the cosubstrate by using two separate mass balances for the particulate compounds of each of them then the soluble products of the hydrolysis of each fraction are joined in the mass balance for the soluble compounds in this particular case the cosubstrates beverage and dairy wastewater had mostly soluble fraction so they enter directly in the soluble compound mass balance however the model must be generic and capable of processing other type of cosubstrate such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw where the particulate organic fraction makes up the biggest proportion the model was solved in matlab r2018b while the inlet and outlet data were loaded from an excel spreadsheet the parameters that were not calibrated by using the measured data were assigned values consistent with those suggested in the adm1 report 2 2 1 inlet characterization reliable characterization of the inlet has been one of the main challenges in the application of adm1 based models in wwtps to complete the inlet characterization of the substrate required by the model some assumptions had to be made to complete the required inlet vectors and adapt some of the real measured variables at the plant for incorporation in the model it is worth noting that in this study almost all the information that is measured daily at the plant was used to assess the model behavior for the monodigestion digester where hydrolyzed mixed sludge hms was used as the substrate the assumptions were as follows 1 the volatile solid content vs of the primary sludge was equal to its volatile suspended solid content vss the latter was the value measured daily at the wwtp 2 according to the characterization of the hms table 1 a vs cod ratio of 0 5 was established and then kept constant during the whole evaluation period it is worth noting that the model works on a cod basis 3 the macromolecular composition of the hms in terms of proteins lipids and carbohydrates was kept constant during the whole operation period at 45 35 and 20 respectively the same composition was applied for the particulate matter and the soluble fraction of the inlet cod 4 the hydrolysis constant k h was assumed to be the same for proteins carbohydrates and lipids for the codigestion digester where mixed sewage sludge mss was used as the substrate the assumptions related to the substrate were as follows 1 the volatile solid vs content of the mss was equal to its volatile suspended solid content vss 2 according to the characterization of the mss table 2 a vs cod ratio of 0 48 was established and then kept constant during the whole evaluation period 3 according to the characterization of the mss the soluble fraction of the cod represented on average 2 of the total cod 4 the soluble fraction of the cod was assumed to be the sum of the main vfas detected namely acetic propionic butyric and valeric acid which were equally distributed in the feed 5 the macromolecular composition in terms of carbohydrates lipids and proteins was kept constant during the whole operation period at 41 31 and 28 respectively this composition was considered to be the same for the particulate and soluble fractions of the inlet cod 6 the hydrolysis constant k h was assumed to be the same for proteins carbohydrates and lipids on the other hand the assumptions related to the cosubstrates were as follows 1 according to table 2 the particulate cod fraction calculated as the difference between total and soluble cod is 13 and 25 for bw and dw respectively according to our experience in the lab we think that fraction is above all colloidal material that did not pass through the filter during the soluble cod analysis therefore for the model application the total cod was assumed to be equal to the soluble cod 2 beverage wastewater bw was assumed to be composed of only carbohydrates and its inert fraction was zero this was demonstrated by the bmp test 3 dairy wastewater dw was composed of 80 carbohydrates and 20 lipids 4 no vfas were present in the cosubstrates bmp tests of the substrates and cosubstrates were performed throughout the evaluation period the biogas and methane contents were monitored throughout the test by a plug syringe and a naoh solution displacement device respectively the bmp test was used to obtain the hydrolytic coefficient kh for the substrates and the biodegradable fraction fd for the substrates and cosubstrates from the first order equation for parameters estimation matlab r2018b and single least squares criteria between simulated and experimental data were used for the minimization procedure both parameters were incorporated into the input data vector required by the model souza et al 2013 calibrated the three hydrolytic coefficients and the disintegration constant from the original adm1 model using the bmp test however obtaining 4 different parameters from an accumulated biogas production rate could be risky due to overparameterization and identification issues a table with a description of how the inlet vector was estimated for each substrate and cosubstrate can be found in supplementary material 2 2 2 parameter estimation calibration and validation part of the data from the full scale digesters was used for model calibration and another part was used for model validation the inlet conditions regarding the anions cations and inorganic carbon some model parameters such as the inorganic methane carbon yield c ch4 and the pipe resistance coefficient k p and a couple of experimental factors used to convert the results of routine experimental lab analysis of the digestate into useful model outputs such as vss and vfa were fitted during the calibration period an iterative manual calibration procedure was carried out in matlab focusing on all the variables from the biogas and the digestate see tables 4 and 6 different indicators with varying degrees of statistical basis can be chosen and estimated to assess the performance of the model during the calibration and validation period nordlander et al 2017 identified the exactly matched values between the experimental and simulated results however for the purpose of this study a more direct approach was chosen the performance of the calibration as well the validation was determined by establishing the simulation success rate as the number of experimental values that lies within a certain band of the simulation with a certain tolerance range carrera chapela et al 2016 donoso bravo et al 2018 adding a prediction band may help to make the application of this model more useful for plant operators and engineers because it provides a straightforward way of evaluating model success 2 3 analytical methods cod was measured by spectrophotometry and total and volatile solids were measured by a gravimetric method volatile fatty acids vfas were measured by the titration method with a result expressed as equivalent of acetic acid ph and total ammonium nitrogen tan were measured by selective electrodes all these measurements were carried out according to apha 2012 the protein content was calculated based on the assumption that the protein contained 16 w w nitrogen therefore the difference between the tkn and tan was multiplied by a factor of 6 25 to estimate the protein content lipids were measured by soxhlet extraction carbohydrate content was estimated based on the difference between the total cod and the specific cod contribution of lipids and proteins the estimated cod of proteins and lipids was 1 44 and 2 69 gcod gvs 1 respectively donoso bravo et al 2011c 3 results and discussion 3 1 full scale monodigester fed with hms fig 2 shows the inlet conditions in terms of the olr and hrt of the full scale digester during the evaluation period the data from day 1 to day 66 were used for parameter fitting model calibration during this period the organic loading rate olr was kept between 4 and 6 kgcod m 3 d 1 with a couple of exceptional olr drops below 3 kgcod m 3 d 1 the hydraulic retention time hrt increased steadily from 15 d to values above 20 d during the calibration period from day 67 to day 165 validation period the olr was kept between 5 and 6 5 kgcod m 3 d 1 whereas the hrt was kept below 20 d the results of the parameter fitting during the calibration period are presented in table 3 four missing inlet conditions were adjusted during the calibration period to provide estimated values since these parameters are not measured at the wrrf the bmp test data provided an estimation of the inert fraction of the particulate organic matter which limits biogas production however the inert fraction of the soluble fraction cannot be estimated from the bmp test and was thus estimated from the data from the full scale digester it was estimated that 5 of the soluble fraction of the substrate was inert which as expected was lower than the value for the particulate fraction table 2 only two parameters c ch4 and k p directly associated with the model were calibrated the first parameter as suggested by rosen and jeppsson 2006 is underestimated in the original adm1 parameter list and must be adjusted on a case by case basis likewise the k p parameter is related to the physical properties of the digester and its biogas line and must be adjusted on a case by case basis finally the two experimental conversion factors for vfa and vss of the digestate had to be determined to be able to use these measured output variables in the model evaluation the model simulations depicted in a prediction band with a tolerance of 10 for the calibration and validation periods with the gas and liquid variables can be seen in fig 3 visually one can see that the model captured the variation in the experimental data for both the biogas flow and the biogas composition a similar agreement can be observed for the variables measured in the liquid phase or digestate because the tolerance range is defined by the user operator the model performance based on the success rate is assessed for three different tolerance ranges of 5 10 and 20 for both the calibration and validation periods table 4 it is worth recalling that during the validation period none of the model parameters adjusted in the calibration period were modified as table 4 shows the success of the model improves as the tolerance increases because the prediction band is widened considering the 10 tolerance case the model has a clear capacity to properly generalize the behavior of the digester fed with hms except for the vfa in the digestate all the variables were reproduced by the model with above 50 success the disagreement can be explained by the experimental method used to estimate the total vfa concentration which is a titration based method that lumps together in a rough fashion the effects of all the vfas present in the digestate in this particular case the same error tolerance either 5 10 or 20 was used for all the variables however a specific error tolerance can be chosen for each measured variable depending on the estimated error of measurement or for any other practical reason 3 2 full scale digester in codigestion mode fig 4 shows the inlet conditions applied to the full scale digester during the 9 month operation evaluation period from day 1 59 the mono digestion of mss took place during the first half of this period the olr applied to the digester was approximately 3 kgcod m 3 d 1 at an hrt of 28 d on average in the second part of the monodigestion operation there was a significant drop in the olr to values below 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 which was due to a decrease in the inlet flow of mss which led to a rise in the hrt as well the addition of cosubstrate bw began on day 60 and the rate of addition was kept below 5 red line of the total olr applied yellow line in the reactor during this period the olr rose steadily to values of approximately 3 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 while a slight decreasing trend in the hrt occurred from day 159 on dw was incorporated into the cosubstrate line and the fraction of olr pertaining to the cosubstrates increased to values close to 24 of the olr on some days the highest olr values were attained during this period with peaks well above 4 kgcod m 3 d 1 similar to the second period the hrt decreased steadily throughout this operation phase in general greater variability in the curves for olr and hrt was observed after the addition of this second cosubstrate overall the inlet conditions to which the digester was subjected were quite variable therefore they are ideal for testing a model of the digester outputs similar variable behavior has been reported in full scale anaerobic codigestion plants nordlander et al 2017 the results of the parameter fitting during the calibration period are presented in table 5 the same parameters estimated in table 3 were also estimated for the codigestion digester the inert fraction of the soluble fraction was estimated to be 23 of the soluble content of the substrate which as expected was lower than the particulate fraction table 3 the model performance during the calibration and validation periods with an error tolerance band of 10 with the gas and liquid digestate variables can be seen in fig 5 visually one can see that the model captured the high variation of the experimental data during the entire evaluation period for both the biogas flow and biogas composition the incorporation of cosubstrate especially from 170 d on entailed a significant increase in biogas production but at the same time sharper variations in the daily biogas production which were captured by the model similar behaviors have been observed in the codigestion of sewage sludge with ofmsw at full scale mattioli et al 2017 these variations are caused by the fact that the cosubstrates are added discontinuously as freight trucks arrive at the wrrf the addition of the second cosubstrate also had an impact on the ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas which were overall also well represented by the model the variations in the liquid phase parameters due to the addition of the cosubstrate were less significant than those observed in the gas phase the values for ph and vss fell within the simulation band the vfa cod and total ammonia steadily increased after the addition of the second cosubstrate which was partially reproduced by the model this result is explained by the lack of characterization of these new inlet feeds that we know may change over time in our case due to the lack of data we assumed that the macromolecular composition and nitrogen content of the cosubstrates were constant on the other hand the rise in vfa concentration can be related to the accumulation of vfa during the storage of the cosubstrates due to warmer outdoor conditions the assessment of the model performance for the three different tolerance ranges of 5 10 and 20 and the three digester operation periods calibration validation 1 and validation 2 is shown in table 6 for all of the error tolerance values the capacity of the model was maintained at an appropriate level from calibration to validation 1 where even better results were attained for biogas soluble cod and vfas this result shows that the model can be properly generalized for conditions where a low fraction of cosubstrates are added in the following period validation 2 the capability of the model worsened compared to that in the previous period drops in biogas co2 and above all vfas and tan were observed this result can be directly related to the scarcity of inlet measurements since only the soluble cod was measured this relationship suggests that by adding couple more measurements such as tan and vfa into the daily experimental routine at the plant a more accurate model that represents the entire digester operation can be obtained 3 3 how can the model be used in the wwtp relying on a model to properly describe a process may be beneficial in different aspects as long as the specific goals and model limitations are well understood cook et al 2017 developed a stability indicator tool for acod based on the adm1 that compares the results of the simulation and real measured values the digester stability is assessed by determining the digester stability score from that comparison in the context of the present study there are some other issues that can be addressed by using this type of model application now we will describe potential applications of the model as a tool to aid in the decision making procedure 3 3 1 enhancing resilience by continuous process status follow up the continuous follow up or supervision of digester data with the model can have a direct impact on plant operation resilience fig 6 shows the benefit of undertaking real time process supervision with the model when the model properly predicts the behavior of a digester it is functioning as desired however when the model fails and its results diverge from the data generated in the plant valuable information can also be drawn when such a divergence takes place one can tell that there is an anomaly that may be related to the model or the process model issue if the problem lies in the model itself it may lead to a model parameter adjustment that may imply that some biological changes are taking place in the reactor on the other hand if the issue is related to the data data issue one may check the status of a specific sensor or whether an analytical method is being well performed however it is crucial to keep in mind that any trustworthy and reliable exploitation of this model must be accompanied by a continuous model updating with real data on a periodic basis as well as a complete understanding of the limitations of the tool 3 3 2 inlet condition determination reverse engineering as has been pointed out in general the traditional substrate and cosubstrate characterization carried out in a wrrf is insufficient to fully characterize the model inlet conditions this missing information and the assumptions that need to be established to complete the inlet information will inevitably increase the uncertainty of the model output and consequently harm the reliability of the model therefore one of the possible model applications could be the estimation of inlet conditions from a simulation of the model output variables that are measured this approach has been suggested by aichinger et al 2015 where the acod of thermally pretreated sludge and ofmsw was assessed in lab scale conditions was modeled by the platform sumo simulator in the case of the digester data used in this study the performance of the model can be enhanced by changing the inlet total nitrogen which we maintained constant due to a lack of information for instance by changing the tan inlet concentration from 1 0 to 1 5 g l 1 on day 159 and then to 2 75 g l 1 between days 210 and 221 the model performance improved from an 8 78 success rate therefore although tan is not measured at the plant the reverse engineering application of the model may suggest that there is an important addition of nitrogen to the digester coming from the cosubstrates which may indicate that the protein content rose over time it is interesting to note that not only the simulated tan concentration improved but also other parameters such as vfa from 17 6 to 29 and co2 from 66 to 80 which shows the complexity of the model and how the variables are interconnected in the model structure 3 3 3 knowledge of the general state of the unmeasured variables when the model is performing well in other words representing the measured output variables of a digester with a certain level of success one can expect that the rest of the model variables which are not measured and will probably never be can be tracked through the model as well for instance the evolution of the microbial populations or intermediate compounds during the ad process may be supervised and monitored 3 3 4 cosubstrate selection tool along with bmp tests and cosubstrate characterization which give a first screening of the best cosubstrates to be codigested in a wrrf the model can be used to explore the impact of the addition of a new cosubstrate to digesters without disturbing the real system and as the results here have demonstrated with highly reliable results therefore if cosubstrate characterization is available one may predict of the digester operation outcome under different possible scenarios such as different cosubstrate proportions feeding regimes overloads or famine by employing the model figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material show some possible scenarios that can be simulated with the model 3 3 5 cosubstrate addition planning a large portion of the studies found claim the selection of an optimum mix of substrates and cosubstrates as one of the main reasons to use a model in acod however according to plant operators the exact proportion of the substrates fed to a digester is not something that can be managed or controlled easily in the field operators must treat what they receive and there is little or no time or resources to screen the cosubstrates as well as a lack of space for storage and or mixing processes therefore the main advantages of having a model would be the ability to predict the outcome of a process before adding certain types and amounts of substrates to forecast the influence of certain mixing conditions or in other words to help with the decision making process one of the potential applications of the model is as a planning tool for the assessment of the timing of the addition of cosubstrates according to plant operators and managers it is generally desired to have a constant quantity of biogas accumulated in the gas meter so that electrical and thermal energy is produced in a constant fashion which enables the planning of energy exploitation and sale to the grid fig s3 in the supplementary material shows some possible scenarios that can be simulated with the model 4 conclusions a mathematical model based on the adm1 can be implemented in a full scale digester operation to reproduce the anaerobic degradation of hms as well as the anaerobic codigestion of sewage sludge with industrial effluents normal field inlet characterization and reasonable assumptions can be enough to achieve appropriate model behavior for both cases however the macromolecular composition of the substrates and cosubstrates should be incorporated every 3 4 months during the calibration procedure only two model parameters were estimated the yield of methane from inorganic carbon c ch4 and the gas pressure factor kp a simulation success rate was proposed to offer a simple and objective criterion to assess the model performance in hms monodigestion success rates of 65 for biogas production and 60 100 for other variables were achieved regarding the full scale digester in codigestion mode the model had a biogas flow prediction success rate of approximately 60 on average for the whole evaluation period while for the other variables values between 70 and 100 were attained in both cases the behavior of some variables in the digestate such as vfa and soluble cod can be improved further however such modifications must be done along with an improvement of the substrate and cosubstrate characterization routine the current model can be used as a tool to aid in the determination of some inlet conditions by reverse engineering to improve the resilience of the process by early possible fault detection and to elucidate the general state of the process likewise the model can be used to manage the timing of cosubstrate addition to keep the production of biogas and energy as stable as possible however it is crucial to keep in mind that the trustworthy and reliable exploitation of the model must be accompanied by continuous model updating with real data on a periodic basis as well as a complete understanding of the limitations of the tool declaration of

18006,the occurrence of algal bloom results in deterioration of water quality undesirable sights tastes and odors and the possibility of infections to humans and fatalities to livestock wildlife and pets earlier studies have identified a range of factors including water temperature flow and nutrient concentrations that could affect cyanobacterial proliferation lack of enough data independence in data across multiple sampling time steps as well as the presence of more than one causative factors each with different levels of influence on the response has resulted in limited progress in the development of generalized prediction frameworks for cyanobacteria in this study a prediction model for cyanobacteria occurrences was developed using only three dominant environmental variables water temperature velocity and phosphorus concentration these environmental variables were selected due to not only direct or joint contribution to algal bloom but also the ease of their availability either through direct measurements or as modelled responses in the river location of interest in order to apply bacterial growth dynamic to the model weight functions which quantify the importance assigned to the three variables depending on the cell number at the preceding time were formulated an extensive dataset spanning from 2013 to 2018 at 16 representative locations across the four major rivers in south korea was used to develop and validate the model through cross validation this model was shown to have more than 75 forecasting accuracy despite the use of a relatively simple predictive algorithm as the developed model makes use of commonly available environmental variables it can easily be extended to locations across the country where very limited or no prior information about cyanobacteria bloom is available keywords cyanobacterial bloom river temperature total phosphorus velocity weighted function model 1 introduction the occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom is becoming a common water related predicament brooks et al 2016 hallegraeff 1993 paerl and huisman 2008 along with its unsightly color and unpleasant odor cyanobacteria deteriorates water quality and creates toxins that can harm humans and animals alike fleming et al 2002 it also synthesizes added difficulty for water managers in deciding how much dam releases should occur in times of an active bloom event downstream gilroy et al 2000 an example of this comes from south korea where almost every summer fast spreading algal blooms on major rivers have been recognized as a major concern for public health and drinking water cha et al 2017 kim 2012 park et al 2017 another example is the recent mass fish killing along the 40 km stretch of darling river in australia offering an illustration of how unprecedented growth of cyanobacteria can impact our riverine ecosystems carman and tomevska 2019 the increasing frequencies of cyanobacterial bloom occurrences across the world have prompted considerable research in identifying factors that may be responsible for their occurrences and proliferation richardson et al 2018 showed the influences of three factors such as temperature retention time and total phosphorus on the algal bloom in wide range of lakes in europe these factors can be broadly grouped into climatological nutrient induced and hydrological categories fornarelli et al 2013 paerl and otten 2013 it has been noted that some cyanobacteria need temperatures over 20 c due to their competitiveness with eukaryotic phytoplankton moreover above 25 c they are recorded to have a dominant position in comparison with diatom berg and sutula 2015 davis et al 2009 additionally reynolds and walsby 1975 suggested that a temperature range of 25 35 c results in favorable conditions for cyanobacteria onset similarly retention time or flow velocity is also known to influence cyanobacteria occurrences low discharge or velocities hinder circulation and could trigger water stratification thereby creating a favorable environment for cyanobacteria and the buoyancy conditions needed for their growth beard et al 1999 brookes et al 1999 huber et al 2012 oliver 1994 finally sustained nutrient influx through salinity nitrogen and phosphorus are necessary for cyanobacterial growth phosphorus is known as a limiting nutrient and widely affects the total phytoplankton biomass in freshwater ecosystems elser et al 1990 schindler 1974 sommer 1989 sterner 1994 in freshwater lake systems phytoplankton biomass has been noted to be strongly dependent upon total phosphorus with a weaker relationship with total nitrogen guildford and hecky 2000 however recent literature has revealed the impact of nitrogen on cyanobacterial growth in lakes gobler et al 2016 paerl et al 2011 conley et al 2009 presented that regulating only phosphorus along with allowing nitrogen can decrease algal bloom in freshwater but cause eutrophication in estuaries high phosphorus is generally considered as the main source of cyanobacteria in south korea kim and kang 1993 lee et al 1998 some studies schindler et al 2008 2012 have suggested that the presence of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in water bodies control the concentration of nitrogen in water and constitute nitrogen as a less effective contributor of the growth of cyanobacteria although much attention has been given to

major water sources for most of the population and industries the total basin area of these rivers is about 63 016 km2 which occupies almost 63 of south korea south korea ministry of environment 2003 six year weekly water quality data from january 2013 to december 2018 are used in this study these datasets are mostly sourced from the water environment information system http water nier go kr operated by ministry of environment of south korea south korea ministry of environment 2012 the datasets include weekly measurements of water temperature t c total phosphorus p mg l number of cyanobacteria cells c total number of cells ml and discharge rate m3 sec from 16 stations along the four major rivers the frequency of routine observation of the data is once a week but twice a week for serious algal bloom events the cyanobacterial cell numbers in the above datasets are collected as the sum of cell counts for harmful cyanobacteria species such as microcystis anabaena aphanizomenon and oscillatoria those four species are also classified as cyanobacterial toxins affecting the liver or nervous system world health organization 2001 the 16 stations presented in fig 1 a have been operating since 2012 for monitoring algal bloom and extracting water quality samples one of the reasons for continuous measurement of this data is due to repeating occurrences of cyanobacteria every summer in the country especially in recent years as temperatures rise across the world srivastava et al 2015 as there are no velocity measurements in the datasets the flow velocity was indirectly obtained by using the hec ras model hydrologic engineering center river analysis system the hec ras model makes use of cross section roughness and discharge information to derive average cross sectional velocity at defined measurement points brunner 1995 the cross section and roughness data were obtained from the national river basic management plan of 2015 han river flood control office 2018 which has been published for the rivers every five years by the south korea government daily discharges of every measuring point were derived from the database mywater operated by k water of south korea https www water or kr 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 climatological and environmental factors governing cyanobacteria growth as mentioned earlier it is difficult to attribute the occurrence of cyanobacteria to one specific factor as there exist combinations of factors that trigger and sustain cyanobacteria growth based on a review of pertinent literature in this study three factors water temperature t total phosphorus p and flow velocity v were considered as the dominant environmental variables leading to the occurrence and growth of cyanobacteria although combination of excess nitrogen and phosphorus can worsen cyanobacterial concentration in rivers phosphorus is considered as the main cause of cyanobacteria in south korea kim and kang 1993 lee et al 1998 and surplus nitrogen is known to have limited influence on the cyanobacterial formulation schindler et al 2008 2012 hence in order to place more emphasis on the single nutrient this study focuses on p as a representative nutrient factor as shown in the time series of t p v and c at one of the representative stations in nakdong river in fig 1 b definite patterns in the environmental variables and cyanobacteria growth are noticeable t and p are relatively higher at the time of cyanobacteria events whereas v is lower in addition to this it is quite clear from fig 1 c f that these variables have positive negative correlations with cyanobacteria count notwithstanding these observations it is not straightforward to derive a direct relationship between the cyanobacteria and the environmental variables due to low pearson correlation coefficients 0 21 0 03 and 0 06 for t p and v respectively and their joint dependence realizing this we refrain from a prediction of numeric cell counts and focus on developing a binary prediction model for cyanobacteria occurrence or non occurrence the predictive model for the cyanobacterial bloom occurrence can be stated as 1 o t p v θ 0 1 where the binary response variable i e o is defined as o 1 if c c 0 else c representing a pre specified threshold of cyanobacteria cell concentrations c to account for the uncertainty in the cell count measurements and is adopted equal to 1000 cells ml following the south korean government s algal alert system standards south korea ministry of environment 2009 srivastava et al 2015 additionally t p v represent temperature c total phosphorus concentration mg l and flow velocity m s respectively with the vector θ denoting model parameters to be ascertained as the response for the model in equation 1 is binary various formulations of the model can be explored a commonly used form involves specifying equation 1 through a logistic regression relationship kleinbaum et al 2002 using continually varying representations for predictors t p v an even simpler model uses binary predictors defined based on thresholds that become the parameters θ to be estimated our proposed model predicts the occurrence of cyanobacteria if t p and v values are simultaneously above or below the critical thresholds defined as θ θ t θ p θ v in other words if at a given time step t and p are higher than the thresholds θ t θ p respectively and v is lower than the threshold θ v then the model predicts the occurrence of cyanobacteria at that time step however during our study we found that these critical thresholds are not directly applicable because of the persistence characteristic of cyanobacterial bloom the cyanobacterial bloom tends to persist for some time after it reaches the exponential phase of its typical growth curve even under not so favorable environmental conditions tortora et al 2004 following this we considered that these thresholds are not static but a function of the recent past concentration of cyanobacteria for this we propose the following formulation to update the thresholds of t p and v conditional on the cyanobacteria cell count at the preceding time step 2 θ θ t t θ t p θ t v θ t θ p θ v i f c t 1 0 θ t s t f c t 1 θ p s p f c t 1 θ v s v f c t 1 else where the vector θ t t θ t p θ t v denotes the updated thresholds of t p and v at the given time step t conditioned on the cyanobacteria cell count at the preceding time step i e c t 1 s t s p and s v denote the sample standard deviations of t p and v respectively and f c t 1 is a common scaling factor positive real number estimated by a weight function using cyanobacteria concentration at previous time step c t 1 it should be noted that the c 1000 in equation 1 is to define the occurrence of a cyanobacteria bloom operationally which should be altered by users as per local guidelines that may be in place also as implied in equation 2 only non zero values of c t 1 are used to modify the dynamic thresholds for t p and v these modified thresholds then decide whether a bloom has occurred or not for the time step in question with these modified threshold values lower for t and p higher for v it is possible to incorporate the persistence nature of cyanobacterial bloom in this study three forms of weight function were tested and compared these are 3 sigmoid f c t 1 α 1 e β c t 1 γ 4 linear f c t 1 α c t 1 if c t 1 β αβ if c t 1 β 5 exponential f c t 1 α 1 e β c t 1 here α β and γ represent model parameters to be ascertained along with the three thresholds θ t θ p θ v the above process is illustrated in fig 2 b e using cyanobacteria occurrence predictions at gongju station in geum river as an example the second panel in the figure presents the time series of recorded cyanobacteria cell numbers c with solid line and threshold cell number c 1000 with dotted line in the 3rd to 5th panels from the top θ is determined for example of temperature either θ t or θ t s t f c t 1 using equation 2 based on cyanobacteria cell counts of preceding time steps the environmental variable values at each time step are compared with the thresholds θ t t θ t p and θ t v to see whether there is a cyanobacteria occurrence or not consider the first case in may 2014 where a cyanobacteria occurrence is noted here a triggering condition did not occur as t t is lower than θ t t even though p t and v t meet the specified criteria accordingly this prediction is regarded as a correct rejection next there was a 2 week long cyanobacteria occurrence in july 2014 and the triggering conditions were correctly predicted i e hit lastly the cyanobacteria occurrence disappeared in august 2014 mainly resulting from increased v t at that time and was also correctly predicted by the model i e correct rejection 2 2 2 model calibration using maximum likelihood as shown earlier the proposed model first adjusts the threshold θ values at the current time step as θ t t θ t p and θ t v on the basis of cyanobacteria cell count at the preceding time step and thereafter compares them with the observed environmental variables t t p t and v t a yes or no alert is predicted depending upon whether these values are below above the thresholds a maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters θ θ t θ p θ v and function parameters α β γ given n observations can be obtained as 6 l θ t θ p θ v α β γ d a t a i 1 n o i log p 1 o i log 1 p where p represents the probability of joint exceedance of the adopted thresholds or p p r o b t θ t p θ p v θ v and l the log likelihood as the modelled outcomes are binary the above maximum likelihood estimate can be expressed using the form of a 2 2 contingency table by considering the four scalar attributes hits false alarms misses and correct rejections wilks 2011 as presented in fig 2 a the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters would be analogous to that obtained through maximization of the probability of correct hits and rejections referred to as proportion correct or pc 7 pc a d a b c d where a hits b false alarms c misses and d correct rejections the difficulty in using the maximum likelihood formulation above lies in the fact that the proportion of non occurrences is markedly higher than the proportion of occurrences as a result the above maximization ends up maximizing d as it dominates the pc score this can result in parameters that will correctly predict the non occurrences but not the occurrences that are of greater importance 2 2 3 modified parameter estimation approach in order to overcome the limitation of parameter estimation approach outlined above and to enforce a greater importance to actual occurrences various modifications to the maximum likelihood estimator in equation 7 were investigated after assessing alternate performance measures the peirce skill score pss equation 8 was selected as the objective function for calibrating the parameters pss can be calculated as the difference between the hit rate h a a c and the false alarm rate f b b d that is pss h f 8 pss ad bc a c b d using pss as the basis for parameter estimation perfect forecasts provide a score of one as b c 0 or alternatively h 1 and f 0 while random forecasts give negative scores the advantage pss offers over the maximum likelihood estimator in equation 7 is that the model is not discouraged from forecasting rare occurrences wilks 2011 kim et al 2018 which is highly relevant to the cyanobacteria prediction problem at hand there are two parameters and three critical thresholds of environmental variables to be ascertained depending on the weight functions used in equations 3 5 for γ in the sigmoid model presented in equation 3 the median value of cyanobacteria cell numbers in the training datasets was used for simplification in order to identify these parameters and critical thresholds the shuffled complex evolution sce optimization approach from r package soilhyp was applied sce has been widely used for a broad class of hydrologic and environmental optimization problems duan et al 1993 vrugt et al 2003 2 2 4 assessment of model sensitivity and cross validation besides pss the threat score ts equation 9 was also ascertained on the basis of pss optimized parameters for an independent assessment of the applicability of the three weight functions as well as the sensitivity of each variable wilks 2011 suggested that ts is particularly useful when the event to be forecasted occurs less frequently than its nonoccurrence and is computed as 9 ts a a b c in addition to the original ts four conditional ts scores were also evaluated the first ts1 calculates ts for events which do not have a preceding cyanobacterial event in other words it judges the model s forecasting accuracy at the time of abrupt cyanobacterial occurrence the other three scores ts2 to ts4 measure ts for the cases where temperature and phosphorus are less than their median values tt t50 and pt p50 and velocity is greater than the median velocity vt v50 these conditional ts scores can be interpreted as sensitivity estimates of the model performance to exceedances of each environmental variable above or below its median entire dataset was first used to get a stable estimate of model parameters following this further checks on these calibrated variables and their applicability were conducted using a 4 fold cross validation wherein 12 out of 16 stations were randomly selected as training datasets and the remaining four stations were used as test datasets this validation process was repeated 50 times the calibrated parameters and calculated skill scores are presented in the next section 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration results using the entire dataset the pss parameters and critical thresholds for each environmental variable were ascertained the pss for the three weight functions range from 0 79 to 0 80 table 1 the critical thresholds of environmental variables are also within physically acceptable ranges for instance θ t is in line with the favorable temperature range of 25 35 c for cyanobacteria occurrences suggested by reynolds and walsby 1975 accordingly this threshold can explain non occurrence of cyanobacteria in han river in fig 1 c these results also support the finding of huang et al 2008 that the change of the flow velocity in a range of less than 0 4 m s would accelerate the growth of algae and the occurrence of bloom in river type reservoir similarly the critical velocity about 0 05 m s which suppress the development of stratification suggested by mitrovic et al 2003 can be included in this range of velocity 3 2 cross validation results in order to verify the calibration result and assess the future applicability of the model the 4 fold cross validation was implemented and results are presented in fig 3 fig 3 a presents box plots of the distribution of pss for the three weight functions it is clear from the figure that the all pss and threshold values are similar to those obtained from the calibration results table 1 the linear weight function provides the most robust range of the environmental variables fig 3 b d with relatively narrower interquartile ranges with the conditional ts results which were implemented for assessing the model reliability in infrequent situations all three weight functions predicted over 40 accuracy even under unusual events described in fig 3 e the exponential model generally shows higher tss than others except for ts1 which is slightly lower than those of the sigmoid model therefore it is recommended to use the linear or exponential weight function for the cyanobacteria prediction while dealing with the similar environmental conditions furthermore it was apparent from the averaged values of conditional ts2 to ts4 fig 3 e that the most dominant factor for cyanobacteria occurrence in the study area was temperature ts2 followed by velocity ts4 and phosphorus ts3 this is because the variable showing high dependence on cyanobacteria even in relatively low apparent conditions can be interpreted as having a lower correlation with cyanobacteria in detail ts2 dataset includes the cases where temperature is less than the median value of the temperature temperature being the most dominant variable resulting ts2 is much smaller than normal ts contrasting to ts2 ts3 includes the cases where total phosphorus is less than the median value of total phosphorus phosphorus being the least dominant variable resulting in ts3 is slightly smaller than the normal ts ts4 results fall in between these two categories following these results the gap between the normal ts and conditional tss can be interpreted as the relative contribution of each environmental variable towards cyanobacteria predictive model formulation 3 3 maximum likelihood results the usefulness of adopting a new basis for parameter estimation in pss and not using the maximum likelihood based estimate which would have amounted to maximizing pc equation 8 was also assessed through the cross validation described in section 3 2 based on this the maximized pc was found to be as high as 0 91 0 02 and the normal ts equation 9 was almost identical to the pss derived value reported in the previous sub section however the ts2 to ts4 conditioned by relatively implausible t p and v conditions for cyanobacteria occurrences section 2 2 4 were found to be slightly lower than those from the pss based cross validation results furthermore ts1 was unquestionably lower than the pss derived result which were 0 13 0 08 for the pc case and 0 69 0 02 for the pss case fig 3 e namely the model performance when calibrated by maximizing pc tends to sharply drop for cases that do not have a preceding cyanobacteria event accordingly the use of a metric such as the pss is recommended for the specification of rare occurrence variables such as cyanobacteria 3 4 caveats and follow up studies this study focused on the three dominant environmental variables of cyanobacterial growth water temperature t total phosphorus p and flow velocity v although the stable range of each predictor threshold in fig 3 suggest that climatological conditions over study area are not significantly different to each other there could be additional environmental and climatological conditions that are important in cyanobacterial growth depending on the location being modelled similarly notwithstanding an obvious strong relationship of cyanobacteria with the three variables used in the study other factors are also known to affect the appearance of cyanobacteria such as ph nitrogen salinity turbidity irradiance electric conductivity etc furthermore results of conditional tss indicate that exceptional changes in one of the variables can influence algal bloom occurrence in this study we assumed phosphorus as an indicator of the nutrients in the water in order to verify if nitrogen is a better choice than phosphorus pss and ts were estimated first using total nitrogen n instead of total phosphorus p and both variables together thereafter the model forecasting accuracy was found to be slightly reduced statistically insignificant in comparison to the base case it can thus be interpreted that total phosphorus is marginally a better choice than total nitrogen or the combination together otherwise also its relative impact on cyanobacterial growth is much smaller than water temperature and flow velocity v likewise if all relevant factors are available it would be meaningful to rank their relative contributions which is a limitation of most data collection systems as measurements are often not complete based on the data type published in south korea and the cyanobacteria toxic classification from world health organization the sum of toxic cyanobacteria species including microcystis anabaena aphanizomenon and oscillatoria was classified as cyanobacteria in this study however it should be recognized that every cyanobacteria species acts somewhat differently and favors different environmental conditions a follow up to this study would be to develop a probabilistic forecasting model that provides cyanobacteria predictions in a probabilistic manner thereby allowing water managers to make decisions based on the tolerable risks allowed in the river system of interest furthermore expansion of the model to suppress or delay the dominance of cyanobacteria that is to reduce the probability of occurrence of the events could be another way forward in situations where there is no or insufficient data it would be valuable to utilize remote sensing data of the three environmental factors as a surrogate o reilly et al 2015 the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has developed the national phytoplankton monitoring program which was first developed in coastal areas for monitoring marine harmful algal blooms habs more recently this program which used satellite imagery to identify surface cyanobacteria events has begun to concentrate on freshwater habs brooks et al 2016 as another example to detect early algal bloom by satellite image teta et al 2017 showed that remote sensing data combined with aerial and in situ data was an efficient method to detect early blooms of cyanobacteria investigation of these added data resources to establish a globally applicable predictive model would be of interest 4 conclusion we proposed a simple binary model for predicting cyanobacteria blooms in rivers conditioned on the three environmental variables these variables were identified through literature review and are easily measurable at all locations the novel elements of this research were to propose a prediction model of cyanobacteria occurrence conditional on the preceding state of cyanobacteria concentration and a procedure for parameter estimation that provides equal consideration to the cases of a very few samples of cyanobacteria occurrence as compared to the non occurrence cases based on the preceding time step cyanobacteria concentration thresholds of the variables at the current time step were transformed by using three types of weight function i e sigmoid linear and exponential in which the linear and exponential function were found to be performing better more than 0 75 pss and 0 4 conditional ts scores capturing rare combinations of occurrence of the three environmental variables gave us confidence in the accuracy of the proposed model furthermore results based on conditional ts showed that the most dominant factor for cyanobacteria in this study area was temperature followed by velocity and phosphorus providing avenues for an extension to other regions and even catchments with limited

18006,the occurrence of algal bloom results in deterioration of water quality undesirable sights tastes and odors and the possibility of infections to humans and fatalities to livestock wildlife and pets earlier studies have identified a range of factors including water temperature flow and nutrient concentrations that could affect cyanobacterial proliferation lack of enough data independence in data across multiple sampling time steps as well as the presence of more than one causative factors each with different levels of influence on the response has resulted in limited progress in the development of generalized prediction frameworks for cyanobacteria in this study a prediction model for cyanobacteria occurrences was developed using only three dominant environmental variables water temperature velocity and phosphorus concentration these environmental variables were selected due to not only direct or joint contribution to algal bloom but also the ease of their availability either through direct measurements or as modelled responses in the river location of interest in order to apply bacterial growth dynamic to the model weight functions which quantify the importance assigned to the three variables depending on the cell number at the preceding time were formulated an extensive dataset spanning from 2013 to 2018 at 16 representative locations across the four major rivers in south korea was used to develop and validate the model through cross validation this model was shown to have more than 75 forecasting accuracy despite the use of a relatively simple predictive algorithm as the developed model makes use of commonly available environmental variables it can easily be extended to locations across the country where very limited or no prior information about cyanobacteria bloom is available keywords cyanobacterial bloom river temperature total phosphorus velocity weighted function model 1 introduction the occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom is becoming a common water related predicament brooks et al 2016 hallegraeff 1993 paerl and huisman 2008 along with its unsightly color and unpleasant odor cyanobacteria deteriorates water quality and creates toxins that can harm humans and animals alike fleming et al 2002 it also synthesizes added difficulty for water managers in deciding how much dam releases should occur in times of an active bloom event downstream gilroy et al 2000 an example of this comes from south korea where almost every summer fast spreading algal blooms on major rivers have been recognized as a major concern for public health and drinking water cha et al 2017 kim 2012 park et al 2017 another example is the recent mass fish killing along the 40 km stretch of darling river in australia offering an illustration of how unprecedented growth of cyanobacteria can impact our riverine ecosystems carman and tomevska 2019 the increasing frequencies of cyanobacterial bloom occurrences across the world have prompted considerable research in identifying factors that may be responsible for their occurrences and proliferation richardson et al 2018 showed the influences of three factors such as temperature retention time and total phosphorus on the algal bloom in wide range of lakes in europe these factors can be broadly grouped into climatological nutrient induced and hydrological categories fornarelli et al 2013 paerl and otten 2013 it has been noted that some cyanobacteria need temperatures over 20 c due to their competitiveness with eukaryotic phytoplankton moreover above 25 c they are recorded to have a dominant position in comparison with diatom berg and sutula 2015 davis et al 2009 additionally reynolds and walsby 1975 suggested that a temperature range of 25 35 c results in favorable conditions for cyanobacteria onset similarly retention time or flow velocity is also known to influence cyanobacteria occurrences low discharge or velocities hinder circulation and could trigger water stratification thereby creating a favorable environment for cyanobacteria and the buoyancy conditions needed for their growth beard et al 1999 brookes et al 1999 huber et al 2012 oliver 1994 finally sustained nutrient influx through salinity nitrogen and phosphorus are necessary for cyanobacterial growth phosphorus is known as a limiting nutrient and widely affects the total phytoplankton biomass in freshwater ecosystems elser et al 1990 schindler 1974 sommer 1989 sterner 1994 in freshwater lake systems phytoplankton biomass has been noted to be strongly dependent upon total phosphorus with a weaker relationship with total nitrogen guildford and hecky 2000 however recent literature has revealed the impact of nitrogen on cyanobacterial growth in lakes gobler et al 2016 paerl et al 2011 conley et al 2009 presented that regulating only phosphorus along with allowing nitrogen can decrease algal bloom in freshwater but cause eutrophication in estuaries high phosphorus is generally considered as the main source of cyanobacteria in south korea kim and kang 1993 lee et al 1998 some studies schindler et al 2008 2012 have suggested that the presence of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in water bodies control the concentration of nitrogen in water and constitute nitrogen as a less effective contributor of the growth of cyanobacteria although much attention has been given to

thresholds θ t θ p respectively and v is lower than the threshold θ v then the model predicts the occurrence of cyanobacteria at that time step however during our study we found that these critical thresholds are not directly applicable because of the persistence characteristic of cyanobacterial bloom the cyanobacterial bloom tends to persist for some time after it reaches the exponential phase of its typical growth curve even under not so favorable environmental conditions tortora et al 2004 following this we considered that these thresholds are not static but a function of the recent past concentration of cyanobacteria for this we propose the following formulation to update the thresholds of t p and v conditional on the cyanobacteria cell count at the preceding time step 2 θ θ t t θ t p θ t v θ t θ p θ v i f c t 1 0 θ t s t f c t 1 θ p s p f c t 1 θ v s v f c t 1 else where the vector θ t t θ t p θ t v denotes the updated thresholds of t p and v at the given time step t conditioned on the cyanobacteria cell count at the preceding time step i e c t 1 s t s p and s v denote the sample standard deviations of t p and v respectively and f c t 1 is a common scaling factor positive real number estimated by a weight function using cyanobacteria concentration at previous time step c t 1 it should be noted that the c 1000 in equation 1 is to define the occurrence of a cyanobacteria bloom operationally which should be altered by users as per local guidelines that may be in place also as implied in equation 2 only non zero values of c t 1 are used to modify the dynamic thresholds for t p and v these modified thresholds then decide whether a bloom has occurred or not for the time step in question with these modified threshold values lower for t and p higher for v it is possible to incorporate the persistence nature of cyanobacterial bloom in this study three forms of weight function were tested and compared these are 3 sigmoid f c t 1 α 1 e β c t 1 γ 4 linear f c t 1 α c t 1 if c t 1 β αβ if c t 1 β 5 exponential f c t 1 α 1 e β c t 1 here α β and γ represent model parameters to be ascertained along with the three thresholds θ t θ p θ v the above process is illustrated in fig 2 b e using cyanobacteria occurrence predictions at gongju station in geum river as an example the second panel in the figure presents the time series of recorded cyanobacteria cell numbers c with solid line and threshold cell number c 1000 with dotted line in the 3rd to 5th panels from the top θ is determined for example of temperature either θ t or θ t s t f c t 1 using equation 2 based on cyanobacteria cell counts of preceding time steps the environmental variable values at each time step are compared with the thresholds θ t t θ t p and θ t v to see whether there is a cyanobacteria occurrence or not consider the first case in may 2014 where a cyanobacteria occurrence is noted here a triggering condition did not occur as t t is lower than θ t t even though p t and v t meet the specified criteria accordingly this prediction is regarded as a correct rejection next there was a 2 week long cyanobacteria occurrence in july 2014 and the triggering conditions were correctly predicted i e hit lastly the cyanobacteria occurrence disappeared in august 2014 mainly resulting from increased v t at that time and was also correctly predicted by the model i e correct rejection 2 2 2 model calibration using maximum likelihood as shown earlier the proposed model first adjusts the threshold θ values at the current time step as θ t t θ t p and θ t v on the basis of cyanobacteria cell count at the preceding time step and thereafter compares them with the observed environmental variables t t p t and v t a yes or no alert is predicted depending upon whether these values are below above the thresholds a maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters θ θ t θ p θ v and function parameters α β γ given n observations can be obtained as 6 l θ t θ p θ v α β γ d a t a i 1 n o i log p 1 o i log 1 p where p represents the probability of joint exceedance of the adopted thresholds or p p r o b t θ t p θ p v θ v and l the log likelihood as the modelled outcomes are binary the above maximum likelihood estimate can be expressed using the form of a 2 2 contingency table by considering the four scalar attributes hits false alarms misses and correct rejections wilks 2011 as presented in fig 2 a the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters would be analogous to that obtained through maximization of the probability of correct hits and rejections referred to as proportion correct or pc 7 pc a d a b c d where a hits b false alarms c misses and d correct rejections the difficulty in using the maximum likelihood formulation above lies in the fact that the proportion of non occurrences is markedly higher than the proportion of occurrences as a result the above maximization ends up maximizing d as it dominates the pc score this can result in parameters that will correctly predict the non occurrences but not the occurrences that are of greater importance 2 2 3 modified parameter estimation approach in order to overcome the limitation of parameter estimation approach outlined above and to enforce a greater importance to actual occurrences various modifications to the maximum likelihood estimator in equation 7 were investigated after assessing alternate performance measures the peirce skill score pss equation 8 was selected as the objective function for calibrating the parameters pss can be calculated as the difference between the hit rate h a a c and the false alarm rate f b b d that is pss h f 8 pss ad bc a c b d using pss as the basis for parameter estimation perfect forecasts provide a score of one as b c 0 or alternatively h 1 and f 0 while random forecasts give negative scores the advantage pss offers over the maximum likelihood estimator in equation 7 is that the model is not discouraged from forecasting rare occurrences wilks 2011 kim et al 2018 which is highly relevant to the cyanobacteria prediction problem at hand there are two parameters and three critical thresholds of environmental variables to be ascertained depending on the weight functions used in equations 3 5 for γ in the sigmoid model presented in equation 3 the median value of cyanobacteria cell numbers in the training datasets was used for simplification in order to identify these parameters and critical thresholds the shuffled complex evolution sce optimization approach from r package soilhyp was applied sce has been widely used for a broad class of hydrologic and environmental optimization problems duan et al 1993 vrugt et al 2003 2 2 4 assessment of model sensitivity and cross validation besides pss the threat score ts equation 9 was also ascertained on the basis of pss optimized parameters for an independent assessment of the applicability of the three weight functions as well as the sensitivity of each variable wilks 2011 suggested that ts is particularly useful when the event to be forecasted occurs less frequently than its nonoccurrence and is computed as 9 ts a a b c in addition to the original ts four conditional ts scores were also evaluated the first ts1 calculates ts for events which do not have a preceding cyanobacterial event in other words it judges the model s forecasting accuracy at the time of abrupt cyanobacterial occurrence the other three scores ts2 to ts4 measure ts for the cases where temperature and phosphorus are less than their median values tt t50 and pt p50 and velocity is greater than the median velocity vt v50 these conditional ts scores can be interpreted as sensitivity estimates of the model performance to exceedances of each environmental variable above or below its median entire dataset was first used to get a stable estimate of model parameters following this further checks on these calibrated variables and their applicability were conducted using a 4 fold cross validation wherein 12 out of 16 stations were randomly selected as training datasets and the remaining four stations were used as test datasets this validation process was repeated 50 times the calibrated parameters and calculated skill scores are presented in the next section 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration results using the entire dataset the pss parameters and critical thresholds for each environmental variable were ascertained the pss for the three weight functions range from 0 79 to 0 80 table 1 the critical thresholds of environmental variables are also within physically acceptable ranges for instance θ t is in line with the favorable temperature range of 25 35 c for cyanobacteria occurrences suggested by reynolds and walsby 1975 accordingly this threshold can explain non occurrence of cyanobacteria in han river in fig 1 c these results also support the finding of huang et al 2008 that the change of the flow velocity in a range of less than 0 4 m s would accelerate the growth of algae and the occurrence of bloom in river type reservoir similarly the critical velocity about 0 05 m s which suppress the development of stratification suggested by mitrovic et al 2003 can be included in this range of velocity 3 2 cross validation results in order to verify the calibration result and assess the future applicability of the model the 4 fold cross validation was implemented and results are presented in fig 3 fig 3 a presents box plots of the distribution of pss for the three weight functions it is clear from the figure that the all pss and threshold values are similar to those obtained from the calibration results table 1 the linear weight function provides the most robust range of the environmental variables fig 3 b d with relatively narrower interquartile ranges with the conditional ts results which were implemented for assessing the model reliability in infrequent situations all three weight functions predicted over 40 accuracy even under unusual events described in fig 3 e the exponential model generally shows higher tss than others except for ts1 which is slightly lower than those of the sigmoid model therefore it is recommended to use the linear or exponential weight function for the cyanobacteria prediction while dealing with the similar environmental conditions furthermore it was apparent from the averaged values of conditional ts2 to ts4 fig 3 e that the most dominant factor for cyanobacteria occurrence in the study area was temperature ts2 followed by velocity ts4 and phosphorus ts3 this is because the variable showing high dependence on cyanobacteria even in relatively low apparent conditions can be interpreted as having a lower correlation with cyanobacteria in detail ts2 dataset includes the cases where temperature is less than the median value of the temperature temperature being the most dominant variable resulting ts2 is much smaller than normal ts contrasting to ts2 ts3 includes the cases where total phosphorus is less than the median value of total phosphorus phosphorus being the least dominant variable resulting in ts3 is slightly smaller than the normal ts ts4 results fall in between these two categories following these results the gap between the normal ts and conditional tss can be interpreted as the relative contribution of each environmental variable towards cyanobacteria predictive model formulation 3 3 maximum likelihood results the usefulness of adopting a new basis for parameter estimation in pss and not using the maximum likelihood based estimate which would have amounted to maximizing pc equation 8 was also assessed through the cross validation described in section 3 2 based on this the maximized pc was found to be as high as 0 91 0 02 and the normal ts equation 9 was almost identical to the pss derived value reported in the previous sub section however the ts2 to ts4 conditioned by relatively implausible t p and v conditions for cyanobacteria occurrences section 2 2 4 were found to be slightly lower than those from the pss based cross validation results furthermore ts1 was unquestionably lower than the pss derived result which were 0 13 0 08 for the pc case and 0 69 0 02 for the pss case fig 3 e namely the model performance when calibrated by maximizing pc tends to sharply drop for cases that do not have a preceding cyanobacteria event accordingly the use of a metric such as the pss is recommended for the specification of rare occurrence variables such as cyanobacteria 3 4 caveats and follow up studies this study focused on the three dominant environmental variables of cyanobacterial growth water temperature t total phosphorus p and flow velocity v although the stable range of each predictor threshold in fig 3 suggest that climatological conditions over study area are not significantly different to each other there could be additional environmental and climatological conditions that are important in cyanobacterial growth depending on the location being modelled similarly notwithstanding an obvious strong relationship of cyanobacteria with the three variables used in the study other factors are also known to affect the appearance of cyanobacteria such as ph nitrogen salinity turbidity irradiance electric conductivity etc furthermore results of conditional tss indicate that exceptional changes in one of the variables can influence algal bloom occurrence in this study we assumed phosphorus as an indicator of the nutrients in the water in order to verify if nitrogen is a better choice than phosphorus pss and ts were estimated first using total nitrogen n instead of total phosphorus p and both variables together thereafter the model forecasting accuracy was found to be slightly reduced statistically insignificant in comparison to the base case it can thus be interpreted that total phosphorus is marginally a better choice than total nitrogen or the combination together otherwise also its relative impact on cyanobacterial growth is much smaller than water temperature and flow velocity v likewise if all relevant factors are available it would be meaningful to rank their relative contributions which is a limitation of most data collection systems as measurements are often not complete based on the data type published in south korea and the cyanobacteria toxic classification from world health organization the sum of toxic cyanobacteria species including microcystis anabaena aphanizomenon and oscillatoria was classified as cyanobacteria in this study however it should be recognized that every cyanobacteria species acts somewhat differently and favors different environmental conditions a follow up to this study would be to develop a probabilistic forecasting model that provides cyanobacteria predictions in a probabilistic manner thereby allowing water managers to make decisions based on the tolerable risks allowed in the river system of interest furthermore expansion of the model to suppress or delay the dominance of cyanobacteria that is to reduce the probability of occurrence of the events could be another way forward in situations where there is no or insufficient data it would be valuable to utilize remote sensing data of the three environmental factors as a surrogate o reilly et al 2015 the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has developed the national phytoplankton monitoring program which was first developed in coastal areas for monitoring marine harmful algal blooms habs more recently this program which used satellite imagery to identify surface cyanobacteria events has begun to concentrate on freshwater habs brooks et al 2016 as another example to detect early algal bloom by satellite image teta et al 2017 showed that remote sensing data combined with aerial and in situ data was an efficient method to detect early blooms of cyanobacteria investigation of these added data resources to establish a globally applicable predictive model would be of interest 4 conclusion we proposed a simple binary model for predicting cyanobacteria blooms in rivers conditioned on the three environmental variables these variables were identified through literature review and are easily measurable at all locations the novel elements of this research were to propose a prediction model of cyanobacteria occurrence conditional on the preceding state of cyanobacteria concentration and a procedure for parameter estimation that provides equal consideration to the cases of a very few samples of cyanobacteria occurrence as compared to the non occurrence cases based on the preceding time step cyanobacteria concentration thresholds of the variables at the current time step were transformed by using three types of weight function i e sigmoid linear and exponential in which the linear and exponential function were found to be performing better more than 0 75 pss and 0 4 conditional ts scores capturing rare combinations of occurrence of the three environmental variables gave us confidence in the accuracy of the proposed model furthermore results based on conditional ts showed that the most dominant factor for cyanobacteria in this study area was temperature followed by velocity and phosphorus providing avenues for an extension to other regions and even catchments with limited

18007,iron electrocoagulation fe ec is an effective technology to remove arsenic as from groundwater used for drinking a commonly noted limitation of fe ec is fouling or passivation of electrode surfaces via rust accumulation over long term use in this study we examined the effect of removing electrode surface layers on the performance of a large scale 10 000 l d capacity fe ec plant in west bengal india we also characterized the layers formed on the electrodes in active use for over 2 years at this plant the electrode surfaces developed three distinct horizontal sections of layers that consisted of different minerals calcite fe iii precipitates and magnetite near the top magnetite in the middle and fe iii precipitates and magnetite near the bottom the interior of all surface layers adjacent to the fe 0 metal was dominated by magnetite we determined the impact of surface layer removal by mechanical abrasion on fe ec performance by measuring solution composition as fe p si mn ca ph do and electrochemical parameters total cell voltage and electrode interface potentials during electrolysis after electrode cleaning the fe concentration in the bulk solution increased substantially from 15 2 to 41 5 mg l this higher fe concentration led to increased removal of a number of solutes for as the concentration reached below the 10 μg l who mcl more rapidly and with less total fe consumed i e less electrical energy after cleaning 128 4 μg l as removed per kwh compared to before cleaning 72 9 μg l as removed per kwh similarly the removal of p and si improved after cleaning by 0 3 mg l kwh and 1 1 mg l kwh respectively our results show that mechanically removing the surface layers that accumulate on electrodes over extended periods of fe ec operation can restore fe ec system efficiency concentration of solute removed kwh delivered since fe release into the bulk solution substantially increased upon electrode cleaning our results also suggest that routine electrode maintenance can ensure robust and reliable fe ec performance over year long timescales graphical abstract image 1 keywords anodic dissolution electrode surface layers iron electrocoagulation

smith et al 1992 2002 steinmaus et al 2013 the arsenic crisis is severe in south asia due to the low income of the population lack of resources and poor infrastructure of arsenic remediation technologies especially in rural regions johnston et al 2010 amrose et al 2015 iron electrocoagulation fe ec is gaining attention as a promising technology to remove arsenic from groundwater in resource poor settings this technique is attractive because it has many properties that favor implementation and sustainable operation in rural communities such as its modular design low cost flexible

effectively remove arsenic to below the world health organization who maximum contaminant limit mcl of 10 μg l who 2018 rigorous field based investigations of fe ec treatment remain poorly documented in the peer reviewed literature especially for large scale plants operated over extended periods investigations of pilot scale treatment systems are essential to characterize and address the technical challenges that arise when treatment methods emerge from the laboratory and begin extended operation in the field in the few field based investigations of fe ec systems in the literature it is commonly reported that resistive rust surface layers form on the surfaces of fe 0 electrodes over extended operating cycles amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 these surface layers have been proposed to reduce the contaminant removal efficiency herein defined as the concentration of solute removed per electrical energy delivered μg l or mg l per kwh of fe ec systems although some studies have characterized the surface layer mineralogy timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 the role of surface layer growth on the performance of fe ec systems is not well understood in theory surface layer growth can impact several aspects of ec treatment first electrochemically generated fe ii can be trapped in the electrode surface layer which would decrease the amount of fe ii transported to the bulk solution where it forms fe iii precipitates that bind solutes such as arsenic as phosphate p and silica si second if the surface layer consists of poorly conducting fe minerals e g goethite lepidocrocite the rust build up would increase the charge transfer resistance which increases the electrical energy required to pass current and could increase the interface overpotential enough to favor anodic oxidation of h2o to o2 instead of fe 0 to fe ii van genuchten et al 2017 since the formation and growth of surface layers can decrease the contaminant removal efficiency via these processes surface layer removal is likely an effective method to increase or maintain the performance of fe ec systems various techniques to mitigate surface layer growth have been proposed in the literature such as altering the frequency with which the electrode polarity is reversed manipulating the electrode storage conditions air dried vs wet storage and periodic removal of the surface layers by mechanical abrasion of these methods mechanical removal of the surface layers seems to be one of the most promising strategies for example in a recent extended laboratory study müller et al 2019 found that alternating the electrode polarity actually increased the surface layer mass and varying the electrode storage conditions during inactive cycles was ineffective at preventing surface layer growth by contrast periodic mechanical electrode cleaning after days to weeks of operation effectively restored fe ec performance in the lab müller et al 2019 and is an attractive field based approach because it is simple and requires only minimal low cost labor without hazardous chemicals amrose et al 2014 nikolaev et al 1982 however few studies describe how the fe ec performance changes as a result of thorough electrode cleaning i e with mechanical abrasion to completely remove hard layers of rust build up and no studies have investigated fe ec field systems with large electrodes 18 000 cm2 per electrode that have operated over extended periods understanding how mechanical electrode cleaning impacts the performance of fully operational fe ec systems would help practitioners optimize plant maintenance and operation and can be used to improve predictions of the long term efficiency of fe ec systems the objective of this work is to characterize the extent to which deep mechanical cleaning of the electrodes restores the performance of a pilot scale fe ec field system in a case where the electrodes had not been cleaned after two years of use in operation about 8 h per day 2 4 days per week for the purpose of this work we use the term deep cleaning to indicate thorough surface layer removal by mechanical abrasion with a hand held angle grinder followed by electrode rinsing with water to this end we performed a set of experiments at an existing fe ec plant actively treating arsenic contaminated groundwater for drinking at a rural school near kolkata india to understand the effect of deep cleaning on fe ec system performance we compared an exhaustive series of chemical as fe p si mn ph do and electrochemical measurements total cell potential electrode interface potentials before and after electrode deep cleaning we also investigated the macroscopic 1 mm surface layer properties using a high resolution digital camera and determined the surface layer mineralogy and composition using x ray diffraction xrd x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and wet chemical techniques our results reveal significant improvements in the contaminant removal efficiency and operating costs of fe ec treatment following electrode deep cleaning our field based fe ec investigation provides important complementary perspectives to results derived from laboratory based fe ec studies both of which are required for a complete understanding of the potential of fe ec to sustainably improve safe water access in rural arsenic affected resource poor communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the fe ec system and field site the fe ec pilot plant is situated at dhapdhapi high school west bengal india and had been in operation for two years prior to the experiments to meet the local water demand the plant was operated for 2 4 days per week during the school year and 2 days per week when school was out of session the plant consisted of 2 steel reactor tanks coated with food grade epoxy paint to house the electrode assembly 1600 l for each tank 1270 mm 1210 mm 1030 mm both reactor tanks contained 16 parallel mild steel plates is 2062 cold formed shri hari industries mumbai india spaced 50 mm apart each with dimensions of 1000 mm 900 mm 3 mm these mild steel plates herein referred to as fe 0 plates or electrodes for simplicity were used as received fig s1 in the electronic supplemental material esm shows the unused electrodes as received the 16 electrodes in each reactor tank were connected electrically such that alternating fe 0 plates served as anode and cathode 8 anodes and 8 cathodes per tank fig 1 the 16 electrodes in reactor tank 1 rt1 are numbered as e1 to e16 and those in reactor tank 2 rt2 are numbered as e17 to e32 both reactor tanks were open to the atmosphere fig 1 before electrolysis the tanks were filled with 1000 l of contaminated groundwater from a nearby tube well depth 32 m using a submersible pump at a flow rate of 22 l min the chemical composition of this groundwater is summarized in table s1 in the esm but notably contained 164 9 μg l as 2 2 fe 0 electrolysis we followed the exact fe ec electrolysis protocol as employed by the local fe ec plant operators after filling the reactor tanks anodic fe 0 dissolution was initiated by applying a direct current of 150 a current density i 0 3 ma cm2 for approximately 90 min to the 32 electrodes housed in both tanks with a custom built power supply suresh electrical industries india under ambient atmospheric conditions a total coulombic dose of 450 c l 2 3 mm fe by faraday s law was applied in experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning described below following existing practices the total cell voltage was varied manually to maintain constant current throughout electrolysis the polarity of all electrodes was reversed after each experiment during electrolysis the solution was mixed by recirculating 5 25 reactor volumes per hour using a centrifugal pump these operating parameters were used in experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning 2 3 mechanical removal of the electrode surface layers electrode deep cleaning was performed by first removing all fe 0 plates from the reactor tanks and letting the electrodes air dry overnight on a clean floor cover when dried the mass of each electrode plate was measured using a hanging scale procured locally next selected surface layer sections were sampled for subsequent characterization by gently removing the layers with a brass scraper in the top middle and bottom regions of representative fe 0 plates since the solids accumulated on the electrode surface contained several layers a series of scrapings from the outer and inner layers at a single location was also collected in addition to surface layer samples the as laden fe iii precipitate sludge produced during routine fe ec treatment was collected from the fe ec plant tube settler the surface layers and raw sludge were stored in clean sealed plastic bags prior to analysis by x ray diffraction xrd x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and acid digestions after collecting surface layer samples from 10 different electrodes across both reactor tanks the remaining surface layers were removed from each electrode using angle grinders fit with a metallic wire brush for removing rust from steel personal protective equipment i e eye protection masks and appropriate clothing were used by all participants in the deep cleaning to maintain the structural integrity of the electrodes during deep cleaning minimal pressure was applied while using the angle grinders after electrode deep cleaning each fe 0 plate was rinsed with water to remove residual surface flakes and the electrodes were left to dry overnight the mass of each electrode was then measured again using a hanging scale to quantify mass loss from deep cleaning a high resolution digital camera was used to photograph the electrodes before and after deep cleaning the electrodes were then re inserted into their respective positions in the reactor tanks and were reconnected to the power supply 2 4 solid phase analysis major and minor mineral phases in the surface layers were identified by powder xrd and xas for xrd the surface layer samples were ground into a fine powder with a mortar and pestle a bruker d 8 diffractometer was used to collect the diffractograms cu k α radiation from 15 to 75 2θ 0 01 step sizes using a rotating sample stage x ray absorption spectra at the fe k edge were collected for a subset of samples at beam line 4 1 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource and at the dutch belgian beam line dubble bm 26a of the european synchrotron facility nikitenko et al 2008 borsboom et al 1998 additional details of xas data collection and analysis are provided in the esm the chemical composition of the solids was determined by digesting surface layer samples and the raw treatment sludge using an aqua regia solution 70 hno3 and 37 hcl 1 3 mol ratio following published protocols van genuchten et al 2016 the digestion was then analyzed for fe as p si ca and mn by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optima 8000 2 5 bulk solution and electrochemical measurements a series of water samples was collected at regular time intervals during fe 0 electrolysis before and after deep cleaning to evaluate the effect of surface layer removal on solution chemistry while the reactors were filling with groundwater aliquots of raw unfiltered water were collected in 15 ml sample vials for measurements of the initial electrolyte composition after applying the current unfiltered aliquots of the bulk solution were collected using a wide mouth pipette every 10 min during electrolysis for measurements of total fe generated by fe ec in addition filtered samples were collected at identical 10 min intervals by passing a suspension aliquot through 0 2 μm nylon filters for measurements of dissolved ions a few drops of concentrated nitric acid 70 were added to 5 ml of each filtered and unfiltered sample and the final volume was adjusted to 10 ml by adding di water all samples were sealed to the atmosphere and transported to the home institution for analysis of fe as p si ca and mn by icp oes bulk solution ph and do were measured initially and throughout electrolysis using a thermo scientific orion ph meter and hach ldo optical do probe respectively the initial ph and do were measured in rt1 at a depth of 25 cm before initiating electrolysis during electrolysis ph and do measurements were collected at 10 min intervals at the same location in rt1 the interfacial potentials ip of the electrodes anodes and cathodes were measured after the current stabilized 10 min after onset of electrolysis using an ag agcl reference electrode and a handheld multimeter fluke the ip of each electrode was measured by submerging the ag agcl reference electrode to a depth of 12 13 cm and placing the tip of the reference electrode adjacent to the fe 0 plate current flowing through each fe 0 plate was measured with a handheld ac dc clamp meter fluke 376 true rms all measurements except ph and do are plotted as an average of values from rt1 and rt2 identical protocols for bulk solution and electrochemical measurements were followed in experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning 3 results 3 1 macroscopic surface characteristics of the electrodes fig 2 shows the macroscopic surface characteristics of a representative fe 0 plate before fig 2a and after fig 2b electrode deep cleaning the surface of the fe 0 plate before cleaning fig 2a had three visually distinct regions labeled a i a ii and a iii based on color and surface texture the top approximately 1 3 of the plate a i was characterized by light orange surface layers with smooth uniform texture the middle region a ii which was also approximately 1 3 of the electrode showed black surface layers with a heterogeneous texture consisting of large 2 5 cm diameter oblate dome shaped blisters the bottom 1 3 of the electrode a iii was a closer match to the a i region but had thicker and dark orange surface layers covered with smaller 1 cm diameter blisters these three distinct regions were observed for both sides of every electrode except for those at the ends of each electrode assembly end plates e1 and e16 in rt1 and e17 and e32 in rt2 the sides of the four end plates that faced the bulk electrolyte displayed surface layers of uniform light orange color without blisters fig s2 the sides of these end plates that faced the electrode assembly resembled the remaining electrodes with a i a ii and a iii regions electrode deep cleaning described in section 2 3 removed significant quantities of the surface layers that had accumulated on the electrodes over two years on average 2 3 0 4 kg table s2 of surface layers was removed from each electrode which was 10 of the initial average electrode mass 21 7 0 6 kg removing the surface layers resulted in smooth black surfaces for all regions b i b ii and b iii fig 2b visual inspection of the electrodes after deep cleaning revealed a near complete transformation of the middle region b ii to a black heterogeneous texture rather than the smooth shiny surface indicative of fe 0 metal in the b i and b iii regions electrode deep cleaning around large blisters 2 5 cm diameter resulted in significant material loss in the form of large flakes 1 2 cm diameter 0 2 0 5 mm thickness which produced depressions in the electrodes additional cleaning around blisters in the middle of the electrode might have resulted in cleaner surfaces fig 2b but more rigorous cleaning was not attempted in this region to avoid structural damage to the electrode 3 2 surface layer characterization 3 2 1 mineralogy in fig 3 we present xrd patterns of surface layer samples from the three characteristic locations a i a ii and a iii showing different colors and textures for a representative electrode e31 in addition fig 3 presents the xrd patterns of samples collected at different depths of the surface layer at a single location e22 exterior interior the xrd patterns showed differences in the intensity of characteristic diffraction peaks depending on the sample location and depth for example the bragg diffraction peak of calcite caco3 is more intense in the sample collected from the a i region of the electrode which also had the lightest color bragg diffraction peaks from goethite α feooh and lepidocrocite γ feooh were also more apparent in the a i and a iii surface layers than in the a ii region peaks from calcite and lepidocrocite were absent in the xrd pattern of the sample collected from the black middle region a ii only peaks due to magnetite fe3o4 appeared in this diffractogram the extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra of the samples collected from the a i a ii and a iii regions showed trends consistent with the xrd patterns but suggest a larger contribution of disordered fe iii precipitates the exafs spectra of the a i and a iii surface layers display characteristic fingerprints of nanocrystalline 2 line ferrihydrite fig s4 which was not apparent in the corresponding xrd patterns the exafs spectrum of the a ii surface layer matched more closely that of magnetite comparing the diffractograms of samples collected from the interior and exterior of a single location fig 3 showed that the light colored exterior contained more fe iii precipitates and calcite whereas magnetite dominated the interior adjacent to the fe 0 metal fig 4 shows the powder xrd patterns of homogenized flakes 1 3 cm diameter of surface layers collected from 10 different electrodes all surface layer samples exhibited diffractograms with similar features but slightly varied peak amplitudes the diffractograms indicate that magnetite is a major component of the surface layers regardless of the plate position in the electrode assembly but we note that disordered fe iii precipitates could be present and not display strong peaks in the xrd patterns in addition to the widespread presence of magnetite nearly all surface layer samples showed bragg peaks from goethite and to a lesser extent lepidocrocite which is consistent with previous studies of the surface layers formed on fe ec electrodes over shorter timescales timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 bragg diffraction peaks for calcite were observed in many samples but were more intense in the light colored samples consistent with the xrd patterns of a i surface layers of e31 fig 3 3 2 2 chemical composition in table 1 we present the chemical composition of identical surface layer samples as those for which xrd patterns are given in fig 3 for comparison table 1 also lists the chemical composition of the air dried fe iii precipitate bulk sludge collected from the pilot plant tube settler after one fe ec run along the height of the plate the mass fraction of fe 532 g kg was highest in the a ii region consistent with the predominance of magnetite which has a higher theoretical fe mass fraction 724 g kg for fe3o4 than goethite 629 g kg for feooh and ferrihydrite 523 g kg for fe oh 3 in contrast the mass fractions of as 55 mg kg si 3 1 g kg and ca 1 9 g kg were lowest in the a ii region in general the a i and a iii regions contained the highest fraction of oxyanions as 72 158 mg kg si 5 4 5 5 g kg p 497 654 mg kg and ca 24 6 42 9 g kg which is consistent with the higher fraction of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates and calcite in these regions however mn had a relatively uniform distribution in the three regions 770 1060 mg kg within a single surface layer the mass fractions of all elements except fe were 2 5 times higher at the exterior than the interior table 1 all surface layer samples displayed higher mass fractions of fe 435 532 g kg than the air dried bulk treatment sludge generated during fe ec 186 g kg fe the bulk treatment sludge also contained 3 30 times higher oxyanion mass fractions table 1 than any of the surface layers by contrast the ca and mn mass fractions of the treatment sludge ca 71 3 g kg mn 885 mg kg were relatively similar to the electrode surface layers the overall trends in surface layer composition tabulated for electrode 31 e31 in table 1 were comparable for all measured surface layers collected from other electrodes table s2 3 3 behavior of the chemical composition of the bulk electrolyte 3 3 1 iron production in fig 5 we report the average concentration of total fe aqueous plus solid phase measured in the bulk electrolyte throughout electrolysis before and after electrode deep cleaning the gray bar in fig 5 represents the expected bulk fe concentration based on faraday s law assuming all charge passed through the anode goes to the production and release of fe ii to the bulk solution i e 100 faradaic efficiency before electrode deep cleaning the bulk fe concentration remained near its initial value of 13 7 2 2 mg l throughout the delivery of 450 c l indicating poor production of fe in the bulk solution by contrast the bulk fe concentration after electrode deep cleaning increased roughly linearly with electrolysis time leading to 41 5 mg l at the end of electrolysis although the fe level increased substantially after electrode deep cleaning the 41 5 mg l measured after cleaning is still below the expected concentration 117 2 mg l assuming 100 faradaic efficiency which could be due to inadequate mixing during electrolysis and settling of fe iii solids we also note that laboratory experiments using brand new electrodes of the same material as those of the fe ec pilot plant in the current investigation measured a faradaic efficiency in synthetic groundwater of approximately 80 müller et al 2019 3 3 2 dissolved arsenic phosphate silicate and manganese fig 6 compares the residual fractions of dissolved as p si and mn in the bulk solution before and after deep cleaning of electrode electrode cleaning resulted in more rapid removal of as p si and mn for example the as concentration decreased from the initial 164 9 μg l to 10 μg l within 60 min of electrolysis after electrode deep cleaning whereas 90 min of electrolysis was required to reach 10 μg l using uncleaned electrodes similar to as removal the removal of p was improved after electrode deep cleaning fig 6b shows that after 20 min of fe 0 electrolysis 98 of the initial 1 6 0 3 mg l p was removed after deep cleaning compared to just 74 at the same stage of electrolysis using uncleaned electrodes electrode deep cleaning also resulted in an increase in si removal initial si 15 3 1 7 mg l from nearly no removal with the uncleaned electrodes to 28 removal at the end of electrolysis with cleaned electrodes fig 6c consistent with the removal of oxyanions the removal fraction of initial mn 5 8 0 3 mg l increased from 12 before electrode deep cleaning to 21 fig 6d taken together electrode deep cleaning improved the removal of all measured species per kwh table s3 3 4 electrochemical parameters the behavior of the cell potential as a function of electrolysis time fig 7 was similar for experiments before and after deep cleaning with a rapid increase in voltage immediately after the onset of electrolysis followed by a gradual increase however the curve of the total cell potential was positioned 2 v lower for the experiment following electrode deep cleaning 6 2 9 9 v relative to that before cleaning 7 8 11 8 v this lower voltage required to pass the 150 a current resulted in lower energy consumed over the course of electrolysis from 2 2 kwh before cleaning to 1 6 kwh after cleaning consistent with the reduction in total cell potential after deep cleaning the average anodic interface potential became less positive decreasing from 3 0 0 9 to 2 1 0 6 v vs ag agcl for all anodes in rt1 and rt2 fig s5 the average cathodic interface potential also became less negative after deep cleaning 2 2 0 5 to 1 5 0 5 v vs ag agcl for all cathodes in rt1 and rt2 measurements of the current for individual plates table s4 indicated the 150 a applied to both rt1 and rt2 was well distributed 9 7 a per plate except for those facing the bulk electrolyte e1 e16 e17 e32 which had less current 7 1 a per plate 3 5 dissolved oxygen and ph fig 8 shows the behavior of the do and solution ph in the bulk electrolyte throughout electrolysis before and after electrode deep cleaning consistent with the reducing conditions of the aquifer that provided the raw water low initial do concentrations were measured before fe 0 electrolysis before deep cleaning the do concentration reached air saturation 9 mg l after 80 min of electrolysis where it stayed for the remainder of the experiment after deep cleaning the do level increased more slowly and stabilized near 7 mg l several mg l below the air saturated value the behavior of solution ph throughout electrolysis fig 8b followed similar trends for experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning in both sets of experiments the solution ph steadily increased during electrolysis consistent with cathodic h reduction to h2 g after a short 15 min lag where it stayed near its initial value of 7 1 although the shape of the ph curve as a function of electrolysis time was similar for experiments before and after deep cleaning the increase in ph with electrolysis time was smaller after electrode deep cleaning final ph near 7 5 than before deep cleaning final ph near 7 7 4 discussion 4 1 physical characteristics of surface layers formed during extended fe ec field treatment 4 1 1 formation of three distinct electrode surface regions the xrd and xas data of surface layer samples suggest widespread magnetite formation adjacent to the fe 0 metal i e the interior surface layer extending over the entire electrode surface with layers of calcite and fe iii precipitates adhered to the surface layer exterior of the a i and a iii regions the formation and growth of magnetite on fe ec electrodes has been documented by a number of field and laboratory fe ec studies müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 timmes et al 2010 the predominance of magnetite in our work is attributed to the initial product of fe ec treatment being fe ii and the high thermodynamic stability of magnetite across a wide range of solution composition i e ph redox conditions when fe ii is present cornell and schwertmann 2003 the existence of magnetite in the surface layer interior is a concern because it has been proposed to trap electrochemically generated fe ii which increases magnetite layer growth at the expense of fe ii transport to the bulk solution where as removal occurs magnetite formation is also important because its conductivity though lower than bare fe 0 metal is orders of magnitude higher than that of most fe iii precipitates e g lepidocrocite goethite and calcite which is beneficial for the flow of current the greater abundance of calcite and fe iii precipitates in the exterior surface layers of the a i and a iii regions is attributed to the design of the fe ec reactor though speculative one explanation for preferential calcite formation near the electrode top is the proximity of this region to the air water interface this proximity could facilitate calcite formation by more effective co2 g exchange with the atmosphere exsolving increases ph and favors calcite formation or by mixing induced splashes near the water surface enhancing evaporation and leading to locally increased ca2 and co3 2 activity the color and abundance of fe iii precipitates in the a iii region of all 32 electrodes is likely related to the accumulation of settled solids at the bottom of the reactor tanks due to the flat bottom of the reactor tanks and insufficient pumping of the post electrolysis suspension to the tube settler a constant layer of settled particles remained in the tanks after water transfer this layer of accumulated sludge consisted of the poorly ordered fe iii precipitates formed during typical fe ec treatment fig s4 and was 10 cm deep under stagnant conditions however when the tanks were filled and mixed a fraction of this layer became resuspended leading to a dense region of solids near the bottom of the reactor consistent with the adherence of orange poorly ordered fe iii precipitates to the a iii region of the electrode fig 2 fig s4 while the light colored surface layers in the a i and a iii regions can inhibit fe ii transport to the bulk solution similar to magnetite these surface layers also likely lead to inhomogeneous electron flow through the electrodes the insulating surface layer minerals e g calcite fe iii precipitates in the a i and a iii regions are expected to result in preferential electron flow through the a ii region this conclusion is consistent with the significant quantities of uncorroded fe 0 metal in the a i and a iii regions observed after deep cleaning fig 2b and only a few spots of bare fe 0 metal in the a ii region suggesting nearly complete electrochemical oxidation of the center of the electrode 4 1 2 blisters in addition to the three horizontal regions of distinct surface layers another major modification of the electrode surface was the formation of protruding blisters 2 5 cm wide of rusted fe 0 metal these blisters were most abundant and had the largest diameter in the a ii region fig 2b where the electrodes were likely most electrochemically active but blistering was also observed to a lesser extent in the a i and a iii regions these unique features can be explained by the cathodic reduction of h the reaction occurring at the cathode most commonly reported in the fe ec literature is the reduction of 2h to form h2 g that bubbles to the water surface however it is well documented that h reduction can also yield adsorbed h atoms that diffuse into the fe 0 crystal lattice to occupy microstructural defect sites such as vacancies dislocations and grain boundaries tiegel et al 2016 landolt 2007 jiang and carter 2004 at these sites h2 g build up from h atom recombination can create local areas of high internal pressure which causes deformation and pushes the material towards the electrode surface consistent with our observations of dome shaped blisters laureys et al 2017 escobar et al 2011 since the electrode polarity of the investigated fe ec system was reversed between every test i e each electrode served as cathode and anode every electrode was blistered the only regions without blisters were the sides of the four end plates e1 e16 e17 e32 facing the bulk electrolyte fig s2 which is consistent with their lower current and interface potentials table s4 fig s5 the formation of relatively large blisters is a concern for fe ec system operation because they worsen the structural integrity of the fe 0 electrodes because fe ec is based on forming fe ii by the oxidation of the fe 0 anode often termed the sacrificial anode it is inevitable that the electrodes must be replaced when all fe 0 metal has been oxidized however the electrodes must be replaced more quickly if uncorroded fe 0 is still present but the electrodes fail structurally in our work deep cleaning of a blister on one electrode removed a large flake of magnetite leaving a small hole in the plate removal of many similarly large flakes could therefore result in large holes and failure of the electrode structure which would lead to the premature loss of beneficial uncorroded fe 0 metal however we note that so long as the structural integrity of the electrode is maintained the formation of large blisters is expected to be less consequential to fe ec performance than the coating of insulating layers of calcite and fe iii precipitates 4 2 influence of electrode deep cleaning on solution chemistry 4 2 1 iron the optimization of fe ec performance relies on efficient electrochemical fe ii production and transport to the bulk solution we found that electrode deep cleaning increased the bulk fe concentration after electrolysis from 15 mg l to 41 5 mg l a nearly 3 fold improvement and decreased the total cell voltage by 2v we note that bulk fe levels might have continued to increase following the electrolysis stage due to insufficient electrolyte mixing but no measurements were collected after the current stopped this clear improvement in fe release to solution after electrode deep cleaning provides compelling field based evidence to confirm the hypothesis that electrode surface layers block the transport of electrochemically generated fe ii to the bulk electrolyte because the production and release of fe ii from the electrode initiates the removal of many chemical species in fe ec the increased bulk fe level coincided with more effective removal of as p si and mn and modified the behavior of do and solution ph the chemical dynamics of as do and ph before and after cleaning are discussed below with p si and mn removal described in section s2 of the esm 4 2 2 arsenic before deep cleaning 90 min of fe 0 electrolysis was required to remove 164 9 μg l as to below the 10 μg l who mcl which equated to 2 2 kwh average voltage of 9 9 v it is noteworthy that the uncleaned electrodes still achieved adequate as removal despite poor bulk fe production which could be partly due to the high raw water fe content and the resuspension of reactive fe iii precipitates that had settled in the reactor tank bottoms during previous runs after deep cleaning only 60 min of electrolysis was required to achieve 10 μg l as which equated to 1 3 kwh average voltage of 8 4 v therefore if electrolysis ceased after 60 min when the as level decreased to 10 μg l the as removal efficiency would be nearly twice as high after electrode deep cleaning increase from 72 9 to 128 4 μg l as per kwh however additional electrolysis time included as a factor of safety resulted in only 20 higher as removal efficiency after electrode deep cleaning increase from 72 9 to 86 4 μg l kwh previous laboratory studies of fe ec systems operated at similar charge dosage rates as the pilot plant indicate that arsenic removal typically proceeds through a two step pathway van genuchten et al 2012 2020 i oxidation of arsenite as iii the dominant species in reduced aquifers roberts et al 2004 by reactive fenton type oxidants e g fe iv generated by fe ii reactions with do and ii arsenate as v sorption to co precipitating fe iii oxyhydr oxides this reaction pathway is supported by as k edge xas measurements of the arsenic rich sludge collected directly from the pilot plant which indicated that as v is the overwhelmingly dominant form of arsenic bound to the solids roy et al 2019 since both reaction steps are initiated by fe ii the improvement in as removal efficiency can be explained by the increased bulk fe concentration and the lower total cell voltage hence lower electrical energy consumption after electrode deep cleaning we note briefly here that while the sludge contains strongly sorbing as v appropriate sludge disposal is still necessary because aqueous as can leach even from as v rich fe iii precipitates when the solids are exposed to reducing conditions e g organic rich soils in the short term the sludge generated at the plant is being used by researchers at jadavpur university for investigating its immobilization in concrete blocks roy et al 2019 for the long term a contract has been signed with a state approved hazardous waste disposal company ramky ltd for removing sludge for storage at a hazardous chemical waste disposal site at haldia west bengal hernandez et al 2019 another outcome of removing and characterizing the electrode surface layers is the ability to perform a mass balance calculation of as on a large fe ec system to confirm the as removal location averaging the composition of surface layer samples measured in this work table s2 gives a surface layer as content of 51 7 39 5 mg kg multiplying this value by the surface layer mass removed during deep cleaning gives a total of 3 82 2 92 g of as attached to the electrode during the two years of surface layer growth the plant treated 900 m3 of groundwater from 164 9 to 10 μg l as i e at least 154 μg l removed yielding 138 6 g of total as removed these calculations indicate that as attachment to the electrode surface accounted for 3 of total removal which supports the conclusion that as is removed dominantly by sorption to fe iii precipitates in the bulk kumar et al 2004 we note that the as content of the light colored layers was several times higher than for magnetite suggesting that the as fraction bound to the electrodes would decrease further if fe iii precipitate build up on the electrode was avoided 4 2 3 dissolved oxygen and solution ph in addition to altering the dynamics of ion removal electrode deep cleaning also affected the behavior of do and solution ph measurements of do during experiments with both unclean and clean electrodes revealed a continuous increase from the low initial value 2 0 mg l throughout electrolysis which indicates that the flux of atmospheric o2 into the electrolyte was greater than o2 consumption during fe ec treatment however the final do was 2 mg l lower after deep cleaning than before which can be explained by the more efficient production of fe ii with clean electrodes which consumes do to form fe iii precipitates delaire et al 2017 in experiments with both unclean and clean electrodes the solution ph increased steadily during electrolysis which is explained by a combination of both co2 g outgassing and the consumption of h ions at the cathode however after deep cleaning the ph increase was 0 15 0 2 log units lower than before deep cleaning this result is attributed to the higher bulk fe concentration after deep cleaning because fe ii oxidation and fe iii hydrolysis consumes oh thus lowering ph 4 3 recommendations for maintaining and operating fe ec systems proper maintenance of water treatment technologies is critical to ensure their sustained operation in optimal conditions this is particularly important when operating in rural resource poor areas where small changes in overall treatment costs and power consumption can render technologies ineffective or economically non viable in our study we investigated one of the only documented fe ec pilot plants that has sustainably removed as from local groundwater in south asia for extended periods about 4 years at the time of this writing studying this unique system we found that mechanically removing the magnetite calcite and fe iii precipitate surface layers formed on fe 0 electrodes over extended operation improved dramatically the performance of the system for example surface layer removal resulted in a substantial increase in bulk fe production and a decrease in the voltage and hence in the electrical energy consumption required to pass the 150 a of current needed for treatment these improvements led to a significant increase in arsenic removal efficiency 128 4 μg l as removed per kwh after cleaning 72 9 μg l as removed per kwh before cleaning these results imply that periodic on schedule electrode cleaning to completely remove accumulated surface layers can help to sustain the performance of fe ec systems over year long timescales based on cost estimates of local labor and electricity use our cost benefit analysis table s5 suggests that the deep cleaning procedure was economically practical but we note that the success criteria for maintaining different fe ec plants will depend on regional costs of labor and electricity and several properties of the plant e g size influent arsenic concentration price of steel etc among the various approaches to maintain fe ec electrodes reported in the literature e g ultrasonic cleaning high electrolyte velocity gradients see section s3 in the esm mechanical abrasion is one of the most attractive for rural communities in south asia because this method is simple reliable and low cost amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 although this method requires some labor and equipment only three minimally trained workers were able to perform the deep cleaning in less than two days indicating the relative ease of the task this suggests that the entire procedure could be completed in a single weekend which would prevent disrupting water treatment and distribution to students teachers and staff during hours when the school that houses the pilot plant is open while polarity reversal has been proposed as a method to minimize surface layer growth our results suggest that this strategy had minimal effect which is consistent with a laboratory fe ec study showing polarity reversal actually increased surface layer growth over extended operation müller et al 2019 one promising alternative could be to operate the system at high current densities i e i 3 ma cm2 which was recently shown at the lab scale to limit surface layer formation müller et al 2019 but this approach has not been tested on large fe ec systems and can result in unacceptably high voltages hence we propose that mechanical deep cleaning is one of the most promising methods to improve bulk fe ii production and decrease energy requirements which is essential to achieve consistent as removal over sustained periods the precise timing of electrode cleaning will depend on the operating conditions and reactor design of the specific fe ec system but our study has uncovered some useful relationships to help optimize and simplify the cleaning schedule one of the most obvious indicators of fe ec performance and a useful trigger for electrode maintenance is the bulk fe concentration which could be monitored regularly using field test kits merrill et al 2009 however routine fe measurements require trained labor and can be prohibitively expensive particularly in poor decentralized communities instead a number of other indicators could be used including the do solution ph and total cell potential in our work we found that behaviors of the do ph and the cell voltage were all impacted by deep cleaning with systematic changes concomitant with an increase in bulk fe concentration these parameters are simple to measure using hand held devices with unambiguous numerical values as opposed to color based test kits therefore plant operators without formal education can easily track the behavior of the do ph and cell voltage and compare the values produced using clean electrodes with those of old electrodes to make more informed decisions of when to begin an electrode deep cleaning activity finally with respect to electrode blistering we found that intensive mechanical cleaning around blisters could lead to holes through the electrode which should be avoided to maintain the structural integrity of the electrode therefore we recommend that electrode deep cleaning preferentially targets the light colored external electrode surface layers which are significantly more insulating than the magnetite interior layers and are the region most likely to overlay bare fe 0 metal in addition different types of steel of can be used as the electrode material since the steel production process can impact the likelihood of blister formation for example a recent study showed that cold formed steel allows the growth of blisters more than recovered and recrystallized steel because of a greater number of structural defects laureys et al 2017 the electrode material used in the investigated fe ec system was cold formed steel which could contribute to the large sized blisters since h reduction is likely related to blister formation selecting electrode materials that favor other cathodic reactions such as carbon based air diffusion cathodes that reduce o2 form oh or h2o2 jiang et al 2018 could also prevent the electrode blistering observed in this work 5 conclusions thick surface layers formed on fe ec electrodes following operation over 2 years which inhibited fe ii transport to the bulk electrolyte surface layer growth occurred despite polarity reversal between cycles of operation three distinct horizontal surface layer regions formed fe iii precipitates calcite and magnetite at the top magnetite in the middle and fe iii precipitates and magnetite at the bottom the surface layer stratification is attributed to operating conditions and fe ec reactor design the middle region of all electrodes which was dominated by magnetite and likely the most electrochemically active area consisted of 2 5 cm blisters attributed to cathodic h reduction and h diffusion into the fe 0 metal mechanical removal of the surface layers increased substantially the bulk fe concentration decreased total cell voltage and improved the removal efficiency of as and other ions our work suggests that periodic on schedule electrode cleaning

18007,iron electrocoagulation fe ec is an effective technology to remove arsenic as from groundwater used for drinking a commonly noted limitation of fe ec is fouling or passivation of electrode surfaces via rust accumulation over long term use in this study we examined the effect of removing electrode surface layers on the performance of a large scale 10 000 l d capacity fe ec plant in west bengal india we also characterized the layers formed on the electrodes in active use for over 2 years at this plant the electrode surfaces developed three distinct horizontal sections of layers that consisted of different minerals calcite fe iii precipitates and magnetite near the top magnetite in the middle and fe iii precipitates and magnetite near the bottom the interior of all surface layers adjacent to the fe 0 metal was dominated by magnetite we determined the impact of surface layer removal by mechanical abrasion on fe ec performance by measuring solution composition as fe p si mn ca ph do and electrochemical parameters total cell voltage and electrode interface potentials during electrolysis after electrode cleaning the fe concentration in the bulk solution increased substantially from 15 2 to 41 5 mg l this higher fe concentration led to increased removal of a number of solutes for as the concentration reached below the 10 μg l who mcl more rapidly and with less total fe consumed i e less electrical energy after cleaning 128 4 μg l as removed per kwh compared to before cleaning 72 9 μg l as removed per kwh similarly the removal of p and si improved after cleaning by 0 3 mg l kwh and 1 1 mg l kwh respectively our results show that mechanically removing the surface layers that accumulate on electrodes over extended periods of fe ec operation can restore fe ec system efficiency concentration of solute removed kwh delivered since fe release into the bulk solution substantially increased upon electrode cleaning our results also suggest that routine

effectively remove arsenic to below the world health organization who maximum contaminant limit mcl of 10 μg l who 2018 rigorous field based investigations of fe ec treatment remain poorly documented in the peer reviewed literature especially for large scale plants operated over extended periods investigations of pilot scale treatment systems are essential to characterize and address the technical challenges that arise when treatment methods emerge from the laboratory and begin extended operation in the field in the few field based investigations of fe ec systems in the literature it is commonly reported that resistive rust surface layers form on the surfaces of fe 0 electrodes over extended operating cycles amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 these surface layers have been proposed to reduce the contaminant removal efficiency herein defined as the concentration of solute removed per electrical energy delivered μg l or mg l per kwh of fe ec systems although some studies have characterized the surface layer mineralogy timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 the role of surface layer growth on the performance of fe ec systems is not well understood in theory surface layer growth can impact several aspects of ec treatment first electrochemically generated fe ii can be trapped in the electrode surface layer which would decrease the amount of fe ii transported to the bulk solution where it forms fe iii precipitates that bind solutes such as arsenic as phosphate p and silica si second if the surface layer consists of poorly conducting fe minerals e g goethite lepidocrocite the rust build up would increase the charge transfer resistance which increases the electrical energy required to pass current and could increase the interface overpotential enough to favor anodic oxidation of h2o to o2 instead of fe 0 to fe ii van genuchten et al 2017 since the formation and growth of surface layers can decrease the contaminant removal efficiency via these processes surface layer removal is likely an effective method to increase or maintain the performance of fe ec systems various techniques to mitigate surface layer growth have been proposed in the literature such as altering the frequency with which the electrode polarity is reversed manipulating the electrode storage conditions air dried vs wet storage and periodic removal of the surface layers by mechanical abrasion of these methods mechanical removal of the surface layers seems to be one of the most promising strategies for example in a recent extended laboratory study müller et al 2019 found that alternating the electrode polarity actually increased the surface layer mass and varying the electrode storage conditions during inactive cycles was ineffective at preventing surface layer growth by contrast periodic mechanical electrode cleaning after days to weeks of operation effectively restored fe ec performance in the lab müller et al 2019 and is an attractive field based approach because it is simple and requires only minimal low cost labor without hazardous chemicals amrose et al 2014 nikolaev et al 1982 however few studies describe how the fe ec performance changes as a result of thorough electrode cleaning i e with mechanical abrasion to completely remove hard layers of rust build up and no studies have investigated fe ec field systems with large electrodes 18 000 cm2 per electrode that have operated over extended periods understanding how mechanical electrode cleaning impacts the performance of fully operational fe ec systems would help practitioners optimize plant maintenance and operation and can be used to improve predictions of the long term efficiency of fe ec systems the objective of this work is to characterize the extent to which deep mechanical cleaning of the electrodes restores the performance of a pilot scale fe ec field system in a case where the electrodes had not been cleaned after two years of use in operation about 8 h per day 2 4 days per week for the purpose of this work we use the term deep cleaning to indicate thorough surface layer removal by mechanical abrasion with a hand held angle grinder followed by electrode rinsing with water to this end we performed a set of experiments at an existing fe ec plant actively treating arsenic contaminated groundwater for drinking at a rural school near kolkata india to understand the effect of deep cleaning on fe ec system performance we compared an exhaustive series of chemical as fe p si mn ph do and electrochemical measurements total cell potential electrode interface potentials before and after electrode deep cleaning we also investigated the macroscopic 1 mm surface layer properties using a high resolution digital camera and determined the surface layer mineralogy and composition using x ray diffraction xrd x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and wet chemical techniques our results reveal significant improvements in the contaminant removal efficiency and operating costs of fe ec treatment following electrode deep cleaning our field based fe ec investigation provides important complementary perspectives to results derived from laboratory based fe ec studies both of which are required for a complete understanding of the potential of fe ec to sustainably improve safe water access in rural

atmospheric conditions a total coulombic dose of 450 c l 2 3 mm fe by faraday s law was applied in experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning described below following existing practices the total cell voltage was varied manually to maintain constant current throughout electrolysis the polarity of all electrodes was reversed after each experiment during electrolysis the solution was mixed by recirculating 5 25 reactor volumes per hour using a centrifugal pump these operating parameters were used in experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning 2 3 mechanical removal of the electrode surface layers electrode deep cleaning was performed by first removing all fe 0 plates from the reactor tanks and letting the electrodes air dry overnight on a clean floor cover when dried the mass of each electrode plate was measured using a hanging scale procured locally next selected surface layer sections were sampled for subsequent characterization by gently removing the layers with a brass scraper in the top middle and bottom regions of representative fe 0 plates since the solids accumulated on the electrode surface contained several layers a series of scrapings from the outer and inner layers at a single location was also collected in addition to surface layer samples the as laden fe iii precipitate sludge produced during routine fe ec treatment was collected from the fe ec plant tube settler the surface layers and raw sludge were stored in clean sealed plastic bags prior to analysis by x ray diffraction xrd x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and acid digestions after collecting surface layer samples from 10 different electrodes across both reactor tanks the remaining surface layers were removed from each electrode using angle grinders fit with a metallic wire brush for removing rust from steel personal protective equipment i e eye protection masks and appropriate clothing were used by all participants in the deep cleaning to maintain the structural integrity of the electrodes during deep cleaning minimal pressure was applied while using the angle grinders after electrode deep cleaning each fe 0 plate was rinsed with water to remove residual surface flakes and the electrodes were left to dry overnight the mass of each electrode was then measured again using a hanging scale to quantify mass loss from deep cleaning a high resolution digital camera was used to photograph the electrodes before and after deep cleaning the electrodes were then re inserted into their respective positions in the reactor tanks and were reconnected to the power supply 2 4 solid phase analysis major and minor mineral phases in the surface layers were identified by powder xrd and xas for xrd the surface layer samples were ground into a fine powder with a mortar and pestle a bruker d 8 diffractometer was used to collect the diffractograms cu k α radiation from 15 to 75 2θ 0 01 step sizes using a rotating sample stage x ray absorption spectra at the fe k edge were collected for a subset of samples at beam line 4 1 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource and at the dutch belgian beam line dubble bm 26a of the european synchrotron facility nikitenko et al 2008 borsboom et al 1998 additional details of xas data collection and analysis are provided in the esm the chemical composition of the solids was determined by digesting surface layer samples and the raw treatment sludge using an aqua regia solution 70 hno3 and 37 hcl 1 3 mol ratio following published protocols van genuchten et al 2016 the digestion was then analyzed for fe as p si ca and mn by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optima 8000 2 5 bulk solution and electrochemical measurements a series of water samples was collected at regular time intervals during fe 0 electrolysis before and after deep cleaning to evaluate the effect of surface layer removal on solution chemistry while the reactors were filling with groundwater aliquots of raw unfiltered water were collected in 15 ml sample vials for measurements of the initial electrolyte composition after applying the current unfiltered aliquots of the bulk solution were collected using a wide mouth pipette every 10 min during electrolysis for measurements of total fe generated by fe ec in addition filtered samples were collected at identical 10 min intervals by passing a suspension aliquot through 0 2 μm nylon filters for measurements of dissolved ions a few drops of concentrated nitric acid 70 were added to 5 ml of each filtered and unfiltered sample and the final volume was adjusted to 10 ml by adding di water all samples were sealed to the atmosphere and transported to the home institution for analysis of fe as p si ca and mn by icp oes bulk solution ph and do were measured initially and throughout electrolysis using a thermo scientific orion ph meter and hach ldo optical do probe respectively the initial ph and do were measured in rt1 at a depth of 25 cm before initiating electrolysis during electrolysis ph and do measurements were collected at 10 min intervals at the same location in rt1 the interfacial potentials ip of the electrodes anodes and cathodes were measured after the current stabilized 10 min after onset of electrolysis using an ag agcl reference electrode and a handheld multimeter fluke the ip of each electrode was measured by submerging the ag agcl reference electrode to a depth of 12 13 cm and placing the tip of the reference electrode adjacent to the fe 0 plate current flowing through each fe 0 plate was measured with a handheld ac dc clamp meter fluke 376 true rms all measurements except ph and do are plotted as an average of values from rt1 and rt2 identical protocols for bulk solution and electrochemical measurements were followed in experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning 3 results 3 1 macroscopic surface characteristics of the electrodes fig 2 shows the macroscopic surface characteristics of a representative fe 0 plate before fig 2a and after fig 2b electrode deep cleaning the surface of the fe 0 plate before cleaning fig 2a had three visually distinct regions labeled a i a ii and a iii based on color and surface texture the top approximately 1 3 of the plate a i was characterized by light orange surface layers with smooth uniform texture the middle region a ii which was also approximately 1 3 of the electrode showed black surface layers with a heterogeneous texture consisting of large 2 5 cm diameter oblate dome shaped blisters the bottom 1 3 of the electrode a iii was a closer match to the a i region but had thicker and dark orange surface layers covered with smaller 1 cm diameter blisters these three distinct regions were observed for both sides of every electrode except for those at the ends of each electrode assembly end plates e1 and e16 in rt1 and e17 and e32 in rt2 the sides of the four end plates that faced the bulk electrolyte displayed surface layers of uniform light orange color without blisters fig s2 the sides of these end plates that faced the electrode assembly resembled the remaining electrodes with a i a ii and a iii regions electrode deep cleaning described in section 2 3 removed significant quantities of the surface layers that had accumulated on the electrodes over two years on average 2 3 0 4 kg table s2 of surface layers was removed from each electrode which was 10 of the initial average electrode mass 21 7 0 6 kg removing the surface layers resulted in smooth black surfaces for all regions b i b ii and b iii fig 2b visual inspection of the electrodes after deep cleaning revealed a near complete transformation of the middle region b ii to a black heterogeneous texture rather than the smooth shiny surface indicative of fe 0 metal in the b i and b iii regions electrode deep cleaning around large blisters 2 5 cm diameter resulted in significant material loss in the form of large flakes 1 2 cm diameter 0 2 0 5 mm thickness which produced depressions in the electrodes additional cleaning around blisters in the middle of the electrode might have resulted in cleaner surfaces fig 2b but more rigorous cleaning was not attempted in this region to avoid structural damage to the electrode 3 2 surface layer characterization 3 2 1 mineralogy in fig 3 we present xrd patterns of surface layer samples from the three characteristic locations a i a ii and a iii showing different colors and textures for a representative electrode e31 in addition fig 3 presents the xrd patterns of samples collected at different depths of the surface layer at a single location e22 exterior interior the xrd patterns showed differences in the intensity of characteristic diffraction peaks depending on the sample location and depth for example the bragg diffraction peak of calcite caco3 is more intense in the sample collected from the a i region of the electrode which also had the lightest color bragg diffraction peaks from goethite α feooh and lepidocrocite γ feooh were also more apparent in the a i and a iii surface layers than in the a ii region peaks from calcite and lepidocrocite were absent in the xrd pattern of the sample collected from the black middle region a ii only peaks due to magnetite fe3o4 appeared in this diffractogram the extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra of the samples collected from the a i a ii and a iii regions showed trends consistent with the xrd patterns but suggest a larger contribution of disordered fe iii precipitates the exafs spectra of the a i and a iii surface layers display characteristic fingerprints of nanocrystalline 2 line ferrihydrite fig s4 which was not apparent in the corresponding xrd patterns the exafs spectrum of the a ii surface layer matched more closely that of magnetite comparing the diffractograms of samples collected from the interior and exterior of a single location fig 3 showed that the light colored exterior contained more fe iii precipitates and calcite whereas magnetite dominated the interior adjacent to the fe 0 metal fig 4 shows the powder xrd patterns of homogenized flakes 1 3 cm diameter of surface layers collected from 10 different electrodes all surface layer samples exhibited diffractograms with similar features but slightly varied peak amplitudes the diffractograms indicate that magnetite is a major component of the surface layers regardless of the plate position in the electrode assembly but we note that disordered fe iii precipitates could be present and not display strong peaks in the xrd patterns in addition to the widespread presence of magnetite nearly all surface layer samples showed bragg peaks from goethite and to a lesser extent lepidocrocite which is consistent with previous studies of the surface layers formed on fe ec electrodes over shorter timescales timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 bragg diffraction peaks for calcite were observed in many samples but were more intense in the light colored samples consistent with the xrd patterns of a i surface layers of e31 fig 3 3 2 2 chemical composition in table 1 we present the chemical composition of identical surface layer samples as those for which xrd patterns are given in fig 3 for comparison table 1 also lists the chemical composition of the air dried fe iii precipitate bulk sludge collected from the pilot plant tube settler after one fe ec run along the height of the plate the mass fraction of fe 532 g kg was highest in the a ii region consistent with the predominance of magnetite which has a higher theoretical fe mass fraction 724 g kg for fe3o4 than goethite 629 g kg for feooh and ferrihydrite 523 g kg for fe oh 3 in contrast the mass fractions of as 55 mg kg si 3 1 g kg and ca 1 9 g kg were lowest in the a ii region in general the a i and a iii regions contained the highest fraction of oxyanions as 72 158 mg kg si 5 4 5 5 g kg p 497 654 mg kg and ca 24 6 42 9 g kg which is consistent with the higher fraction of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates and calcite in these regions however mn had a relatively uniform distribution in the three regions 770 1060 mg kg within a single surface layer the mass fractions of all elements except fe were 2 5 times higher at the exterior than the interior table 1 all surface layer samples displayed higher mass fractions of fe 435 532 g kg than the air dried bulk treatment sludge generated during fe ec 186 g kg fe the bulk treatment sludge also contained 3 30 times higher oxyanion mass fractions table 1 than any of the surface layers by contrast the ca and mn mass fractions of the treatment sludge ca 71 3 g kg mn 885 mg kg were relatively similar to the electrode surface layers the overall trends in surface layer composition tabulated for electrode 31 e31 in table 1 were comparable for all measured surface layers collected from other electrodes table s2 3 3 behavior of the chemical composition of the bulk electrolyte 3 3 1 iron production in fig 5 we report the average concentration of total fe aqueous plus solid phase measured in the bulk electrolyte throughout electrolysis before and after electrode deep cleaning the gray bar in fig 5 represents the expected bulk fe concentration based on faraday s law assuming all charge passed through the anode goes to the production and release of fe ii to the bulk solution i e 100 faradaic efficiency before electrode deep cleaning the bulk fe concentration remained near its initial value of 13 7 2 2 mg l throughout the delivery of 450 c l indicating poor production of fe in the bulk solution by contrast the bulk fe concentration after electrode deep cleaning increased roughly linearly with electrolysis time leading to 41 5 mg l at the end of electrolysis although the fe level increased substantially after electrode deep cleaning the 41 5 mg l measured after cleaning is still below the expected concentration 117 2 mg l assuming 100 faradaic efficiency which could be due to inadequate mixing during electrolysis and settling of fe iii solids we also note that laboratory experiments using brand new electrodes of the same material as those of the fe ec pilot plant in the current investigation measured a faradaic efficiency in synthetic groundwater of approximately 80 müller et al 2019 3 3 2 dissolved arsenic phosphate silicate and manganese fig 6 compares the residual fractions of dissolved as p si and mn in the bulk solution before and after deep cleaning of electrode electrode cleaning resulted in more rapid removal of as p si and mn for example the as concentration decreased from the initial 164 9 μg l to 10 μg l within 60 min of electrolysis after electrode deep cleaning whereas 90 min of electrolysis was required to reach 10 μg l using uncleaned electrodes similar to as removal the removal of p was improved after electrode deep cleaning fig 6b shows that after 20 min of fe 0 electrolysis 98 of the initial 1 6 0 3 mg l p was removed after deep cleaning compared to just 74 at the same stage of electrolysis using uncleaned electrodes electrode deep cleaning also resulted in an increase in si removal initial si 15 3 1 7 mg l from nearly no removal with the uncleaned electrodes to 28 removal at the end of electrolysis with cleaned electrodes fig 6c consistent with the removal of oxyanions the removal fraction of initial mn 5 8 0 3 mg l increased from 12 before electrode deep cleaning to 21 fig 6d taken together electrode deep cleaning improved the removal of all measured species per kwh table s3 3 4 electrochemical parameters the behavior of the cell potential as a function of electrolysis time fig 7 was similar for experiments before and after deep cleaning with a rapid increase in voltage immediately after the onset of electrolysis followed by a gradual increase however the curve of the total cell potential was positioned 2 v lower for the experiment following electrode deep cleaning 6 2 9 9 v relative to that before cleaning 7 8 11 8 v this lower voltage required to pass the 150 a current resulted in lower energy consumed over the course of electrolysis from 2 2 kwh before cleaning to 1 6 kwh after cleaning consistent with the reduction in total cell potential after deep cleaning the average anodic interface potential became less positive decreasing from 3 0 0 9 to 2 1 0 6 v vs ag agcl for all anodes in rt1 and rt2 fig s5 the average cathodic interface potential also became less negative after deep cleaning 2 2 0 5 to 1 5 0 5 v vs ag agcl for all cathodes in rt1 and rt2 measurements of the current for individual plates table s4 indicated the 150 a applied to both rt1 and rt2 was well distributed 9 7 a per plate except for those facing the bulk electrolyte e1 e16 e17 e32 which had less current 7 1 a per plate 3 5 dissolved oxygen and ph fig 8 shows the behavior of the do and solution ph in the bulk electrolyte throughout electrolysis before and after electrode deep cleaning consistent with the reducing conditions of the aquifer that provided the raw water low initial do concentrations were measured before fe 0 electrolysis before deep cleaning the do concentration reached air saturation 9 mg l after 80 min of electrolysis where it stayed for the remainder of the experiment after deep cleaning the do level increased more slowly and stabilized near 7 mg l several mg l below the air saturated value the behavior of solution ph throughout electrolysis fig 8b followed similar trends for experiments before and after electrode deep cleaning in both sets of experiments the solution ph steadily increased during electrolysis consistent with cathodic h reduction to h2 g after a short 15 min lag where it stayed near its initial value of 7 1 although the shape of the ph curve as a function of electrolysis time was similar for experiments before and after deep cleaning the increase in ph with electrolysis time was smaller after electrode deep cleaning final ph near 7 5 than before deep cleaning final ph near 7 7 4 discussion 4 1 physical characteristics of surface layers formed during extended fe ec field treatment 4 1 1 formation of three distinct electrode surface regions the xrd and xas data of surface layer samples suggest widespread magnetite formation adjacent to the fe 0 metal i e the interior surface layer extending over the entire electrode surface with layers of calcite and fe iii precipitates adhered to the surface layer exterior of the a i and a iii regions the formation and growth of magnetite on fe ec electrodes has been documented by a number of field and laboratory fe ec studies müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 timmes et al 2010 the predominance of magnetite in our work is attributed to the initial product of fe ec treatment being fe ii and the high thermodynamic stability of magnetite across a wide range of solution composition i e ph redox conditions when fe ii is present cornell and schwertmann 2003 the existence of magnetite in the surface layer interior is a concern because it has been proposed to trap electrochemically generated fe ii which increases magnetite layer growth at the expense of fe ii transport to the bulk solution where as removal occurs magnetite formation is also important because its conductivity though lower than bare fe 0 metal is orders of magnitude higher than that of most fe iii precipitates e g lepidocrocite goethite and calcite which is beneficial for the flow of current the greater abundance of calcite and fe iii precipitates in the exterior surface layers of the a i and a iii regions is attributed to the design of the fe ec reactor though speculative one explanation for preferential calcite formation near the electrode top is the proximity of this region to the air water interface this proximity could facilitate calcite formation by more effective co2 g exchange with the atmosphere exsolving increases ph and favors calcite formation or by mixing induced splashes near the water surface enhancing evaporation and leading to locally increased ca2 and co3 2 activity the color and abundance of fe iii precipitates in the a iii region of all 32 electrodes is likely related to the accumulation of settled solids at the bottom of the reactor tanks due to the flat bottom of the reactor tanks and insufficient pumping of the post electrolysis suspension to the tube settler a constant layer of settled particles remained in the tanks after water transfer this layer of accumulated sludge consisted of the poorly ordered fe iii precipitates formed during typical fe ec treatment fig s4 and was 10 cm deep under stagnant conditions however when the tanks were filled and mixed a fraction of this layer became resuspended leading to a dense region of solids near the bottom of the reactor consistent with the adherence of orange poorly ordered fe iii precipitates to the a iii region of the electrode fig 2 fig s4 while the light colored surface layers in the a i and a iii regions can inhibit fe ii transport to the bulk solution similar to magnetite these surface layers also likely lead to inhomogeneous electron flow through the electrodes the insulating surface layer minerals e g calcite fe iii precipitates in the a i and a iii regions are expected to result in preferential electron flow through the a ii region this conclusion is consistent with the significant quantities of uncorroded fe 0 metal in the a i and a iii regions observed after deep cleaning fig 2b and only a few spots of bare fe 0 metal in the a ii region suggesting nearly complete electrochemical oxidation of the center of the electrode 4 1 2 blisters in addition to the three horizontal regions of distinct surface layers another major modification of the electrode surface was the formation of protruding blisters 2 5 cm wide of rusted fe 0 metal these blisters were most abundant and had the largest diameter in the a ii region fig 2b where the electrodes were likely most electrochemically active but blistering was also observed to a lesser extent in the a i and a iii regions these unique features can be explained by the cathodic reduction of h the reaction occurring at the cathode most commonly reported in the fe ec literature is the reduction of 2h to form h2 g that bubbles to the water surface however it is well documented that h reduction can also yield adsorbed h atoms that diffuse into the fe 0 crystal lattice to occupy microstructural defect sites such as vacancies dislocations and grain boundaries tiegel et al 2016 landolt 2007 jiang and carter 2004 at these sites h2 g build up from h atom recombination can create local areas of high internal pressure which causes deformation and pushes the material towards the electrode surface consistent with our observations of dome shaped blisters laureys et al 2017 escobar et al 2011 since the electrode polarity of the investigated fe ec system was reversed between every test i e each electrode served as cathode and anode every electrode was blistered the only regions without blisters were the sides of the four end plates e1 e16 e17 e32 facing the bulk electrolyte fig s2 which is consistent with their lower current and interface potentials table s4 fig s5 the formation of relatively large blisters is a concern for fe ec system operation because they worsen the structural integrity of the fe 0 electrodes because fe ec is based on forming fe ii by the oxidation of the fe 0 anode often termed the sacrificial anode it is inevitable that the electrodes must be replaced when all fe 0 metal has been oxidized however the electrodes must be replaced more quickly if uncorroded fe 0 is still present but the electrodes fail structurally in our work deep cleaning of a blister on one electrode removed a large flake of magnetite leaving a small hole in the plate removal of many similarly large flakes could therefore result in large holes and failure of the electrode structure which would lead to the premature loss of beneficial uncorroded fe 0 metal however we note that so long as the structural integrity of the electrode is maintained the formation of large blisters is expected to be less consequential to fe ec performance than the coating of insulating layers of calcite and fe iii precipitates 4 2 influence of electrode deep cleaning on solution chemistry 4 2 1 iron the optimization of fe ec performance relies on efficient electrochemical fe ii production and transport to the bulk solution we found that electrode deep cleaning increased the bulk fe concentration after electrolysis from 15 mg l to 41 5 mg l a nearly 3 fold improvement and decreased the total cell voltage by 2v we note that bulk fe levels might have continued to increase following the electrolysis stage due to insufficient electrolyte mixing but no measurements were collected after the current stopped this clear improvement in fe release to solution after electrode deep cleaning provides compelling field based evidence to confirm the hypothesis that electrode surface layers block the transport of electrochemically generated fe ii to the bulk electrolyte because the production and release of fe ii from the electrode initiates the removal of many chemical species in fe ec the increased bulk fe level coincided with more effective removal of as p si and mn and modified the behavior of do and solution ph the chemical dynamics of as do and ph before and after cleaning are discussed below with p si and mn removal described in section s2 of the esm 4 2 2 arsenic before deep cleaning 90 min of fe 0 electrolysis was required to remove 164 9 μg l as to below the 10 μg l who mcl which equated to 2 2 kwh average voltage of 9 9 v it is noteworthy that the uncleaned electrodes still achieved adequate as removal despite poor bulk fe production which could be partly due to the high raw water fe content and the resuspension of reactive fe iii precipitates that had settled in the reactor tank bottoms during previous runs after deep cleaning only 60 min of electrolysis was required to achieve 10 μg l as which equated to 1 3 kwh average voltage of 8 4 v therefore if electrolysis ceased after 60 min when the as level decreased to 10 μg l the as removal efficiency would be nearly twice as high after electrode deep cleaning increase from 72 9 to 128 4 μg l as per kwh however additional electrolysis time included as a factor of safety resulted in only 20 higher as removal efficiency after electrode deep cleaning increase from 72 9 to 86 4 μg l kwh previous laboratory studies of fe ec systems operated at similar charge dosage rates as the pilot plant indicate that arsenic removal typically proceeds through a two step pathway van genuchten et al 2012 2020 i oxidation of arsenite as iii the dominant species in reduced aquifers roberts et al 2004 by reactive fenton type oxidants e g fe iv generated by fe ii reactions with do and ii arsenate as v sorption to co precipitating fe iii oxyhydr oxides this reaction pathway is supported by as k edge xas measurements of the arsenic rich sludge collected directly from the pilot plant which indicated that as v is the overwhelmingly dominant form of arsenic bound to the solids roy et al 2019 since both reaction steps are initiated by fe ii the improvement in as removal efficiency can be explained by the increased bulk fe concentration and the lower total cell voltage hence lower electrical energy consumption after electrode deep cleaning we note briefly here that while the sludge contains strongly sorbing as v appropriate sludge disposal is still necessary because aqueous as can leach even from as v rich fe iii precipitates when the solids are exposed to reducing conditions e g organic rich soils in the short term the sludge generated at the plant is being used by researchers at jadavpur university for investigating its immobilization in concrete blocks roy et al 2019 for the long term a contract has been signed with a state approved hazardous waste disposal company ramky ltd for removing sludge for storage at a hazardous chemical waste disposal site at haldia west bengal hernandez et al 2019 another outcome of removing and characterizing the electrode surface layers is the ability to perform a mass balance calculation of as on a large fe ec system to confirm the as removal location averaging the composition of surface layer samples measured in this work table s2 gives a surface layer as content of 51 7 39 5 mg kg multiplying this value by the surface layer mass removed during deep cleaning gives a total of 3 82 2 92 g of as attached to the electrode during the two years of surface layer growth the plant treated 900 m3 of groundwater from 164 9 to 10 μg l as i e at least 154 μg l removed yielding 138 6 g of total as removed these calculations indicate that as attachment to the electrode surface accounted for 3 of total removal which supports the conclusion that as is removed dominantly by sorption to fe iii precipitates in the bulk kumar et al 2004 we note that the as content of the light colored layers was several times higher than for magnetite suggesting that the as fraction bound to the electrodes would decrease further if fe iii precipitate build up on the electrode was avoided 4 2 3 dissolved oxygen and solution ph in addition to altering the dynamics of ion removal electrode deep cleaning also affected the behavior of do and solution ph measurements of do during experiments with both unclean and clean electrodes revealed a continuous increase from the low initial value 2 0 mg l throughout electrolysis which indicates that the flux of atmospheric o2 into the electrolyte was greater than o2 consumption during fe ec treatment however the final do was 2 mg l lower after deep cleaning than before which can be explained by the more efficient production of fe ii with clean electrodes which consumes do to form fe iii precipitates delaire et al 2017 in experiments with both unclean and clean electrodes the solution ph increased steadily during electrolysis which is explained by a combination of both co2 g outgassing and the consumption of h ions at the cathode however after deep cleaning the ph increase was 0 15 0 2 log units lower than before deep cleaning this result is attributed to the higher bulk fe concentration after deep cleaning because fe ii oxidation and fe iii hydrolysis consumes oh thus lowering ph 4 3 recommendations for maintaining and operating fe ec systems proper maintenance of water treatment technologies is critical to ensure their sustained operation in optimal conditions this is particularly important when operating in rural resource poor areas where small changes in overall treatment costs and power consumption can render technologies ineffective or economically non viable in our study we investigated one of the only documented fe ec pilot plants that has sustainably removed as from local groundwater in south asia for extended periods about 4 years at the time of this writing studying this unique system we found that mechanically removing the magnetite calcite and fe iii precipitate surface layers formed on fe 0 electrodes over extended operation improved dramatically the performance of the system for example surface layer removal resulted in a substantial increase in bulk fe production and a decrease in the voltage and hence in the electrical energy consumption required to pass the 150 a of current needed for treatment these improvements led to a significant increase in arsenic removal efficiency 128 4 μg l as removed per kwh after cleaning 72 9 μg l as removed per kwh before cleaning these results imply that periodic on schedule electrode cleaning to completely remove accumulated surface layers can help to sustain the performance of fe ec systems over year long timescales based on cost estimates of local labor and electricity use our cost benefit analysis table s5 suggests that the deep cleaning procedure was economically practical but we note that the success criteria for maintaining different fe ec plants will depend on regional costs of labor and electricity and several properties of the plant e g size influent arsenic concentration price of steel etc among the various approaches to maintain fe ec electrodes reported in the literature e g ultrasonic cleaning high electrolyte velocity gradients see section s3 in the esm mechanical abrasion is one of the most attractive for rural communities in south asia because this method is simple reliable and low cost amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 although this method requires some labor and equipment only three minimally trained workers were able to perform the deep cleaning in less than two days indicating the relative ease of the task this suggests that the entire procedure could be completed in a single weekend which would prevent disrupting water treatment and distribution to students teachers and staff during hours when the school that houses the pilot plant is open while polarity reversal has been proposed as a method to minimize surface layer growth our results suggest that this strategy had minimal effect which is consistent with a laboratory fe ec study showing polarity reversal actually increased surface layer growth over extended operation müller et al 2019 one promising alternative could be to operate the system at high current densities i e i 3 ma cm2 which was recently shown at the lab scale to limit surface layer formation müller et al 2019 but this approach has not been tested on large fe ec systems and can result in unacceptably high voltages hence we propose that mechanical deep cleaning is one of the most promising methods to improve bulk fe ii production and decrease energy requirements which is essential to achieve consistent as removal over sustained periods the precise timing of electrode cleaning will depend on the operating conditions and reactor design of the specific fe ec system but our study has uncovered some useful relationships to help optimize and simplify the cleaning schedule one of the most obvious indicators of fe ec performance and a useful trigger for electrode maintenance is the bulk fe concentration which could be monitored regularly using field test kits merrill et al 2009 however routine fe measurements require trained labor and can be prohibitively expensive particularly in poor decentralized communities instead a number of other indicators could be used including the do solution ph and total cell potential in our work we found that behaviors of the do ph and the cell voltage were all impacted by deep cleaning with systematic changes concomitant with an increase in bulk fe concentration these parameters are simple to measure using hand held devices with unambiguous numerical values as opposed to color based test kits therefore plant operators without formal education can easily track the behavior of the do ph and cell voltage and compare the values produced using clean electrodes with those of old electrodes to make more informed decisions of when to begin an electrode deep cleaning activity finally with respect to electrode blistering we found that intensive mechanical cleaning around blisters could lead to holes through the electrode which should be avoided to maintain the structural integrity of the electrode therefore we recommend that electrode deep cleaning preferentially targets the light colored external electrode surface layers which are significantly more insulating than the magnetite interior layers and are the region most likely to overlay bare fe 0 metal in addition different types of steel of can be used as the electrode material since the steel production process can impact the likelihood of blister formation for example a recent study showed that cold formed steel allows the growth of blisters more than recovered and recrystallized steel because of a greater number of structural defects laureys et al 2017 the electrode material used in the investigated fe ec system was cold formed steel which could contribute to the large sized blisters since h reduction is likely related to blister formation selecting electrode materials that favor other cathodic reactions such as carbon based air diffusion cathodes that reduce o2 form oh or h2o2 jiang et al 2018 could also prevent the electrode blistering observed in this work 5 conclusions thick surface layers formed on fe ec electrodes following operation over 2 years which inhibited fe ii transport to the bulk electrolyte surface layer growth occurred despite polarity reversal between cycles of operation three distinct horizontal surface layer regions formed fe iii precipitates calcite and magnetite at the top magnetite in the middle and fe iii precipitates and magnetite at the bottom the surface layer stratification is attributed to operating conditions and fe ec reactor design the middle region of all electrodes which was dominated by magnetite and likely the most electrochemically active area consisted of 2 5 cm blisters attributed to cathodic h reduction and h diffusion into the fe 0 metal mechanical removal of the surface layers increased substantially the bulk fe concentration decreased total cell voltage and improved the removal efficiency of as and other ions our work suggests that periodic on schedule electrode cleaning

poorly understood to examine the effect of wildfire residues on growth and die off of escherichia coli e coli a pathogen indicator we mixed stormwater with e coli and suspended particles from the pre and post wildfire area in batch reactors and monitored e coli concentration e coli grew initially in the presence of all particles but the relative e coli concentration was 10 times lower in the presence of wildfire residues than in natural soil from unaffected areas wildfire residues also decreased the persistence of e coli during a 15 day incubation period these results indicate that the growth or persistence of e coli in surface water in the presence of wildfire residues was less than that in the presence of unburned soil particles potentially due to depletion of nutrient concentration and or loss of viability of bacteria in the presence of wildfire residues to examine the transport potential of wildfire residues and their ability to facilitate the transport of e coli in the subsurface system suspensions containing wildfire residues and or e coli were injected through unsaturated sand columns a model subsurface system transport of wildfire residues in sand columns increased with decreases in the depth and increases in the concentration of particles but increased transport of wildfire residues did not result in the increased transport of e coli suggesting wildfire residues do not facilitate the transport of e coli overall the results indicate that wildfire residues may not increase the risk of the microbial contamination of surface water or groundwater

more than 15 based on a 2000 2050 meteorology prediction huang et al 2015 wildfire removes vegetation increases soil hydrophobicity and reduces infiltration thereby increasing the volume of stormwater runoff rodrigues et al 2019 furthermore compared with pre fire runoff post fire runoff could contain 1000 times more suspended particles and contaminants including traces of metals nutrients total suspended solids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons burke et al 2013 and it could affect the water quality of receiving water bodies and affect aquatic species silva et al 2016 although numerous

et al 2019 no study to date has examined the effect of wildfire on microbial contamination of surface water and groundwater via subsurface infiltration of stormwater containing wildfire residues and pathogen post wildfire runoff can carry wildfire residues and deposit them in surface waters or in the subsurface from where they can infiltrate into groundwater fig 1 thus wildfire residues could mix with pathogens present in surface waters or subsurface environment and affect their fate in these systems the fate of pathogens in surface water depends on water chemistry wang et al 2019 sunlight exposure nelson et al 2018 and the presence of particles which may protect pathogens from inactivation by sunlight exposure bohrerova and linden 2006 or provide nutrients chua et al 2009 for microbial growth on the other hand particles may release chemicals that are toxic to bacteria and kill them although wildfire events shift the microbial community in soil fultz et al 2016 it is not clear whether wildfire residues could increase or decrease the survival of pathogens in surface waters wildfire residues primarily consist of burnt biomass such as ash black carbon or charcoal and soil minerals all these particles have different chemical properties bodi et al 2014 preston et al 2017 which can affect the growth or decay of pathogen in water bacteria can colonize on black carbon and form biofilm which could protect them from disinfectants lechevallier et al 1984 small suspended solids 20 μm might induce the agglomeration of bacteria by acting as a condensation nucleus offering protection from antibacterial effects henao et al 2018 wildfire residues can also change the nutrient concentration in water thus wildfire residues could either help increase or decrease the viability of pathogens in surface water based on the chemical composition of water containing wildfire residues wildfire residues like natural soil colloids could be transported through the subsurface and facilitate the transport of pathogens to groundwater microbial contamination of groundwater has been associated with heavy rainfall events particularly in the beginning of the wet season wu et al 2016 under this condition the concentration of e coli and coliform bacteria in groundwater could increase partly due to particle facilitated transport of bacteria zeleznik et al 2011 the same process could be relevant after wildfire where the concentration of particles in the runoff increases by orders of magnitude due to post wildfire depletion of vegetation and intensification of erosion for colloid facilitated transport to be important in the subsurface environment wildfire residues or colloids must be transported through the subsurface and pathogens must remain attached and viable on wildfire residues however little is known about the effect of wildfire residues on growth or decay of pathogens in water conditions that may affect the infiltration of pathogens through subsurface soils include soil chemical properties clark and pitt 2007 infiltration rate mohanty and boehm 2014 and ph or chemical composition of infiltrating water pitt et al 1999 suspended particle type and concentration are critical in determining the relevance of the facilitated transport of pathogens in subsurface soil abusharar and salameh 1995 post wildfire the concentration of particles in runoff increases due to an increase in erosion lee et al 2016 an increase in particle concentration could decrease pathogen removal in the subsurface muirhead et al 2006 thereby facilitating infiltration through the subsurface fries et al 2006 jeng et al 2005 particles may also be filtered through subsurface soils thus it is important to compare the effect of wildfire residues with that of natural soil particles to help determine the fate and transport of pathogens in surface water and subsurface environment so that the effect of wildfire on the microbial quality of surface waters and groundwater can be assessed this study examines the effect of wildfire particles on bacterial viability and their transport through the subsurface we hypothesized that the microbial transport through the subsurface would increase in the presence of particles but the transport would depend on particle type due to the bacteria particle association additionally wildfire residues would decrease the viability of pathogens in surface waters due to the depletion of nutrients in wildfire eroded soils to test these hypotheses bacteria laden stormwater was injected at varying particle concentrations and subsurface depths and the effluent was monitored for e coli a pathogen indicator and total particle concentration the viability of e coli in stormwater was monitored over time in the presence of unburned soil wildfire residues and biochar a surrogate for black carbon generated during a wildfire 2 material and methods 2 1 stormwater collection stormwater was collected using 20 l carboys from ballona creek located in los angeles ca 34 0 36 n 118 23 29 w the stormwater from urban areas is expected to have a very different composition than stormwater from forest watersheds or other type of catchments nevertheless the ballona creek stormwater provides a natural water matrix for use in the study to examine the fate of e coli when the stormwater is mixed with runoff from wildfire affected areas the collected stormwater was left untouched for at least 24 h to settle large particles and the supernatant was transferred into 1 l glass containers and autoclaved at 121 c for 45 min the sterile stormwater was stored at 4 c before being used in the experiment we autoclaved the water to kill the native microorganisms to avoid competition with the added e coli for the available nutrients although autoclaving water may change the nutrient composition of stormwater the same water was used for all the experiments 2 2 post wildfire residues collection for the control study natural unburned soil was collected from the ballona wetlands 33 9713 118 4304 where there has been no fire occurrence in the last several decades after the woolsey fire in november 2018 recently burned soil with wildfire residues were collected from corral canyon park 34 0365 118 7223 and from malibu lagoon 34 0341 118 6812 the sampling locations were chosen based on the stormwater runoff route the samples were collected from the top 10 cm of soil using a sterilized spatula and stored at 4 c biochar particles biochar supreme everson wa were used as a surrogate for black carbon without soil 2 3 characterization of wildfire residues the postfire residues were characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy briefly the 13c cross polarization with magic angle spinning nmr spectrum was acquired on a bruker av iii hd 600 nmr spectrometer at a frequency of 150 9 mhz the fine wildfire residue was mixed thoroughly and a homogenous wildfire sample weighing 33 7 mg was packed in a 3 2 mm outside diameter zirconia rotor with a vespel cap a total of 59 657 scans were acquired with a sample spinning rate of 10 khz using a variable amplitude cross polarization sequence with a contact time of 2 ms and a recycle delay of 1 s the data was processed with 50 hz of line broadening the analysis was repeated twice with another set of burnt residue from the homogenous mixture to analyze the nutrient concentration leached from soil samples 4 0 g of different particle types were suspended into 40 ml of milli q water using a 50 ml centrifuge tube and the solution was shaken wrist action shaker burrel scientific for 24 h the particles were removed from the supernatant by centrifugation 5000 g for 15 min and the water chemistry of the supernatant was analyzed for nutrients nitrate nitrite and phosphate dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen the results were reported in supplementary material 2 4 suspended particles solution preparation to prepare suspended wildfire residues and unburned soil samples were first sieved to remove particulates larger than 45 μm and 2 g of the sieved sample was suspended in 1 l deionized water the suspension was placed in an ice bath and sonicated using a probe branson digital sonifier to enhance the dispersion of particles for 15 min on for 1 0 s off for 3 0 s the suspension was transferred into a 500 ml graduated cylinder and particles with a size greater than 10 μm were settled based on stokes law details in the supplementary material particles with size lower than 10 μm were isolated for the transport study because larger particles have limited potential for subsurface transport due to filtration and gravitational settling and are expected to be deposited on the surface 200 ml of the suspension was transferred into 50 ml centrifuge tubes centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min and 45 ml of the supernatant was discarded leaving behind 5 ml of concentrated particle suspension the stock suspension was shaken by hand and then sonicated for 1 min prior to its use in the experiments the particle size distribution of influent and effluent samples containing suspended solids was determined by analyzing 1 0 ml of the solution using a particle sizing analyzer system accusizer model 770 particle sizing systems which determines the concentration of particles per ml and the diameter of each particle ranging from 0 55 μm to 500 μm 2 5 e coli k 12 suspension suspension of e coli k 12 with resistance to kanamycin cas 25389 94 0 fisher bioreagents was prepared following the method described in a previous study mohanty and boehm 2014 although growth of bacteria could vary with strains foppen et al 2010 and stormwater may contain a wide range of bacterial strain we used this particular strain to eliminate growth of environmental e coli or potential contamination from natural dust during the experiment briefly a single colony of e coli was grown in luria bertani growth media lb broth miller fisher bioreagents and the e coli was separated from the media by centrifugation to remove the supernatant and washed with a phosphate buffered saline pbs solution the e coli stock solution was added to stormwater containing particles to achieve the desired final concentration 103 105 cfu ml 1 the range used in this study is within the expected concentration of e coli in stormwater or surface waters grebel et al 2013 for the column experiments the suspension was mixed for 120 min using an automated shaker to ensure attachment of bacteria on particles vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 2 6 growth and decay of e coli in the presence of post wildfire residues to examine if the presence of wildfire residues affects the growth and die off of e coli in the stormwater 50 ml of autoclaved stormwater spiked with 103 cfu ml 1 of e coli and 100 mg l 1 of suspended particles from different origins a control soil 3 soils with wildfire residues or biochar were mixed at 150 rpm in 100 ml glass flasks at 37 c for 15 days to identify the growth and die off of e coli in stormwater without particles the experiment was repeated without particles to monitor any change in concentration of e coli 500 μl samples were pipetted and analyzed for e coli at the following time intervals 0 3 0 8 1 2 3 4 7 9 11 and 15 days bacteria concentration was analyzed by inoculating 50 μl of the sample into lb agar plates with kanamycin following spread plate and counting techniques 2 plates per sample when the concentration was expected to be too high to count within range 300 cfu the pbs solution was used to dilute the sample to achieve bacteria counts between 30 and 300 cfu per plate however samples with low concentrations were not concentrated due to low sample volume and the resulting low colony count below 30 was included to estimate the concentration 2 7 sand columns as a model for subsurface sand filters were used as a model to examine if the wildfire residues could migrate through the subsurface into groundwater a coarse sand 20 30 standard sand certified mtp with grain diameters between 0 6 and 0 85 mm was used in this study to examine the worst case condition for subsurface infiltration sand was washed using deionized water for 10 min soaked in 1m hcl solution for 6 h and then washed multiple times with milli q water until the ph was near neutral pvc pipes 2 0 cm diameter and 35 cm height were used as columns a screen 100 μm pore size was placed at the bottom of the column before packing to prevent the sand particles from being washed away with the effluent columns were packed with sand in 15 g intervals to ensure they were packed uniformly deionized water was applied on the top of the sand surface at 9 0 ml min 1 for 4 h using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s digital drive cole parmer in order to equilibrate the flow and wash out any small sand colloids generated during packing details about the pore volume pv estimation by the bromide tracer are provided in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 supplementary material 2 8 effect of sand filters depth and suspended particle concentration on particle removal to examine the effect of subsurface depth on particle removal ten sand columns with different heights 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm were assembled in duplicate and autoclaved stormwater was injected at 9 0 ml min 1 to simulate pulse input 1 0 ml of suspension containing control unburned soil 4 0 g l 1 was injected on the top of the column using a pipette controller 1 0 ml is sufficiently high to detect effluent concentration and low to prevent temporary ponding layer on filter layer which could increase the flow rate and affect transport of particles or bacteria ten effluent samples were collected at the bottom of the column every 0 3 pv using 15 ml centrifuge tubes the injection of suspended solids was repeated 5 times per column to investigate the change on particle removal due to particle type and concentration duplicated sand columns with 20 cm depth were used and suspensions of control soil and biochar particles were created at different concentrations 0 01 0 05 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 g l 1 the concentration range represents the concentration of particles measured in stormwater huey and meyer 2010 1 0 ml of each particle concentration solution was injected per column and samples were collected every 0 3 pv at the bottom of the column each injection was repeated 5 times per column the volume and particle concentration of samples were measured in order to calculate the total mass of solids removed during the injection 2 9 transport of e coli and suspended particles through sand columns to examine the transport of bacteria with and without wildfire residues 1 ml of suspension containing 105 cfu ml 1 of e coli with 2 0 g l 1 of particles of either type was injected on top of the column using a pipette controller while deionized water was continuously injected at 9 0 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump effluent samples were collected at the bottom of the column influent and effluent samples were analyzed for volume and bacteria and particle concentration in order to calculate the mass balance for each contaminant during the infiltration process 2 10 water sample analysis the ph of the solutions used for column and batch experiments was measured using an ion selective electrode fisher scientific 9107bn and the concentration of particles was measured using a spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 365 uv visible spectrophotometer based on absorbance at 890 nm the high wavelength is typically used for turbidity measurement mohanty et al 2015 because at high wavelength the absorbance by color from dissolved organic carbon is negligible calibration curves were used for unburned and burned particles to accurately estimate the particle concentration based on the absorbance figs s2 and s3 supplementary material the concentration of nutrients nitrate nitrite and phosphate was analyzed using ion chromatography dionex integrion hpic system thermofisher the concentration of dissolved organic carbon total nitrogen and total organic carbon was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu 2 11 data and statistical analysis the bacteria concentration in samples was calculated by multiplying the average of colonies counted in two

influent and e effluent statistical analysis was conducted using r version 3 5 3 3 results 3 1 growth and die off of fecal bacteria is affected by particle types nutrient leaching results table s2 supplementary material showed that more nutrients were leached from unburned soil than wildfire residues or fire depletes the nutrient availability in soil nmr analysis of burned residues figs s4 and s5 supplementary material of wildfire residues confirmed these changes presence of aliphatic 0 50 ppm substituted aliphatic 50 110 ppm aromatic substituted aromatic 110 165 ppm and carboxylic and carbonyl 165 215 ppm e coli in stormwater grew in the presence of particles but the extent of growth varied with particle origin fig 2 irrespective of particle types e coli concentration increased for 2 3 days growth phase and remained constant stationary phase for an additional 1 7 days based on particle types before a decrease in concentration indicating the die off phase the lag growth and stationary phases table s3 supplementary material of e coli were determined following a method described elsewhere buchanan et al 1997 the die off phase was stipulated as the total concentration of bacteria started decreasing the extent to which the concentration increased initially or decreased after the stationary phase depended on the particle origin or type in the absence of added particles in the stormwater e coli grew to 79 times its initial concentration by the end of 7 days whereas in the presence of unburned soil particles e coli grew faster the concentration increased by a factor of 250 by the end of 7 days however in the presence of wildfire residues or biochar particles e coli grew only by 20 30 times which is nearly 10 times less than that observed in the presence of unburned soil particles additionally the growth phase of e coli was shorter in the presence of wildfire residues compared with unburned soil in the presence of wildfire residues the e coli concentration started to decrease after 4 7 days compared to 11 days in the presence of unburned soil particles within day 4 and 11 of incubation with particles e coli concentration in the presence of wildfire residues were similar p 0 578 to that in the presence of black carbon particles and significantly different p 0 05 to e coli concentration in the presence of unburned soil particles after 11 days the concentration of e coli was drastically lowered in the presence of wildfire residues 1 10 times its initial concentration but the e coli concentration remained high in the presence of unburned soil particles the concentration remained 147 times the initial concentration furthermore the survival rate of e coli was lower in the presence of wildfire residues than in unburned soil particles after 15 days of incubation after 15 days the e coli concentration was below the detection limit when wildfire residues and biochar particles were present but the concentration of e coli remained high 77 times the initial concentration in the presence of unburned soil particles after 15 days 3 2 removal of suspended solids depends on the subsurface depth suspended particles from unburned soil were removed during infiltration through sand filters but the removal decreased with a decrease in the filter media depth fig 3 the depth of filter media was negatively correlated pearson correlation coefficient r 0 940 to effluent peak concentration but positively correlated spearman correlation ρ 1 to the removal of suspended particles the trend is similar for e coli without the presence of particles fig 3b the removal of e coli also a type of particle was consistently higher than soil particles indicating greater adsorption or filtration of e coli compared with soil particles a three times increase in filter media depth decreased the peak height by half an addition of a 1 cm sand layer increased the removal of suspended solids by 1 9 increases in influent particle concentration did not change the total concentration of effluent particles transported but shifted the distribution of concentrations of each size faction fig s6 supplementary material when the influent concentration was high less small particles and a greater number of larger particles were passed through the sand filters 3 3 particle type affects the removal of suspended particles removal of suspended particles depended on particle type and concentration but colloid facilitated transport of e coli was not observed in this study despite the transport of particles through sand filters fig 4 removal of suspended particles was 100 when particles concentration was below 0 7 g l 1 irrespective of the particle origin however particle removal decreased with increases in influent particle concentration above 0 7 g l 1 and the removal rate depended on particle origin for instance while unburned soil was completely removed when solids concentration was 0 5 g l 1 removal decreased to 62 when the suspended solids concentration increased to 3 0 g l 1 similarly 100 of biochar particles were removed with suspended particles concentration of 0 5 g l 1 but the removal slightly decreased to 96 when particles concentration was 2 9 g l 1 when the suspended particle concentration was above 2 0 g l 1 the sand filter removed biochar particles 10 times more efficiently than unburned soil removal of wildfire residues was closer to the removal of unburned soil rather than biochar particles although particle removal decreased with increases in particle concentration in the influent e coli were completely removed in the presence of wildfire residues suggesting their effect on facilitated transport of e coli in subsurface soil is unlikely sand columns removed most of the suspended particles irrespective of the particle origin leaving only fine particles diameter 3 μm to pass through the sand filter fig 5 for all particle type analyzed the mode of particle size in the influent was higher than that of effluent samples indicating removal of particles by sand filter for influent solutions the mode of the particle size distribution varied from 6 53 μm for wildfire particle 1 to 15 08 μm for biochar particles whereas the mode of the particle size distribution of effluent was smaller ranging from 0 55 μm for biochar particles to 1 35 μm for natural soil and wildfire residues an increase in particle concentration in the influent solution did not significantly p 0 14 affect the particle distribution in the effluent fig s6 supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 presence of wildfire residues in surface water suppresses bacterial growth our results showed that the fate of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters depended on not only the presence of suspended particles but also the source of particles or more particularly whether the soil contained wildfire residues wildfire residues suppressed bacteria growth and accelerated their die off compared with unburned or unaffected soil natural soil particles typically contain organic matter and soil minerals which can serve as a source of dissolved nutrients for bacteria friedrich et al 1999 an alteration in nutrient concentration in water due to the presence of wildfire residue could be attributed to the observed change in microbial growth and persistence in this study similar results were observed in other studies with natural soil particles for instance increases in suspended particles content had been shown to increase nitrifying bacteria population in rivers xia et al 2004 and phytoplankton growth in marine waters garzon garcia et al 2018 however wildfire residues are mostly composed of burned organic matter like ash and char that have less nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen than soil homann et al 2011 ilstedt et al 2003 thus the decrease in nutrient leaching could suppress e coli growth in our experiment wildfire residues including ash could also leach chemicals such as heavy metals that could be toxic to bacteria mitic et al 2015 mixing nitrate and phosphate to suspension containing similar concentration of wildfire residues we observed negligible difference in nutrient concentration after mixing indicating adsorption of nutrients on wildfire residues from stormwater had negligible effect on the result one other possibility is that a wildfire residue or soil particle might attach multiple e coli and make one colony on agar plate thereby underpredicting the actual concentration of e coli this is particularly possible for biochar particles which has higher adsorption capacity for e coli than soil particles abit et al 2012 in contrast to biochar wildfire residues contain soil ash and a small quantity of black carbon and the resulting mixture would have lower affinity to e coli than biochar the result could vary with properties of burnt materials and mixing of other particles during their transport to surface waters overall the result indicates that the export of wildfire residues to surface water would not increase pathogen concentration more than it would due to the deposition of unburnt soil 4 2 particle removal improves with increases in subsurface depth and lowers suspended particle concentration subsurface soil depth could vary from less than a meter to hundreds of meters thus it is important to understand whether subsurface depth can influence potential groundwater contamination from wildfire residues injecting biochar or unburned soil residues two extreme cases we showed that increases in subsurface depth increased the removal of wildfire residues but the removal decreased with increases in particle concentration increases in removal with increases in subsurface depth can be attributed to longer hydraulic retention time and increase in adsorption sites li and davis 2008 mitchell et al 2011 however the removal decreased with increases in particle concentration potentially due to the exhaustion of attachment sites when the influent particle concentration was 2 0 g l 1 only 62 of unburned soil particles were removed which is significantly lower than the removal of biochar particles 96 under the same condition the result indicates that burnt residues have a stronger interaction with sand particles and are easier to be removed in subsurface soils 4 3 subsurface removal of wildfire residues are similar to unburned soil rather than biochar the removal of wildfire residues by sand filters was similar to that of unburned soil particles than biochar particles at particle concentration higher than 0 7 g l 1 the removal of biochar particles was around 96 which is significantly higher than the removal of unburned soil and wildfire particles 44 68 biochar particles can serve as the nucleus of aggregation lehmann et al 2011 forming larger colloids that are more likely to be removed than fine wildfire residues or soil particles furthermore a change in surface properties of soil during wildfire could affect their removal nmr analysis of wildfire residues confirmed the changes consistent with a previous study otto et al 2006 the result suggests that a significant portion of wildfire residues contain black carbon and ash in addition to soil wildfire residues have been shown to have a high content of aromatic carbon which decreases their polarity and increases their water repellency properties knicker et al 2006 an increase in water repellency was previously attributed to increased removal of wildfire residues in sands goebel et al 2013 removal of biochar particles was higher than that of wildfire residues suggesting biochar may not be a good surrogate to predict the transport of wildfire residues in subsurface soil a difference is attributed to how both are formed under intense heat although wildfire residues and biochar are formed under similar temperature conditions 800 c biochar is produced in the absence of oxygen while wildfire residues are formed in the presence of oxygen resulting in higher ash content this key difference in production conditions appears to affect their removal during infiltration through the subsurface 4 4 colloidal particles 3 μm are poorly removed through subsurface infiltration during subsurface infiltration most particles regardless of their origin or types with size greater than 3 μm were removed the particle size distribution of effluents indicates that finer particles were present in larger quantity when biochar was injected compared with unburned soil and wildfire residues the effluent particle size range is similar to that of bacteria which indicates that bacteria could move through the sand filter under the same conditions unless the interaction of bacteria with sand is stronger than the interaction of wildfire residues with sand however e coli concentration in the effluent was below the detection limit in the effluent indicating bacterial interaction with the sand surface was high the presence of fine colloids in the effluent did not increase bacteria transport suggesting colloid facilitated transport of e coli in the presence of wildfire residues is unlikely in fact colloid retarded transport of bacteria was observed in our study without soil colloids bacteria removal in 10 cm columns was around 75 which increased to near 100 with an increase in depth by 10 cm fig s6 supplementary material in the presence of suspended particles and bacteria the removal of bacteria in 20 cm sand columns remained at 100 irrespective of nature of particles the results contradicted the result in some previous studies muirhead et al 2006 walters et al 2013 which showed that e coli predominantly attached to suspended solids with particle diameter lower than 12 or 20 μm in our study particles larger than 3 μm were filtered out on top of the filter layer and the deposited particles could block pores or flow paths in sand layer thereby increasing removal of suspended bacteria and colloid associated bacteria the particle size distribution analysis showed that biochar particles were more mobile than wildfire residues and unburned soil and the relative size in the effluent for biochar particles was smaller than wildfire residues and unburned soil soils from affected and unaffected regions have similar particle size distribution which suggests that the effluent might be dominated by soil minerals rather than burned black carbon that might be a small fraction of total mass but the presence of these particles did not affect e coli concentration in the effluent suggesting their deposition in subsurface soil would not increase microbial risk we used one strain of e coli however the fate and transport behavior of e coli could vary based on type of strains within species bolster et al 2009 or by different types of pathogen species haznedaroglu et al 2009 thus the result presented in this study could vary based on strain types it should be noted that the transport of virus in the presence of wildfire could be much higher than the transport of bacteria as unlike bacteria removal of virus is minimal due to its small size sasidharan et al 2016 thus future studies should include virus and actual pathogens instead of indicator bacteria used in this study 5 conclusion and environmental implications the study answered the question of whether a rainfall event following a wildfire which help transport wildfire residues to surface waters or through subsurface soil could increase the risk of microbial contamination of surface waters subsurface soil and consequently groundwater specific conclusions are the presence of wildfire residues in surface water reduces the growth of indicator bacteria and accelerates their die off when compared to unburned soil suggesting microbial risk post wildfire is minimal wildfire residues have a limited effect on the transport of pathogen through subsurface soil although transport of these particles increased when their concentration exceeded 0 7 g l 1 transport of biochar particles in subsurface soil was less than wildfire residues indicating biochar may not be a good surrogate to study the transport of wildfire residues in subsurface soils this study is the first study to examine potential implication of wildfire residues on microbial water quality of receiving water bodies the result shows that wildfire residues may not have a measurable negative impact on microbial water quality because of the decrease in subsurface transport and the low viability of indicator bacteria on wildfire residues relative to natural soil particles the results prove that wildfire residues can impair the growth of bacteria and may have wide implications on other natural processes naturally soil and water contain billions of non pathogenic bacteria which serve many ecosystem functions such as biodegradation of chemical pollutants and nutrient cycling thus the presence of wildfire residues could also have detrimental effect on these processes wildfire residues and their surface chemistry can also vary based on the condition and sources future studies should examine the effect of wildfire on the basis of different components such as ash type black carbon and soil mineralogy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

presence of wildfire residues than in natural soil from unaffected areas wildfire residues also decreased the persistence of e coli during a 15 day incubation period these results indicate that the growth or persistence of e coli in surface water in the presence of wildfire residues was less than that in the presence of unburned soil particles potentially due to depletion of nutrient

in the subsurface system suspensions containing wildfire residues and or e coli were injected through unsaturated sand columns a model subsurface system transport of wildfire residues in sand columns increased with decreases in the depth and increases in the concentration of particles but increased transport of wildfire residues did not result in the increased transport of e coli suggesting

exposure nelson et al 2018 and the presence of particles which may protect pathogens from inactivation by sunlight exposure bohrerova and linden 2006 or provide nutrients chua et al 2009 for microbial growth on the other hand particles may release chemicals that are toxic to bacteria and kill them although wildfire events shift the microbial community in soil fultz et al 2016 it is not clear whether wildfire residues could increase or decrease the survival of pathogens in surface waters wildfire residues primarily consist of burnt biomass such as ash black carbon or charcoal and soil minerals all these particles have different chemical properties bodi et al 2014 preston et al 2017 which can affect the growth or decay of pathogen in water bacteria can colonize on black carbon and form biofilm which could protect them from disinfectants lechevallier et al 1984 small suspended solids 20 μm might induce the agglomeration of bacteria by acting as a condensation nucleus offering protection from antibacterial effects henao et al 2018 wildfire residues can also change the nutrient concentration in water thus wildfire residues could either help increase or decrease the viability of pathogens in surface water based on the chemical composition of water containing wildfire residues wildfire residues like natural soil colloids could be transported through the subsurface and facilitate the transport of pathogens to groundwater microbial contamination of groundwater has been associated with heavy rainfall events particularly in the beginning of the wet season wu et al 2016 under this condition the concentration of e coli and coliform bacteria in groundwater could increase partly due to particle facilitated transport of bacteria zeleznik et al 2011 the same process could be relevant after wildfire where the concentration of particles in the runoff increases by orders of magnitude due to post wildfire depletion of vegetation and intensification of erosion for colloid facilitated transport to be important in the subsurface environment wildfire residues or colloids must be transported through the subsurface and pathogens must remain attached and viable on wildfire residues however little is known about the effect of wildfire residues on growth or decay of pathogens in water conditions that may affect the infiltration of pathogens through subsurface soils include soil chemical properties clark and pitt 2007 infiltration rate mohanty and boehm 2014 and ph or chemical composition of infiltrating water pitt et al 1999 suspended particle type and concentration are critical in determining the relevance of the facilitated transport of pathogens in subsurface soil abusharar and salameh 1995 post wildfire the concentration of particles in runoff increases due to an increase in erosion lee et al 2016 an increase in particle concentration could decrease pathogen removal in the subsurface muirhead et al 2006 thereby facilitating infiltration through the subsurface fries et al 2006 jeng et al 2005 particles may also be filtered through subsurface soils thus it is important to compare the effect of wildfire residues with that of natural soil particles to help determine the fate and transport of pathogens in surface water and subsurface environment so that the effect of wildfire on the microbial quality of surface waters and groundwater can be assessed this study examines the effect of wildfire particles on bacterial viability and their transport through the subsurface we hypothesized that the microbial transport through the subsurface would increase in the presence of particles but the transport would depend on particle type due to the bacteria particle association additionally wildfire residues would decrease the viability of pathogens in surface waters due to the depletion of nutrients in wildfire eroded soils to test these hypotheses bacteria laden stormwater was injected at varying particle concentrations and subsurface depths and the effluent was monitored for e coli a pathogen indicator and total particle concentration the viability of e coli in stormwater was monitored over time in the presence of unburned soil wildfire residues and biochar a surrogate for black carbon generated during a wildfire 2 material and methods 2 1 stormwater collection stormwater was collected using 20 l carboys from ballona creek located in los angeles ca 34 0 36 n 118 23 29 w the stormwater from urban areas is expected to have a very different composition than stormwater from forest watersheds or other type of catchments nevertheless the ballona creek stormwater provides a natural water matrix for use in the study to examine the fate of e coli when the stormwater is mixed with runoff from wildfire affected areas the collected stormwater was left untouched for at least 24 h to settle large particles and the supernatant was transferred into 1 l glass containers and autoclaved at 121 c for 45 min the sterile stormwater was stored at 4 c before being used in the experiment we autoclaved the water to kill the native microorganisms to avoid competition with the added e coli for the available nutrients although autoclaving water may change the nutrient composition of stormwater the same water was used for all the experiments 2 2 post wildfire residues collection for the control study natural unburned soil was collected from the ballona wetlands 33 9713 118 4304 where there has been no fire occurrence in the last several decades after the woolsey fire in november 2018 recently burned soil with wildfire residues were collected from corral canyon park 34 0365 118 7223 and from malibu lagoon 34 0341 118 6812 the sampling locations were chosen based on the stormwater runoff route the samples were collected from the top 10 cm of soil using a sterilized spatula and stored at 4 c biochar particles biochar supreme everson wa were used as a surrogate for black carbon without soil 2 3 characterization of wildfire residues the postfire residues were characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy briefly the 13c cross polarization with magic angle spinning nmr spectrum was acquired on a bruker av iii hd 600 nmr spectrometer at a frequency of 150 9 mhz the fine wildfire residue was mixed thoroughly and a homogenous wildfire sample weighing 33 7 mg was packed in a 3 2 mm outside diameter zirconia rotor with a vespel cap a total of 59 657 scans were acquired with a sample spinning rate of 10 khz using a variable amplitude cross polarization sequence with a contact time of 2 ms and a recycle delay of 1 s the data was processed with 50 hz of line broadening the analysis was repeated twice with another set of burnt residue from the homogenous mixture to analyze the nutrient concentration leached from soil samples 4 0 g of different particle types were suspended into 40 ml of milli q water using a 50 ml centrifuge tube and the solution was shaken wrist action shaker burrel scientific for 24 h the particles were removed from the supernatant by centrifugation 5000 g for 15 min and the water chemistry of the supernatant was analyzed for nutrients nitrate nitrite and phosphate dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen the results were reported in supplementary material 2 4 suspended particles solution preparation to prepare suspended wildfire residues and unburned soil samples were first sieved to remove particulates larger than 45 μm and 2 g of the sieved sample was suspended in 1 l deionized water the suspension was placed in an ice bath and sonicated using a probe branson digital sonifier to enhance the dispersion of particles for 15 min on for 1 0 s off for 3 0 s the suspension was transferred into a 500 ml graduated cylinder and particles with a size greater than 10 μm were settled based on stokes law details in the supplementary material particles with size lower than 10 μm were isolated for the transport study because larger particles have limited potential for subsurface transport due to filtration and gravitational settling and are expected to be deposited on the surface 200 ml of the suspension was transferred into 50 ml centrifuge tubes centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min and 45 ml of the supernatant was discarded leaving behind 5 ml of concentrated particle suspension the stock suspension was shaken by hand and then sonicated for 1 min prior to its use in the experiments the particle size distribution of influent and effluent samples containing suspended solids was determined by analyzing 1 0 ml of the solution using a particle sizing analyzer system accusizer model 770 particle sizing systems which determines the concentration of particles per ml and the diameter of each particle ranging from 0 55 μm to 500 μm 2 5 e coli k 12 suspension suspension of e coli k 12 with resistance to kanamycin cas 25389 94 0 fisher bioreagents was prepared following the method described in a previous study mohanty and boehm 2014 although growth of bacteria could vary with strains foppen et al 2010 and stormwater may contain a wide range of bacterial strain we used this particular strain to eliminate growth of environmental e coli or potential contamination from natural dust during the experiment briefly a single colony of e coli was grown in luria bertani growth media lb broth miller fisher bioreagents and the e coli was separated from the media by centrifugation to remove the supernatant and washed with a phosphate buffered saline pbs solution the e coli stock solution was added to stormwater containing particles to achieve the desired final concentration 103 105 cfu ml 1 the range used in this study is within the expected concentration of e coli in stormwater or surface waters grebel et al 2013 for the column experiments the suspension was mixed for 120 min using an automated shaker to ensure attachment of bacteria on particles vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 2 6 growth and decay of e coli in the presence of post wildfire residues to examine if the presence of wildfire residues affects the growth and die off of e coli in the stormwater 50 ml of autoclaved stormwater spiked with 103 cfu ml 1 of e coli and 100 mg l 1 of suspended particles from different origins a control soil 3 soils with wildfire residues or biochar were mixed at 150 rpm in 100 ml glass flasks at 37 c for 15 days to identify the growth and die off of e coli in stormwater without particles the experiment was repeated without particles to monitor any change in concentration of e coli 500 μl samples were pipetted and analyzed for e coli at the following time intervals 0 3 0 8 1 2 3 4 7 9 11 and 15 days bacteria concentration was analyzed by inoculating 50 μl of the sample into lb agar plates with kanamycin following spread plate and counting techniques 2 plates per sample when the concentration was expected to be too high to count within range 300 cfu the pbs solution was used to dilute the sample to achieve bacteria counts between 30 and 300 cfu per plate however samples with low concentrations were not concentrated due to low sample volume and the resulting low colony count below 30 was included to estimate the concentration 2 7 sand columns as a model for subsurface sand filters were used as a model to examine if the wildfire residues could migrate through the subsurface into groundwater a coarse sand 20 30 standard sand certified mtp with grain diameters between 0 6 and 0 85 mm was used in this study to examine the worst case condition for subsurface infiltration sand was washed using deionized water for 10 min soaked in 1m hcl solution for 6 h and then washed multiple times with milli q water until the ph was near neutral pvc pipes 2 0 cm diameter and 35 cm height were used as columns a screen 100 μm pore size was placed at the bottom of the column before packing to prevent the sand particles from being washed away with the effluent columns were packed with sand in 15 g intervals to ensure they were packed uniformly deionized water was applied on the top of the sand surface at 9 0 ml min 1 for 4 h using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s digital drive cole parmer in order to equilibrate the flow and wash out any small sand colloids generated during packing details about the pore volume pv estimation by the bromide tracer are provided in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 supplementary material 2 8 effect of sand filters depth and suspended particle concentration on particle removal to examine the effect of subsurface depth on particle removal ten sand columns with different heights 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm were assembled in duplicate and autoclaved stormwater was injected at 9 0 ml min 1 to simulate pulse input 1 0 ml of suspension containing control unburned soil 4 0 g l 1 was injected on the top of the column using a pipette controller 1 0 ml is sufficiently high to detect effluent concentration and low to prevent temporary ponding layer on filter layer which could increase the flow rate and affect transport of particles or bacteria ten effluent samples were collected at the bottom of the column every 0 3 pv using 15 ml centrifuge tubes the injection of suspended solids was repeated 5 times per column to investigate the change on particle removal due to particle type and concentration duplicated sand columns with 20 cm depth were used and suspensions of control soil and biochar particles were created at different concentrations 0 01 0 05 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 g l 1 the concentration range represents the concentration of particles measured in stormwater huey and meyer 2010 1 0 ml of each particle concentration solution was injected per column and samples were collected every 0 3 pv at the bottom of the column each injection was repeated 5 times per column the volume and particle concentration of samples were measured in order to calculate the total mass of solids removed during the injection 2 9 transport of e coli and suspended particles through sand columns to examine the transport of bacteria with and without wildfire residues 1 ml of suspension containing 105 cfu ml 1 of e coli with 2 0 g l 1 of particles of either type was injected on top of the column using a pipette controller while deionized water was continuously injected at 9 0 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump effluent samples were collected at the bottom of the column influent and effluent samples were analyzed for volume and bacteria and particle concentration in order to calculate the mass balance for each contaminant during the infiltration process 2 10 water sample analysis the ph of the solutions used for column and batch experiments was measured using an ion selective electrode fisher scientific 9107bn and the concentration of particles was measured using a spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 365 uv visible spectrophotometer based on absorbance at 890 nm the high wavelength is typically used for turbidity measurement mohanty et al 2015 because at high wavelength the absorbance by color from dissolved organic carbon is negligible calibration curves were used for unburned and burned particles to accurately estimate the particle concentration based on the absorbance figs s2 and s3 supplementary material the concentration of nutrients nitrate nitrite and phosphate was analyzed using ion chromatography dionex integrion hpic system thermofisher the concentration of dissolved organic carbon total nitrogen and total organic carbon was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu 2 11 data and statistical analysis the bacteria concentration in samples was calculated by multiplying the average of colonies counted in two

influent and e effluent statistical analysis was conducted using r version 3 5 3 3 results 3 1 growth and die off of fecal bacteria is affected by particle types nutrient leaching results table s2 supplementary material showed that more nutrients were leached from unburned soil than wildfire residues or fire depletes the nutrient availability in soil nmr analysis of burned residues figs s4 and s5 supplementary material of wildfire residues confirmed these changes presence of aliphatic 0 50 ppm substituted aliphatic 50 110 ppm aromatic substituted aromatic 110 165 ppm and carboxylic and carbonyl 165 215 ppm e coli in stormwater grew in the presence of particles but the extent of growth varied with particle origin fig 2 irrespective of particle types e coli concentration increased for 2 3 days growth phase and remained constant stationary phase for an additional 1 7 days based on particle types before a decrease in concentration indicating the die off phase the lag growth and stationary phases table s3 supplementary material of e coli were determined following a method described elsewhere buchanan et al 1997 the die off phase was stipulated as the total concentration of bacteria started decreasing the extent to which the concentration increased initially or decreased after the stationary phase depended on the particle origin or type in the absence of added particles in the stormwater e coli grew to 79 times its initial concentration by the end of 7 days whereas in the presence of unburned soil particles e coli grew faster the concentration increased by a factor of 250 by the end of 7 days however in the presence of wildfire residues or biochar particles e coli grew only by 20 30 times which is nearly 10 times less than that observed in the presence of unburned soil particles additionally the growth phase of e coli was shorter in the presence of wildfire residues compared with unburned soil in the presence of wildfire residues the e coli concentration started to decrease after 4 7 days compared to 11 days in the presence of unburned soil particles within day 4 and 11 of incubation with particles e coli concentration in the presence of wildfire residues were similar p 0 578 to that in the presence of black carbon particles and significantly different p 0 05 to e coli concentration in the presence of unburned soil particles after 11 days the concentration of e coli was drastically lowered in the presence of wildfire residues 1 10 times its initial concentration but the e coli concentration remained high in the presence of unburned soil particles the concentration remained 147 times the initial concentration furthermore the survival rate of e coli was lower in the presence of wildfire residues than in unburned soil particles after 15 days of incubation after 15 days the e coli concentration was below the detection limit when wildfire residues and biochar particles were present but the concentration of e coli remained high 77 times the initial concentration in the presence of unburned soil particles after 15 days 3 2 removal of suspended solids depends on the subsurface depth suspended particles from unburned soil were removed during infiltration through sand filters but the removal decreased with a decrease in the filter media depth fig 3 the depth of filter media was negatively correlated pearson correlation coefficient r 0 940 to effluent peak concentration but positively correlated spearman correlation ρ 1 to the removal of suspended particles the trend is similar for e coli without the presence of particles fig 3b the removal of e coli also a type of particle was consistently higher than soil particles indicating greater adsorption or filtration of e coli compared with soil particles a three times increase in filter media depth decreased the peak height by half an addition of a 1 cm sand layer increased the removal of suspended solids by 1 9 increases in influent particle concentration did not change the total concentration of effluent particles transported but shifted the distribution of concentrations of each size faction fig s6 supplementary material when the influent concentration was high less small particles and a greater number of larger particles were passed through the sand filters 3 3 particle type affects the removal of suspended particles removal of suspended particles depended on particle type and concentration but colloid facilitated transport of e coli was not observed in this study despite the transport of particles through sand filters fig 4 removal of suspended particles was 100 when particles concentration was below 0 7 g l 1 irrespective of the particle origin however particle removal decreased with increases in influent particle concentration above 0 7 g l 1 and the removal rate depended on particle origin for instance while unburned soil was completely removed when solids concentration was 0 5 g l 1 removal decreased to 62 when the suspended solids concentration increased to 3 0 g l 1 similarly 100 of biochar particles were removed with suspended particles concentration of 0 5 g l 1 but the removal slightly decreased to 96 when particles concentration was 2 9 g l 1 when the suspended particle concentration was above 2 0 g l 1 the sand filter removed biochar particles 10 times more efficiently than unburned soil removal of wildfire residues was closer to the removal of unburned soil rather than biochar particles although particle removal decreased with increases in particle concentration in the influent e coli were completely removed in the presence of wildfire residues suggesting their effect on facilitated transport of e coli in subsurface soil is unlikely sand columns removed most of the suspended particles irrespective of the particle origin leaving only fine particles diameter 3 μm to pass through the sand filter fig 5 for all particle type analyzed the mode of particle size in the influent was higher than that of effluent samples indicating removal of particles by sand filter for influent solutions the mode of the particle size distribution varied from 6 53 μm for wildfire particle 1 to 15 08 μm for biochar particles whereas the mode of the particle size distribution of effluent was smaller ranging from 0 55 μm for biochar particles to 1 35 μm for natural soil and wildfire residues an increase in particle concentration in the influent solution did not significantly p 0 14 affect the particle distribution in the effluent fig s6 supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 presence of wildfire residues in surface water suppresses bacterial growth our results showed that the fate of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters depended on not only the presence of suspended particles but also the source of particles or more particularly whether the soil contained wildfire residues wildfire residues suppressed bacteria growth and accelerated their die off compared with unburned or unaffected soil natural soil particles typically contain organic matter and soil minerals which can serve as a source of dissolved nutrients for bacteria friedrich et al 1999 an alteration in nutrient concentration in water due to the presence of wildfire residue could be attributed to the observed change in microbial growth and persistence in this study similar results were observed in other studies with natural soil particles for instance increases in suspended particles content had been shown to increase nitrifying bacteria population in rivers xia et al 2004 and phytoplankton growth in marine waters garzon garcia et al 2018 however wildfire residues are mostly composed of burned organic matter like ash and char that have less nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen than soil homann et al 2011 ilstedt et al 2003 thus the decrease in nutrient leaching could suppress e coli growth in our experiment wildfire residues including ash could also leach chemicals such as heavy metals that could be toxic to bacteria mitic et al 2015 mixing nitrate and phosphate to suspension containing similar concentration of wildfire residues we observed negligible difference in nutrient concentration after mixing indicating adsorption of nutrients on wildfire residues from stormwater had negligible effect on the result one other possibility is that a wildfire residue or soil particle might attach multiple e coli and make one colony on agar plate thereby underpredicting the actual concentration of e coli this is particularly possible for biochar particles which has higher adsorption capacity for e coli than soil particles abit et al 2012 in contrast to biochar wildfire residues contain soil ash and a small quantity of black carbon and the resulting mixture would have lower affinity to e coli than biochar the result could vary with properties of burnt materials and mixing of other particles during their transport to surface waters overall the result indicates that the export of wildfire residues to surface water would not increase pathogen concentration more than it would due to the deposition of unburnt soil 4 2 particle removal improves with increases in subsurface depth and lowers suspended particle concentration subsurface soil depth could vary from less than a meter to hundreds of meters thus it is important to understand whether subsurface depth can influence potential groundwater contamination from wildfire residues injecting biochar or unburned soil residues two extreme cases we showed that increases in subsurface depth increased the removal of wildfire residues but the removal decreased with increases in particle concentration increases in removal with increases in subsurface depth can be attributed to longer hydraulic retention time and increase in adsorption sites li and davis 2008 mitchell et al 2011 however the removal decreased with increases in particle concentration potentially due to the exhaustion of attachment sites when the influent particle concentration was 2 0 g l 1 only 62 of unburned soil particles were removed which is significantly lower than the removal of biochar particles 96 under the same condition the result indicates that burnt residues have a stronger interaction with sand particles and are easier to be removed in subsurface soils 4 3 subsurface removal of wildfire residues are similar to unburned soil rather than biochar the removal of wildfire residues by sand filters was similar to that of unburned soil particles than biochar particles at particle concentration higher than 0 7 g l 1 the removal of biochar particles was around 96 which is significantly higher than the removal of unburned soil and wildfire particles 44 68 biochar particles can serve as the nucleus of aggregation lehmann et al 2011 forming larger colloids that are more likely to be removed than fine wildfire residues or soil particles furthermore a change in surface properties of soil during wildfire could affect their removal nmr analysis of wildfire residues confirmed the changes consistent with a previous study otto et al 2006 the result suggests that a significant portion of wildfire residues contain black carbon and ash in addition to soil wildfire residues have been shown to have a high content of aromatic carbon which decreases their polarity and increases their water repellency properties knicker et al 2006 an increase in water repellency was previously attributed to increased removal of wildfire residues in sands goebel et al 2013 removal of biochar particles was higher than that of wildfire residues suggesting biochar may not be a good surrogate to predict the transport of wildfire residues in subsurface soil a difference is attributed to how both are formed under intense heat although wildfire residues and biochar are formed under similar temperature conditions 800 c biochar is produced in the absence of oxygen while wildfire residues are formed in the presence of oxygen resulting in higher ash content this key difference in production conditions appears to affect their removal during infiltration through the subsurface 4 4 colloidal particles 3 μm are poorly removed through subsurface infiltration during subsurface infiltration most particles regardless of their origin or types with size greater than 3 μm were removed the particle size distribution of effluents indicates that finer particles were present in larger quantity when biochar was injected compared with unburned soil and wildfire residues the effluent particle size range is similar to that of bacteria which indicates that bacteria could move through the sand filter under the same conditions unless the interaction of bacteria with sand is stronger than the interaction of wildfire residues with sand however e coli concentration in the effluent was below the detection limit in the effluent indicating bacterial interaction with the sand surface was high the presence of fine colloids in the effluent did not increase bacteria transport suggesting colloid facilitated transport of e coli in the presence of wildfire residues is unlikely in fact colloid retarded transport of bacteria was observed in our study without soil colloids bacteria removal in 10 cm columns was around 75 which increased to near 100 with an increase in depth by 10 cm fig s6 supplementary material in the presence of suspended particles and bacteria the removal of bacteria in 20 cm sand columns remained at 100 irrespective of nature of particles the results contradicted the result in some previous studies muirhead et al 2006 walters et al 2013 which showed that e coli predominantly attached to suspended solids with particle diameter lower than 12 or 20 μm in our study particles larger than 3 μm were filtered out on top of the filter layer and the deposited particles could block pores or flow paths in sand layer thereby increasing removal of suspended bacteria and colloid associated bacteria the particle size distribution analysis showed that biochar particles were more mobile than wildfire residues and unburned soil and the relative size in the effluent for biochar particles was smaller than wildfire residues and unburned soil soils from affected and unaffected regions have similar particle size distribution which suggests that the effluent might be dominated by soil minerals rather than burned black carbon that might be a small fraction of total mass but the presence of these particles did not affect e coli concentration in the effluent suggesting their deposition in subsurface soil would not increase microbial risk we used one strain of e coli however the fate and transport behavior of e coli could vary based on type of strains within species bolster et al 2009 or by different types of pathogen species haznedaroglu et al 2009 thus the result presented in this study could vary based on strain types it should be noted that the transport of virus in the presence of wildfire could be much higher than the transport of bacteria as unlike bacteria removal of virus is minimal due to its small size sasidharan et al 2016 thus future studies should include virus and actual pathogens instead of indicator bacteria used in this study 5 conclusion and environmental implications the study answered the question of whether a rainfall event following a wildfire which help transport wildfire residues to surface waters or through subsurface soil could increase the risk of microbial contamination of surface waters subsurface soil and consequently groundwater specific conclusions are the presence of wildfire residues in surface water reduces the growth of indicator bacteria and accelerates their die off when compared to unburned soil suggesting microbial risk post wildfire is minimal wildfire residues have a limited effect on the transport of pathogen through subsurface soil although transport of these particles increased when their concentration exceeded 0 7 g l 1 transport of biochar particles in subsurface soil was less than wildfire residues indicating biochar may not be a good surrogate to study the transport of wildfire residues in subsurface soils this study is the first study to examine potential implication of wildfire residues on microbial water quality of receiving water bodies the result shows that wildfire residues may not have a measurable negative impact on microbial water quality because of the decrease in subsurface transport and the low viability of indicator bacteria on wildfire residues relative to natural soil particles the results prove that wildfire residues can impair the growth of bacteria and may have wide implications on other natural processes naturally soil and water contain billions of non pathogenic bacteria which serve many ecosystem functions such as biodegradation of chemical pollutants and nutrient cycling thus the presence of wildfire residues could also have detrimental effect on these processes wildfire residues and their surface chemistry can also vary based on the condition and sources future studies should examine the effect of wildfire on the basis of different components such as ash type black carbon and soil mineralogy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18009,the release of potentially toxic metal ions from corrosion scales formed on pipe surfaces is of great concern for water quality in drinking water distribution systems dwds this study examined the effects of alkalinity chloride and sulfate on metal release from corrosion scales sampled from a corroded iron pipe jar tests and recirculation pipe systems were used to investigate the metal release potential during stagnant and active flow conditions the experimental data show that both the ambient water chemistry and hydraulic conditions exerted complex influences on metal release from the exposed corrosion scales fe mn and ni were more labile to be released during a 132 h period of stagnation while the release of al zn and cu was an order of magnitude higher under flow conditions compared to stagnant conditions increasing concentrations of chloride from 5 mg l to 60 mg l and sulfate from 20 mg l to 100 mg l resulted in the increased release of fe al and zn especially under active flow conditions this effect could be effectively mitigated by increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l as caco3 while increasing alkalinity suppressed the release of fe and stimulated the release of al and cu under stagnant conditions this contradictory effect was not observed under active flow conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal release corrosion scales alkalinity

products can cause aesthetic issues e g blue water the lead and copper rule in the united states stipulates that 90 of samples should have a cu concentration of 1 3 mg l imran et al 2006 shi et al 2006 in comparison the guideline amount for cu given by the standards for drinking water quality in china is 1 0 mg l mhc and sac 2006a corrosion scales can be destabilized due to the switch from one water source to another especially when water chemistry parameters e g ph alkalinity and concentrations of sulfate and chloride in these sources are sufficiently different imran et al 2005a 2006 tang et al 2006b alshehri et al 2009 yang et al 2012 2014 consequently metals accumulated in corrosion scales such as fe zn cu al and other trace contaminants can be released into the water for example tucson arizona and north china suffered from red water issues after conventional groundwater sources were replaced with surface water in their dwds price and jefferson 1997 yang et al 2012 2014 a significant rise in pb release was associated with water discoloration in flint michigan when a temporary drinking water source was used without proper corrosion control this consequently led to severe health issues for the local residents hanna attisha et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 experimental studies in tampa florida have also revealed that change of water quality due to water source blending alters the release potential of metals such as fe cu and pb imran et al 2005a 2006 shi et al 2006 tang et al 2006b alshehri et al 2009 in order to address the water shortage in north china water from the danjiangkou reservoir in south china has been transferred to beijing and other northern cities since late 2014 via the mid route of the south to north water diversion snwd project water in the danjiangkou reservoir has average concentrations of chloride and sulfate of 4 5 mg l and 30 mg l respectively and alkalinity of approximately 105 mg l as caco3 hereafter wang 2015 li et al 2018 these anionic concentrations differ from the composition of most conventional water sources in north china which tend to have higher amounts of chloride 15 54 mg l and sulfate 23 85 mg l and varying levels of alkalinity 130 220 mg l thus the switch in water between local sources and the danjiangkou reservoir might result in metal release due to the potential instability of corrosion scales and sediments found in these systems prior research has shown that increasing alkalinity to greater than 80 150 mg l can alleviate iron release and red water episodes since stable carbonates such as caco3 tend to precipitate and form a protective film on pipe surfaces sander et al 1996 imran et al 2005a 2006 shi and taylor 2007 lasheen et al 2008 alshehri et al 2009 hu et al 2018 in high alkalinity water with sufficient oxidants the formation of goethite eq 1 and magnetite eq 2 also helps to preserve the stability of corrosion scale layer sontheimer et al 1981 1 2fe2 1 2o2 4oh 2feooh s goethite h2o 2 3feco3 s 1 2o2 fe3o4 s magnetite 3co2 in contrast chloride and sulfate are aggressive with respect to the iron oxides protective films and their presence tends to accelerate pipe corrosion and iron release imran et al 2005a 2006 lasheen et al 2008 alshehri et al 2009 peng et al 2013 hu et al 2018 the larson ratio lr eq 3 is deemed to be a good descriptor of the corrosivity induced by chloride and sulfate vs the protective action of alkalinity which has been widely used for the evaluation of the corrosion potential of iron and red water risk larson and skold 1958 mcneill and edwards 2001 imran et al 2005b 3 lr c l 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 the concentrations of sulfate chloride and bicarbonate in the above formula are expressed in milliequivalents per liter units however variations in alkalinity and concentrations of chloride and sulfate have been found to cause complex and in some cases contradictory effects on metal release shi et al 2006 found that reducing water alkalinity from 158 to 207 mg l to 68 90 mg l through lime softening can increase fe release potential but decrease cu release imran et al 2006 also proposed that increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 80 mg l is beneficial for red water control but at the same time accelerates cu release similarly the abundance of sulfate in surface water has been reported to simultaneously increase fe release and decrease pb release imran et al 2006 accordingly water that meets the quality regulations for one metal might not meet those for another as such the effects of variations in alkalinity and chloride and sulfate levels on the release potential of different metals required more detailed research if suitable guidelines and limits are to be established in addition to the chemical desorption and dissolution of corrosion scales the hydraulic remobilization of particles from deposited scales may also account for a significant fraction of released metals in dwds sarin et al 2001 vreeburg and boxall 2007 husband and boxall 2016 li et al 2016 indeed hydraulic conditions can influence metal release in many ways for example flowing water alters the rates of convection and diffusion of solutes thus influencing the processes of precipitation and dissolution sarin et al 2001 li et al 2016 at the same time flow velocity and regime affect the shear stress applied on pipe surfaces which is a dominant control on the deposition and remobilization of particulates vreeburg and boxall 2007 husband and boxall 2016 however the interactive effects of water chemistry and hydraulic condition on metal release potential remains to be assessed in this study jar tests and experimental recirculating pipe systems were used to compare metal release from iron corrosion scales during both stagnant and active flow conditions these tests were conducted using waters with varying alkalinities and chloride and sulfate concentrations representative of the conditions found in most dwds 2 materials and methods 2 1 scale sampling and characterization corrosion scales were sampled from a 1 0 m diameter water main in zhengzhou city henan province china this main pipe made of unlined cast iron had been in service for 30 years before excavation the water supplied to zhengzhou city is conventionally sourced from the yellow river which has typical chloride and sulfate concentrations of 54 mg l and 86 mg l respectively table 1 in december 2014 the water source in zhengzhou city was switched into the danjiangkou reservoir as a result of the snwd mid route project as the main pipe used in this study was excavated in april 2016 its inside surfaces had first been in contact with water from the yellow river for nearly 30 years and then following the commissioning of the snwd project water from the danjiangkou reservoir for approximately 1 5 years water quality parameters for these two water sources are summarized in table 1 thirty seven corrosion tubercles with a similar weight 17 0 0 5 g were sampled from the inner walls of the pipe supplementary information fig s1 carefully rinsed with deionized di water to remove loosely attached particles from the scale surfaces and dried under vacuum at 20 c these samples were recorded as tubercles 1 37 respectively tubercles 1 5 were pulverized and used for physico chemical characterization scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan was employed to observe the microstructures of the corrosion tubercles elemental composition was determined by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds hitachi s 4800 japan and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher scientific icap q usa while the crystalline phases were identified using x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance germany the remaining 32 corrosion tubercles which were weighed prior to the experiments were prepared for exposures in jar tests and recirculating pipe testing systems the surfaces of these tubercles that had become attached to the pipe walls in service were coated with polyvinyl chloride pvc to prevent metal release which would not happen in real systems as a result only the tubercle surfaces that were in contact with water whilst in service were exposed to water during the subsequent testing 2 2 preparation of testing solutions in order to determine the effects of sulfate chloride and alkalinity on metal release from the corrosion scales these parameters were varied within the range of 20 100 mg l 5 60 mg l and 50 200 mg l respectively these ranges encompass almost all possible conditions in the snwd mid route area and are representative of conditions found in most dwds twenty three testing solutions table 2 were prepared at 25 c and kept in an air and light proof water tank requisite amounts of analytical grade nahco3 and na2co3 were added into di water to achieve the target alkalinity based on the chemical equilibrium of the carbonic system benjamin 2001 analytical grade mgso4 k2so4 and cacl2 were added to adjust the concentrations of so4 2 and cl respectively to the target values shown in table 2 analytical grade ca no3 2 4h2o mg no3 2 6h2o and kno3 were added to adjust the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and k to 60 mg l 24 mg l and 3 mg l respectively which are approximate to the typical levels for most dwds water ph was adjusted to 7 3 by adding analytical grade nitric acid 2 3 test systems 2 3 1 jar tests jar tests were adopted to investigate metal release under stagnant conditions twenty three 10 l polyethylene jars with a height of 30 cm were sequentially rinsed with 0 1m hno3 tap water di water and the testing solution each jar was individually filled with one of the testing solutions listed in table 2 without any headspace and contained a completely submerged corrosion scale sample tubercles 6 28 placed at the bottom of each jar all of the jars were sealed kept in a dark temperature controlled room 25 c and exposed for 132 h during the exposure period a 10 ml aliquot was sampled with a syringe at approximately 10 cm below the water level and subsequently processed to determine the metal concentrations sampling was performed with caution to avoid agitating the stagnant water water was sampled every 2 h in the initial 12 h period of exposure and every 24 h thereafter no additional water was added to the jars during the experiment meaning that there was an approximate 0 3 cm headspace in each jar at the end of the experiment after the 132 h exposure period the corrosion scales were removed from the jars dried in vacuum at 20 c and weighed to determine the weight loss associated with the release of their components using eq 4 4 wl δ w w i n i 100 where wl is the weight loss of corrosion scales in δ w is the change of weight after 132 h experiment in g and w i n i is the initial weight of corrosion scales before experiment in g 2 3 2 recirculating pipe system a recirculation scale exposure system was assembled to simulate active flow conditions in dwds fig 1 tubercles 29 37 with a weight of 153 g in total were placed in a nylon net and fixed in the transparent polymethyl methacrylate pmma pipe section length 150 cm inner diameter 10 cm and outer diameter 10 5 cm which was covered with light proof material an 80 l tank length 40 cm width 40 cm and height 50 cm made of polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp was used as a sump for the recirculated water water velocity in the system was adjusted to 4 7 l s 0 6 m s in the pmma pipe section using a variable frequency pump crundfos denmark and a speed controller zoncn h3000 china an ultrasonic flowmeter dalian haifeng tds 100h china was used to verify and record the flow velocity all other hydraulic connections in the system were made using polyethylene pe piping length 120 cm inner diameter 5 cm and outer diameter 5 3 cm all of the connections in the system were sealed with epoxy resin one plastic valve was installed at the tank outlet to allow water discharge and another one was used as an air exhaust the volume of recirculated water inside the system was approximately 90 l therefore the ratio of scale weight to water volume was comparable in the stagnant and flow setups prior to the onset of the experiment the recirculation pipe system was sequentially rinsed using tap water di water and the testing solution testing solutions with chemistries described in table 2 were used in the experiments at a temperature of 25 c the tests were conducted under turbulent flow condition with a reynolds number 6 104 a 240 h exposure time was chosen for these experiments as a longer period was required for the variations in released metals and other water quality parameters to stabilize during the experiments a 10 ml aliquot was sampled from the recirculation system every 24 h after the 240 h exposure period water was drained from the system and exchanged for the next testing solution as listed in table 2 2 4 analytical methods water samples were acidified using 1 nitric acid of guaranteed grade and analyzed within 24 h mhc and sac 2006b peng et al 2013 the total concentrations of released metals fe al mn zn cu ni cr and cd were determined using a thermo fisher scientific

water ph and do were measured using an electrochemistry tester hach hq40d usa titrations were conducted in accordance with standard method 2320 apha 2012 to determine alkalinity principal component analysis pca a multivariate statistical technique that has been successfully applied in the analysis of corrosion scales in dwds li et al 2019 was used to assess the relationships between alkalinity concentrations of chloride and sulfate and metals released from the corrosion scales data were analyzed using spss 22 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of corrosion scales physico chemical characteristics of the exposed corrosion scales including their micromorphology porosity and composition have been discussed in detail in our prior studies li et al 2018 2019 the corrosion tubercles which were dispersed throughout the pipe and usually have a well developed layered structure are shown in fig s1 fig s2 demonstrates that 0 2 μm acicular formations were present in the outer layers of the corrosion tubercles figs s2a and s2b while 0 2 μm granular structures were relatively pronounced in their inner layers figs s2c and s2d fe accounted for approximately one third of the weight of the corrosion scales followed by o and c table s1 si ca s al and other trace metals are often present in scales at varying levels depending on the pipe material water quality and hydraulic conditions li et al 2018 2019 the xrd results fig s3 demonstrate that quartz sio2 was the main crystalline phase formed in the studied corrosion tubercles while goethite α feooh magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 were also found in their outer layers and lepidocrocite γ feooh in their inner layers goethite magnetite and maghemite are more stable and beneficial for maintaining the integrity of corrosion tubercles sontheimer et al 1981 sarin et al 2001 3 2 variations in water chemical composition time profiles for metal release determined with cl and so4 2 concentrations of 23 mg l and 60 mg l respectively are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 shows the variations in water ph do and alkalinity during the experiments for the 132 h stagnation tests the concentrations of fe released from corrosion scales reached 190 260 μg l within the initial 12 h becoming relatively stable thereafter fig 2a prior studies have also shown that fe is mainly released during the initial periods of exposure after which a quasi equilibrium can be achieved sarin et al 2004a li et al 2016 releases of cu ni and cd exhibited a similar trend and their concentrations varied within the range of 0 1 0 4 μg l 1 4 2 0 μg l and 0 06 0 09 μg l respectively in the stable stage fig 2e f and 2h the concentrations of al 0 20 μg l zn 1 10 μg l and cr 0 0 15 μg l fluctuated during the entire exposure period fig 2b d and 2g mn concentration gradually increased with the exposure time from 2 μg l to 50 μg l fig 2c suggesting that a prolonged stagnation time would further increase mn release which is a concern for operational dwds for the tests conducted under active flow conditions fe al and ni were released rapidly within the first 24 h of the experiments and their concentrations were largely stable thereafter fig 2a b and 2f however the observed metal concentrations were significantly different for samples with differing water chemistry see section 3 3 mn concentrations fluctuated in the initial stages of exposure but gradually stabilized over time fig 2c while concentrations of zn varied throughout the entire exposure period fig 2d these fluctuations probably resulted from metal release deposition processes in the recirculation system a notable increase in the release of cu occurred after ca 100 h of exposure fig 2e while only trace levels of cr 0 2 μg l and cd 0 1 μg l were released metals are released into water at least partially due to the solubilization of pipeline materials and the dissolution of metal compounds accumulated in corrosion scales fig 3a and b demonstrate that metal release was accompanied by an increase in water ph and a decline in do the change in do is likely to be associated with the oxidation of metal species in the scales and associated microbial activity lechevallier et al 1993 sarin et al 2004a 2004b li et al 2016 hu et al 2018 the resulting reduction of o2 to oh increases water ph alkalinity was found to decrease with exposure time fig 3c especially for the high alkalinity solutions 200 mg l under active flow conditions this was likely to be due to the precipitation of carbonates during the experiments as facilitated by the flowing water as further discussed in sections 3 3 2 and 3 4 3 3 effects of alkalinity chloride and sulfate on metal release 3 3 1 stagnation the correlation matrix for alkalinity concentrations of chloride and sulfate and metal release is shown in table 3 table 3 a demonstrates that for the 132 h stagnation experiments water alkalinity was positively correlated with al and cu release and negatively correlated with fe release p 0 01 this indicates that alkalinity increases from 50 mg l to 200 mg l can reduce the concentration of fe but at the same time may accelerate the release of al and cu fig 4a d 4i and 4 j prior studies have also identified the antagonistic effects of increasing alkalinity on fe and cu release in dwds imran et al 2006 shi et al 2006 soluble species such as cuco3 aq and cuhco3 formed in the ph range of 7 0 8 5 facilitate the release of cu with increasing alkalinity edwards et al 1996 fig 5 demonstrates that an increase in alkalinity from 50 mg l to 125 200 mg l reduced the weight loss of corrosion scales from 2 to 1 in contrast fe concentrations were positively correlated with cl and so4 2 r 0 37 and r 0 45 respectively but not significantly so this indicates that an increase in cl from 5 mg l to 60 mg l and so4 2 from 20 mg l to 100 mg l can accelerate the release of fe fig 4a b this finding is in agreement with prior studies indicating that cl and so4 2 ions are aggressive with respect to the protective films formed on the surfaces of corrosion scales as they can react with fe ii and fe iii based solid phases and cause structural instability these ions can also form soluble complexes with fe ii and fe iii ions thus accelerating fe release elzenga et al 1987 veleva et al 1998 lasheen et al 2008 the aggressive effect induced by cl and so4 2 ions together with the protective action of alkalinity accounts for a strong correlation r 0 93 between the lr values and fe concentrations the concept of the lr was initially introduced to evaluate the corrosivity of water it has since been used to predict fe corrosion and release in dwds larson and skold 1958 mcneill and edwards 2001 imran et al 2005b fig 6 a demonstrates that under stagnant conditions fe concentration increased as lr increased in addition so4 2 had a significantly negative effect on the release of ni p 0 01 and cd p 0 05 the presence of cl may increase cr release to a certain extent r 0 46 p 0 05 while only trace amounts of cr 0 2 μg l and cd 0 1 μg l were detected pca of the data generated from the 132 h stagnation tests showed that the data can be interpreted based on 4 principal components pcs table 4 a shows the loadings of the original variables on the pcs pc1 explained 26 2 of the overall variance having positive associations with alkalinity al and cu and a negative association with fe as such pc1 represented the significant effects of alkalinity on metal release from the corrosion scales pc2 explained 25 9 of the variance having a negative association with so4 2 and positive associations with mn ni and cd pc2 is interpreted to represent the effect of so4 2 on metal release pc3 explained 15 5 of the variance having positive associations with cl and cr and representing the accelerating effect of cl on cr release zn release which was associated with pc4 appeared to be independent of the three tested water quality parameters 3 3 2 active flow conditions similar to the results obtained under stagnant conditions fe concentrations measured under active flow conditions were positively correlated with cl and so4 2 and negatively correlated with alkalinity table 3b these trends were also associated with a strong and positive correlation between lr values and fe release p 0 01 and similar effects were observed for the release of al and zn alkalinity was also negatively correlated with mn release r 0 66 p 0 01 fig 4a h demonstrate that an increase in alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l resulted in lower rates of fe al mn and zn release under the active flow conditions this may have been associated with the precipitation of calcite and possibly other carbonate solids on the scale surfaces with the resultant inhibition of metal release and discoloration larson and skold 1957 1958 larson 1960 sander et al 1996 high alkalinity waters 150 mg l have been recognized as effective for mitigating fe release shi et al 2006 alshehri et al 2009 imran et al 2005a also determined an 80 mg l alkalinity threshold for beneficial red water control in addition prior research has shown that for high alkalinity waters with sufficient concentrations of oxidants the oxidation of fe ii generates goethite and magnetite as shown in eq 1 and eq 2 these solids are less soluble and thus their presence is conducive to the control of metal release sontheimer et al 1981 the data presented in fig 4a d 4g and 4h show that the release of fe al and zn was enhanced when the concentrations of so4 2 and cl were increased from 20 mg l to 100 mg l and from 5 mg l to 60 mg l respectively particularly under low alkalinity conditions 50 mg l given the corrosivity of cl and so4 2 and the protective effect of alkalinity waters with a lr 0 5 are usually considered corrosive while those with a lr 0 3 are recommended for dwds imran et al 2005b melidis et al 2007 schock and lytle 2011 lechevallier et al 1993 proposed that disinfection efficiency can be enhanced when the lr 1 0 our data show a clear increase in the concentrations of fe al and zn under active flow conditions when lr 1 3 fig 6 four pcs were extracted via pca of metal release data obtained under active flow conditions table 4 b pc1 was negatively associated with alkalinity and positively associated with fe al mn and zn explaining 33 3 of the total variance as such pc1 is interpreted as the effect of alkalinity on metal release pc2 explained 17 7 of the data variance having positive associations with so4 2 fe and zn and a negative association with cr pc2 presents the effect of so4 2 on metal release pc3 was positively associated with cl and negatively associated with ni explaining 15 5 of the total variance pc4 was positively associated with cu and cd which explained 14 6 of the overall variance the results show that for the testing conditions used in this study the protective effect of increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l surpassed the aggressiveness effect of increasing so4 2 and cl concentrations from 20 mg l to 100 mg l and from 5 mg l to 60 mg l respectively this implies that when a conventional water source is switched to another that is abundant in so4 2 or cl the addition of bicarbonates can be an effective measure to increase alkalinity and thereby reduce the risk of metal release thus improving the stability and resilience of dwds in this study the water chemistries investigated are representative of the range of water sources used in the snwd mid route area and the corrosion scales used in the experiments were sampled from a water main from a local dwds therefore these results are of considerable practical importance for situations when local water sources are brought during emergencies to replace transfer from the danjiangkou reservoir which has relatively low so4 2 and cl concentrations however these observations may need to be validated further when applied to other dwds 3 4 comparison of metal release under stagnant and active flow conditions the findings described in the previous sections demonstrate that the release of metal constituents may be significantly different when measured under stagnant and active flow conditions during the 132 h stagnation experiments levels of released fe reached up to 200 μg l figs 2a 4a 4b and 6a and accounted for more than 80 of the total metal released from corrosion scales fe release was followed in descending order by mn 14 99 zn 1 02 al 0 96 ni 0 64 and cu 0 06 fig 7 a in contrast fe released in active flow were reduced to 100 μg l and accounted for approximately 75 of the total metal release compared to the release of al 15 23 zn 8 14 cu 0 70 mn 0 30 and ni 0 26 which accounted for the remaining 25 fig 7b under the stagnant conditions fe release was associated with the do content fig 8 r 0 65 p 0 05 flowing water promotes the convection and diffusion of do provides sufficient oxidants near to pipe surfaces and prevents iron oxides from being reduced and dissolved larson and skold 1958 sarin et al 2004a fabbricino and korshin 2014 in addition active flow conditions accelerate the mass transfer of other water components including carbonate species which might facilitate the formation of protective films on scale surfaces and thereby preserve their integrity this is demonstrated in fig 3c which shows that in higher alkalinity waters 125 mg l and 200 mg l alkalinity decreased with the exposure time under active flow conditions but remained almost constant under stagnant conditions with active flow the protective effect induced by increasing alkalinity was observed not only for fe but also for the release of al zn and mn section 3 3 no such effects were observed in the 132 h stagnation experiments fig 2c f and 7 demonstrate that mn and ni are more likely to be released during periods of stagnation it is notable that mn release was two orders of magnitude higher under stagnant conditions compared to active flow conditions prior research has shown that mn tends to be mobilized in anoxic water stone and morgan 1984 jakyum 1993 royer and unz 1999 which appears to reflect stagnant conditions as such do in the water adjacent to the surface of corrosion scales or within them is sufficiently depleted so as to promote the reduction of manganese oxides to soluble mn ii species that are subsequently released from the scales fig 8 demonstrates a gradual increase in mn release in association with do consumption throughout the exposure period r 0 90 p 0 01 this observation is in agreement with prior studies that have demonstrated notable ni absorption by manganese oxides the instability of which results in the co release of mn and ni during stagnation or on the other hand the resistance of these metals to mobilization under active flow conditions green pedersen et al 1997 trivedi et al 2001 peng and korhsin 2011 in contrast with the trends observed for fe mn and ni exposures in flowing water tended to result in increased al zn and cu levels reaching concentrations an order of magnitude higher than under stagnation fig 2b d 2e and 7 the observed variations in water ph may account for the release of al a ph above 7 8 may contribute to a more prominent formation of soluble al oh 4 complexes released from insoluble aluminum oxide or hydroxide complexes hem and roberson 1967 roberson and hem 1969 the formation of these complexes can also destabilize the exposed scales and stimulate the release of co accumulated metals such as fe al and zn as indicated by the strong and positive correlations between them table 3b as previously mentioned higher levels of carbonate species in water will promote the formation of soluble cuco3 aq and cuhco3 and increase cu release edwards et al 1996 imran et al 2006 shi et al 2006 as such flowing water accelerates the transfer of solutes to the water in dwds this study examined the effects of water chemistry on metal release under different flow conditions while the 132 h stagnation and 0 6 m s flow exposures adopted for our experiment are representative of the conditions expected to occur in many dwds hydraulic conditions are often more diverse due to wider range of flow velocities reynolds numbers and possible occurrence of transient flows such as water hammer effects all these aspects can have an important influence on metal release and the stability of exposed corrosion scales as such further research is required to determine the extent and significance of these additional effects 4 conclusions this study quantified the effects of alkalinity chloride and sulfate on metal release from corrosion scales sampled from an iron main pipe the range of examined conditions represents those commonly occurring in dwds in which new water supply sources that are chemically distinct from the existing supplies are brought such operational changes have taken place in the snwd mid route area of china which supplies water to hundreds of millions of consumers jar tests and recirculating pipe systems were used to investigate metal release under stagnant and active flow conditions respectively the release of the metal constituents of exposed scales was significantly different under different flow conditions fe mn and ni were released more prominently in the 132 h stagnation tests which was partly explained by the depletion of do the release of al zn and cu under active flow conditions was an order of magnitude higher than under stagnant conditions probably due to lower mass transfer limitations only trace amounts of cr 0 2 μg l and cd 0 1 μg l were released under both the active flow and stagnant conditions increases in concentrations of chloride from 5 mg l to 60 mg l and sulfate from 20 mg l to 100 mg l tended to stimulate the release of fe al and zn especially under the active flow conditions this effect is indicative of the reduced stability of the exposed scales at elevated chloride and sulfate levels which can be effectively mitigated by increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l to achieve a lr of 1 3 our findings can be used to predict the effects of short and long term changes in water chemistry i e alkalinity and concentrations of chloride and sulfate on the stability of significant amounts of corrosion scales as such our results can inform the control of metal release in dwds by securing more diverse water supplies and improving stability and resilience declaration of competing

18009,the release of potentially toxic metal ions from corrosion scales formed on pipe surfaces is of great concern for water quality in drinking water distribution systems dwds this study examined the effects of alkalinity chloride and sulfate on metal release from corrosion scales sampled from a corroded iron pipe jar tests and recirculation pipe systems were used to investigate the metal release potential during stagnant and active flow conditions the experimental data show that both the ambient water chemistry and hydraulic conditions exerted complex influences on metal release from the exposed corrosion scales fe mn and ni were more labile to be released during a 132 h period of stagnation while the release of al zn and cu was an order of magnitude higher under flow conditions compared to stagnant conditions increasing concentrations of chloride from 5 mg l to 60 mg l and sulfate from 20 mg l to 100 mg l resulted in the increased release of fe al and zn especially under active flow conditions this effect could be effectively mitigated by increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l as caco3 while increasing alkalinity suppressed the release of fe and stimulated the release of al and cu under stagnant conditions this contradictory effect was not observed under active flow conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal release corrosion scales alkalinity

from dwds transporting treated water with low as concentrations 10 μg l li et al 2020 also observed pb enrichment 1 3 g kg in the corrosion scales formed in low lead 10 mg kg galvanized steel coupons that were exposed to treated water with low pb concentrations 10 μg l the release of these contaminants can cause water discoloration and taste odor issues and more importantly pose a threat to human health lasheen et al 2008 clark et al 2015 hanna attisha et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 fe tends to be the dominant metal constituent of corrosion scales formed in iron water mains and iron service lines in dwds followed by varying levels of ca mn zn al mg and other trace metals resulting from their adsorption occlusion and co precipitation peng et al 2010 2012 veschetti et al 2010 li et al 2019 iron release can decrease the aesthetic quality of drinking water by increasing turbidity and leading to discoloration sarin et al 2004a 2004b imran et al 2005a 2006 other studies have also documented that the occurrence of toxic contaminants such as pb as and cr in dwds is closely associated with iron release lytle et al 2004 gerke et al 2008 peng et al 2010 2012 an fe concentration limit of 0 3 mg l is currently specified in both the secondary maximum contaminant level guidelines in the united states usepa 1991 and the standards for drinking water quality in china mhc and sac 2006a potential sources of al in corrosion scales include impurities in the pipe metal materials water sources and residuals from the water treatment process snoeyink et al 2003 hill 2010 kim and herrera 2010 prior studies have demonstrated a notable occurrence of al in tap water and corrosion deposits when al based coagulants are used in water treatment lin et al 2001 kim and herrera 2010 peng et al 2010 the accumulation of al may result in the formation of crystalline phases such as alumina al2o3 and gibbsite al oh 3 the precipitation of amorphous hydroxide and the adsorption of al3 complexes snoeyink et al 2003 kim and herrera 2010 li et al 2019 as galvanized steel is frequently applied in service lines the presence of zn in the corrosion scales mainly occurs as a result of the oxidation of zinc coatings lin et al 2001 sarin et al 2001 tang et al 2006a 2018 li et al 2019 2020 the use of zn orthophosphate corrosion inhibitors in some dwds is another potential source tang et al 2018 zn mainly accumulates in the form of zincite zno and hydrozincite zn5 co3 2 oh 6 tang et al 2006a li et al 2018 corrosion of copper and brass fittings in domestic plumbing systems can be a major source of the cu accumulating in corrosion scales boulay and edwards 2001 shi et al 2006 d antonio et al 2008 hill 2010 while cu regulations are not necessarily enforced in some countries excessive release of cu by products can cause aesthetic issues e g blue water the lead and copper rule in the united states stipulates that 90 of samples should have a cu concentration of 1 3 mg l imran et al 2006 shi et al 2006 in comparison the guideline amount for cu given by the standards for drinking water quality in china is 1 0 mg l mhc and sac 2006a corrosion scales can be destabilized due to the switch from one water source to another especially when water chemistry parameters e g ph alkalinity and concentrations of sulfate and chloride in these sources are sufficiently different imran et al 2005a 2006 tang et al 2006b alshehri et al 2009 yang et al 2012 2014 consequently metals accumulated in corrosion scales such as fe zn cu al and other trace contaminants can be released into the water for example tucson arizona and north china suffered from red water issues after conventional groundwater sources were replaced with surface water in their dwds price and jefferson 1997 yang et al 2012 2014 a significant rise in pb release was associated with water discoloration in flint michigan when a temporary drinking water source was used without proper corrosion control this consequently led to severe health issues for the local residents hanna attisha et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 experimental studies in tampa florida have also revealed that change of water quality due to water source blending alters the release potential of metals such as fe cu and pb imran et al 2005a 2006 shi et al 2006 tang et al 2006b alshehri et al 2009 in order to address the water shortage in north china water from the danjiangkou reservoir in south china has been transferred to beijing and other northern cities since late 2014 via the mid route of the south to north water diversion snwd project water in the danjiangkou reservoir has average concentrations of chloride and sulfate of 4 5 mg l and 30 mg l respectively and alkalinity of approximately 105 mg l as caco3 hereafter wang 2015 li et al 2018 these anionic concentrations differ from the composition of most conventional water sources in north china which tend to have higher amounts of chloride 15 54 mg l and sulfate 23 85 mg l and varying levels of alkalinity 130 220 mg l thus the switch in water between local sources and the danjiangkou reservoir might result in metal release due to the potential instability of corrosion scales and sediments found in these systems prior research has shown that increasing alkalinity to greater than 80 150 mg l can alleviate iron release and red water episodes since stable carbonates such as caco3 tend to precipitate and form a protective film on pipe surfaces sander et al 1996 imran et al 2005a 2006 shi and taylor 2007 lasheen et al 2008 alshehri et al 2009 hu et al 2018 in high alkalinity water with sufficient oxidants the formation of goethite eq 1 and magnetite eq 2 also helps to preserve the stability of corrosion scale layer sontheimer et al 1981 1 2fe2 1 2o2 4oh 2feooh s goethite h2o 2 3feco3 s 1 2o2 fe3o4 s magnetite 3co2 in contrast chloride and sulfate are aggressive with respect to the iron oxides protective films and their presence tends to accelerate pipe corrosion and iron release imran et al 2005a 2006 lasheen et al 2008 alshehri et al 2009 peng et al 2013 hu et al 2018 the larson ratio lr eq 3 is deemed to be a good descriptor of the corrosivity induced by chloride and sulfate vs the protective action of alkalinity which has been widely used for the evaluation of the corrosion potential of iron and red water risk larson and skold 1958 mcneill and edwards 2001 imran et al 2005b 3 lr c l 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 the concentrations of sulfate chloride and bicarbonate in the above formula are expressed in milliequivalents per liter units however variations in alkalinity and concentrations of chloride and sulfate have been found to cause complex and in some cases contradictory effects on metal release shi et al 2006 found that reducing water alkalinity from 158 to 207 mg l to 68 90 mg l through lime softening can increase fe release potential but decrease cu release imran et al 2006 also proposed that increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 80 mg l is beneficial for red water control but at the same time accelerates cu release similarly the abundance of sulfate in surface water has been reported to simultaneously increase fe release and decrease pb release imran et al 2006 accordingly water that meets the quality regulations for one metal might not meet those for another as such the effects of variations in alkalinity and chloride and sulfate levels on the release potential of different metals required more detailed research if suitable guidelines and limits are to be established in addition to the chemical desorption and dissolution of corrosion scales the hydraulic remobilization of particles from deposited scales may also account for a significant fraction of released metals in dwds sarin et al 2001 vreeburg and boxall 2007 husband and boxall 2016 li et al 2016 indeed hydraulic conditions can influence metal release in many ways for example flowing water alters the rates of convection and diffusion of solutes thus influencing the processes of precipitation and dissolution sarin et al 2001 li et al 2016 at the same time flow velocity and regime affect the shear stress applied on pipe surfaces which is a dominant control on the deposition and remobilization of particulates vreeburg and boxall 2007 husband and boxall 2016 however the interactive effects of water chemistry and hydraulic condition on metal release potential remains to be assessed in this study jar tests and experimental recirculating pipe systems were used to compare metal release from iron corrosion scales during both stagnant and active flow conditions these tests were conducted using waters with varying alkalinities and chloride and sulfate concentrations representative of the conditions found in most dwds 2 materials and methods 2 1 scale sampling and characterization corrosion scales were sampled from a 1 0 m diameter water main in zhengzhou city henan province china this main pipe made of unlined cast iron had been in service for 30 years before excavation the water supplied to zhengzhou city is conventionally sourced from the yellow river which has typical chloride and sulfate concentrations of 54 mg l and 86 mg l respectively table 1 in december 2014 the water source in zhengzhou city was switched into the danjiangkou reservoir as a result of the snwd mid route project as the main pipe used in this study was excavated in april 2016 its inside surfaces had first been in contact with water from the yellow river for nearly 30 years and then following the commissioning of the snwd project water from the danjiangkou reservoir for approximately 1 5 years water quality parameters for these two water sources are summarized in table 1 thirty seven corrosion tubercles with a similar weight 17 0 0 5 g were sampled from the inner walls of the pipe supplementary information fig s1 carefully rinsed with deionized di water to remove loosely attached particles from the scale surfaces and dried under vacuum at 20 c these samples were recorded as tubercles 1 37 respectively tubercles 1 5 were pulverized and used for physico chemical characterization scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan was employed to observe the microstructures of the corrosion tubercles elemental composition was determined by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds hitachi s 4800 japan and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher scientific icap q usa while the crystalline phases were identified using x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance germany the remaining 32 corrosion tubercles which were weighed prior to the experiments were prepared for exposures in jar tests and recirculating pipe testing systems the surfaces of these tubercles that had become attached to the pipe walls in service were coated with polyvinyl chloride pvc to prevent metal release which would not happen in real systems as a result only the tubercle surfaces that were in contact with water whilst in service were exposed to water during the subsequent testing 2 2 preparation of testing solutions in order to determine the effects of sulfate chloride and alkalinity on metal release from the corrosion scales these parameters were varied within the range of 20 100 mg l 5 60 mg l and 50 200 mg l respectively these ranges encompass almost all possible conditions in the snwd mid route area and are representative of conditions found in most dwds twenty three testing solutions table 2 were prepared at 25 c and kept in an air and light proof water tank requisite amounts of analytical grade nahco3 and na2co3 were added into di water to achieve the target alkalinity based on the chemical equilibrium of the carbonic system benjamin 2001 analytical grade mgso4 k2so4 and cacl2 were added to adjust the concentrations of so4 2 and cl respectively to the target values shown in table 2 analytical grade ca no3 2 4h2o mg no3 2 6h2o and kno3 were added to adjust the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and k to 60 mg l 24 mg l and 3 mg l respectively which are approximate to the typical levels for most dwds water ph was adjusted to 7 3 by adding analytical grade nitric acid 2 3 test systems 2 3 1 jar tests jar tests were adopted to investigate metal release under stagnant conditions twenty three 10 l polyethylene jars with a height of 30 cm were sequentially rinsed with 0 1m hno3 tap water di water and the testing solution each jar was individually filled with one of the testing solutions listed in table 2 without any headspace and contained a completely submerged corrosion scale sample tubercles 6 28 placed at the bottom of each jar all of the jars were sealed kept in a dark temperature controlled room 25 c and exposed for 132 h during the exposure period a 10 ml aliquot was sampled with a syringe at approximately 10 cm below the water level and subsequently processed to determine the metal concentrations sampling was performed with caution to avoid agitating the stagnant water water was sampled every 2 h in the initial 12 h period of exposure and every 24 h thereafter no additional water was added to the jars during the experiment meaning that there was an approximate 0 3 cm headspace in each jar at the end of the experiment after the 132 h exposure period the corrosion scales were removed from the jars dried in vacuum at 20 c and weighed to determine the weight loss associated with the release of their components using eq 4 4 wl δ w w i n i 100 where wl is the weight loss of corrosion scales in δ w is the change of weight after 132 h experiment in g and w i n i is the initial weight of corrosion scales before experiment in g 2 3 2 recirculating pipe system a recirculation scale exposure system was assembled to simulate active flow conditions in dwds fig 1 tubercles 29 37 with a weight of 153 g in total were placed in a nylon net and fixed in the transparent polymethyl methacrylate pmma pipe section length 150 cm inner diameter 10 cm and outer diameter 10 5 cm which was covered with light proof material an 80 l tank length 40 cm width 40 cm and height 50 cm made of polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp was used as a sump for the recirculated water water velocity in the system was adjusted to 4 7 l s 0 6 m s in the pmma pipe section using a variable frequency pump crundfos denmark and a speed controller zoncn h3000 china an ultrasonic flowmeter dalian haifeng tds 100h china was used to verify and record the flow velocity all other hydraulic connections in the system were made using polyethylene pe piping length 120 cm inner diameter 5 cm and outer diameter 5 3 cm all of the connections in the system were sealed with epoxy resin one plastic valve was installed at the tank outlet to allow water discharge and another one was used as an air exhaust the volume of recirculated water inside the system was approximately 90 l therefore the ratio of scale weight to water volume was comparable in the stagnant and flow setups prior to the onset of the experiment the recirculation pipe system was sequentially rinsed using tap water di water and the testing solution testing solutions with chemistries described in table 2 were used in the experiments at a temperature of 25 c the tests were conducted under turbulent flow condition with a reynolds number 6 104 a 240 h exposure time was chosen for these experiments as a longer period was required for the variations in released metals and other water quality parameters to stabilize during the experiments a 10 ml aliquot was sampled from the recirculation system every 24 h after the 240 h exposure period water was drained from the system and exchanged for the next testing solution as listed in table 2 2 4 analytical methods water samples were acidified using 1 nitric acid of guaranteed grade and analyzed within 24 h mhc and sac 2006b peng et al 2013 the total concentrations of released metals fe al mn zn cu ni cr and cd were determined using a thermo fisher scientific icap q icp ms instrument usa in accordance with standard method 3125 apha 2012 each measurement was performed for three times blanks and concentration standards were measured every 15 samples run water ph and do were measured using an electrochemistry tester hach hq40d usa titrations were conducted in accordance with standard method 2320 apha 2012 to determine alkalinity principal component analysis pca a multivariate statistical technique that has been successfully applied in the analysis of corrosion scales in dwds li et al 2019 was used to assess the relationships between alkalinity concentrations of chloride and sulfate and metals released from the corrosion scales data were analyzed using spss 22 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of corrosion scales physico chemical characteristics of the exposed corrosion scales including their micromorphology porosity and composition have been discussed in detail in our prior studies li et al 2018 2019 the corrosion tubercles which were dispersed throughout the pipe and usually have a well developed layered structure are shown in fig s1 fig s2 demonstrates that 0 2 μm acicular formations were present in the outer layers of the corrosion tubercles figs s2a and s2b while 0 2 μm granular structures were relatively pronounced in their inner layers figs s2c and s2d fe accounted for approximately one third of the weight of the corrosion scales followed by o and c table s1 si ca s al and other trace metals are often present in scales at varying levels depending on the pipe material water quality and hydraulic conditions li et al 2018 2019 the xrd results fig s3 demonstrate that quartz sio2 was the main crystalline phase formed in the studied corrosion tubercles while goethite α feooh magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 were also found in their outer layers and lepidocrocite γ feooh in their inner layers goethite magnetite and maghemite are more stable and beneficial for maintaining the integrity of corrosion tubercles sontheimer et al 1981 sarin et al 2001 3 2 variations in water chemical composition time profiles for metal release determined with cl and so4 2 concentrations of 23 mg l and 60 mg l respectively are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 shows the variations in water ph do and alkalinity during the experiments for the 132 h stagnation tests the concentrations of fe released from corrosion scales reached 190 260 μg l within the initial 12 h becoming relatively stable thereafter fig 2a prior studies have also shown that fe is mainly released during the initial periods of exposure after which a quasi equilibrium can be achieved sarin et al 2004a li et al 2016 releases of cu ni and cd exhibited a similar trend and their concentrations varied within the range of 0 1 0 4 μg l 1 4 2 0 μg l and 0 06 0 09 μg l respectively in the stable stage fig 2e f and 2h the concentrations of al 0 20 μg l zn 1 10 μg l and cr 0 0 15 μg l fluctuated during the entire exposure period fig 2b d and 2g mn concentration gradually increased with the exposure time from 2 μg l to 50 μg l fig 2c suggesting that a prolonged stagnation time would further increase mn release which is a concern for operational dwds for the tests conducted under active flow conditions fe al and ni were released rapidly within the first 24 h of the experiments and their concentrations were largely stable thereafter fig 2a b and 2f however the observed metal concentrations were significantly different for samples with differing water chemistry see section 3 3 mn concentrations fluctuated in the initial stages of exposure but gradually stabilized over time fig 2c while concentrations of zn varied throughout the entire exposure period fig 2d these fluctuations probably resulted from metal release deposition processes in the recirculation system a notable increase in the release of cu occurred after ca 100 h of exposure fig 2e while only trace levels of cr 0 2 μg l and cd 0 1 μg l were released metals are released into water at least partially due to the solubilization of pipeline materials and the dissolution of metal compounds accumulated in corrosion scales fig 3a and b demonstrate that metal release was accompanied by an increase in water ph and a decline in do the change in do is likely to be associated with the oxidation of metal species in the scales and associated microbial activity lechevallier et al 1993 sarin et al 2004a 2004b li et al 2016 hu et al 2018 the resulting reduction of o2 to oh increases water ph alkalinity was found to decrease with exposure time fig 3c especially for the high alkalinity solutions 200 mg l under active flow conditions this was likely to be due to the precipitation of carbonates during the experiments as facilitated by the flowing water as further discussed in sections 3 3 2 and 3 4 3 3 effects of alkalinity chloride and sulfate on metal release 3 3 1 stagnation the correlation matrix for alkalinity concentrations of chloride and sulfate and metal release is shown in table 3 table 3 a demonstrates that for the 132 h stagnation experiments water alkalinity was positively correlated with al and cu release and negatively correlated with fe release p 0 01 this indicates that alkalinity increases from 50 mg l to 200 mg l can reduce the concentration of fe but at the same time may accelerate the release of al and cu fig 4a d 4i and 4 j prior studies have also identified the antagonistic effects of increasing alkalinity on fe and cu release in dwds imran et al 2006 shi et al 2006 soluble species such as cuco3 aq and cuhco3 formed in the ph range of 7 0 8 5 facilitate the release of cu with increasing alkalinity edwards et al 1996 fig 5 demonstrates that an increase in alkalinity from 50 mg l to 125 200 mg l reduced the weight loss of corrosion scales from 2 to 1 in contrast fe concentrations were positively correlated with cl and so4 2 r 0 37 and r 0 45 respectively but not significantly so this indicates that an increase in cl from 5 mg l to 60 mg l and so4 2 from 20 mg l to 100 mg l can accelerate the release of fe fig 4a b this finding is in agreement with prior studies indicating that cl and so4 2 ions are aggressive with respect to the protective films formed on the surfaces of corrosion scales as they can react with fe ii and fe iii based solid phases and cause structural instability these ions can also form soluble complexes with fe ii and fe iii ions thus accelerating fe release elzenga et al 1987 veleva et al 1998 lasheen et al 2008 the aggressive effect induced by cl and so4 2 ions together with the protective action of alkalinity accounts for a strong correlation r 0 93 between the lr values and fe concentrations the concept of the lr was initially introduced to evaluate the corrosivity of water it has since been used to predict fe corrosion and release in dwds larson and skold 1958 mcneill and edwards 2001 imran et al 2005b fig 6 a demonstrates that under stagnant conditions fe concentration increased as lr increased in addition so4 2 had a significantly negative effect on the release of ni p 0 01 and cd p 0 05 the presence of cl may increase cr release to a certain extent r 0 46 p 0 05 while only trace amounts of cr 0 2 μg l and cd 0 1 μg l were detected pca of the data generated from the 132 h stagnation tests showed that the data can be interpreted based on 4 principal components pcs table 4 a shows the loadings of the original variables on the pcs pc1 explained 26 2 of the overall variance having positive associations with alkalinity al and cu and a negative association with fe as such pc1 represented the significant effects of alkalinity on metal release from the corrosion scales pc2 explained 25 9 of the variance having a negative association with so4 2 and positive associations with mn ni and cd pc2 is interpreted to represent the effect of so4 2 on metal release pc3 explained 15 5 of the variance having positive associations with cl and cr and representing the accelerating effect of cl on cr release zn release which was associated with pc4 appeared to be independent of the three tested water quality parameters 3 3 2 active flow conditions similar to the results obtained under stagnant conditions fe concentrations measured under active flow conditions were positively correlated with cl and so4 2 and negatively correlated with alkalinity table 3b these trends were also associated with a strong and positive correlation between lr values and fe release p 0 01 and similar effects were observed for the release of al and zn alkalinity was also negatively correlated with mn release r 0 66 p 0 01 fig 4a h demonstrate that an increase in alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l resulted in lower rates of fe al mn and zn release under the active flow conditions this may have been associated with the precipitation of calcite and possibly other carbonate solids on the scale surfaces with the resultant inhibition of metal release and discoloration larson and skold 1957 1958 larson 1960 sander et al 1996 high alkalinity waters 150 mg l have been recognized as effective for mitigating fe release shi et al 2006 alshehri et al 2009 imran et al 2005a also determined an 80 mg l alkalinity threshold for beneficial red water control in addition prior research has shown that for high alkalinity waters with sufficient concentrations of oxidants the oxidation of fe ii generates goethite and magnetite as shown in eq 1 and eq 2 these solids are less soluble and thus their presence is conducive to the control of metal release sontheimer et al 1981 the data presented in fig 4a d 4g and 4h show that the release of fe al and zn was enhanced when the concentrations of so4 2 and cl were increased from 20 mg l to 100 mg l and from 5 mg l to 60 mg l respectively particularly under low alkalinity conditions 50 mg l given the corrosivity of cl and so4 2 and the protective effect of alkalinity waters with a lr 0 5 are usually considered corrosive while those with a lr 0 3 are recommended for dwds imran et al 2005b melidis et al 2007 schock and lytle 2011 lechevallier et al 1993 proposed that disinfection efficiency can be enhanced when the lr 1 0 our data show a clear increase in the concentrations of fe al and zn under active flow conditions when lr 1 3 fig 6 four pcs were extracted via pca of metal release data obtained under active flow conditions table 4 b pc1 was negatively associated with alkalinity and positively associated with fe al mn and zn explaining 33 3 of the total variance as such pc1 is interpreted as the effect of alkalinity on metal release pc2 explained 17 7 of the data variance having positive associations with so4 2 fe and zn and a negative association with cr pc2 presents the effect of so4 2 on metal release pc3 was positively associated with cl and negatively associated with ni explaining 15 5 of the total variance pc4 was positively associated with cu and cd which explained 14 6 of the overall variance the results show that for the testing conditions used in this study the protective effect of increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l surpassed the aggressiveness effect of increasing so4 2 and cl concentrations from 20 mg l to 100 mg l and from 5 mg l to 60 mg l respectively this implies that when a conventional water source is switched to another that is abundant in so4 2 or cl the addition of bicarbonates can be an effective measure to increase alkalinity and thereby reduce the risk of metal release thus improving the stability and resilience of dwds in this study the water chemistries investigated are representative of the range of water sources used in the snwd mid route area and the corrosion scales used in the experiments were sampled from a water main from a local dwds therefore these results are of considerable practical importance for situations when local water sources are brought during emergencies to replace transfer from the danjiangkou reservoir which has relatively low so4 2 and cl concentrations however these observations may need to be validated further when applied to other dwds 3 4 comparison of metal release under stagnant and active flow conditions the findings described in the previous sections demonstrate that the release of metal constituents may be significantly different when measured under stagnant and active flow conditions during the 132 h stagnation experiments levels of released fe reached up to 200 μg l figs 2a 4a 4b and 6a and accounted for more than 80 of the total metal released from corrosion scales fe release was followed in descending order by mn 14 99 zn 1 02 al 0 96 ni 0 64 and cu 0 06 fig 7 a in contrast fe released in active flow were reduced to 100 μg l and accounted for approximately 75 of the total metal release compared to the release of al 15 23 zn 8 14 cu 0 70 mn 0 30 and ni 0 26 which accounted for the remaining 25 fig 7b under the stagnant conditions fe release was associated with the do content fig 8 r 0 65 p 0 05 flowing water promotes the convection and diffusion of do provides sufficient oxidants near to pipe surfaces and prevents iron oxides from being reduced and dissolved larson and skold 1958 sarin et al 2004a fabbricino and korshin 2014 in addition active flow conditions accelerate the mass transfer of other water components including carbonate species which might facilitate the formation of protective films on scale surfaces and thereby preserve their integrity this is demonstrated in fig 3c which shows that in higher alkalinity waters 125 mg l and 200 mg l alkalinity decreased with the exposure time under active flow conditions but remained almost constant under stagnant conditions with active flow the protective effect induced by increasing alkalinity was observed not only for fe but also for the release of al zn and mn section 3 3 no such effects were observed in the 132 h stagnation experiments fig 2c f and 7 demonstrate that mn and ni are more likely to be released during periods of stagnation it is notable that mn release was two orders of magnitude higher under stagnant conditions compared to active flow conditions prior research has shown that mn tends to be mobilized in anoxic water stone and morgan 1984 jakyum 1993 royer and unz 1999 which appears to reflect stagnant conditions as such do in the water adjacent to the surface of corrosion scales or within them is sufficiently depleted so as to promote the reduction of manganese oxides to soluble mn ii species that are subsequently released from the scales fig 8 demonstrates a gradual increase in mn release in association with do consumption throughout the exposure period r 0 90 p 0 01 this observation is in agreement with prior studies that have demonstrated notable ni absorption by manganese oxides the instability of which results in the co release of mn and ni during stagnation or on the other hand the resistance of these metals to mobilization under active flow conditions green pedersen et al 1997 trivedi et al 2001 peng and korhsin 2011 in contrast with the trends observed for fe mn and ni exposures in flowing water tended to result in increased al zn and cu levels reaching concentrations an order of magnitude higher than under stagnation fig 2b d 2e and 7 the observed variations in water ph may account for the release of al a ph above 7 8 may contribute to a more prominent formation of soluble al oh 4 complexes released from insoluble aluminum oxide or hydroxide complexes hem and roberson 1967 roberson and hem 1969 the formation of these complexes can also destabilize the exposed scales and stimulate the release of co accumulated metals such as fe al and zn as indicated by the strong and positive correlations between them table 3b as previously mentioned higher levels of carbonate species in water will promote the formation of soluble cuco3 aq and cuhco3 and increase cu release edwards et al 1996 imran et al 2006 shi et al 2006 as such flowing water accelerates the transfer of solutes to the water in dwds this study examined the effects of water chemistry on metal release under different flow conditions while the 132 h stagnation and 0 6 m s flow exposures adopted for our experiment are representative of the conditions expected to occur in many dwds hydraulic conditions are often more diverse due to wider range of flow velocities reynolds numbers and possible occurrence of transient flows such as water hammer effects all these aspects can have an important influence on metal release and the stability of exposed corrosion scales as such further research is required to determine the extent and significance of these additional effects 4 conclusions this study quantified the effects of alkalinity chloride and sulfate on metal release from corrosion scales sampled from an iron main pipe the range of examined conditions represents those commonly occurring in dwds in which new water supply sources that are chemically distinct from the existing supplies are brought such operational changes have taken place in the snwd mid route area of china which supplies water to hundreds of millions of consumers jar tests and recirculating pipe systems were used to investigate metal release under stagnant and active flow conditions respectively the release of the metal constituents of exposed scales was significantly different under different flow conditions fe mn and ni were released more prominently in the 132 h stagnation tests which was partly explained by the depletion of do the release of al zn and cu under active flow conditions was an order of magnitude higher than under stagnant conditions probably due to lower mass transfer limitations only trace amounts of cr 0 2 μg l and cd 0 1 μg l were released under both the active flow and stagnant conditions increases in concentrations of chloride from 5 mg l to 60 mg l and sulfate from 20 mg l to 100 mg l tended to stimulate the release of fe al and zn especially under the active flow conditions this effect is indicative of the reduced stability of the exposed scales at elevated chloride and sulfate levels which can be effectively mitigated by increasing alkalinity from 50 mg l to 200 mg l to achieve a lr of 1 3 our findings can be used to predict the effects of short and long term changes in water chemistry i e alkalinity and concentrations of chloride and sulfate on the stability of significant amounts of corrosion scales as such our results can inform the control of metal release in dwds by securing more diverse water supplies and improving stability and resilience declaration of competing
