3325,accurate rainfall datasets with high temporal and spatial resolutions are crucial for most hydrological applications one potentially valuable source of rainfall data that has consistent spatial and temporal resolutions are atmospheric reanalysis products however while such data sets can provide a physically consistent representation of rainfall over large spatial and temporal extents they are generally less accurate than observed datasets at daily scales in contrast while the gauge measurements are accurate source of rainfall data sub daily observations are spatially sparse and are of shorter length than daily observations while the temporal resolution of daily observations can be enhanced using temporal disaggregation methods they are often applied stochastically with a focus on capturing the fine scale statistical properties rather than generating a best estimate time series useful for hindcasting purposes the increasing availability of high resolution regional reanalysis products prompts the question whether they can be used to temporally disaggregate daily observations to derive high resolution estimates of sub daily rainfalls suitable for hydrologic applications this study investigates the efficacy of a simple disaggregation approach to temporally disaggregate daily rainfalls to hourly values using a regional reanalysis at moderate spatial resolutions the approach is tested on attributes relevant to a wide range of hydrological applications the selected performance metrics include the distribution and frequency of various sub daily rainfall accumulations statistics characterising the sequencing and central tendency of sub daily rainfalls and the efficacy of areal estimates of sub daily rainfalls for simulating catchment streamflows categorical evaluation shows that the disaggregated rainfalls reduce the frequency of false alarms and improves the probability of detection compared to the use of raw reanalysis estimates however a mixed performance in capturing fine scale statistical characteristics suggests that the disaggregation approach is less robust for applications that rely solely on high resolution rainfall characteristics in hydrological evaluation when compared to estimates based on raw reanalysis or uniformly disaggregated daily observations the disaggregated catchment rainfalls improve the simulation of the magnitude and timing of peak flows and the accuracy of derived flood frequency estimates the proposed disaggregation method is easily applied to any high resolution dataset and has the potential to be used in hydrological applications that rely heavily on sub daily characterisation with a varying performance across the target applications keywords regional reanalysis disaggregation categorical evaluation peak flow statistics hydrological modelling 1 introduction the availability of accurate rainfall information with high spatial and temporal resolution is vital for most hydrological applications such applications commonly include rainfall runoff and flood modelling bennett et al 2016 lobligeois et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 flood forecasting bennett et al 2014 and the estimation of probabilistic rainfalls for engineering design termed design rainfalls maidment 1993 design rainfall estimates for sub daily durations are particularly relevant to the hydrological design of urban infrastructure as flood response times in such catchments range from a few minutes to several hours bezak et al 2018 coombes and roso 2019 madsen et al 2009 while the size of a catchment can have a major influence on the choice of rainfall time step hydrological modelling is best undertaken at sub daily timesteps if sub daily variation in spatial and or temporal structure of rainfall are found to influence the magnitude and timing of runoff brighenti et al 2019 ficchì et al 2016 gabellani et al 2007 kandel et al 2004 paschalis et al 2014 socolofsky et al 2001 it has also been demonstrated that adoption of a sub daily time step in rainfall runoff modelling can improve estimates of quantities over longer e g daily time steps ficchì et al 2016 gauged measurements are the best available estimates of rainfall at point locations but their use in many hydrological applications is limited for example it is difficult to infer spatial variability or areal averages from point observations goodrich et al 1995 even when multiple rain gauges do exist the density and distribution of the network varies markedly with topography and land use salio et al 2015 thiemig et al 2012 and this limits the accuracy and reliability of gauge based areal rainfall estimates for hydrological applications further the majority of gauged observations are available at daily time scales and the proportion of the observed rainfall recorded at sub daily time steps is small by comparison becker et al 2013 lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 for instance in australia there are more than 17 000 daily read gauges though only around 2300 sub daily stations of which 1768 daily and only 101 sub daily stations have records longer than 40 years westra et al 2014 in general gridded rainfall datasets generated by interpolating gauge observations provide areal rainfall estimates which contain some inter grid spatial variability though the accuracy of such gridded estimates is heavily dependent on the density of the gauging network and the interpolation technique used in data sparse regions gridded datasets based on global regional reanalysis and remote sensing have the potential to provide estimates of rainfall in a spatially and temporally consistent manner acharya et al 2019 kirschbaum et al 2017 kucera et al 2013 the availability of spatially and temporally consistent and high resolution rainfall datasets remains a challenge for the australian continent the majority of gauged rainfall observations are at a daily timestep and thus the associated spatially interpolated datasets such as australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 and scientific information for land owners silo jeffrey et al 2001 are also daily the recent development of a regional atmospheric reanalysis bureau of meteorology atmospheric high resolution regional reanalysis for australia barra provides a spatially consistent sub daily precipitation dataset su et al 2019 rainfall observations are not assimilated in barra and thus the associated rainfall estimates are poorer than the observed interpolated dataset at daily scale acharya et al 2019 however the sub daily rainfall fields were evaluated and found to be skilful in representing rainfall occurrence and temporal patterns at point and spatial scales acharya et al 2020 given the paucity of sub daily observations compared to daily it is of particular interest to understand how the available data sets can be used to better represent sub daily rainfall behaviour over spatial scales that are relevant to hydrological modelling the hydrological response of a catchment is strongly influenced by the temporal variability of rainfall bárdossy and pegram 2016 and the biases in the rainfall depths andréassian et al 2001 as the daily rainfall datasets are more widely available and more accurate than sub daily rainfall the disaggregation of daily observations to sub daily rainfall estimates offers a solution to the temporal resolution problem bárdossy and pegram 2016 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 this can be achieved by adopting statistical approaches bárdossy and pegram 2016 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 pui et al 2012 there are variety of disaggregation models based on different theoretical underpinnings sharma and mehrotra 2010 and general reviews procedures relevant to sub daily rainfalls may be found in koutsoyiannis 2003 papalexiou et al 2018 pui et al 2012 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 veneziano et al 2006 in general the disaggregation approaches utilise sub daily rainfall characteristics that are estimated from historical observations to generate sub daily rainfall based on sub daily rainfall statistics relevant disaggregation approaches include multiplicative cascade models lombardo et al 2017 müller and haberlandt 2018 2015 multivariate techniques that preserve the required spatial and temporal dependencies koutsoyiannis 2003 müller and haberlandt 2018 perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 wasko et al 2013 wilks 1998 and simple method of fragments breinl and di baldassarre 2019 pui et al 2012 westra et al 2012 one of the core features of temporal disaggregation approaches is that they may use information from observed rainfall sources to preserve rainfall characteristics at coarser timestep lombardo et al 2012 papalexiou et al 2018 and preserve selected time series characteristics such as autocorrelation koutsoyiannis et al 2003 müller and haberlandt 2015 rainfall asymmetry at higher temporal resolutions müller et al 2017 and rainfall intermittency gires et al 2012 schleiss and smith 2016 while the rainfall time series generated from stochastic disaggregation are useful to drive hydrological models some issues remain for the hydrological modelling applications a majority of the disaggregation approaches are univariate in that they are applied independently to one location at a time this means that spatial consistency between stations is not explicitly considered chen et al 2021 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 papalexiou et al 2018 pui et al 2012 sharma and mehrotra 2010 even though the rainfall at coarser timesteps are spatially coherent this limits the ability of generating spatial rainfall fields that could further be used to drive a spatially distributed hydrological model though a variety of methods are available for explicitly preserving spatial dependencies clark et al 2004 perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 rebora et al 2006 wasko et al 2013 in addition a large number of realisations are generated during the disaggregation process because the rainfall is randomly distributed across finer timesteps only to preserve the overall rainfall statistics müller and haberlandt 2015 while such stochastic approaches are well suited to capturing the distribution or uncertainty of rainfall behaviour at fine spatio temporal scales under varying conditions they are not well suited to the many applications where it is sufficient to derive a single time series that best represent historical conditions for hindcasting purposes the increasing availability of regional reanalysis and satellite rainfall products raises the prospect of using the associated spatio temporal patterns to disaggregate daily observations to sub daily rainfalls in concept the adoption of accurate daily rainfall observations that help preserve the spatio temporal patterns of meso scale rainfalls combined with the use of the reanalysis data will help ensure that the finer scale rainfalls are physically realistic the efficacy of the approach depends heavily on the ability of the selected reanalysis product to accurately represent the spatial and temporal variation in rainfalls at the sub daily scales of interest there have been few attempts to explore the value of using indirect sources of rainfall datasets to improve temporal resolutions of point daily gauge rainfall for flood simulation ryo et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 these studies demonstrated that the resulting disaggregated point rainfalls improved the simulation performance of peak flows despite these few individual cases which proved the value of incorporating sub daily rainfall patterns for disaggregation point rainfalls little has been done on the efficacy of using reanalysis datasets to improve the temporal resolution of observation based datasets particularly for hydrological applications this is particularly an important area to explore because reanalysis datasets are derived using numeric weather prediction nwp models where it may be expected that the derived spatio temporal patterns of rainfall are wholly consistent with the physical equations that govern atmospheric circulation in addition reanalysis products are rapidly improving in terms of their underlying model physics their spatial resolution and in the increasing number and types of observations assimilated and these changes lead to improvements in the representation rainfall fields however there remain significant challenges to assimilating rainfall related observations into nwp models bannister et al 2020 and thus incorporating observations into the reanalysis products at a postprocessing stage provides an alternative means to improving the representation of sub daily rainfalls developing an approach which combines the advantages of accurate daily rainfall observations with temporally finer reanalysis estimates has the potential to provide improved estimates of sub daily rainfalls for use in hydrologic applications this study is motivated by the opportunity to generate sub daily precipitation data that is not subject to the limitations of the available pluviometer network which is biased towards lower elevations and is much more sparsely distributed than daily read gauges here we design a temporal disaggregation approach that uses sub daily patterns derived from reanalysis data to disaggregate daily rainfall totals derived from gauged measurements point and spatially interpolated areal data sets we evaluate the accuracy of this disaggregation procedure across a range of hydrometeorological metrics where our choice of performance measures is predominately influenced by the practical needs of engineering hydrology for direct evaluation of point rainfall we examine one on one evaluation based on categorical metrics general statistical properties and the statistical distribution of rainfall maxima further we indirectly assess the performance of areal rainfall estimates by their ability to simulate overall streamflow reproduce timing and magnitude peak flow events and to derive flood frequency curves finally we present a discussion on the implication of temporal disaggregation on hydrological applications relevant to the users of the reanalysis data 2 study area and data this study is conducted over a set of 27 mesoscale catchments located around eastern queensland australia fig 1 there were a few large events in the region during the study period supporting information s7 which makes them suitable for assessment using flood related metrics the study catchments represent a subset of the australian bureau of meteorology s set of hydrologic reference stations which provide high quality streamflow records with minimal effects of water resource development and land use change turner 2012 the areas of catchments vary from 6 6 km2 to 3876 km2 with a median of 153 1 km2 all catchments are located in the temperate dry winter hot summer zone of the köppen geiger climate classification scheme peel et al 2007 a summary of catchment attributes used in the study is presented in the supplementary material streamflow data from continuous hydrometric stations were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology streamflows at a regular time step of one hour were obtained by linear interpolation from the irregular time series of continuously recorded data sub daily rainfall observations from 33 pluviometers located within or close to the selected catchments were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology for details see supplementary material as the record lengths of pluviometers vary between stations a six year period january 2010 to december 2015 was selected for analysis at gauge locations to maximise the number of stations with concurrent hourly rainfall observations awap is a daily gridded rainfall product with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 approximately 5 km across australia over the period 1900 present jones et al 2009 it is interpolated from the gauged rainfall data using a weighing scheme that incorporates orographic corrections jones et al 2009 this product corresponds areal average rainfall over each grid cell and has been widely used for hydrological studies across australia nathan and mcmahon 2017 gridded estimates of daily potential evapotranspiration pet were obtained from gridded silo product at a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 over australia jeffrey et al 2001 the pet was calculated from the 0 05 climate datasets using the morton s wet environment method morton 1983 hourly rainfall data were obtained from barra r referred to simply as barra as shorthand barra is the only regional reanalysis encompassing the oceania region with high temporal resolution su et al 2019 barra uses the unified model davies et al 2005 as its numerical weather model and a 4d variational data assimilation scheme to assimilate a wide range of surface radiosonde aircraft and satellite observations barra extends spatially over 65 0 to 196 9 east 65 0 to 19 4 north at a spatial resolution of 0 11 approximately 12 km at the equator and with 70 levels up to 80 km into the atmosphere the model parameterisation in barra is largely inherited from the ukmo global atmosphere ga 6 0 configurations as described in walters et al 2017 surface and satellite rainfall observations are not assimilated and the precipitation fields are determined by the physical parameterisation of the model corrected to match the assimilated climatic observations mentioned above in particular the precipitation is estimated by two schemes in the model the grid scale 12 km formation and evolution of precipitation is handled by a microphysics scheme based on wilson and ballard 1999 while the sub grid 12 km is estimated by a mass flux convection scheme based on gregory and rowntree 1990 we use the term rainfall here to approximate precipitation because most of the precipitation in this region is in the form of rainfall we extracted the rainfall time series from the gridded datasets at pluviometer gauge locations and also as time series of area averaged rainfalls over the study catchments hourly rainfall at pluviometer locations were extracted from the nearest barra grid cell for the same six year period as the available concurrent pluviograph observations for catchment average variables we applied area weighted averaging to the variables over the grid cells located within the catchment boundary over the study period of 1990 2017 we extracted catchment average hourly rainfalls from barra daily rainfall from awap and daily pet from silo 3 methodology the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a simple procedure for temporal disaggregation of daily rainfall datasets to hourly using a regional reanalysis product barra the method is evaluated using a range of metrics and example hydrological applications that rely on hourly rainfall data at gauged locations we assess the ability of the disaggregated rainfalls to match the occurrence and frequency of observations and compare various statistics related to sequencing and distribution with observed sub daily rainfall for catchment applications we disaggregate catchment average rainfalls for use as an input to a rainfall runoff model and then evaluate the performance of the simulated streamflow against observed streamflow using continuous error metrics peak event based metrics and flood frequency quantiles 3 1 rainfall disaggregation daily rainfall totals are disaggregated using temporal patterns from barra to obtain hourly rainfall that is we simply re scale the sub daily rainfalls from barra to match the selected daily rainfalls such disaggregation method can be applied to measured rainfall at a point or to an areal estimate derived for a grid or catchment boundary in our study we separately evaluate the temporal disaggregation approach using observed point daily rainfalls and catchment average rainfall from gridded daily awap rainfalls a flowchart showing the input datasets disaggregated rainfall datasets and their evaluations is presented in fig 2 these separate evaluations are undertaken for two reasons first rainfalls recorded at a gauge and those derived for a grid cell area represent inherently different behaviour gauged observations represent rainfall at a point whereas gridded data represent rainfalls that are averaged over the grid cell area 0 11 0 11 in the case of barra and 0 05 0 05 for awap second reference hourly observations are available only at gauged i e point locations while an independent hourly reference set could be derived by spatial interpolation of pluviograph or radar data the quality of the estimates would vary with gauge density topography and the interpolation method used chen et al 2017 gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 louvet et al 2016 accordingly we assessed the utility of the disaggregation approach by comparing the quality of hydrological model simulations that could be achieved using different sets of rainfall inputs an assessment using this indirect approach is directly relevant to hydrological applications 3 2 disaggregation of point rainfall in disaggregating point rainfall we assume that the sub daily temporal pattern of barra rainfall holds true for corresponding gauge location for each day the general equation we use for disaggregation is 1 p h i p daily f i where ph i is the disaggregated rainfall at i th hour of a given day f i is the disaggregation factor for i th hour pdaily is the daily rainfall for the day and i 1 2 24 enumerates the timestep between 9am 10am local time which is the time period convention to record daily gauge reading in australia the daily rainfall used in the disaggregating point rainfall is generated by aggregating the sub daily rainfall allowing for the evaluation of disaggregation approach with accurate sub daily rainfall for evaluation purposes we prepared four rainfall datasets at each gauge location 1 pg the hourly gauge observations which is the reference data for evaluation of temporal disaggregation approach 2 pbn hourly barra rainfall at the nearest grid point to the gauge location 3 pgb daily totals from pdaily is disaggregated using sub daily temporal patterns from the nearest barra grid cell the rainfall at hour i at the nearest barra grid point is represented by p b and the disaggregation function takes the form f i p b i i p b i in the cases of rainy days in which barra does not simulate any rainfall uniform disaggregation is adopted as f i 1 24 the frequency of this fallback function is tracked to ensure that the it does not have the significant impact on the disaggregation approach 4 pbb daily totals from pdaily is disaggregated using sub daily temporal patterns from the best neighbour within the 3 3 grid space centred on the nearest neighbour grid point the best neighbouring grid cell is selected on a day by day basis which results on minimum absolute difference in daily totals across the neighbouring 3 3 grid cells as determined from comparison with daily awap data the rainfall at the best neighbouring grid cell is represented by p bn and the disaggregation function takes the form f i p bn i i p bn i the first two datasets represent the observed hourly rainfall at the gauge and the barra rainfall estimates at corresponding nearest grid cell the third data set uses the nearest neighbouring grid cell for barra sub daily patterns this is a logical option to consider as it represents the grid cell that is closest to the location of the gauge and as such it provides the best representation of the physical characteristics e g elevation and aspect of the gauge location in addition selecting the same grid cell over the entire time series simplifies its practical application however this approach implicitly assumes that there are no spatial displacement errors in the barra simulations of individual storms an assumption which is not consistent with the findings by acharya et al 2020 especially during large rainfall events accordingly the fourth data set tests whether there is value in considering the variable nature of the displacement errors which is accommodated by simply selecting the nearest cell with the most similar daily rainfall total while it is acknowledged that this approach ignores the potential biases inherent in rainfall reanalysis products it has the merit of simplicity and avoids the somewhat challenging task of developing a more sophisticated event dependent approaches over multiple sites it is also worth noting that restricting the search area to a 3 3 grid is consistent with the findings of acharya et al 2020 3 2 1 disaggregation of areal rainfall the inputs required to undertake the selected hydrological modelling are catchment average estimates of hourly rainfall and pet values the average catchment rainfall estimates are calculated by averaging grid cell values that overlie the catchment boundaries where the daily totals are obtained from the grid averaged awap data and the sub daily temporal patterns from the corresponding hourly barra data the general formulation of disaggregation approach for areal rainfall is similar to that used for point rainfalls in equation 1 for evaluation we prepare a set of three catchment average hourly rainfall datasets 1 ab hourly catchment barra rainfalls averaged over each catchment 2 agu daily catchment average rainfalls from awap that are uniformly disaggregated to hourly rainfalls using the simple function f i 1 24 3 a bn this is generated by disaggregating the daily catchment average rainfall from awap pawap using hourly distribution of rainfall from barra p b the disaggregation function for hour i is f i a b i i a b i although the disaggregation approach considered here focuses on the use of the daily gridded awap and sub daily barra rainfall products the other rainfall datasets considered here serve as a reference for comparison the first dataset a b is directly obtained from barra and its use in rainfall runoff modelling serves as a hydrological evaluation of the reanalysis data in its raw form in particular this option is a practical consideration for sparsely gauged or ungauged regions where the areal estimates of observed rainfall are less reliable or not available and reanalysis data represents the only viable alternative similarly the second dataset a gu represents the scenario where rainfall data with high temporal resolution are not available for disaggregation in such case the daily rainfall may be uniformly disaggregated to hourly time series these two options provide useful benchmarks to assess the relative utility of the proposed disaggregation approach where a bn could only be justified if it is found to yield superior outcomes 3 3 rainfall runoff modelling we selected a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model gr4h which is an hourly version of the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 this model is widely used internationally and is known to perform well across australia bennett et al 2016 2014 pagano et al 2010 gr4h consists of a soil moisture accounting storage followed by routing and water exchange functions it has four free parameters to be optimised production storage x1 water exchange coefficient x2 routing storage x3 and the time base of the unit hydrograph x4 other fixed values used in the model are adopted according to mathevet 2005 and perrin et al 2003 the gr4h rainfall runoff model requires hourly forcing of rainfall and pet the disaggregation methods described in section 3 1 are used to generate the different hourly rainfall time series and daily pet obtained from the silo data product is disaggregated to hourly using a fixed diurnal pattern the diurnal pattern follows a sinusoidal curve between sunrise and sunset and assumes that the instantaneous pet is zero during the night and peaks at solar noon liu et al 2005 the variables required to compute the timing and duration of daylight hours are computed for each day using solar calculations from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2020 the resulting instantaneous pet is then integrated to provide hourly values for hydrological evaluation of rainfall datasets the hydrological model could be calibrated either to observed rainfall only or to individual rainfall datasets artan et al 2007 bitew et al 2012 bitew and gebremichael 2011 stisen and sandholt 2010 yilmaz et al 2005 these two approaches serve different purpose in that the former focuses on the impact of differences in rainfall inputs only whereas the latter reveals how the different errors in the candidate rainfall data sets influence both model calibration and subsequent streamflow simulation during validation period bitew and gebremichael 2011 tuning the model to take account of the differences in errors in the four rainfall series provides the most appropriate means of evaluating performance as this most closely resembles how such errors propagate through the modelling chains in practical applications other studies undertaken to evaluate the hydrologic utility of various rainfall products have also undertaken separate model calibrations for each rainfall data set beck et al 2017 behrangi et al 2011 bitew et al 2012 bitew and gebremichael 2011 camici et al 2020 we used the same pet inputs with each of the disaggregated rainfall data sets the benefit of using the same pet series is that it ensures that any differences in performance are attributable solely to the selected rainfall input without the confounding influence of differences in pet input we use the r package airgr coron et al 2019 coron et al 2017 to calibrate and run the gr4h model given the small number of model parameters the steepest descent local search global plus local search procedure is deemed sufficient to optimise the parameters lobligeois et al 2014 an initial parameter set is determined by gross sampling of the parameter space to limit the risk of being trapped in local minima and the final set of optimum parameters is then found by a steepest descent local search this calibration is applied with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of sub daily flow as an objective function we split the available 28 years data 1990 2017 into a spin up period of two years 1990 1991 and two sub periods of 13 years each 1992 2004 2005 2017 to perform two fold cross validation in particular we calibrate the model on one of the sub periods and generate evaluation time series on another sub period and vice versa the evaluation time series for both subperiods are stitched together to obtain the evaluation time series of 26 years 1992 2017 the cross validation approach in this study allows us to independently evaluate the model over the entire time period another advantage of having a longer evaluation time series is that it is useful for analysing characteristics of extremes using derived flood frequency curves 3 4 rainfall evaluation at gauge locations we assess the efficacy of the disaggregated rainfall datasets for representing hourly point rainfalls using three groups of measures that are broadly relevant to many hydrological applications these include the use of categorical evaluation metrics relevant to the general behaviour of rainfall occurrence sequencing and distribution statistics relevant to the parameterisation of stochastic rainfall generators and the assessment of rainfall extremes first we use categorical metrics on the occurrence of rainfall to evaluate its performance although categorical metrics have been used to evaluate rainfall datasets at fine scales bulovic et al 2020 chiaravalloti et al 2018 these metrics are typically based on one on one evaluation and penalises any small errors due to temporal differences as if they were wrong values to take into account any possible temporal displacements that are likely to occur in high resolution datasets we compute the metrics at various temporal accumulations 1 h 3 h and 6 h adopting a threshold of 0 1 mm h we generate a contingency table for dichotomous events rain no rain on observed and disaggregated rainfall we then calculate four categorical metrics relevant to rainfall occurrence probability of detection pod proportion hits in observed events success ratio sr proportion of hits in modelled events which is also complement to 1 of false alarm ratio frequency bias fbias ratio of modelled to observed rainfall occurrence and critical success index csi proportion of correct modelled rainfall occurrence after removing correct non occurrences we use a single diagram referred to as a performance diagram roebber 2009 to summarise all four categorical scores such visualisation displays the value of all four categorical metrics in the one diagram and facilitates comparison of the individual metrics between the different datasets we also explore a selection of precipitation statistics which are relevant to the sequencing and distribution of rainfalls as commonly employed by stochastic weather generators the statistics considered include the mean variance skewness wet frequency and transition probabilities for observed and disaggregated rainfall datasets transition probabilities considered in this study are p00 and p11 which denote the probability of a dry followed by a dry hour or aggregated timestep and a wet followed by a wet hour or aggregated timestep respectively finally we compare quantiles of hourly rainfall magnitudes derived from different rainfall datasets as such information is commonly used in engineering design and associated risk analyses the observed sub daily data was available for only a six year period which is too short to support the estimation of annual exceedance probabilities accordingly we base our evaluation on the analysis of monthly maxima rainfall depth extracted for 1 3 and 6 h accumulations from each of the candidate rainfall series we use l moments hosking and wallis 1997 to fit generalised extreme value gev distribution to the sample of monthly maxima the rainfall depth corresponding to monthly exceedance probabilities meps of 0 1 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 are estimated from the fitted distribution for each of the rainfall datasets the quantiles derived using observed data r mep o are considered as evaluation benchmarks against which the rainfall quantiles derived using barra and disaggregated rainfalls r mep m are compared and reported in terms of relative bias 2 relative b i a s r mep m r mep o r mep o 3 5 hydrological evaluation we use an indirect approach to evaluate the different areal rainfall datasets by comparing the performance of the hydrological simulations over a 26 year period at each of the 27 catchments as explained in section 3 2 the evaluation is performed over the entire validation time series obtained via cross validation we use various approaches and metrics to assess the overall performance of the hydrological simulations including peak flow statistics and derived flood quantiles first we examine the overall model performance using a well established nse in addition we compute linear correlation r variability ratio α σ m σ o and normalised bias β n m o σ o where m and o denote respectively the simulated and observed streamflow series these three metrics are selected because they can be arranged mathematically to compute the nse as nse 2 α r α 2 β n 2 gupta et al 2009 in comparing nse and its components separately we can assess the contribution of each components to the overall nse and compare different aspects of model performance in detail second we explore the performance of the rainfall datasets in their ability to derive flood events in terms of their magnitude timing and volume from the validation time series obtained via hydrological simulation using areal rainfall a partial series comprising the largest 26 flood events an average of one event per year was extracted for each catchment such events are identified from the observed gauged data using a simple peaks over threshold approach whereby a flow threshold is selected to yield as many flow peaks as there are years in the simulation period subject to each event being separated by at least one month to assure independence corresponding to each observed event we search for peak values in the simulated streamflow within the range of 24 h the timing and magnitude of the corresponding peak in the simulated flow series are recorded the total volume of the simulated peak events is relevant to the analysis of streamflow yields and floods and accordingly we also compare maximum flood volumes extracted from a three day window surrounding the peak of each event selected for the catchment sizes considered we expect that a window of three day captures the entire event volume for shorter events and is representative of the majority of the peak volume for longer events the performance of the model is reported in terms of error relative to observed values 3 peak f l o w e r r o r δ q p q p sim q p obs q p obs 100 4

simulated peak streamflow q p obs is observed peak streamflow tp returns the timing of the peak v p 3 d sim is maximum 3 day volume in simulated streamflow and v p 3 d obs is maximum 3 day peak in observed streamflow finally a flood frequency analysis is undertaken using maxima extracted from the observed and simulated streamflows and the results are then compared we extract the annual maxima flow peaks from the observed and simulated flow series and fit a gev distribution using the method of l moments hosking and wallis 1997 to derive a set of flood quantiles corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities aeps of 0 2 0 1 0 04 0 02 i e for average recurrence intervals ranging between 5 and 50 years the flow quantiles derived from the gauged flows q aep o are considered the benchmarks for evaluation the corresponding flood quantiles derived from the simulated flow series q aep m are compared against the benchmark using a relative bias score expressed as 6 relative b i a s q aep m q aep o q aep o 4 results 4 1 point rainfall evaluation at gauge locations 4 1 1 categorical evaluation the binary categorical rain no rain performance of barra and the disaggregated datasets is summarised in a performance diagram for three temporal accumulations fig 3 the diagram displays the four categorical metrics namely probability of detection pod success ratio sr critical success index csi and frequency bias fbias across the ordinate abscissa dashed lines and solid contour lines respectively this format was adopted as it facilitates comparison of the performance of the different rainfall data sets across all selected catchments overall it is found that the performance of the different rainfall data sets based on categorical metrics improves with temporal accumulation from hourly to 6 hourly though the relative differences between the rainfall data sets remains similar fig 3 it can be observed that there are more frequent occurrences of rainfall in hourly barra frequency bias between 1 and 1 5 compared to the other data sets this bias is due to the tendency of nwp models to overestimate rainfall frequency jiang et al 2020 kendon et al 2012 lopez 2007 stephens et al 2010 in addition both the sr and pod are closer or less than 0 5 respectively indicating that the number of rainfall occurrences are missed more than half of the time and falsely predicted to the same degree compared to raw barra daily rainfalls disaggregated using barra yields better sr whereas the pod remains relatively similar for instance at temporal accumulations of 3 h disaggregation increased the median sr from 0 46 to 0 61 whereas pod only increased slightly 0 56 to 0 59 fig 3 b there is some difference in the degree of improvement across hits misses and false alarms this is mostly because the hits and misses are governed by the instances of rain whereas false alarms depend solely on the instances of no rain the use of barra in disaggregation always generates hourly rainfalls when daily rainfalls are non zero though sub daily rainfalls are always zero on days when barra rainfall are non zero but the observed rainfalls are zero in practice there are many instances where rainfall events appear in the barra time series but not in the gauged record which could be due to various reasons such as barra s general tendency to overestimate small rainfalls the presence of timing or spatial displacement errors in the reanalysis or the intrinsic differences in spatial representation between point and areal rainfalls at finer temporal scales any such instances of incorrect zero hourly rainfalls in the barra estimates are corrected by disaggregation whenever the observed daily rainfall total is zero thus improving false alarms in contrast during wet days any discrepancies in patterns of hourly barra rainfalls appear in the disaggregated dataset and this results in a minimal or nil improvement in hits this difference means that compared to the performance of the original hourly barra data pb the disaggregation method is able to reduce the rate of false alarms in the two disaggregated barra time series pbn and pbb but it is not able to improve the rate of detection accordingly sr a function of hits and false alarms is improved whereas pod a function of hits and misses shows no improvement in the case of fbias and csi which are dependent on the three attributes of hits misses and false alarms the improvement across any one of these will improve the overall metrics the improvement in fbias and csi can thus be attributed solely to the reduced number of false alarms fig 3 the disaggregation undertaken using the best gauge in neighbouring 9 grid cells pbb has no significant effect on the overall performance of the resulting dataset this is partly because we are only evaluating in terms of binary rain no rain occurrence whereby any improvement in the magnitude of rainfall is not detected in addition the best grid cell among the neighbouring gird cells is identified on day by day basis to minimise bias at daily scale while this appeared to improve the representation of sub daily rainfall extremes about 4 5 events per year in acharya et al 2020 its influence is not apparent when a longer time series is considered 4 1 2 rainfall statistics a set of statistics relevant to the seasonal sequencing and distribution of 3 hourly rainfalls derived from the different point rainfall data sets is presented in fig 4 similar statistics for 1 and 6 hourly rainfalls are presented in supporting information figures s1 and s2 in general there is a high variability in rainfall statistics across stations which reflects topographical differences in elevation distance from the coast and aspect as shown in the upper three panels of fig 4 all three rainfall data sets reproduce the seasonal variation in central tendency statistics reasonably well when compared to gauged information pg with specific regard to the raw barra rainfalls pb the average rainfall is overestimated in the wet season djf and underestimated in the dry season jja whereas the variability is generally underestimated the data sets derived by disaggregation pbn and pbb greatly improves the rainfall statistics compared to pb the mean rainfall in observed and disaggregated rainfalls are identical as expected because all the disaggregated rainfalls sum to gauge observations at a coarse timestep i e daily while the disaggregated data sets preserve the means exactly they underestimate both the variance and skew despite underestimation the disaggregated rainfall improves skewness while degrading the variance however comparing the two disaggregated rainfall datasets pbn and pbb it is worth noting that there is negligible difference in performance between them that is there is no appreciable improvement arising from using sub daily information from the selected best neighbouring grid across the time periods considered the improvements in the disaggregated data sets over raw barra rainfalls is higher for 6 h accumulations than for 1 h accumulations figures s1 and s2 in supporting information this is not surprising as rainfalls are measured once per day and it would be expected that the accuracy of the representation improves as the accumulations approach 24 h in addition the accuracy of rainfall time series at a finer time steps is more likely to be impacted by potential temporal displacement of the rainfall field and other random errors which are compensated at aggregated timesteps the frequency of wet time periods pwet is higher in the raw barra data fig 4d this is expected due to the tendency of nwp models to overestimate light rainfalls the application of disaggregation improves the representation of wet periods significantly mostly due to the moderating influence of dry and very low rainfall days on the frequently overestimated small rainfalls also discussed in section 4 1 1 with regard to dry dry and wet wet period transition probabilities p00 and p11 it is seen that raw barra estimates pb p underestimates p00 and overestimates p11 this result can also be attributed to the tendency of reanalysis datasets to overestimate light rainfalls as the disaggregation approach reduces false alarms in rainfall occurrence it increases p00 subsequently the occurrence of light drizzle periods for days with observed rainfall are retained in the disaggregated product resulting in a higher wet wet transition probabilities p11 a reduced number of overestimated drizzles results in a higher p00 for pbn than for pbb whereas the lack of dry timesteps and persistence in nwp models results in a higher pbn than for pg on the other hand the wet wet transition probability p11 is influenced by the adopted fallback function in the disaggregated product the fallback function uniformly disaggregates the non zero daily rainfalls when barra does not simulate any rainfall this fallback function was found to occur 4 95 of the time on average 18 days in a year although the average depth for those conditions is 0 91 mm it inflates the wet wet transition probabilities by assigning rainfall to a continuous period of 24 h overall the difference in improvement between metrics based on the distribution of rainfall magnitudes i e fig 4a c and those based on occurrence frequencies and probabilities i e fig 4d f reflects the disaggregation approach adopted in this study 4 1 3 rainfall frequency analysis the results of the rainfall frequency analysis are reported as deviations from the quantiles derived for observed data figures 5 s3 and s4 where in all cases the results were obtained by fitting a gev distribution to the monthly point rainfall maxima extracted from six years of concurrent record it is seen that raw barra pb significantly overestimates the rainfall quantiles for all monthly exceedance probabilities considered and the degree of over estimation increases with event severity this overestimation is consistent with the statistics presented in section 4 1 2 which shows an overestimation in mean rainfall from barra in contrast the two disaggregated rainfall series based on barra patterns pbn and pbb consistently underestimate the rainfall depths by around 15 across all exceedance probabilities this underestimation could be attributed to mismatch in the areal extent of rainfall arising due to application of grid cell average temporal patterns to point rainfall depths while the biases have different direction for the raw barra and the disaggregated datasets it is clear that the magnitude of bias is smaller for estimates of rainfall frequencies obtained by disaggregating point observations using the reanalysis barra rainfall than raw barra 4 2 hydrological evaluation at 27 selected catchments 4 2 1 streamflow simulation a summary of gr4h model performance metrics based on nse correlation r variability ratio α and normalised bias results βn for all 27 study catchments is presented in fig 6 overall the performance of different disaggregation procedures can be ranked in order of decreasing performance as follows awap disaggregated using barra abn awap disaggregated uniformly agu and raw barra ab based on the three metrics r α βn the increases in nse can be attributed to improvements in correlation and variability conversely normalised bias is close to zero and has the least influence on overall nse compared to using raw barra as an input there is a clear improvement in model performance when using disaggregated awap even though the approach is based on simple uniform disaggregation this can be attributed to a lower accuracy of barra compared to awap in estimating daily rainfall acharya et al 2019 and the influence of model storage on accommodating errors in sub daily patterns of rainfall focusing on the individual components the normalised bias component β in all three rainfall inputs are small indicating that the model parameters are adjusted during calibration to take account of the overall systematic bias the correlation r however is lower for barra which could be linked to a lower correlation of daily rainfall from raw barra with awap rainfall acharya et al 2019 for the rainfalls disaggregated using barra the awap inputs preserve the accuracy of rainfalls at the daily scale and the rainfall patterns adopted from barra provide an improved representation of sub daily rainfall variability the value of accommodating a more realistic representation of sub daily variability compared to simple uniform disaggregation is evident in fig 6 where it is seen that results for qbn are generally better than those obtained for qgu although the additional information in the form of sub daily variability improves the overall hydrological simulation the degree of improvement is small due to the fact that both the disaggregated datasets share the same daily inputs rainfalls this improvement in performance is small yet it is statistically significant t 27 2 67 p 0 037 4 2 2 timing and magnitude of flood peaks the foregoing analysis reports on the ability of the different disaggregation schemes to reproduce the full streamflow timeseries but it is also commonly of interest to focus on the analysis of high flow events accordingly a summary of the relative errors in peak flow and timing for events equal to or rarer than the annual maximum across all 27 study catchments are presented in fig 7 a overall the magnitude of the simulated peak flows is underestimated by all derived rainfall inputs compared to observed streamflow such underestimation is most likely due to the scheme used to calibrate the gr4h model where the focus was on reproducing the whole streamflow regime and not the 0 3 of days relevant to the flood maxima considered here the relative errors in simulating these flood events are the highest for simulations undertaken with raw barra ab followed by simulations undertaken using awap disaggregated uniformly agu and the best results were achieved when using awap rainfalls disaggregated using barra abn while the errors in magnitude of the flood peaks derived using ab are higher than those derived using agu it is still interesting to observe that the timing of the peaks are better characterised by ab than agu 7a this difference is most likely due to the influence of variability in the sub daily spatio temporal patterns of ab in contrast the absence of sub daily variability in the agu rainfalls result in large positive timing errors indicating a delayed peak timing error for most events the best representation of peak flow timing is achieved when abn is used where more than 50 of events have timing error of less than 5 hours this result supports the potential utility of sub daily variability in barra rainfall for hydrological simulation if the bias is treated appropriately fig 7b summarises the relative errors in simulating three day flow volumes for selected events across the 27 study catchments it is seen that simulations undertaken using raw barra rainfalls greatly underestimate flood volumes whereas the two disaggregated rainfall datasets result in less biased estimates it is also observed that the flow volumes derived using the two disaggregated rainfall datasets are similar these results indicate that the multi day flow volume is more dependent on the accuracy of multi day rainfall depth than on its sub daily variability this is expected as losses due to infiltration and other processes generally represent a smaller proportion of the input rainfall as the severity of the event increases and any effects of sub daily variability are diminished when aggregated over multiple days 4 2 3 flood frequency analysis the ability of the disaggregated rainfalls to derive flood frequency curves is assessed by fitting a gev distribution to annual maxima extracted from the different streamflow series individual analysis in supporting information s10 the results of this assessment are shown in fig 8 in terms of the relative bias in derived flood quantiles obtained using the different rainfall inputs it is found that all rainfall inputs yield flood quantiles that are lower than those obtained from observed streamflow which is consistent with the results presented in the previous section the degree of underestimation is similar across the range of exceedance probabilities considered which indicates that the approaches are better able to simulate the variability of flood maxima than their associated means i e the scale parameters of fitted distributions are better represented than the location parameters see supporting information s9 obviously the degree of underestimation is heavily dependent on the structure and parameterisation of the gr4h model but the differences in the results provide a useful indication of the efficacy of the different input rainfall series it is seen from fig 8 that while the performance ranking of the different rainfall products is the same as discussed in the previous section it is interesting to observe that the relative advantage of disaggregating awap by barra i e abn rather than by simple uniform disaggregation agu is greater when evaluating the frequency of floods rather than when evaluating their magnitude the ability to derive better flood quantiles using abn than agu can be attributed to the value of representing sub daily variability in rainfall inputs which has an important influence on the generation of large floods 5 discussion we discuss below the value of combining reanalysis and observation based rainfalls compared to their individual use for representing rainfalls and for hydrological modelling we also discuss the practical applications of this approach and its implications for hydrological modelling previous evaluation of the magnitude and frequency of rainfall estimates obtained from barra and other data sources showed that some biases exist in the raw barra rainfalls acharya et al 2020 2019 such biases persists over daily and sub daily scales and are dependent on the location and spatial scale of interest acharya et al 2020 2019 su et al 2020 while these previous studies assessed the more general ability of barra to represent rainfall distributions across the whole of australia it is perhaps not surprising that similar biases were found using metrics considered here at 33 pluviometer gauges location figs 3 and 4 in addition the tendency of raw barra estimates to overestimate rainfall persistence and frequency figs 4 and 5 is consistent with the performance of other numerical weather prediction reported in other studies jiang et al 2020 kendon et al 2012 lopez 2007 stephens et al 2010 the use of barra to disaggregate daily gauged data resulted in a mixed performance across the metrics considered in general the sub daily time series of point rainfalls obtained via disaggregating daily rainfall are more accurate than raw barra estimates with respect to rainfall occurrence fig 3 and frequency fig 5 basing the disaggregation on the nearest neighbour pbn the best neighbour pbb yielded minimal improvements in performance this seems to be in contrast to acharya et al 2020 which demonstrated that adopting rainfall information from neighbouring grid cells enhances the rainfall temporal patterns within the day for large rainfall events however such events constitute only about 10 15 days in a year and this have minimal impact on rainfall improvement when evaluated over the entire time series it is also of note that as the model in barra is unable to explicitly model the subgrid processes governing small scale convective cloud and precipitation the simulated precipitation can lack storm cell organisation be too spatially diffused and show timing bias in convection initiation su et al 2020 and references therein although the disaggregation is able to reproduce some of the rainfall characteristics e g wet day frequency it overestimates transition probabilities p00 and p11 and underestimates variance and skewness fig 4 such limitations could be attributed to the adopted fallback function for resolving zero barra rainfalls and the parsimony of the disaggregation approach compared to complex rainfall characteristics considering that there are advanced stochastic disaggregation approaches which preserve such characteristics e g breinl and di baldassarre 2019 lombardo et al 2017 ma et al 2020 müller and haberlandt 2018 2015 seyyedi et al 2014 if the resulting applications are sensitive to fine scale rainfall characteristics then it may not be appropriate to adopt the simple deterministic disaggregation approach presented in this study while the evaluation of central tendency and categorical statistics are of interest assessment of rainfall datasets it is difficult to infer how rainfall behaviour at point locations or across large regions impact on hydrological performance camici et al 2020 dembélé et al 2020 and this provides the motivation for indirectly assessing performance through hydrological simulation it is worth acknowledging that hydrological evaluation of the rainfall data sets lumps together uncertainties from both the rainfall models and the rainfall runoff model while the structure of the rainfall runoff model is fixed the model parameters are tuned to accommodate the different nature of errors in the four rainfall data sets as such the evaluation sheds light on the hydrological efficacy of the candidate rainfalls in a manner that is consistent with how such modelling is undertaken in practice the biases and errors in the raw hourly barra rainfalls propagate through the gr4h model which resulted in much poorer hydrological simulations in terms of nse and peak flow bias compared to disaggregated daily observations figs 6 and 7 despite the ability of rainfall runoff models to cope with imperfect rainfall inputs andréassian et al 2001 the observed biases in raw barra rainfalls are large enough to impact adversely on the resulting simulations the use of sub daily patterns from barra to derive disaggregated daily inputs to the gr4h model greatly improved model performance however the degree of improvement compared to the results obtained using raw barra rainfalls or uniformly disaggregated daily rainfalls varied with the metrics considered for example the use of rainfalls disaggregated using barra provide modest improvements to the overall simulation of the hourly flow regime fig 6 whereas the simulation of high flow events fig 7 and flood quantiles fig 8 demonstrate significant improvement the continuous evaluation metrics such as nse are highly influenced by timing errors which may result from the different disaggregation approaches however such small timing errors have minimal influence on the magnitude of peak flows events or the annual maxima such behaviour is consistent with the previous studies that utilised similar disaggregation approaches and evaluation metrics ryo et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 in shrestha et al 2018 the hydrological performance associated with a disaggregated rainfall dataset in terms of nse was significantly lower than that obtained using observed dataset while the magnitude of peak for those events were in agreement it is also worth noting that some degree of hydrological performance could be influenced due to the catchment size e g zhu et al 2018 while the small number of catchments considered precludes drawing firm conclusions about the influence of catchment size on the results it is worth noting that the general pattern of the results shown in fig 5 holds for all ranges of catchment size figure s6 the raw barra data includes some significant rainfall events that are higher than the corresponding estimates in the awap data set and these led to higher estimates of the storage parameter in the gr4h model supporting information figure s6 the higher storage parameter obtained from the raw barra data set resulted in a general underestimation of smaller streamflow peaks and this is evident in results shown in figs 4 5 7 8 another interesting observation is that the degree of improvement in the characterisation of rainfalls achieved by disaggregation is somewhat different to its corresponding hydrological simulation the improvement in rainfall as observed in fig 3 and fig 4 translates to a higher improvement in hydrological simulation fig 6 this effect is in part due to the nature of the evaluation metrics used the rainfall metrics based on one on one evaluations penalises small differences in sub daily temporal patterns equally as incorrect rainfall depths occurrence and this results in poorer evaluation metrics also the metrics based on dichotomous events categorical metrics wet frequency transition probabilities focus mainly on rainfall occurrence and are insensitive to improvements rainfall magnitude however disaggregation corrects systematic biases in the magnitude of rainfall inputs by adopting daily totals from observed datasets and this coupled with the ability of hydrological models to cope with imperfect rainfall inputs greatly improves model performance the gr4h modelling shows the value of disaggregation for simulating streamflow and flood events and for deriving design floods fig 8 in particular the magnitude and timing of flow peaks are better simulated using rainfall inputs that are disaggregated using barra fig 7 the results highlight the value of combining accurate daily rainfalls with some form of sub daily variability when simulating the peak flows that is although the disaggregated rainfalls shared the same daily totals uniform disaggregation of the awap rainfalls resulted in the less accurate representation of peak flow timing previous research have shown that the calibration of models with sub daily time steps can significantly improve model calibration and simulation performance booij 2002 huang et al 2019 kobold and brilly 2006 while this study and previous research acharya 2020 have revealed shortcomings in representation of sub daily spatio temporal characteristics in raw barra rainfall figs 7 and 8 show that introducing sub daily variability even if it may not be perfect improves the ability of the model to simulate floods further for hydrologic simulation at coarse time steps aggregating output from sub daily simulation to daily is better than running model directly at daily time step ficchì et al 2016 therefore it is natural to opt for hydrological modelling at finer timestep using the disaggregated rainfall inputs conditioned upon available computational resources while the method adopted in this study is purely a temporal disaggregation spatial dependencies are preserved through the gridded rainfalls products ie the physical basis of the barra reanalysis and the thin plate splines used in the awap data this results in a realistic rainfall field that is constrained by the available daily observations this is also one of the strengths of the proposed disaggregation approach as it does not rely on additional parametric characterisation of spatial characteristics for instilling spatial consistency e g breinl and di baldassarre 2019 clark et al 2004 müller and haberlandt 2018 2015 wasko et al 2013 however the accuracy of the sub daily characteristics is dependent on the quality of the reanalysis and the nature of these associated uncertainties are described by acharya et al 2020 an important implication of this analysis is that the disaggregation method can be seen as an alternative post processing application of reanalysis products particularly those like barra that are derived without assimilating rainfall observations it also offers a step forward towards improving the utility of existing daily rainfall products which represent the most widely available set of rainfall observations one strength of this approach is that it is not limited to a particular set of inputs meaning that it can be easily applied to any high quality dataset that may have been derived at coarser temporal or spatial scales for example high quality gauge or interpolated dataset such as awap can be disaggregated using any of the available reanalysis or satellite datasets such as era5 hersbach et al 2020 trmm huffman et al 2007 or imerg huffman et al 2018 the approach also facilitates the assessment of epistemic uncertainty in estimates of sub daily areal rainfalls as different re analysis data sets can be used to disaggregate a single set of daily observations the use of global reanalysis could be used for studies that encompasses large regions that are beyond the extent of regional reanalysis datasets or for studies that benefit from a consistent set of rainfall inputs such as large sample hydrology addor et al 2020 in recent years global reanalyses are evolving for example era40 125 km uppala et al 2005 has evolved to era interim 80 km dee et al 2011 and subsequently era5 30 km hersbach et al 2020 and they are improving in terms of their resolution and accuracy dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 nogueira 2020 tarek et al 2020 the biases in raw barra rainfall totals as evaluated at daily scale makes it less attractive for direct application in rainfall runoff modelling however the reanalysis data can be used as an alternative to rainfall observations for hydrological modelling in the regions where gauge measurements are sparse or not existent essou et al 2016 tarek et al 2020 although evaluations presented here demonstrate the potential value of the disaggregation approach any assessment relies upon the accuracy of the adopted benchmark this is particularly difficult in the case of sub daily areal rainfalls as all methods of estimation involve uncertainties it is difficult to find catchments with high densities of pluviometer gauges and considerable effort and uncertainty is involved in deriving and compiling sub daily rainfall information over large areas and or time periods boushaki et al 2009 dunn et al 2016 lewis et al 2019 ma et al 2020 similar difficulties arise when representing sub daily variability in space and time using radar gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 hasan et al 2016 panziera et al 2018 sinclair and pegram 2005 remote sensing bulovic et al 2020 freitas et al 2020 o and kirstetter 2018 zeweldi and gebremichael 2009 and other data merging approaches e g nerini et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 sinclair and pegram 2005 these issues also have some bearing on representing the spatial variability of daily rainfalls over catchments although the areal and temporal averaging involved is more easily accommodated particularly as the gauging network of sub daily observations is much less dense than daily becker et al 2013 lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 the adoption of a lumped model gr4h obviates the need to represent spatial variation in rainfalls across the catchment and this greatly simplifies the manner in which differences in the resolution of the datasets are accommodated while the temporal resolution of rainfall is generally deemed to have more influence on catchment response than its spatial distribution the influence of the latter is more pronounced in the large catchments with strong spatial variability of rainfall bárdossy and pegram 2016 emmanuel et al 2017 huang et al 2019 lobligeois et al 2014 a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of differing spatial resolutions of the datasets could be undertaken by preserving the spatial temporal dependencies in the disaggregation method e g breinl and di baldassarre 2019 koutsoyiannis 2003 müller and haberlandt 2018 seyyedi et al 2014 though this would need to explicitly consider the potential for spatial displacement errors during large events acharya et al 2020 a semi distributed model would need to be adopted to take advantage of the additional information on spatial variability provided by such disaggregation approach while this study was focused on the temporal resolution aspect of rainfall datasets the spatial aspect of rainfall could be considered in the further studies 6 conclusions the method proposed here to disaggregate daily rainfalls based on observed data to sub daily data using reanalysis data is simple and its efficacy is evaluated separately for its ability to improve the representation of sub daily rainfall and its value in hydrological modelling the results from this study support the idea of improving temporal resolution of coarse high quality rainfall datasets by using temporally finer datasets as a disaggregation function the results suggest that disaggregation procedures based on globally regionally available reanalysis precipitation datasets have the potential to enhance temporal resolutions of ground observations and improve the spatio temporal representation of rainfalls over large areal extents while such sub daily rainfall datasets are shown to improve upon raw reanalysis datasets by reducing false alarms and correcting mean they are unable to reproduce fine scale rainfall characteristics however the use of reanalysis data to disaggregate daily rainfalls was found to materially improve the ability of a rainfall runoff model to simulate the timing and peaks of flood events and derived flood frequency estimates compared to raw reanalysis datasets the generation of sub daily rainfall by disaggregation provides the opportunity to address the limited availability of sub daily datasets and their paucity relative to daily measurements such spatially and temporally fine rainfall datasets are valuable in hydrology especially when we are dealing with extremes the value of the proposed approach to a particular application can be tested using available daily observations point or areal and reanalysis datasets if suitable sub daily rainfall data sets are not available for comparison the approach can be indirectly evaluated by comparing the performance of a selected hydrological model run with alternative sets of inputs

3325,accurate rainfall datasets with high temporal and spatial resolutions are crucial for most hydrological applications one potentially valuable source of rainfall data that has consistent spatial and temporal resolutions are atmospheric reanalysis products however while such data sets can provide a physically consistent representation of rainfall over large spatial and temporal extents they are generally less accurate than observed datasets at daily scales in contrast while the gauge measurements are accurate source of rainfall data sub daily observations are spatially sparse and are of shorter length than daily observations while the temporal resolution of daily observations can be enhanced using temporal disaggregation methods they are often applied stochastically with a focus on capturing the fine scale statistical properties rather than generating a best estimate time series useful for hindcasting purposes the increasing availability of high resolution regional reanalysis products prompts the question whether they can be used to temporally disaggregate daily observations to derive high resolution estimates of sub daily rainfalls suitable for hydrologic applications this study investigates the efficacy of a simple disaggregation approach to temporally disaggregate daily rainfalls to hourly values using a regional reanalysis at moderate spatial resolutions the approach is tested on attributes relevant to a wide range of hydrological applications the selected performance metrics include the distribution and frequency of various sub daily rainfall accumulations statistics characterising the sequencing and central tendency of sub daily rainfalls and the efficacy of areal estimates of sub daily rainfalls for simulating catchment streamflows categorical evaluation shows that the disaggregated rainfalls reduce the frequency of false alarms and improves the probability of detection compared to the use of raw reanalysis estimates however a mixed performance in capturing fine scale statistical characteristics suggests that the disaggregation approach is less robust for applications that rely solely on high resolution rainfall characteristics in hydrological evaluation when compared to estimates based on raw reanalysis or uniformly disaggregated daily observations the disaggregated catchment rainfalls improve the simulation of the magnitude and timing of peak flows and the accuracy of derived flood frequency estimates the proposed disaggregation method is easily applied to any high resolution dataset and has the potential to be used in hydrological applications that rely heavily on sub daily characterisation with a varying performance across the target applications keywords regional reanalysis disaggregation categorical evaluation peak flow statistics hydrological modelling 1 introduction the availability of accurate rainfall information with high spatial and temporal resolution is vital for most hydrological applications such applications commonly include rainfall runoff and flood modelling bennett et al 2016 lobligeois et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 flood forecasting bennett et al 2014 and the estimation of probabilistic rainfalls for engineering design termed design rainfalls maidment 1993 design rainfall estimates for sub daily durations are particularly relevant to the hydrological design of urban infrastructure as flood response times in such catchments range from a few minutes to several hours bezak et al 2018 coombes and roso 2019 madsen et al 2009 while the size of a catchment can have a major influence on the choice of rainfall time step hydrological modelling is best undertaken at sub daily timesteps if sub daily variation in spatial and or temporal structure of rainfall are found to influence the magnitude and timing of runoff brighenti et al 2019 ficchì et al 2016 gabellani et al 2007 kandel et al 2004 paschalis et al 2014 socolofsky et al 2001 it has also been demonstrated that adoption of a sub daily time step in rainfall runoff modelling can improve estimates of quantities over longer e g daily time steps ficchì et al 2016 gauged measurements are the best available estimates of rainfall at point locations but their use in many hydrological applications is limited for example it is difficult to infer spatial variability or areal averages from point observations goodrich et al 1995 even when multiple rain gauges do exist the density and distribution of the network varies markedly with topography and land use salio et al 2015 thiemig et al 2012 and this limits the accuracy and reliability of gauge based areal rainfall estimates for hydrological applications further the majority of gauged observations are available at daily time scales and the proportion of the observed rainfall recorded at sub daily time steps is small by comparison becker et al 2013 lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 for instance in australia there are more than 17 000 daily read gauges though only around 2300 sub daily stations of which 1768 daily and only 101 sub daily stations have records longer than 40 years westra et al 2014 in general gridded rainfall datasets generated by interpolating gauge observations provide areal rainfall estimates which contain some inter grid spatial variability though the accuracy of such gridded estimates is heavily dependent on the density of the gauging network and the interpolation technique used in data sparse regions gridded datasets based on global regional reanalysis and remote sensing have the potential to provide estimates of rainfall in a spatially and temporally consistent manner acharya et al 2019 kirschbaum et al 2017 kucera et al 2013 the availability of spatially and temporally consistent and high resolution rainfall datasets remains a challenge for the australian continent the majority of gauged rainfall observations are at a daily timestep and thus the associated spatially interpolated datasets such as australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 and scientific information for land owners silo jeffrey et al 2001 are also daily the recent development of a regional atmospheric reanalysis bureau of meteorology atmospheric high resolution regional reanalysis for australia barra provides a spatially consistent sub daily precipitation dataset su et al 2019 rainfall observations are not assimilated in barra and thus the associated rainfall estimates are poorer than the observed interpolated dataset at daily scale acharya et al 2019 however the sub daily rainfall fields were evaluated and found to be skilful in representing rainfall occurrence and temporal patterns at point and spatial scales acharya et al 2020 given the paucity of sub daily observations compared to daily it is of particular interest to understand how the available data sets can be used to better represent sub daily rainfall behaviour over spatial scales that are relevant to hydrological modelling the hydrological response of a catchment is strongly influenced by the temporal variability of rainfall bárdossy and pegram 2016 and the biases in the rainfall depths andréassian et al 2001 as the daily rainfall datasets are more widely available and more accurate than sub daily rainfall the disaggregation of daily observations to sub daily rainfall estimates offers a solution to the temporal resolution problem bárdossy and pegram 2016 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 this can be achieved by adopting statistical approaches bárdossy and pegram 2016 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 pui et al 2012 there are variety of disaggregation models based on different theoretical underpinnings sharma and mehrotra 2010 and general reviews procedures relevant to sub daily rainfalls may be found in koutsoyiannis 2003 papalexiou et al 2018 pui et al 2012 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 veneziano et al 2006 in general the disaggregation approaches utilise sub daily rainfall characteristics that are estimated from historical observations to generate sub daily rainfall based on sub daily rainfall statistics relevant disaggregation approaches include multiplicative cascade models lombardo et al 2017 müller and haberlandt 2018 2015 multivariate techniques that preserve the required spatial and temporal dependencies koutsoyiannis 2003 müller and haberlandt 2018 perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 wasko et al 2013 wilks 1998 and simple method of fragments breinl and di baldassarre 2019 pui et al 2012 westra et al 2012 one of the core features of temporal disaggregation approaches is that they may use information from observed rainfall sources to preserve rainfall characteristics at coarser timestep lombardo et al 2012 papalexiou et al 2018 and preserve selected time series characteristics such as autocorrelation koutsoyiannis et al 2003 müller and haberlandt 2015 rainfall asymmetry at higher temporal resolutions müller et al 2017 and rainfall intermittency gires et al 2012 schleiss and smith 2016 while the rainfall time series generated from stochastic disaggregation are useful to drive hydrological models some issues remain for the hydrological modelling applications a majority of the disaggregation approaches are univariate in that they are applied independently to one location at a time this means that spatial consistency between stations is not explicitly considered chen et al 2021 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 papalexiou et al 2018 pui et al 2012 sharma and mehrotra 2010 even though the rainfall at coarser timesteps are spatially coherent this limits the ability of generating spatial rainfall fields that could further be used to drive a spatially distributed hydrological model though a variety of methods are available for explicitly preserving spatial dependencies clark et al 2004 perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 rebora et al 2006 wasko et al 2013 in addition a large number of realisations are generated during the disaggregation process because the rainfall is randomly distributed across finer timesteps only to preserve the overall rainfall statistics müller and haberlandt 2015 while such stochastic approaches are well suited to capturing the distribution or uncertainty of rainfall behaviour at fine spatio temporal scales under varying conditions they are not well suited to the many applications where it is sufficient to derive a single time series that best represent historical conditions for hindcasting purposes the increasing availability of regional reanalysis and satellite rainfall products raises the prospect of using the associated spatio temporal patterns to disaggregate daily observations to sub daily rainfalls in concept the adoption of accurate daily rainfall observations that help preserve the spatio temporal patterns of meso scale rainfalls combined with the use of the reanalysis data will help ensure that the finer scale rainfalls are physically realistic the efficacy of the approach depends heavily on the ability of the selected reanalysis product to accurately represent the spatial and temporal variation in rainfalls at the sub daily scales of interest there have been few attempts to explore the value of using indirect sources of rainfall datasets to improve temporal resolutions of point daily gauge rainfall for flood simulation ryo et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 these studies demonstrated that the resulting disaggregated point rainfalls improved the simulation performance of peak flows despite these few individual cases which proved the value of incorporating sub daily rainfall patterns for disaggregation point rainfalls little has been done on the efficacy of using reanalysis datasets to improve the temporal resolution of observation based datasets particularly for hydrological applications this is particularly an important area to explore because reanalysis datasets are derived using numeric weather prediction nwp models where it may be expected that the derived spatio temporal patterns of rainfall are wholly consistent with the physical equations that govern atmospheric circulation in addition reanalysis products are rapidly improving in terms of their underlying model physics their spatial resolution and in the increasing number and types of observations assimilated and these changes lead to improvements in the representation rainfall fields however there remain significant challenges to assimilating rainfall related observations into nwp models bannister et al 2020 and thus incorporating observations into the reanalysis products at a postprocessing stage provides an alternative means to improving the representation of sub daily rainfalls developing an approach which combines the advantages of accurate daily rainfall observations with temporally finer reanalysis estimates has the potential to provide improved estimates of sub daily rainfalls for use in hydrologic applications this study is motivated by the opportunity to generate sub daily precipitation data that is not subject to the limitations of the available pluviometer network which is biased towards lower elevations and is much more sparsely distributed than daily read gauges here we design a temporal disaggregation approach that uses sub daily patterns derived from reanalysis data to disaggregate daily rainfall totals derived from gauged measurements point and spatially interpolated areal data sets we evaluate the accuracy of this disaggregation procedure across a range of hydrometeorological metrics where our choice of performance measures is predominately influenced by the practical needs of engineering hydrology for direct evaluation of point rainfall we examine one on one evaluation based on categorical metrics general statistical properties and the statistical distribution of rainfall maxima further we indirectly assess the performance of areal rainfall estimates by their ability to simulate overall streamflow reproduce timing and magnitude peak flow events and to derive flood frequency curves finally we present a discussion on the implication of temporal disaggregation on hydrological applications relevant to the users of the reanalysis data 2 study area and data this study is conducted over a set of 27 mesoscale catchments located around eastern queensland australia fig 1 there were a few large events in the region during the study period supporting information s7 which makes them suitable for assessment using flood related metrics the study catchments represent a subset of the australian bureau of meteorology s set of hydrologic reference stations which provide high quality streamflow records with minimal effects of water resource development and land use change turner 2012 the areas of catchments vary from 6 6 km2 to 3876 km2 with a median of 153 1 km2 all catchments are located in the temperate dry winter hot summer zone of the köppen geiger climate classification scheme peel et al 2007 a summary of catchment attributes used in the study is presented in the supplementary material streamflow data from continuous hydrometric stations were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology streamflows at a regular time step of one hour were obtained by linear interpolation from the irregular time series of continuously recorded data sub daily rainfall observations from 33 pluviometers located within or close to the selected catchments were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology for details see supplementary material as the record lengths of pluviometers vary between stations a six year period january 2010 to december 2015 was selected for analysis at gauge locations to maximise the number of stations with concurrent hourly rainfall observations awap is a daily gridded rainfall product with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 approximately 5 km across australia over the period 1900 present jones et al 2009 it is interpolated from the gauged rainfall data using a weighing scheme that incorporates orographic corrections jones et al 2009 this product corresponds areal average rainfall over each grid cell and has been widely used for hydrological studies across australia nathan and mcmahon 2017 gridded estimates of daily potential evapotranspiration pet were obtained from gridded silo product at a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 over australia jeffrey et al 2001 the pet was calculated from the 0 05 climate datasets using the morton s wet environment method morton 1983 hourly rainfall data were obtained from barra r referred to simply as barra as shorthand barra is the only regional reanalysis encompassing the oceania region with high temporal resolution su et al 2019 barra uses the unified model davies et al 2005 as its numerical weather model and a 4d variational data assimilation scheme to assimilate a wide range of surface radiosonde aircraft and satellite observations barra extends spatially over 65 0 to 196 9 east 65 0 to 19 4 north at a spatial resolution of 0 11 approximately 12 km at the equator and with 70 levels up to 80 km into the atmosphere the model parameterisation in barra is largely inherited from the ukmo global atmosphere ga 6 0 configurations as described in walters et al 2017 surface and satellite rainfall observations are not assimilated and the precipitation fields are determined by the physical parameterisation of the model corrected to match the assimilated climatic observations mentioned above in particular the precipitation is estimated by two schemes in the model the grid scale 12 km formation and evolution of precipitation is handled by a microphysics scheme based on wilson and ballard 1999 while the sub grid 12 km is estimated by a mass flux convection scheme based on gregory and rowntree 1990 we use the term rainfall here to approximate precipitation because most of the precipitation in this region is in the form of rainfall we extracted the rainfall time series from the gridded datasets at pluviometer gauge locations and also as time series of area averaged rainfalls over the study catchments hourly rainfall at pluviometer locations were extracted from the nearest barra grid cell for the same six year period as the available concurrent pluviograph observations for catchment average variables we applied area weighted averaging to the variables over the grid cells located within the catchment boundary over the study period of 1990 2017 we extracted catchment average hourly rainfalls from barra daily rainfall from awap and daily pet from silo 3 methodology the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a simple procedure for temporal disaggregation of daily rainfall datasets to hourly using a regional reanalysis product barra the method is evaluated using a range of metrics and example hydrological applications that rely on hourly rainfall data at gauged locations we assess the ability of the disaggregated rainfalls to match the occurrence and frequency of observations and compare various statistics related to sequencing and distribution with observed sub daily rainfall for catchment applications we disaggregate catchment average rainfalls for use as an input to a rainfall runoff model and then evaluate the performance of the simulated streamflow against observed streamflow using continuous error metrics peak event based metrics and flood frequency quantiles 3 1 rainfall disaggregation daily rainfall totals are disaggregated using temporal patterns from barra to obtain hourly rainfall that is we simply re scale the sub daily rainfalls from barra to match the selected daily rainfalls such disaggregation method can be applied to measured rainfall at a point or to an areal estimate derived for a grid or catchment boundary in our study we separately evaluate the temporal disaggregation approach using observed point daily rainfalls and catchment average rainfall from gridded daily awap rainfalls a flowchart showing the input datasets disaggregated rainfall datasets and their evaluations is presented in fig 2 these separate evaluations are undertaken for two reasons first rainfalls recorded at a gauge and those derived for a grid cell area represent inherently different behaviour gauged observations represent rainfall at a point whereas gridded data represent rainfalls that are averaged over the grid cell area 0 11 0 11 in the case of barra and 0 05 0 05 for awap second reference hourly observations are available only at gauged i e point locations while an independent hourly reference set could be derived by spatial interpolation of pluviograph or radar data the quality of the estimates would vary with gauge density topography and the interpolation method used chen et al 2017 gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 louvet et al 2016 accordingly we assessed the utility of the disaggregation approach by comparing the quality of hydrological model simulations that could be achieved using different sets of rainfall inputs an assessment using this indirect approach is directly relevant to hydrological applications 3 2 disaggregation of point rainfall in disaggregating point rainfall we assume that the sub daily temporal pattern of barra rainfall holds true for corresponding gauge location for each day the general equation we use for disaggregation is 1 p h i p daily f i where ph i is the disaggregated rainfall at i th hour of a given day f i is the disaggregation factor for i th hour pdaily is the daily rainfall for the day and i 1 2 24 enumerates the timestep between 9am 10am local time which is the time period convention to record daily gauge reading in australia the daily rainfall used in the disaggregating point rainfall is generated by aggregating the sub daily rainfall allowing for the evaluation of disaggregation approach with accurate sub daily rainfall for evaluation purposes we prepared four rainfall datasets at each gauge location 1 pg the hourly gauge observations which is the reference data for evaluation of temporal disaggregation approach 2 pbn hourly barra rainfall at the nearest grid point to the gauge location 3 pgb daily totals from pdaily is disaggregated using sub daily temporal patterns from the nearest barra grid cell the rainfall at hour i at the nearest barra grid point is represented by p b and the disaggregation function takes the form f i p b i i p b i in the cases of rainy days in which barra does not simulate any rainfall uniform disaggregation is adopted as f i 1 24 the frequency of this fallback function is tracked to ensure that the it does not have the significant impact on the disaggregation approach 4 pbb daily totals from pdaily is disaggregated using sub daily temporal patterns from the best neighbour within the 3 3 grid space centred on the nearest neighbour grid point the best neighbouring grid cell is selected on a day by day basis which results on minimum absolute difference in daily totals across the neighbouring 3 3 grid cells as determined from comparison with daily awap data the rainfall at the best neighbouring grid cell is represented by p bn and the disaggregation function takes the form f i p bn i i p bn i the first two datasets represent the observed hourly rainfall at the gauge and the barra rainfall estimates at corresponding nearest grid cell the third data set uses the nearest neighbouring grid cell for barra sub daily patterns this is a logical option to consider as it represents the grid cell that is closest to the location of the gauge and as such it provides the best representation of the physical characteristics e g elevation and aspect of the gauge location in addition selecting the same grid cell over the entire time series simplifies its practical application however this approach implicitly assumes that there are no spatial displacement errors in the barra simulations of individual storms an assumption which is not consistent with the findings by acharya et al 2020 especially during large rainfall events accordingly the fourth data set tests whether there is value in considering the variable nature of the displacement errors which is accommodated by simply selecting the nearest cell with the most similar daily rainfall total while it is acknowledged that this approach ignores the potential biases inherent in rainfall reanalysis products it has the merit of simplicity and avoids the somewhat challenging task of developing a more sophisticated event dependent approaches over multiple sites it is also worth noting that restricting the search area to a 3 3 grid is consistent with the findings of acharya et al 2020 3 2 1 disaggregation of areal rainfall the inputs required to undertake the selected hydrological modelling are catchment average estimates of hourly rainfall and pet values the average catchment rainfall estimates are calculated by averaging grid cell values that overlie the catchment boundaries where the daily totals are obtained from the grid averaged awap data and the sub daily temporal patterns from the corresponding hourly barra data the general formulation of disaggregation approach for areal rainfall is similar to that used for point rainfalls in equation 1 for evaluation we prepare a set of three catchment average hourly rainfall datasets 1 ab hourly catchment barra rainfalls averaged over each catchment 2 agu daily catchment average rainfalls from awap that are uniformly disaggregated to hourly rainfalls using the simple function f i 1 24 3 a bn this is generated by disaggregating the daily catchment average rainfall from awap pawap using hourly distribution of rainfall from barra p b the disaggregation function for hour i is f i a b i i a b i although the disaggregation approach considered here focuses on the use of the daily gridded awap and sub daily barra rainfall products the other rainfall datasets considered here serve as a reference for comparison the first dataset a b is directly obtained from barra and its use in rainfall runoff modelling serves as a hydrological evaluation of the reanalysis data in its raw form in particular this option is a practical consideration for sparsely gauged or ungauged regions where the areal estimates of observed rainfall are less reliable or not available and reanalysis data represents the only viable alternative similarly the second dataset a gu represents the scenario where rainfall data with high temporal resolution are not available for disaggregation in such case the daily rainfall may be uniformly disaggregated to hourly time series these two options provide useful benchmarks to assess the relative utility of the proposed disaggregation approach where a bn could only be justified if it is found to yield superior outcomes 3 3 rainfall runoff modelling we selected a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model gr4h which is an hourly version of the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 this model is widely used internationally and is known to perform well across australia bennett et al 2016 2014 pagano et al 2010 gr4h consists of a soil moisture accounting storage followed by routing and water exchange functions it has four free parameters to be optimised production storage x1 water exchange coefficient x2 routing storage x3 and the time base of the unit hydrograph x4 other fixed values used in the model are adopted according to mathevet 2005 and perrin et al 2003 the gr4h rainfall runoff model requires hourly forcing of rainfall and pet the disaggregation methods described in section 3 1 are used to generate the different hourly rainfall time series and daily pet obtained from the silo data product is disaggregated to hourly using a fixed diurnal pattern the diurnal pattern follows a sinusoidal curve between sunrise and sunset and assumes that the instantaneous pet is zero during the night and peaks at solar noon liu et al 2005 the variables required to compute the timing and duration of daylight hours are computed for each day using solar calculations from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2020 the resulting instantaneous pet is then integrated to provide hourly values for hydrological evaluation of rainfall datasets the hydrological model could be calibrated either to observed rainfall only or to individual rainfall datasets artan et al 2007 bitew et al 2012 bitew and gebremichael 2011 stisen and sandholt 2010 yilmaz et al 2005 these two approaches serve different purpose in that the former focuses on the impact of differences in rainfall inputs only whereas the latter reveals how the different errors in the candidate rainfall data sets influence both model calibration and subsequent streamflow simulation during validation period bitew and gebremichael 2011 tuning the model to take account of the differences in errors in the four rainfall series provides the most appropriate means of evaluating performance as this most closely resembles how such errors propagate through the modelling chains in practical applications other studies undertaken to evaluate the hydrologic utility of various rainfall products have also undertaken separate model calibrations for each rainfall data set beck et al 2017 behrangi et al 2011 bitew et al 2012 bitew and gebremichael 2011 camici et al 2020 we used the same pet inputs with each of the disaggregated rainfall data sets the benefit of using the same pet series is that it ensures that any differences in performance are attributable solely to the selected rainfall input without the confounding influence of differences in pet input we use the r package airgr coron et al 2019 coron et al 2017 to calibrate and run the gr4h model given the small number of model parameters the steepest descent local search global plus local search procedure is deemed sufficient to optimise the parameters lobligeois et al 2014 an initial parameter set is determined by gross sampling of the parameter space to limit the risk of being trapped in local minima and the final set of optimum parameters is then found by a steepest descent local search this calibration is applied with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of sub daily flow as an objective function we split the available 28 years data 1990 2017 into a spin up period of two years 1990 1991 and two sub periods of 13 years each 1992 2004 2005 2017 to perform two fold cross validation in particular we calibrate the model on one of the sub periods and generate evaluation time series on another sub period and vice versa the evaluation time series for both subperiods are stitched together to obtain the evaluation time series of 26 years 1992 2017 the cross validation approach in this study allows us to independently evaluate the model over the entire time period another advantage of having a longer evaluation time series is that it is useful for analysing characteristics of extremes using derived flood frequency curves 3 4 rainfall evaluation at gauge locations we assess the efficacy of the disaggregated rainfall datasets for representing hourly point rainfalls using three groups of measures that are broadly relevant to many hydrological applications these include the use of categorical evaluation metrics relevant to the general behaviour of rainfall occurrence sequencing and distribution statistics relevant to the parameterisation of stochastic rainfall generators and the assessment of rainfall extremes first we use categorical metrics on the occurrence of rainfall to evaluate its performance although categorical metrics have been used to evaluate rainfall datasets at fine scales bulovic et al 2020 chiaravalloti et al 2018 these metrics are typically based on one on one evaluation and penalises any small errors due to temporal differences as if they were wrong values to take into account any possible temporal displacements that are likely to occur in high resolution datasets we compute the metrics at various temporal accumulations 1 h 3 h and 6 h adopting a threshold of 0 1 mm h we generate a contingency table for dichotomous events rain no rain on observed and disaggregated rainfall we then calculate four categorical metrics relevant to rainfall occurrence probability of detection pod proportion hits in observed events success ratio sr proportion of hits in modelled events which is also complement to 1 of false alarm ratio frequency bias fbias ratio of modelled to observed rainfall occurrence and critical success index csi proportion of correct modelled rainfall occurrence after removing correct non occurrences we use a single diagram referred to as a performance diagram roebber 2009 to summarise all four categorical scores such visualisation displays the value of all four categorical metrics in the one diagram and facilitates comparison of the individual metrics between the different datasets we also explore a selection of precipitation statistics which are relevant to the sequencing and distribution of rainfalls as commonly employed by stochastic weather generators the statistics considered include the mean variance skewness wet frequency and transition probabilities for observed and disaggregated rainfall datasets transition probabilities considered in this study are p00 and p11 which denote the probability of a dry followed by a dry hour or aggregated timestep and a wet followed by a wet hour or aggregated timestep respectively finally we compare quantiles of hourly rainfall magnitudes derived from different rainfall datasets as such information is commonly used in engineering design and associated risk analyses the observed sub daily data was available for only a six year period which is too short to support the estimation of annual exceedance probabilities accordingly we base our evaluation on the analysis of monthly maxima rainfall depth extracted for 1 3 and 6 h accumulations from each of the candidate rainfall series we use l moments hosking and wallis 1997 to fit generalised extreme value gev distribution to the sample of monthly maxima the rainfall depth corresponding to monthly exceedance probabilities meps of 0 1 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 are estimated from the fitted distribution for each of the rainfall datasets the quantiles derived using observed data r mep o are considered as evaluation benchmarks against which the rainfall quantiles derived using barra and disaggregated rainfalls r mep m are compared and reported in terms of relative bias 2 relative b i a s r mep m r mep o r mep o 3 5 hydrological evaluation we use an indirect approach to evaluate the different areal rainfall datasets by comparing the performance of the hydrological simulations over a 26 year period at each of the 27 catchments as explained in section 3 2 the evaluation is performed over the entire validation time series obtained via cross validation we use various approaches and metrics to assess the overall performance of the hydrological simulations including peak flow statistics and derived flood quantiles first we examine the overall model performance using a well established nse in addition we compute linear correlation r variability ratio α σ m σ o and normalised bias β n m o σ o where m and o denote respectively the simulated and observed streamflow series these three metrics are selected because they can be arranged mathematically to compute the nse as nse 2 α r α 2 β n 2 gupta et al 2009 in comparing nse and its components separately we can assess the contribution of each components to the overall nse and compare different aspects of model performance in detail second we explore the performance of the rainfall datasets in their ability to derive flood events in terms of their magnitude timing and volume from the validation time series obtained via hydrological simulation using areal rainfall a partial series comprising the largest 26 flood events an average of one event per year was extracted for each catchment such events are identified from the observed gauged data using a simple peaks over threshold approach whereby a flow threshold is selected to yield as many flow peaks as there are years in the simulation period subject to each event being separated by at least one month to assure independence corresponding to each observed event we search for peak values in the simulated streamflow within the range of 24 h the timing and magnitude of the corresponding peak in the simulated flow series are recorded the total volume of the simulated peak events is relevant to the analysis of streamflow yields and floods and accordingly we also compare maximum flood volumes extracted from a three day window surrounding the peak of each event selected for the catchment sizes considered we expect that a window of three day captures the entire event volume for shorter events and is representative of the majority of the peak volume for longer events the performance of the model is reported in terms of error relative to observed values 3 peak f l o w e r r o r δ q p q p sim q p obs q p obs 100 4

simulated peak streamflow q p obs is observed peak streamflow tp returns the timing of the peak v p 3 d sim is maximum 3 day volume in simulated streamflow and v p 3 d obs is maximum 3 day peak in observed streamflow finally a flood frequency analysis is undertaken using maxima extracted from the observed and simulated streamflows and the results are then compared we extract the annual maxima flow peaks from the observed and simulated flow series and fit a gev distribution using the method of l moments hosking and wallis 1997 to derive a set of flood quantiles corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities aeps of 0 2 0 1 0 04 0 02 i e for average recurrence intervals ranging between 5 and 50 years the flow quantiles derived from the gauged flows q aep o are considered the benchmarks for evaluation the corresponding flood quantiles derived from the simulated flow series q aep m are compared against the benchmark using a relative bias score expressed as 6 relative b i a s q aep m q aep o q aep o 4 results 4 1 point rainfall evaluation at gauge locations 4 1 1 categorical evaluation the binary categorical rain no rain performance of barra and the disaggregated datasets is summarised in a performance diagram for three temporal accumulations fig 3 the diagram displays the four categorical metrics namely probability of detection pod success ratio sr critical success index csi and frequency bias fbias across the ordinate abscissa dashed lines and solid contour lines respectively this format was adopted as it facilitates comparison of the performance of the different rainfall data sets across all selected catchments overall it is found that the performance of the different rainfall data sets based on categorical metrics improves with temporal accumulation from hourly to 6 hourly though the relative differences between the rainfall data sets remains similar fig 3 it can be observed that there are more frequent occurrences of rainfall in hourly barra frequency bias between 1 and 1 5 compared to the other data sets this bias is due to the tendency of nwp models to overestimate rainfall frequency jiang et al 2020 kendon et al 2012 lopez 2007 stephens et al 2010 in addition both the sr and pod are closer or less than 0 5 respectively indicating that the number of rainfall occurrences are missed more than half of the time and falsely predicted to the same degree compared to raw barra daily rainfalls disaggregated using barra yields better sr whereas the pod remains relatively similar for instance at temporal accumulations of 3 h disaggregation increased the median sr from 0 46 to 0 61 whereas pod only increased slightly 0 56 to 0 59 fig 3 b there is some difference in the degree of improvement across hits misses and false alarms this is mostly because the hits and misses are governed by the instances of rain whereas false alarms depend solely on the instances of no rain the use of barra in disaggregation always generates hourly rainfalls when daily rainfalls are non zero though sub daily rainfalls are always zero on days when barra rainfall are non zero but the observed rainfalls are zero in practice there are many instances where rainfall events appear in the barra time series but not in the gauged record which could be due to various reasons such as barra s general tendency to overestimate small rainfalls the presence of timing or spatial displacement errors in the reanalysis or the intrinsic differences in spatial representation between point and areal rainfalls at finer temporal scales any such instances of incorrect zero hourly rainfalls in the barra estimates are corrected by disaggregation whenever the observed daily rainfall total is zero thus improving false alarms in contrast during wet days any discrepancies in patterns of hourly barra rainfalls appear in the disaggregated dataset and this results in a minimal or nil improvement in hits this difference means that compared to the performance of the original hourly barra data pb the disaggregation method is able to reduce the rate of false alarms in the two disaggregated barra time series pbn and pbb but it is not able to improve the rate of detection accordingly sr a function of hits and false alarms is improved whereas pod a function of hits and misses shows no improvement in the case of fbias and csi which are dependent on the three attributes of hits misses and false alarms the improvement across any one of these will improve the overall metrics the improvement in fbias and csi can thus be attributed solely to the reduced number of false alarms fig 3 the disaggregation undertaken using the best gauge in neighbouring 9 grid cells pbb has no significant effect on the overall performance of the resulting dataset this is partly because we are only evaluating in terms of binary rain no rain occurrence whereby any improvement in the magnitude of rainfall is not detected in addition the best grid cell among the neighbouring gird cells is identified on day by day basis to minimise bias at daily scale while this appeared to improve the representation of sub daily rainfall extremes about 4 5 events per year in acharya et al 2020 its influence is not apparent when a longer time series is considered 4 1 2 rainfall statistics a set of statistics relevant to the seasonal sequencing and distribution of 3 hourly rainfalls derived from the different point rainfall data sets is presented in fig 4 similar statistics for 1 and 6 hourly rainfalls are presented in supporting information figures s1 and s2 in general there is a high variability in rainfall statistics across stations which reflects topographical differences in elevation distance from the coast and aspect as shown in the upper three panels of fig 4 all three rainfall data sets reproduce the seasonal variation in central tendency statistics reasonably well when compared to gauged information pg with specific regard to the raw barra rainfalls pb the average rainfall is overestimated in the wet season djf and underestimated in the dry season jja whereas the variability is generally underestimated the data sets derived by disaggregation pbn and pbb greatly improves the rainfall statistics compared to pb the mean rainfall in observed and disaggregated rainfalls are identical as expected because all the disaggregated rainfalls sum to gauge observations at a coarse timestep i e daily while the disaggregated data sets preserve the means exactly they underestimate both the variance and skew despite underestimation the disaggregated rainfall improves skewness while degrading the variance however comparing the two disaggregated rainfall datasets pbn and pbb it is worth noting that there is negligible difference in performance between them that is there is no appreciable improvement arising from using sub daily information from the selected best neighbouring grid across the time periods considered the improvements in the disaggregated data sets over raw barra rainfalls is higher for 6 h accumulations than for 1 h accumulations figures s1 and s2 in supporting information this is not surprising as rainfalls are measured once per day and it would be expected that the accuracy of the representation improves as the accumulations approach 24 h in addition the accuracy of rainfall time series at a finer time steps is more likely to be impacted by potential temporal displacement of the rainfall field and other random errors which are compensated at aggregated timesteps the frequency of wet time periods pwet is higher in the raw barra data fig 4d this is expected due to the tendency of nwp models to overestimate light rainfalls the application of disaggregation improves the representation of wet periods significantly mostly due to the moderating influence of dry and very low rainfall days on the frequently overestimated small rainfalls also discussed in section 4 1 1 with regard to dry dry and wet wet period transition probabilities p00 and p11 it is seen that raw barra estimates pb p underestimates p00 and overestimates p11 this result can also be attributed to the tendency of reanalysis datasets to overestimate light rainfalls as the disaggregation approach reduces false alarms in rainfall occurrence it increases p00 subsequently the occurrence of light drizzle periods for days with observed rainfall are retained in the disaggregated product resulting in a higher wet wet transition probabilities p11 a reduced number of overestimated drizzles results in a higher p00 for pbn than for pbb whereas the lack of dry timesteps and persistence in nwp models results in a higher pbn than for pg on the other hand the wet wet transition probability p11 is influenced by the adopted fallback function in the disaggregated product the fallback function uniformly disaggregates the non zero daily rainfalls when barra does not simulate any rainfall this fallback function was found to occur 4 95 of the time on average 18 days in a year although the average depth for those conditions is 0 91 mm it inflates the wet wet transition probabilities by assigning rainfall to a continuous period of 24 h overall the difference in improvement between metrics based on the distribution of rainfall magnitudes i e fig 4a c and those based on occurrence frequencies and probabilities i e fig 4d f reflects the disaggregation approach adopted in this study 4 1 3 rainfall frequency analysis the results of the rainfall frequency analysis are reported as deviations from the quantiles derived for observed data figures 5 s3 and s4 where in all cases the results were obtained by fitting a gev distribution to the monthly point rainfall maxima extracted from six years of concurrent record it is seen that raw barra pb significantly overestimates the rainfall quantiles for all monthly exceedance probabilities considered and the degree of over estimation increases with event severity this overestimation is consistent with the statistics presented in section 4 1 2 which shows an overestimation in mean rainfall from barra in contrast the two disaggregated rainfall series based on barra patterns pbn and pbb consistently underestimate the rainfall depths by around 15 across all exceedance probabilities this underestimation could be attributed to mismatch in the areal extent of rainfall arising due to application of grid cell average temporal patterns to point rainfall depths while the biases have different direction for the raw barra and the disaggregated datasets it is clear that the magnitude of bias is smaller for estimates of rainfall frequencies obtained by disaggregating point observations using the reanalysis barra rainfall than raw barra 4 2 hydrological evaluation at 27 selected catchments 4 2 1 streamflow simulation a summary of gr4h model performance metrics based on nse correlation r variability ratio α and normalised bias results βn for all 27 study catchments is presented in fig 6 overall the performance of different disaggregation procedures can be ranked in order of decreasing performance as follows awap disaggregated using barra abn awap disaggregated uniformly agu and raw barra ab based on the three metrics r α βn the increases in nse can be attributed to improvements in correlation and variability conversely normalised bias is close to zero and has the least influence on overall nse compared to using raw barra as an input there is a clear improvement in model performance when using disaggregated awap even though the approach is based on simple uniform disaggregation this can be attributed to a lower accuracy of barra compared to awap in estimating daily rainfall acharya et al 2019 and the influence of model storage on accommodating errors in sub daily patterns of rainfall focusing on the individual components the normalised bias component β in all three rainfall inputs are small indicating that the model parameters are adjusted during calibration to take account of the overall systematic bias the correlation r however is lower for barra which could be linked to a lower correlation of daily rainfall from raw barra with awap rainfall acharya et al 2019 for the rainfalls disaggregated using barra the awap inputs preserve the accuracy of rainfalls at the daily scale and the rainfall patterns adopted from barra provide an improved representation of sub daily rainfall variability the value of accommodating a more realistic representation of sub daily variability compared to simple uniform disaggregation is evident in fig 6 where it is seen that results for qbn are generally better than those obtained for qgu although the additional information in the form of sub daily variability improves the overall hydrological simulation the degree of improvement is small due to the fact that both the disaggregated datasets share the same daily inputs rainfalls this improvement in performance is small yet it is statistically significant t 27 2 67 p 0 037 4 2 2 timing and magnitude of flood peaks the foregoing analysis reports on the ability of the different disaggregation schemes to reproduce the full streamflow timeseries but it is also commonly of interest to focus on the analysis of high flow events accordingly a summary of the relative errors in peak flow and timing for events equal to or rarer than the annual maximum across all 27 study catchments are presented in fig 7 a overall the magnitude of the simulated peak flows is underestimated by all derived rainfall inputs compared to observed streamflow such underestimation is most likely due to the scheme used to calibrate the gr4h model where the focus was on reproducing the whole streamflow regime and not the 0 3 of days relevant to the flood maxima considered here the relative errors in simulating these flood events are the highest for simulations undertaken with raw barra ab followed by simulations undertaken using awap disaggregated uniformly agu and the best results were achieved when using awap rainfalls disaggregated using barra abn while the errors in magnitude of the flood peaks derived using ab are higher than those derived using agu it is still interesting to observe that the timing of the peaks are better characterised by ab than agu 7a this difference is most likely due to the influence of variability in the sub daily spatio temporal patterns of ab in contrast the absence of sub daily variability in the agu rainfalls result in large positive timing errors indicating a delayed peak timing error for most events the best representation of peak flow timing is achieved when abn is used where more than 50 of events have timing error of less than 5 hours this result supports the potential utility of sub daily variability in barra rainfall for hydrological simulation if the bias is treated appropriately fig 7b summarises the relative errors in simulating three day flow volumes for selected events across the 27 study catchments it is seen that simulations undertaken using raw barra rainfalls greatly underestimate flood volumes whereas the two disaggregated rainfall datasets result in less biased estimates it is also observed that the flow volumes derived using the two disaggregated rainfall datasets are similar these results indicate that the multi day flow volume is more dependent on the accuracy of multi day rainfall depth than on its sub daily variability this is expected as losses due to infiltration and other processes generally represent a smaller proportion of the input rainfall as the severity of the event increases and any effects of sub daily variability are diminished when aggregated over multiple days 4 2 3 flood frequency analysis the ability of the disaggregated rainfalls to derive flood frequency curves is assessed by fitting a gev distribution to annual maxima extracted from the different streamflow series individual analysis in supporting information s10 the results of this assessment are shown in fig 8 in terms of the relative bias in derived flood quantiles obtained using the different rainfall inputs it is found that all rainfall inputs yield flood quantiles that are lower than those obtained from observed streamflow which is consistent with the results presented in the previous section the degree of underestimation is similar across the range of exceedance probabilities considered which indicates that the approaches are better able to simulate the variability of flood maxima than their associated means i e the scale parameters of fitted distributions are better represented than the location parameters see supporting information s9 obviously the degree of underestimation is heavily dependent on the structure and parameterisation of the gr4h model but the differences in the results provide a useful indication of the efficacy of the different input rainfall series it is seen from fig 8 that while the performance ranking of the different rainfall products is the same as discussed in the previous section it is interesting to observe that the relative advantage of disaggregating awap by barra i e abn rather than by simple uniform disaggregation agu is greater when evaluating the frequency of floods rather than when evaluating their magnitude the ability to derive better flood quantiles using abn than agu can be attributed to the value of representing sub daily variability in rainfall inputs which has an important influence on the generation of large floods 5 discussion we discuss below the value of combining reanalysis and observation based rainfalls compared to their individual use for representing rainfalls and for hydrological modelling we also discuss the practical applications of this approach and its implications for hydrological modelling previous evaluation of the magnitude and frequency of rainfall estimates obtained from barra and other data sources showed that some biases exist in the raw barra rainfalls acharya et al 2020 2019 such biases persists over daily and sub daily scales and are dependent on the location and spatial scale of interest acharya et al 2020 2019 su et al 2020 while these previous studies assessed the more general ability of barra to represent rainfall distributions across the whole of australia it is perhaps not surprising that similar biases were found using metrics considered here at 33 pluviometer gauges location figs 3 and 4 in addition the tendency of raw barra estimates to overestimate rainfall persistence and frequency figs 4 and 5 is consistent with the performance of other numerical weather prediction reported in other studies jiang et al 2020 kendon et al 2012 lopez 2007 stephens et al 2010 the use of barra to disaggregate daily gauged data resulted in a mixed performance across the metrics considered in general the sub daily time series of point rainfalls obtained via disaggregating daily rainfall are more accurate than raw barra estimates with respect to rainfall occurrence fig 3 and frequency fig 5 basing the disaggregation on the nearest neighbour pbn the best neighbour pbb yielded minimal improvements in performance this seems to be in contrast to acharya et al 2020 which demonstrated that adopting rainfall information from neighbouring grid cells enhances the rainfall temporal patterns within the day for large rainfall events however such events constitute only about 10 15 days in a year and this have minimal impact on rainfall improvement when evaluated over the entire time series it is also of note that as the model in barra is unable to explicitly model the subgrid processes governing small scale convective cloud and precipitation the simulated precipitation can lack storm cell organisation be too spatially diffused and show timing bias in convection initiation su et al 2020 and references therein although the disaggregation is able to reproduce some of the rainfall characteristics e g wet day frequency it overestimates transition probabilities p00 and p11 and underestimates variance and skewness fig 4 such limitations could be attributed to the adopted fallback function for resolving zero barra rainfalls and the parsimony of the disaggregation approach compared to complex rainfall characteristics considering that there are advanced stochastic disaggregation approaches which preserve such characteristics e g breinl and di baldassarre 2019 lombardo et al 2017 ma et al 2020 müller and haberlandt 2018 2015 seyyedi et al 2014 if the resulting applications are sensitive to fine scale rainfall characteristics then it may not be appropriate to adopt the simple deterministic disaggregation approach presented in this study while the evaluation of central tendency and categorical statistics are of interest assessment of rainfall datasets it is difficult to infer how rainfall behaviour at point locations or across large regions impact on hydrological performance camici et al 2020 dembélé et al 2020 and this provides the motivation for indirectly assessing performance through hydrological simulation it is worth acknowledging that hydrological evaluation of the rainfall data sets lumps together uncertainties from both the rainfall models and the rainfall runoff model while the structure of the rainfall runoff model is fixed the model parameters are tuned to accommodate the different nature of errors in the four rainfall data sets as such the evaluation sheds light on the hydrological efficacy of the candidate rainfalls in a manner that is consistent with how such modelling is undertaken in practice the biases and errors in the raw hourly barra rainfalls propagate through the gr4h model which resulted in much poorer hydrological simulations in terms of nse and peak flow bias compared to disaggregated daily observations figs 6 and 7 despite the ability of rainfall runoff models to cope with imperfect rainfall inputs andréassian et al 2001 the observed biases in raw barra rainfalls are large enough to impact adversely on the resulting simulations the use of sub daily patterns from barra to derive disaggregated daily inputs to the gr4h model greatly improved model performance however the degree of improvement compared to the results obtained using raw barra rainfalls or uniformly disaggregated daily rainfalls varied with the metrics considered for example the use of rainfalls disaggregated using barra provide modest improvements to the overall simulation of the hourly flow regime fig 6 whereas the simulation of high flow events fig 7 and flood quantiles fig 8 demonstrate significant improvement the continuous evaluation metrics such as nse are highly influenced by timing errors which may result from the different disaggregation approaches however such small timing errors have minimal influence on the magnitude of peak flows events or the annual maxima such behaviour is consistent with the previous studies that utilised similar disaggregation approaches and evaluation metrics ryo et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 in shrestha et al 2018 the hydrological performance associated with a disaggregated rainfall dataset in terms of nse was significantly lower than that obtained using observed dataset while the magnitude of peak for those events were in agreement it is also worth noting that some degree of hydrological performance could be influenced due to the catchment size e g zhu et al 2018 while the small number of catchments considered precludes drawing firm conclusions about the influence of catchment size on the results it is worth noting that the general pattern of the results shown in fig 5 holds for all ranges of catchment size figure s6 the raw barra data includes some significant rainfall events that are higher than the corresponding estimates in the awap data set and these led to higher estimates of the storage parameter in the gr4h model supporting information figure s6 the higher storage parameter obtained from the raw barra data set resulted in a general underestimation of smaller streamflow peaks and this is evident in results shown in figs 4 5 7 8 another interesting observation is that the degree of improvement in the characterisation of rainfalls achieved by disaggregation is somewhat different to its corresponding hydrological simulation the improvement in rainfall as observed in fig 3 and fig 4 translates to a higher improvement in hydrological simulation fig 6 this effect is in part due to the nature of the evaluation metrics used the rainfall metrics based on one on one evaluations penalises small differences in sub daily temporal patterns equally as incorrect rainfall depths occurrence and this results in poorer evaluation metrics also the metrics based on dichotomous events categorical metrics wet frequency transition probabilities focus mainly on rainfall occurrence and are insensitive to improvements rainfall magnitude however disaggregation corrects systematic biases in the magnitude of rainfall inputs by adopting daily totals from observed datasets and this coupled with the ability of hydrological models to cope with imperfect rainfall inputs greatly improves model performance the gr4h modelling shows the value of disaggregation for simulating streamflow and flood events and for deriving design floods fig 8 in particular the magnitude and timing of flow peaks are better simulated using rainfall inputs that are disaggregated using barra fig 7 the results highlight the value of combining accurate daily rainfalls with some form of sub daily variability when simulating the peak flows that is although the disaggregated rainfalls shared the same daily totals uniform disaggregation of the awap rainfalls resulted in the less accurate representation of peak flow timing previous research have shown that the calibration of models with sub daily time steps can significantly improve model calibration and simulation performance booij 2002 huang et al 2019 kobold and brilly 2006 while this study and previous research acharya 2020 have revealed shortcomings in representation of sub daily spatio temporal characteristics in raw barra rainfall figs 7 and 8 show that introducing sub daily variability even if it may not be perfect improves the ability of the model to simulate floods further for hydrologic simulation at coarse time steps aggregating output from sub daily simulation to daily is better than running model directly at daily time step ficchì et al 2016 therefore it is natural to opt for hydrological modelling at finer timestep using the disaggregated rainfall inputs conditioned upon available computational resources while the method adopted in this study is purely a temporal disaggregation spatial dependencies are preserved through the gridded rainfalls products ie the physical basis of the barra reanalysis and the thin plate splines used in the awap data this results in a realistic rainfall field that is constrained by the available daily observations this is also one of the strengths of the proposed disaggregation approach as it does not rely on additional parametric characterisation of spatial characteristics for instilling spatial consistency e g breinl and di baldassarre 2019 clark et al 2004 müller and haberlandt 2018 2015 wasko et al 2013 however the accuracy of the sub daily characteristics is dependent on the quality of the reanalysis and the nature of these associated uncertainties are described by acharya et al 2020 an important implication of this analysis is that the disaggregation method can be seen as an alternative post processing application of reanalysis products particularly those like barra that are derived without assimilating rainfall observations it also offers a step forward towards improving the utility of existing daily rainfall products which represent the most widely available set of rainfall observations one strength of this approach is that it is not limited to a particular set of inputs meaning that it can be easily applied to any high quality dataset that may have been derived at coarser temporal or spatial scales for example high quality gauge or interpolated dataset such as awap can be disaggregated using any of the available reanalysis or satellite datasets such as era5 hersbach et al 2020 trmm huffman et al 2007 or imerg huffman et al 2018 the approach also facilitates the assessment of epistemic uncertainty in estimates of sub daily areal rainfalls as different re analysis data sets can be used to disaggregate a single set of daily observations the use of global reanalysis could be used for studies that encompasses large regions that are beyond the extent of regional reanalysis datasets or for studies that benefit from a consistent set of rainfall inputs such as large sample hydrology addor et al 2020 in recent years global reanalyses are evolving for example era40 125 km uppala et al 2005 has evolved to era interim 80 km dee et al 2011 and subsequently era5 30 km hersbach et al 2020 and they are improving in terms of their resolution and accuracy dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 nogueira 2020 tarek et al 2020 the biases in raw barra rainfall totals as evaluated at daily scale makes it less attractive for direct application in rainfall runoff modelling however the reanalysis data can be used as an alternative to rainfall observations for hydrological modelling in the regions where gauge measurements are sparse or not existent essou et al 2016 tarek et al 2020 although evaluations presented here demonstrate the potential value of the disaggregation approach any assessment relies upon the accuracy of the adopted benchmark this is particularly difficult in the case of sub daily areal rainfalls as all methods of estimation involve uncertainties it is difficult to find catchments with high densities of pluviometer gauges and considerable effort and uncertainty is involved in deriving and compiling sub daily rainfall information over large areas and or time periods boushaki et al 2009 dunn et al 2016 lewis et al 2019 ma et al 2020 similar difficulties arise when representing sub daily variability in space and time using radar gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 hasan et al 2016 panziera et al 2018 sinclair and pegram 2005 remote sensing bulovic et al 2020 freitas et al 2020 o and kirstetter 2018 zeweldi and gebremichael 2009 and other data merging approaches e g nerini et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 sinclair and pegram 2005 these issues also have some bearing on representing the spatial variability of daily rainfalls over catchments although the areal and temporal averaging involved is more easily accommodated particularly as the gauging network of sub daily observations is much less dense than daily becker et al 2013 lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 the adoption of a lumped model gr4h obviates the need to represent spatial variation in rainfalls across the catchment and this greatly simplifies the manner in which differences in the resolution of the datasets are accommodated while the temporal resolution of rainfall is generally deemed to have more influence on catchment response than its spatial distribution the influence of the latter is more pronounced in the large catchments with strong spatial variability of rainfall bárdossy and pegram 2016 emmanuel et al 2017 huang et al 2019 lobligeois et al 2014 a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of differing spatial resolutions of the datasets could be undertaken by preserving the spatial temporal dependencies in the disaggregation method e g breinl and di baldassarre 2019 koutsoyiannis 2003 müller and haberlandt 2018 seyyedi et al 2014 though this would need to explicitly consider the potential for spatial displacement errors during large events acharya et al 2020 a semi distributed model would need to be adopted to take advantage of the additional information on spatial variability provided by such disaggregation approach while this study was focused on the temporal resolution aspect of rainfall datasets the spatial aspect of rainfall could be considered in the further studies 6 conclusions the method proposed here to disaggregate daily rainfalls based on observed data to sub daily data using reanalysis data is simple and its efficacy is evaluated separately for its ability to improve the representation of sub daily rainfall and its value in hydrological modelling the results from this study support the idea of improving temporal resolution of coarse high quality rainfall datasets by using temporally finer datasets as a disaggregation function the results suggest that disaggregation procedures based on globally regionally available reanalysis precipitation datasets have the potential to enhance temporal resolutions of ground observations and improve the spatio temporal representation of rainfalls over large areal extents while such sub daily rainfall datasets are shown to improve upon raw reanalysis datasets by reducing false alarms and correcting mean they are unable to reproduce fine scale rainfall characteristics however the use of reanalysis data to disaggregate daily rainfalls was found to materially improve the ability of a rainfall runoff model to simulate the timing and peaks of flood events and derived flood frequency estimates compared to raw reanalysis datasets the generation of sub daily rainfall by disaggregation provides the opportunity to address the limited availability of sub daily datasets and their paucity relative to daily measurements such spatially and temporally fine rainfall datasets are valuable in hydrology especially when we are dealing with extremes the value of the proposed approach to a particular application can be tested using available daily observations point or areal and reanalysis datasets if suitable sub daily rainfall data sets are not available for comparison the approach can be indirectly evaluated by comparing the performance of a selected hydrological model run with alternative sets of inputs

3326,evapotranspiration et is a critical component of the global water cycle but basin scale et is often difficult to accurately estimate due to the limitations of the temporal resolution of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites and coverage period daily or monthly terrestrial water storage tws changes at basin scale are hard to obtain which limits the application of water balance in et estimation to surmount this limitation we established a daily tws anomaly reconstruction framework based on this framework the reconstructed daily tws anomalies twsas were used for the first time to estimate the basin scale et in nine exorheic basins of china furthermore we combined four commonly used et models and tws change twsc derived by two different twsa interpolation methods to evaluate the uncertainty of the different methodologies using the three cornered hat tch approach the results show that i the number of negative values of et from the two twsa interpolation methods is close to each other for the reconstruction method the number of negative values is reduced by about 70 relative to interpolation methods which significantly improves the quality of the et estimates and ii among the seven sequences involved in the tch calculation the two twsa interpolation methods show the largest uncertainty while the reconstruction method has similar or optimal performance to the four et models in all the basins except the huaihe river basin and the minjiang river basin the results of this study demonstrate the superiority of derived twsc based on the reconstruction framework in basin scale et estimation which has a great potential for the application in the quantitative evaluation of et and further assessment of et models keywords evapotranspiration grace water balance terrestrial water storage change 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which consists of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and water surface evaporation is the primary way of water and energy exchange among the hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere oki and kanae 2006 zhang et al 2015 accurate estimation of et is critical for developing energy and water balances at regional to global scales various methods have been used for estimating et such as traditional ground observations land surface model simulation remote sensing and water balance methods wang and dickinson 2012 at the local scale ground based observations e g the bowen ratio energy balance method eddy covariance towers etc are typically used to accurately monitor et hirschi et al 2017 sun et al 2008 zitouna chebbi et al 2018 however ground based observation is expensive and the observations may be sparsely as well as unevenly distributed so that it is unable to meet the needs of et estimation at a basin or global scale at the regional scale et is usually obtained by different kinds of model estimates elbeltagi et al 2021 pan et al 2020 srivastava et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a specifically the et models used in the literature can be broadly classified as 1 fully physically based combination models that account for mass and energy conservation principles 2 semi physically based models that deal with either mass or energy conservation and 3 black box models based on artificial neural networks empirical relationships and fuzzy and genetic algorithms in addition regional et can also be derived from the water balance equation wbe that is precipitation subtracted by net flows and change of terrestrial water storage and it is usually regarded as benchmark values for validating et models rodell et al 2004 yeh et al 1998 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites which were launched in 2002 and their successor the grace follow on grace fo mission are currently the only tools available to obtain twsc at regional or global scales tapley et al 2019 since their launch the grace and grace fo mission has continuously monitored global tws anomalies twsas at a temporal resolution of one month and a spatial resolution of 100 000 km2 300 km 300 km and grace data have been widely used in hydrological glacial and other applications feng et al 2013 ran et al 2018 scanlon et al 2016 with twsc derived from grace observations et can be estimated at the basin scale through wbe regional et estimates from grace based on wbe have been applied in many studies but there are several issues to be resolved before its application the problems are as follows i there is an 11 month gap between grace and grace fo i e july 2017 to may 2018 and several missing months which breaks the continuity of the grace observations and hinders the application of grace data over longer time scales humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 landerer et al 2020 sun et al 2020 ii the twsa from grace is monthly mean value it is non instantaneous value and the twsc estimate with the difference between twsa in two consecutive months is distinct from accumulated monthly precipitation runoff flux li et al 2012 rodell et al 2004 iii the grace month is sometimes non consecutive and varies in length humphrey et al 2016 rodell et al 2004 previous studies tried to solve the above problems with different methods rodell et al 2004 attempts to extract daily hydrological fluxes such as precipitation and runoff by running mean accumulation to a time scale consistent with grace observation periods and then calculates et expressed as mean daily et rates during the middle date of the two consecutive grace month by wbe li et al 2018 proposed an improved method to compute the monthly mean et by introducing generalized cross validation and establishing the relation between the monthly mean et and daily precipitation runoff and tws based on wbe however both of the above methods could only produce monthly mean et for the grace month not the natural month in addition they require daily runoff and precipitation data to calculate et and in areas with few or no gauge stations these high frequency data are hard to obtain thus these methods have some limitations for further application ramillien et al 2006 and long et al 2014 estimate et using a linear approximation of twsc which is one half of the difference in twsa between k 1 and k 1 months rather than using the daily precipitation runoff of rodell et al 2004 the missing values of twsa are simply interpolated from the previous and the next months in addition li et al 2019 integrated atmospheric and terrestrial water balance results as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of three remote sensing et datasets and a land surface model in the tibetan plateau headwaters region the grace derived twsc was computed as the backward difference of twsa zhong et al 2020a investigated the impact of considering twsc in the water balance calculation for et estimation and evaluated the performance of the gldas noah and global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam models in nine exorheic basins in china using the water balance method as a benchmark the twscs in the above two studies were obtained by interpolation of twsa which may lead to amplification of the error in the grace data an improved estimate of twsc based on reconstructed daily twsa was proposed to solve the above problems in et estimate from grace in this study humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 used a statistical method to train the grace data and the corresponding meteorological data and reconstructed the tws prior to 2002 this approach presents a new sight to calculate twsa but it can only reconstruct de trended and de seasonalized twsa to address this limitation we propose a new framework to reconstruct the integral daily twsa based on the statistical model we used this framework to reconstruct the daily twsas for 2003 2018 and further applied them to the wbe to calculate the et in nine exorheic basins of china then we use the three cornered hat tch method to evaluate the uncertainty of the derived et long et al 2014 long et al 2017 therefore the objectives of this study were i to reconstruct the daily twsa and provide a new twsc estimate in et calculation and ii to evaluate the reliability of the reconstruction method by combining two twsc interpolation approaches and four et models i e the penman monteith leuning version 2 model pml v2 the gldas 2 1 noah land surface model the complementary

latitude range of 21 52 n i e the upper yangtze river basin uyrb the middle yangtze river basin myrb the yellow river basin yerb the songhuajiang river basin srb the pearl river basin prb the liaohe river basin lrb the haihe river basin hrb the huaihe river basin hurb and the minjiang river basin mrb the boundaries of the nine basins were generated from data of 11 hydrological gauge stations from the china river sediment bulletin combined with a digital elevation model zhong et al 2020a the total area of the nine basins is about 388 33 104 km2 and together they account for 40 5 of the land area of china due to the vast area there are various climate patterns and different degrees of human activity in the study area it should be noted that the prb contains three hydrological gauge stations gaoyao shijiao and boluo the distribution of the basins and the hydrological stations is shown in fig 2 and their detailed information is provided in table 1 2 2 datasets in this study the observed precipitation data the grace based twsas and in situ runoff data were used to calculate the et by the wbe please refer to table 2 for an overview of all the datasets all the gridded data were extracted to the basin scale by area weighting and then integrated into a monthly time scale by summing or averaging to maintain consistency with the grace data 2 2 1 grace derived twsas in this work the latest release of the grace mascon solutions rl06 offered by the center for space research csr were used to reconstruct the daily twsas and calculate the et from 2003 to 2018 this dataset can be used in applications such as hydrology and oceanography without any post processing we refer the reader to save et al 2016 for full details of the data processing steps the jpl released grace rl06 mascon solutions the itsg grace2018 gravity field solutions and the reconstructed global twsas published by humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 were used for the validation the jpl mascon solutions were constrained by the grace observations and the priori geophysical model information the spatial resolution of the jpl product was transformed from 3 3 to 1 1 by using the downscaling factors calculated from the community land model lawrence et al 2019 and then resampled to 0 5 0 5 itsg grace2018 is derived from grace level 1b data and the latest atmosphere and ocean de aliasing level 1b product compared with the old version the data processing flow and error modeling are greatly improved humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 reconstructed the twsas based on the daily precipitation latency effect at a long time scale this dataset was compared with the reconstructed data obtained in this study to verify the accuracy of the reconstruction results 2 2 2 precipitation and temperature data two precipitation datasets the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa dataset and the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd were used in this study the cmfd data were used to calculate the et while the daily cgdpa data were used to reconstruct the daily twsas the coverage area of cmfd is the mainland of china for further details about this dataset we refer the reader to he et al 2020 and yang et al 2010 the cgdpa dataset was derived from daily precipitation records of about 2400 national meteorological stations in china the dataset was interpolated by the thin plate spline method in the context of the climate background field in china and has undergone strict topographic correction and quality control shen and xiong 2016 as a result it can capture the spatiotemporal distribution features of precipitation effectively and has valuable application potential in the study of meteorology and hydrology long et al 2020 the daily temperature in the cn05 1 dataset was based on observations from 2400 chinese meteorological stations the data processing procedures were 1 the average climate field was interpolated by the thin plate spline method 2 the climate anomaly field was interpolated using the angular distance weighting method and 3 the two were superimposed to obtain the final data wu and gao 2013 this dataset has potential applications in studies of climate change agriculture and ecology wu et al 2017 2 2 3 runoff data the monthly runoff data from 11 hydrological stations were obtained from the river sediment bulletin of china it should be mentioned that the net outflow runoff of the myrb equals the difference between datong and yichang and the runoff of the prb is the sum of gaoyao shijiao and boluo to maintain consistency with the grace data we converted the runoff in cubic meters to the equivalent water height in millimeters 2 2 4 modeled et data in this study four et models i e pml v2 noah cr and gleam were utilized hereafter referred to as etpml etnoah etcr and etgleam different model selection criteria and evaluation metrics have been investigated in previous studies banimahd et al 2015 kumari et al 2021 according to these studies we selected these four models from the existing et models by considering the model complexity access difficulty spatial and temporal resolution applicability and adaptability all four models have a spatial resolution better than 0 5 a temporal resolution better than one month and a time span close to or covering the study period 2003 2018 in addition both the cr and pml models are developed for the china region the data for all four models are available online and widely used in several studies yin et al 2021 yin et al 2018 the pml v2 dataset in this study is forced by cmfd pml v2 couples the gross primary productivity gpp process based on the penman monteith leuning model with stomatal conductance theory gpp and et are mutually constrained and limited resulting in the pml v2 model representing a great improvement in et estimation accuracy compared to previous models the gldas 2 1 noah dataset has been forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to the present the monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of the gldas 2 1 noah 3 hourly data rui and beaudoing 2018 the cr dataset is a product of chinese surface et based on a complementary approach it relies only on the input of meteorological data and does not require complex calibration the gleam model which was published jointly by vrije universiteit amsterdam and ghent university uses a series of algorithms to estimate the different components of et i e vegetation transpiration evaporation from bare soil sublimation evaporation from water bodies and interception loss the reason for using these four components was to minimize the loss of et information obtained from satellite observations martens et al 2017 for more details about these four et models please see the references in table 2 3 methods 3 1 water balance based et estimation the wbe describes the dynamic balance of the water cycle at a regional scale at the basin scale it can be represented as the following equation 1 et p q ds dt where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation q is streamflow and ds dt is the changes in tws over a specific period of time e g one month based on the above equation the monthly et can be derived from the basin scale precipitation twsc and runoff twsc is the difference between the twsas at the beginning of two consecutive months three different methods were used to calculate twsc in this study since there is a gap of almost one year between grace and grace fo filling this gap directly by interpolation would bring more error so the dataset of reconstructed twsa for the gap built by zhong et al 2020b was used to fill the grace sequence before interpolation the calculation procedures for the three methods are as follows the first method involves obtaining the twsa at the middle of each month directly using cubic spline interpolation the difference between the twsas of the third month and the first month is then divided by two to obtain the twsc of the second month long et al 2014 this can be expressed as 2 twsc t twsa t 1 t w s a t 1 2 where t represents the time in months the second method involves first decomposing the time series and then interpolating it zhong et al 2020a the twsas contain a long term trend term a seasonal term and a residual term humphrey et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 the corresponding signals can be isolated using a least squares fit with the following expression 3 twsa t a b t t 0 c cos 2 π t d sin 2 π t e cos 4 π t f sin 4 π t ε where a is the constant term b is the trend term c and d represent the annual cycle variation term e and f represent the semi annual cycle variation term and ε denotes the residuals the six parameters in eq 3 can be determined by the least squares regression method the trend and residual terms can then be linearly interpolated to obtain their values at the beginning of the month and the seasonal term can be calculated from the fitting parameters directly finally the three terms are summed to obtain the twsa at the start point of every month and then the monthly twsc is further calculated according to the following formula 4 twsc t t w s a t 1 t w s a t where twsa t and twsa t 1 represent the twsa at the beginning of month t and month t 1 the third approach is to obtain the twsa directly at the beginning of each month using the reconstruction method the change in the regional water storage over a certain period is equal to the difference between the water input and output during that time the input of water is mainly through precipitation while the output is through et and runoff in this case there is a close relationship between et runoff the output components and temperature this means that the higher the temperature the shorter the residence time of precipitation on the land surface and vice versa therefore a linear statistical model can be developed to represent the relationship between the water outputs and daily water storage and residence time the expression for this relation is as follows 5 twsa t t w s a t 1 e 1 τ t p t where t denotes the daily time series twsa t and p t represent the water storage anomaly and precipitation corresponding to time t and τ t is the residence time at moment t the model is calibrated using grace data the daily interannual and subseasonal twsas in eq 5 are averaged to a monthly time scale that is consistent with the grace month and the grace data are detrended and deseasonalized before calculation the calibration equation is as follows 6 anom g r a c e t m β a n o m t w s a t m ε where β is the calibrated scaling factor ε is the error term and anom indicates the operation of subtracting seasonal and trend terms from the original series according to eq 5 and eq 6 we can reconstruct the daily twsa from 2003 to 2018 with the calibrated parameters then the trend and seasonal terms are gained directly by interpolating the corresponding terms after decomposition of the original grace twsa the above terms are then summed to obtain the daily integral twsa after obtaining the daily twsa the twsc of each month is derived according to eq 4 we use the above three methods to determine the monthly twsc and then calculate the et based on the wbe hereafter the et from these three methods is denoted as etspline etinterp and etrec respectively 3 2 uncertainty quantification based on the tch method the tch method was first proposed by premoli and tavella 1993 and tavella and premoli 1994 compared with the traditional error estimation methods the tch method can evaluate the accuracy of three or more different datasets when the true reference field is unknown in addition this method is insensitive to the systematic biases and error cross correlations contained within the datasets the robustness increases with the number of sequences participating in the calculation liu et al 2021 in this study the three et products obtained from the wbe etspline etinterp etrec and the four et models etpml etnoah etcr etgleam were selected to evaluate their uncertainty at the basin scale according to the tch method the details of the calculation process are as follows in each basin the n n 7 different et sequences are denoted by x i i 1 2 n each sequence can then be split into two components 7 x i x t ε i i 1 2 n where x t denotes the true value of et and ε i is the noise of the ith time series which is a set of white noise with zero mean that is orthogonal to the true signal since the true reference field is unknown an arbitrary sequence is chosen as the reference sequence x n and the difference between the remaining sequences and the reference sequence is defined by the following formula 8 y i n x i x n i 1 2 n 1 where y is an n column matrix with the rows equal to the time samples in this study etrec was chosen as the reference sequence the covariance matrix of y can be denoted as s cov y an n n noise covariance matrix r is then introduced the r matrix is a diagonal matrix with the principal diagonal elements being the square of the uncertainty of each sequence the relationship between the s and r matrices is represented as 9 s j r j t where j is the n 1 n matrix which can be expressed as 10 j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 however the number of unknown parameters in eq 9 is n n 1 2 while the number of equations is n n 1 2 therefore this is an underdetermined equation system and the remaining n free parameters need to be solved in a reasonable way to obtain a unique solution galindo and palacio 1999 proposed an objective function and constraints based on kuhn tucker theory 11 f r 1 n r nn 1 k 2 i j n r ij 2 where k det s n 1 and det s denotes the determinant value of the s matrix the constraint of eq 11 is as follows 12 h r 1 n r nn det r det s k 0 in order to make the initial value fulfill the constraint the initial value of the iterative calculation is set as 13 r in 0 0 i n r nn 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t to minimize the objective function under the constraints the n free parameters can be obtained the r matrix can then be solved and the square root of its principal diagonal elements is the uncertainty of each sequence 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the different water balance based et estimates 4 1 1 comparison of the number of negative et values et as a physical quantity describing water transport from land to the atmosphere should have a constant value that is greater than zero however the uncertainty of the forcing data and the twsa estimates obtained using the water balance method can lead to negative values for the calculated et which was also observed by pan et al 2017 and li et al 2019 therefore the number of negative values can reflect the accuracy of the results to some extent we counted the number of negative values for the three grace derived et sequences in each basin as shown in table 3 both et estimates obtained by interpolation methods are close in the number of negative values while the et results obtained by the reconstruction method have a significant reduction in numbers of negative values overall the number of negative values in etspline accounts for 7 2 of the total samples and this ratio for etinterp is 6 9 whereas the percentage of negative values in etrec is only 2 1 from the perspective of a single basin the highest number of negative values is observed in the srb and mrb accounting for 23 8 and 24 2 of the total negative values respectively in comparison the uyrb and prb show the least number of negative values 4 1 2 comparison of the monthly mean and annual et fig 3 and 4 respectively depict the monthly average et and annual et changes from 2003 to 2018 for the three et estimates since the actual et cannot be negative we first deduct all months that contain negative values in the three methods to calculate the monthly average and annual et however as a comparison we also calculated the monthly mean and annual et for the three et sequences that including all negative values as shown in fig a1 and fig a2 the results estimated with or without the negative values do not differ much in magnitude and fluctuation from the monthly average and annual patterns in terms of the monthly mean et all three estimates show similar seasonal fluctuations however the discrepancies between the three are more notable during summer and early autumn in the prb and mrb when et reaches its peak from fig 3 the et estimates derived from the two interpolation methods fluctuate more in summer and cannot accurately reflect the actual natural variation of et in contrast the et change obtained by the reconstruction method is smoother and more in accordance with the natural tendency li et al 2018 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 similarly for the annual scale et the results of the two interpolation methods exhibit more significant fluctuations however in the humid basins the differences between the annual et of the three estimates are minor i e uyrb myrb mrb while in the arid basins the differences become larger i e yerb srb lrb in addition we also present the monthly average and annual et variation for the four models with the three water balance et methods in fig a3 fig a4 and fig a5 in the appendix from the monthly average results the seasonality of etrec is closer to the four et models among the three water balance based et sequences the differences between the models are mainly found in summer and these differences can be observed more clearly from the annual et among the results the three water balance results differ very little in contrast the differences between the three water balance results and the four models are usually dozens of millimeters or even higher the cr model is at the lowest level in all the basins except the uyrb while the gleam model has the highest estimates in the uyrb myrb prb and mrb 4 2 uncertainty analysis based on the tch method fig 5 shows the root mean square error rmse values of the seven sequences obtained by the tch method in the nine basins here two sets of uncertainties were calculated by considering negative values or not although the two results differ in magnitude they are consistent in distribution which indicates that the negative et values do not affect our conclusions the accuracy of the different estimates varies greatly among the basins etrec shows the lowest uncertainty in the srb lrb and hrb and the second lowest uncertainty in the yerb which demonstrates the reliability and superiority of the reconstruction method the et results obtained by the two interpolation methods have the highest rmse values among the four et models the gleam model outperforms the others in the uyrb myrb prb and mrb the et from gldas 2 1 noah model has the smallest rmse values in the yerb and hurb the cr model has a slightly higher uncertainty in the myrb hrb and hurb which is consistent with the fact that the cr model underestimates the actual et of these basins in addition the gleam model has a larger uncertainty in the srb and lrb than the other three models from a basin perspective all seven sequences other than etrec have the largest uncertainty in the mrb reaching 20 40 mm this is closely followed by the hurb with the rmse in the range of 10 30 mm comparatively the uyrb and yerb have the lowest uncertainties within 10 mm 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the grace derived twsa and twsc in this study the monthly twsc was obtained by three different methods section 3 1 and the et from the wbe was calculated using the same precipitation and runoff data hence the differences in the et results depend mainly on the discrepancies in the grace derived twsc in other words the reduction of negative values by the reconstruction method is mainly related to the twsc to further compare the causes of the negative values in the different cases the precipitation runoff twsc and et for the corresponding months in the basins with relatively large negative et numbers the srb hurb and mrb are mapped in fig a6 fig a8 it is clear from the map that the negative values are mainly observed in winter december to february or late autumn this is comprehensible because both precipitation and runoff are at their lowest levels of the year in winter making this liable to lead to negative results if there is bias in the forcing data the larger negative et values usually correspond to the higher twsc estimates the main cause of the negative values is the uncertainties in the forcing data in which the errors in twsc are dominant as shown in fig a6 fig a7 the twsc estimates are higher than precipitation in most cases which is abnormal and indicates that the calculated twsc contains considerable uncertainty it can be observed clearly from fig a6 fig a8 that etrec has a lower number of negative et than the other two et estimates and the absolute value of negative et in etrec is smaller than the other two which demonstrates the superiority of the reconstruction approach in deriving twsc accurately by comparing with the interpolation method the reconstruction method can reflect the interannual variation of twsa more accurately due to the constraint of precipitation and temperature data furthermore the reconstructed daily twsa can capture twsa changes at a higher temporal resolution resulting in a more accurate monthly twsc estimation before the runoff reaches the hydrological station at the outlet the water that remains in the basin would lead to an increase in tws therefore although this part of water is not observed by the hydrologic station at the outlet it can be captured by grace and reflected in the tws however the monthly grace observations limit the detectability of the twsc within a month instead the daily twsa in this study could capture this short term twsc to some extent according to the model formulation eq 5 the above reasons contribute to a better performance of the reconstruction approach in fig a9 the difference between mean annual et estimates of the two interpolation methods is tiny within 0 5 mm while the difference between the reconstruction and interpolation methods is within 2 mm except for the hrb where it is approximately 7 9 mm the possible explanations for the above discrepancy are i for both cubic spline interpolation and linear interpolation after decomposition of the time series they are just simple data processing methods without any constraint of in situ or physical conditions and if the interpolation period is long e g more than two months or the quality of the grace data before and after the interpolation period is not good this will lead to large uncertainty for the calculated twsc which is also shown by the rmse values in fig 5 and ii the effects of certain anthropogenic factors e g agricultural irrigation reservoir construction may not be captured in the interannual and subseasonal terms reconstructed by precipitation and temperature the above two aspects jointly lead to the difference between the interpolation and reconstruction methods according to the rmses in fig 5 the accuracy of the reconstruction method is much higher than that of the interpolation method to further evaluate the reconstructed daily twsa we performed a comparison in two ways i comparing the reconstructed daily twsa to the daily twsa estimates of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 and kvas et al 2019 fig 6 and ii averaging the reconstructed daily twsa into a monthly time scale according to the same time bounds as the grace month and comparing this with the grace twsa fig 7 in order to maintain consistency with humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the jpl grace rl06 mascon solutions were chosen as the twsa estimates for the reconstruction but the csr mascon data were used for the reconstruction in the calculation of et and the comparison with grace twsa in fig 6 it can be seen that all three twsa estimates maintain good consistency with each other in general moreover we calculated the correlation coefficient r rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse between the twsas of this study and those of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 shown in the upper left corner of the subgraph the r values between the two are above 0 9 and the nse is above 0 8 except for the uyrb yerb and hurb the discrepancy between the two can be attributed to the different forcing datasets specifically humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 used multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep data and era5 air temperature data and we used cgdpa precipitation data and cn05 1 air temperature data in the mainland of china the daily mswep data underestimate the actual precipitation in most cases xu et al 2019 while the cgdpa data based on in situ measurements from 2400 meteorological stations throughout china are more accurate shen and xiong 2016 fig 7 shows a comparison of the reconstructed twsa with the grace twsa after averaging the daily twsa to the monthly scale there is a high consistency between the two with the r value above 0 9 and the nse above 0 8 except for the hurb nevertheless the monthly twsa appears to be smoother because grace can only observe the monthly mean twsa and cannot detect the twsa fluctuations within a month in contrast the reconstructed daily twsa can reflect the variation of twsa within a month to some extent to sum up the reconstructed daily twsa obtained in this study can be considered to be relatively reliable and robust 5 2 accuracy of the four et models the uncertainties of the four models in the nine basins are shown in fig 5 we further calculated the annual changes in the precipitation forcing data from 2003 to 2018 for three models pml v2 gleam and noah fig a10 zhong et al 2020a combining fig a4 and fig a10 when the precipitation data values obtained by one model are markedly higher than the values obtained by the other two models the corresponding et model estimates are also higher and vice versa as for the gldas 2 1 noah model in the srb and lrb the precipitation data values are higher than the results of the other two models and its corresponding et values are also the highest in these two basins the cmfd precipitation data values are lower than the results of the other two models in the uyrb and the pml v2 model forced by these data has the lowest values in the uyrb among the three models this indicates that the model performance is strongly influenced by the precipitation forcing data but in addition it is also dependent on the other types of forcing data and the model algorithms although both the pml v2 and cr models are forced by the cmfd data the pml v2 model uses precipitation from the cmfd data while the cr model uses the downward shortwave radiation longwave radiation etc of cmfd and does not use the precipitation data in addition the two models differ in their processing flow pml v2 calculates the actual global et through the penman monteith equation and the leuning surface conductance model the parameters are then calibrated using data from 95 flux towers distributed globally to obtain the et products with a 500 m spatial resolution and an 8 day temporal resolution zhang et al 2019 the subtle spatial temporal resolution and improved algorithms allow the pml v2 model to capture micro scale changes in surface state and flux so that it can represent et changes with high accuracy the cr model relies solely on routine meteorological data as input without the need for precipitation data or surface vegetation and soil data ma and szilagyi 2019 to avoid time consuming calibration using ground observed data the cr et product was developed in a calibration free mode where a spatially and temporally constant of the model parameter i e the priestley taylor alpha coefficient is set by inversely solving the priestley taylor equation over wet grids ma et al 2019 however the climate condition in china varies greatly across the different regions therefore a constant parameter value may not be optimal in all places of china because of the intricate effect of topography land cover conditions and the resulting atmospheric boundary layer this may be the reason why the cr model performed worse in certain basins in the mrb because the grace data have relatively high uncertainty it causes the rmse values of the seven sequences calculated by the tch method to be biased as a result these values cannot represent the actual accuracy of the four models in the mrb we further evaluated the relative uncertainty of the four models over etrec according to eq 14 and the results are presented in fig 8 in the following equation ru represents the relative uncertainty and e represents the mean of etrec 14 ru rms e k e k 1 2 7 fig 8 describes the performance of the models in terms of the relative magnitude of the error the et errors calculated for all four models and the reconstruction method are within an acceptable range less than 30 in most cases the two interpolation methods result in the highest ru values above 30 indicating that the twsc estimate from grace may still contain relatively high uncertainty which is consistent with the conclusions of long et al 2014 5 3 uncertainty analysis for the typical basins from the perspective of the different basins the highest uncertainty occurs in the hurb and mrb in the hurb the cause of this deviation may be the influence of human factors the hurb is in the transition region between the north and south climates and the land is fertile and suitable for large areas of crop cultivation and irrigation the land use map in fig 2 shows that cropland is the dominant land type in the hurb therefore water resources and et in this basin are highly influenced by agricultural activities according to the data provided by the water resources bulletin of the huaihe river basin in 2018 the hurb had an arable land area of about 221 million acres accounting for about 11 of the national arable land area and its grain production accounted for about one sixth of the total national production providing about one quarter of the country s commodity grain of this 66 of the arable land is harvested twice in a year which results in a substantial amount of water for irrigation zhang et al 2021b the proportion of agricultural irrigation water to total water consumption in the hurb has remained at about 60 for years such a large area of agricultural irrigation can have a significant impact on the twsc we used the method of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 to reconstruct the interannual and subseasonal terms of the twsa which mainly reflect the climate driven twsa variability to compensate for this drawback we used the seasonal and trend terms of grace to derive a daily twsa series the anthropogenic influence is usually more evident in the trend and seasonal terms however in the hurb this effect may also be considerably weighted in the subseasonal and interannual terms thus leading to poor reconstruction results the largest rmse and the lowest nse and r values the cause of the sizable uncertainty in the mrb may be that its area is only 5 5 104 km2 which is smaller than the general resolution of the grace satellite 100 000 km2 the signal amplitude must be large enough to obtain a good signal to noise ratio when using grace data in such a small area e g areas with wet climate and abundant precipitation several previous studies have been conducted with grace data for small scale applications chanu et al 2020 ouma et al 2015 yi et al 2017 this tentatively demonstrates the reliability of grace data for small area applications but it still needs to be applied with caution in practice in addition as shown in fig a8 runoff from the mrb is greater than precipitation in some periods which may be related to the water management of cascade reservoirs in the mrb fujian province water resources bulletin 2018 5 4 limitations of the reconstruction method despite the outperformance of daily twsa in the estimate of basin et it also has several limitations it should be noted that the etrec shows new negative et values in the hurb which is resulted from the worst performance in the reconstruction the reconstructed twsa using precipitation and temperature could only capture climate driven changes humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in most basins using this approach could generate a high quality reconstructed twsa fig 7 however in the hurb it leads to a relatively poorer reconstruction result the uncertainty of the reconstructed results would come from inputs of precipitation temperature and grace twsa precipitation is the only input data in eq 5 in regions where rain gauges are sparse or unavailable the quality of precipitation data is limited the reconstructed twsa would also be unreliable the uncertainty of grace twsa can also have a significant impact on the reconstruction data as mentioned above for the application of grace in basins with small areas large rmse values appeared between the reconstructed twsa and grace twsa e g fig 7h and i although the reconstruction method shows a significant improvement in the estimation of et compared with the other two commonly used interpolation methods its performance also varies widely in different basins 6 conclusions in this study the et of nine exorheic basins in china was derived using the water balance method and from four different et models three different methods of calculating twsc in the wbe were compared we also combine four et models to calculate the uncertainty of different et estimates through the tch method the major findings in this study are summarized as follows i etrec performed the best among the three water balance results in terms of the number of monthly negative et values the magnitude of the uncertainty or the accordance with grace twsa we also found that the interpolation methods did not accurately reflect actual changes in et due to their inherent deficiencies the accuracy of both interpolation methods was similar and their uncertainties were the highest among all seven sequences between the two interpolation methods the decomposition and interpolation method showed a better performance than the cubic spline method the results of tch indicate that the rmse of the reconstruction method is at the optimal or suboptimal level in most basins which adequately shows the reliability of the reconstruction method ii the performance of the four et models noah gleam pml v2 cr in different basins was distinct which is closely related to the structure of the model and the forcing data while the diverse topography and the hydrometeorological conditions between and within basins are also important influences in summary in this paper we have demonstrated how a significant improvement in twsc can be achieved based on the daily precipitation reconstruction method for basin scale et estimation compared to the other methods the precipitation reconstruction method can provide a more accurate twsc estimate for the natural month which represents an important data source for et model evaluation and data assimilation the results and the method presented in this paper will provide a valuable reference for basin et and water cycle research credit authorship

3326,evapotranspiration et is a critical component of the global water cycle but basin scale et is often difficult to accurately estimate due to the limitations of the temporal resolution of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites and coverage period daily or monthly terrestrial water storage tws changes at basin scale are hard to obtain which limits the application of water balance in et estimation to surmount this limitation we established a daily tws anomaly reconstruction framework based on this framework the reconstructed daily tws anomalies twsas were used for the first time to estimate the basin scale et in nine exorheic basins of china furthermore we combined four commonly used et models and tws change twsc derived by two different twsa interpolation methods to evaluate the uncertainty of the different methodologies using the three cornered hat tch approach the results show that i the number of negative values of et from the two twsa interpolation methods is close to each other for the reconstruction method the number of negative values is reduced by about 70 relative to interpolation methods which significantly improves the quality of the et estimates and ii among the seven sequences involved in the tch calculation the two twsa interpolation methods show the largest uncertainty while the reconstruction method has similar or optimal performance to the four et models in all the basins except the huaihe river basin and the minjiang river basin the results of this study demonstrate the superiority of derived twsc based on the reconstruction framework in basin scale et estimation which has a great potential for the application in the quantitative evaluation of et and further assessment of et models keywords evapotranspiration grace water balance terrestrial water storage change 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which consists of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and water surface evaporation is the primary way of water and energy exchange among the hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere oki and kanae 2006 zhang et al 2015 accurate estimation of et is critical for developing energy and water balances at regional to global scales various methods have been used for estimating et such as traditional ground observations land surface model simulation remote sensing and water balance methods wang and dickinson 2012 at the local scale ground based observations e g the bowen ratio energy balance method eddy covariance towers etc are typically used to accurately monitor et hirschi et al 2017 sun et al 2008 zitouna chebbi et al 2018 however ground based observation is expensive and the observations may be sparsely as well as unevenly distributed so that it is unable to meet the needs of et estimation at a basin or global scale at the regional scale et is usually obtained by different kinds of model estimates elbeltagi et al 2021 pan et al 2020 srivastava et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a specifically the et models used in the literature can be broadly classified as 1 fully physically based combination models that account for mass and energy conservation principles 2 semi physically based models that deal with either mass or energy conservation and 3 black box models based on artificial neural networks empirical relationships and fuzzy and genetic algorithms in addition regional et can also be derived from the water balance equation wbe that is precipitation subtracted by net flows and change of terrestrial water storage and it is usually regarded as benchmark values for validating et models rodell et al 2004 yeh et al 1998 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites which were launched in 2002 and their successor the grace follow on grace fo mission are currently the only tools available to obtain twsc at regional or global scales tapley et al 2019 since their launch the grace and grace fo mission has continuously monitored global tws anomalies twsas at a temporal resolution of one month and a spatial resolution of 100 000 km2 300 km 300 km and grace data have been widely used in hydrological glacial and other applications feng et al 2013 ran et al 2018 scanlon et al 2016 with twsc derived from grace observations et can be estimated at the basin scale through wbe regional et estimates from grace based on wbe have been applied in many studies but there are several issues to be resolved before its application the problems are as follows i there is an 11 month gap between grace and grace fo i e july 2017 to may 2018 and several missing months which breaks the continuity of the grace observations and hinders the application of grace data over longer time scales humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 landerer et al 2020 sun et al 2020 ii the twsa from grace is monthly mean value it is non instantaneous value and the twsc estimate with the difference between twsa in two consecutive months is distinct from accumulated monthly precipitation runoff flux li et al 2012 rodell et al 2004 iii the grace month is sometimes non consecutive and varies in length humphrey et al 2016 rodell et al 2004 previous studies tried to solve the above problems with different methods rodell et al 2004 attempts to extract daily hydrological fluxes such as precipitation and runoff by running mean accumulation to a time scale consistent with grace observation periods and then calculates et expressed as mean daily et rates during the middle date of the two consecutive grace month by wbe li et al 2018 proposed an improved method to compute the monthly mean et by introducing generalized cross validation and establishing the relation between the monthly mean et and daily precipitation runoff and tws based on wbe however both of the above methods could only produce monthly mean et for the grace month not the natural month in addition they require daily runoff and precipitation data to calculate et and in areas with few or no gauge stations these high frequency data are hard to obtain thus these methods have some limitations for further application ramillien et al 2006 and long et al 2014 estimate et using a linear approximation of twsc which is one half of the difference in twsa between k 1 and k 1 months rather than using the daily precipitation runoff of rodell et al 2004 the missing values of twsa are simply interpolated from the previous and the next months in addition li et al 2019 integrated atmospheric and terrestrial water balance results as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of three remote sensing et datasets and a land surface model in the tibetan plateau headwaters region the grace derived twsc was computed as the backward difference of twsa zhong et al 2020a investigated the impact of considering twsc in the water balance calculation for et estimation and evaluated the performance of the gldas noah and global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam models in nine exorheic basins in china using the water balance method as a benchmark the twscs in the above two studies were obtained by interpolation of twsa which may lead to amplification of the error in the grace data an improved estimate of twsc based on reconstructed daily twsa was proposed to solve the above problems in et estimate from grace in this study humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 used a statistical method to train the grace data and the corresponding meteorological data and reconstructed the tws prior to 2002 this approach presents a new sight to calculate twsa but it can only reconstruct de trended and de seasonalized twsa to address this limitation we propose a new framework to reconstruct the integral daily twsa based on the statistical model we used this framework to reconstruct the daily twsas for 2003 2018 and further applied them to the wbe to calculate the et in nine exorheic basins of china then we use the three cornered hat tch method to evaluate the uncertainty of the derived et long et al 2014 long et al 2017 therefore the objectives of this study were i to reconstruct the daily twsa and provide a new twsc estimate in et calculation and ii to evaluate the reliability of the reconstruction method by combining two twsc interpolation approaches and four et models i e the penman monteith leuning version 2 model pml v2 the gldas 2 1 noah land surface model the complementary

latitude range of 21 52 n i e the upper yangtze river basin uyrb the middle yangtze river basin myrb the yellow river basin yerb the songhuajiang river basin srb the pearl river basin prb the liaohe river basin lrb the haihe river basin hrb the huaihe river basin hurb and the minjiang river basin mrb the boundaries of the nine basins were generated from data of 11 hydrological gauge stations from the china river sediment bulletin combined with a digital elevation model zhong et al 2020a the total area of the nine basins is about 388 33 104 km2 and together they account for 40 5 of the land area of china due to the vast area there are various climate patterns and different degrees of human activity in the study area it should be noted that the prb contains three hydrological gauge stations gaoyao shijiao and boluo the distribution of the basins and the hydrological stations is shown in fig 2 and their detailed information is provided in table 1 2 2 datasets in this study the observed precipitation data the grace based twsas and in situ runoff data were used to calculate the et by the wbe please refer to table 2 for an overview of all the datasets all the gridded data were extracted to the basin scale by area weighting and then integrated into a monthly time scale by summing or averaging to maintain consistency with the grace data 2 2 1 grace derived twsas in this work the latest release of the grace mascon solutions rl06 offered by the center for space research csr were used to reconstruct the daily twsas and calculate the et from 2003 to 2018 this dataset can be used in applications such as hydrology and oceanography without any post processing we refer the reader to save et al 2016 for full details of the data processing steps the jpl released grace rl06 mascon solutions the itsg grace2018 gravity field solutions and the reconstructed global twsas published by humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 were used for the validation the jpl mascon solutions were constrained by the grace observations and the priori geophysical model information the spatial resolution of the jpl product was transformed from 3 3 to 1 1 by using the downscaling factors calculated from the community land model lawrence et al 2019 and then resampled to 0 5 0 5 itsg grace2018 is derived from grace level 1b data and the latest atmosphere and ocean de aliasing level 1b product compared with the old version the data processing flow and error modeling are greatly improved humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 reconstructed the twsas based on the daily precipitation latency effect at a long time scale this dataset was compared with the reconstructed data obtained in this study to verify the accuracy of the reconstruction results 2 2 2 precipitation and temperature data two precipitation datasets the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa dataset and the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd were used in this study the cmfd data were used to calculate the et while the daily cgdpa data were used to reconstruct the daily twsas the coverage area of cmfd is the mainland of china for further details about this dataset we refer the reader to he et al 2020 and yang et al 2010 the cgdpa dataset was derived from daily precipitation records of about 2400 national meteorological stations in china the dataset was interpolated by the thin plate spline method in the context of the climate background field in china and has undergone strict topographic correction and quality control shen and xiong 2016 as a result it can capture the spatiotemporal distribution features of precipitation effectively and has valuable application potential in the study of meteorology and hydrology long et al 2020 the daily temperature in the cn05 1 dataset was based on observations from 2400 chinese meteorological stations the data processing procedures were 1 the average climate field was interpolated by the thin plate spline method 2 the climate anomaly field was interpolated using the angular distance weighting method and 3 the two were superimposed to obtain the final data wu and gao 2013 this dataset has potential applications in studies of climate change agriculture and ecology wu et al 2017 2 2 3 runoff data the monthly runoff data from 11 hydrological stations were obtained from the river sediment bulletin of china it should be mentioned that the net outflow runoff of the myrb equals the difference between datong and yichang and the runoff of the prb is the sum of gaoyao shijiao and boluo to maintain consistency with the grace data we converted the runoff in cubic meters to the equivalent water height in millimeters 2 2 4 modeled et data in this study four et models i e pml v2 noah cr and gleam were utilized hereafter referred to as etpml etnoah etcr and etgleam different model selection criteria and evaluation metrics have been investigated in previous studies banimahd et al 2015 kumari et al 2021 according to these studies we selected these four models from the existing et models by considering the model complexity access difficulty spatial and temporal resolution applicability and adaptability all four models have a spatial resolution better than 0 5 a temporal resolution better than one month and a time span close to or covering the study period 2003 2018 in addition both the cr and pml models are developed for the china region the data for all four models are available online and widely used in several studies yin et al 2021 yin et al 2018 the pml v2 dataset in this study is forced by cmfd pml v2 couples the gross primary productivity gpp process based on the penman monteith leuning model with stomatal conductance theory gpp and et are mutually constrained and limited resulting in the pml v2 model representing a great improvement in et estimation accuracy compared to previous models the gldas 2 1 noah dataset has been forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to the present the monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of the gldas 2 1 noah 3 hourly data rui and beaudoing 2018 the cr dataset is a product of chinese surface et based on a complementary approach it relies only on the input of meteorological data and does not require complex calibration the gleam model which was published jointly by vrije universiteit amsterdam and ghent university uses a series of algorithms to estimate the different components of et i e vegetation transpiration evaporation from bare soil sublimation evaporation from water bodies and interception loss the reason for using these four components was to minimize the loss of et information obtained from satellite observations martens et al 2017 for more details about these four et models please see the references in table 2 3 methods 3 1 water balance based et estimation the wbe describes the dynamic balance of the water cycle at a regional scale at the basin scale it can be represented as the following equation 1 et p q ds dt where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation q is streamflow and ds dt is the changes in tws over a specific period of time e g one month based on the above equation the monthly et can be derived from the basin scale precipitation twsc and runoff twsc is the difference between the twsas at the beginning of two consecutive months three different methods were used to calculate twsc in this study since there is a gap of almost one year between grace and grace fo filling this gap directly by interpolation would bring more error so the dataset of reconstructed twsa for the gap built by zhong et al 2020b was used to fill the grace sequence before interpolation the calculation procedures for the three methods are as follows the first method involves obtaining the twsa at the middle of each month directly using cubic spline interpolation the difference between the twsas of the third month and the first month is then divided by two to obtain the twsc of the second month long et al 2014 this can be expressed as 2 twsc t twsa t 1 t w s a t 1 2 where t represents the time in months the second method involves first decomposing the time series and then interpolating it zhong et al 2020a the twsas contain a long term trend term a seasonal term and a residual term humphrey et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 the corresponding signals can be isolated using a least squares fit with the following expression 3 twsa t a b t t 0 c cos 2 π t d sin 2 π t e cos 4 π t f sin 4 π t ε where a is the constant term b is the trend term c and d represent the annual cycle variation term e and f represent the semi annual cycle variation term and ε denotes the residuals the six parameters in eq 3 can be determined by the least squares regression method the trend and residual terms can then be linearly interpolated to obtain their values at the beginning of the month and the seasonal term can be calculated from the fitting parameters directly finally the three terms are summed to obtain the twsa at the start point of every month and then the monthly twsc is further calculated according to the following formula 4 twsc t t w s a t 1 t w s a t where twsa t and twsa t 1 represent the twsa at the beginning of month t and month t 1 the third approach is to obtain the twsa directly at the beginning of each month using the reconstruction method the change in the regional water storage over a certain period is equal to the difference between the water input and output during that time the input of water is mainly through precipitation while the output is through et and runoff in this case there is a close relationship between et runoff the output components and temperature this means that the higher the temperature the shorter the residence time of precipitation on the land surface and vice versa therefore a linear statistical model can be developed to represent the relationship between the water outputs and daily water storage and residence time the expression for this relation is as follows 5 twsa t t w s a t 1 e 1 τ t p t where t denotes the daily time series twsa t and p t represent the water storage anomaly and precipitation corresponding to time t and τ t is the residence time at moment t the model is calibrated using grace data the daily interannual and subseasonal twsas in eq 5 are averaged to a monthly time scale that is consistent with the grace month and the grace data are detrended and deseasonalized before calculation the calibration equation is as follows 6 anom g r a c e t m β a n o m t w s a t m ε where β is the calibrated scaling factor ε is the error term and anom indicates the operation of subtracting seasonal and trend terms from the original series according to eq 5 and eq 6 we can reconstruct the daily twsa from 2003 to 2018 with the calibrated parameters then the trend and seasonal terms are gained directly by interpolating the corresponding terms after decomposition of the original grace twsa the above terms are then summed to obtain the daily integral twsa after obtaining the daily twsa the twsc of each month is derived according to eq 4 we use the above three methods to determine the monthly twsc and then calculate the et based on the wbe hereafter the et from these three methods is denoted as etspline etinterp and etrec respectively 3 2 uncertainty quantification based on the tch method the tch method was first proposed by premoli and tavella 1993 and tavella and premoli 1994 compared with the traditional error estimation methods the tch method can evaluate the accuracy of three or more different datasets when the true reference field is unknown in addition this method is insensitive to the systematic biases and error cross correlations contained within the datasets the robustness increases with the number of sequences participating in the calculation liu et al 2021 in this study the three et products obtained from the wbe etspline etinterp etrec and the four et models etpml etnoah etcr etgleam were selected to evaluate their uncertainty at the basin scale according to the tch method the details of the calculation process are as follows in each basin the n n 7 different et sequences are denoted by x i i 1 2 n each sequence can then be split into two components 7 x i x t ε i i 1 2 n where x t denotes the true value of et and ε i is the noise of the ith time series which is a set of white noise with zero mean that is orthogonal to the true signal since the true reference field is unknown an arbitrary sequence is chosen as the reference sequence x n and the difference between the remaining sequences and the reference sequence is defined by the following formula 8 y i n x i x n i 1 2 n 1 where y is an n column matrix with the rows equal to the time samples in this study etrec was chosen as the reference sequence the covariance matrix of y can be denoted as s cov y an n n noise covariance matrix r is then introduced the r matrix is a diagonal matrix with the principal diagonal elements being the square of the uncertainty of each sequence the relationship between the s and r matrices is represented as 9 s j r j t where j is the n 1 n matrix which can be expressed as 10 j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 however the number of unknown parameters in eq 9 is n n 1 2 while the number of equations is n n 1 2 therefore this is an underdetermined equation system and the remaining n free parameters need to be solved in a reasonable way to obtain a unique solution galindo and palacio 1999 proposed an objective function and constraints based on kuhn tucker theory 11 f r 1 n r nn 1 k 2 i j n r ij 2 where k det s n 1 and det s denotes the determinant value of the s matrix the constraint of eq 11 is as follows 12 h r 1 n r nn det r det s k 0 in order to make the initial value fulfill the constraint the initial value of the iterative calculation is set as 13 r in 0 0 i n r nn 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t to minimize the objective function under the constraints the n free parameters can be obtained the r matrix can then be solved and the square root of its principal diagonal elements is the uncertainty of each sequence 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the different water balance based et estimates 4 1 1 comparison of the number of negative et values et as a physical quantity describing water transport from land to the atmosphere should have a constant value that is greater than zero however the uncertainty of the forcing data and the twsa estimates obtained using the water balance method can lead to negative values for the calculated et which was also observed by pan et al 2017 and li et al 2019 therefore the number of negative values can reflect the accuracy of the results to some extent we counted the number of negative values for the three grace derived et sequences in each basin as shown in table 3 both et estimates obtained by interpolation methods are close in the number of negative values while the et results obtained by the reconstruction method have a significant reduction in numbers of negative values overall the number of negative values in etspline accounts for 7 2 of the total samples and this ratio for etinterp is 6 9 whereas the percentage of negative values in etrec is only 2 1 from the perspective of a single basin the highest number of negative values is observed in the srb and mrb accounting for 23 8 and 24 2 of the total negative values respectively in comparison the uyrb and prb show the least number of negative values 4 1 2 comparison of the monthly mean and annual et fig 3 and 4 respectively depict the monthly average et and annual et changes from 2003 to 2018 for the three et estimates since the actual et cannot be negative we first deduct all months that contain negative values in the three methods to calculate the monthly average and annual et however as a comparison we also calculated the monthly mean and annual et for the three et sequences that including all negative values as shown in fig a1 and fig a2 the results estimated with or without the negative values do not differ much in magnitude and fluctuation from the monthly average and annual patterns in terms of the monthly mean et all three estimates show similar seasonal fluctuations however the discrepancies between the three are more notable during summer and early autumn in the prb and mrb when et reaches its peak from fig 3 the et estimates derived from the two interpolation methods fluctuate more in summer and cannot accurately reflect the actual natural variation of et in contrast the et change obtained by the reconstruction method is smoother and more in accordance with the natural tendency li et al 2018 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 similarly for the annual scale et the results of the two interpolation methods exhibit more significant fluctuations however in the humid basins the differences between the annual et of the three estimates are minor i e uyrb myrb mrb while in the arid basins the differences become larger i e yerb srb lrb in addition we also present the monthly average and annual et variation for the four models with the three water balance et methods in fig a3 fig a4 and fig a5 in the appendix from the monthly average results the seasonality of etrec is closer to the four et models among the three water balance based et sequences the differences between the models are mainly found in summer and these differences can be observed more clearly from the annual et among the results the three water balance results differ very little in contrast the differences between the three water balance results and the four models are usually dozens of millimeters or even higher the cr model is at the lowest level in all the basins except the uyrb while the gleam model has the highest estimates in the uyrb myrb prb and mrb 4 2 uncertainty analysis based on the tch method fig 5 shows the root mean square error rmse values of the seven sequences obtained by the tch method in the nine basins here two sets of uncertainties were calculated by considering negative values or not although the two results differ in magnitude they are consistent in distribution which indicates that the negative et values do not affect our conclusions the accuracy of the different estimates varies greatly among the basins etrec shows the lowest uncertainty in the srb lrb and hrb and the second lowest uncertainty in the yerb which demonstrates the reliability and superiority of the reconstruction method the et results obtained by the two interpolation methods have the highest rmse values among the four et models the gleam model outperforms the others in the uyrb myrb prb and mrb the et from gldas 2 1 noah model has the smallest rmse values in the yerb and hurb the cr model has a slightly higher uncertainty in the myrb hrb and hurb which is consistent with the fact that the cr model underestimates the actual et of these basins in addition the gleam model has a larger uncertainty in the srb and lrb than the other three models from a basin perspective all seven sequences other than etrec have the largest uncertainty in the mrb reaching 20 40 mm this is closely followed by the hurb with the rmse in the range of 10 30 mm comparatively the uyrb and yerb have the lowest uncertainties within 10 mm 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the grace derived twsa and twsc in this study the monthly twsc was obtained by three different methods section 3 1 and the et from the wbe was calculated using the same precipitation and runoff data hence the differences in the et results depend mainly on the discrepancies in the grace derived twsc in other words the reduction of negative values by the reconstruction method is mainly related to the twsc to further compare the causes of the negative values in the different cases the precipitation runoff twsc and et for the corresponding months in the basins with relatively large negative et numbers the srb hurb and mrb are mapped in fig a6 fig a8 it is clear from the map that the negative values are mainly observed in winter december to february or late autumn this is comprehensible because both precipitation and runoff are at their lowest levels of the year in winter making this liable to lead to negative results if there is bias in the forcing data the larger negative et values usually correspond to the higher twsc estimates the main cause of the negative values is the uncertainties in the forcing data in which the errors in twsc are dominant as shown in fig a6 fig a7 the twsc estimates are higher than precipitation in most cases which is abnormal and indicates that the calculated twsc contains considerable uncertainty it can be observed clearly from fig a6 fig a8 that etrec has a lower number of negative et than the other two et estimates and the absolute value of negative et in etrec is smaller than the other two which demonstrates the superiority of the reconstruction approach in deriving twsc accurately by comparing with the interpolation method the reconstruction method can reflect the interannual variation of twsa more accurately due to the constraint of precipitation and temperature data furthermore the reconstructed daily twsa can capture twsa changes at a higher temporal resolution resulting in a more accurate monthly twsc estimation before the runoff reaches the hydrological station at the outlet the water that remains in the basin would lead to an increase in tws therefore although this part of water is not observed by the hydrologic station at the outlet it can be captured by grace and reflected in the tws however the monthly grace observations limit the detectability of the twsc within a month instead the daily twsa in this study could capture this short term twsc to some extent according to the model formulation eq 5 the above reasons contribute to a better performance of the reconstruction approach in fig a9 the difference between mean annual et estimates of the two interpolation methods is tiny within 0 5 mm while the difference between the reconstruction and interpolation methods is within 2 mm except for the hrb where it is approximately 7 9 mm the possible explanations for the above discrepancy are i for both cubic spline interpolation and linear interpolation after decomposition of the time series they are just simple data processing methods without any constraint of in situ or physical conditions and if the interpolation period is long e g more than two months or the quality of the grace data before and after the interpolation period is not good this will lead to large uncertainty for the calculated twsc which is also shown by the rmse values in fig 5 and ii the effects of certain anthropogenic factors e g agricultural irrigation reservoir construction may not be captured in the interannual and subseasonal terms reconstructed by precipitation and temperature the above two aspects jointly lead to the difference between the interpolation and reconstruction methods according to the rmses in fig 5 the accuracy of the reconstruction method is much higher than that of the interpolation method to further evaluate the reconstructed daily twsa we performed a comparison in two ways i comparing the reconstructed daily twsa to the daily twsa estimates of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 and kvas et al 2019 fig 6 and ii averaging the reconstructed daily twsa into a monthly time scale according to the same time bounds as the grace month and comparing this with the grace twsa fig 7 in order to maintain consistency with humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the jpl grace rl06 mascon solutions were chosen as the twsa estimates for the reconstruction but the csr mascon data were used for the reconstruction in the calculation of et and the comparison with grace twsa in fig 6 it can be seen that all three twsa estimates maintain good consistency with each other in general moreover we calculated the correlation coefficient r rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse between the twsas of this study and those of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 shown in the upper left corner of the subgraph the r values between the two are above 0 9 and the nse is above 0 8 except for the uyrb yerb and hurb the discrepancy between the two can be attributed to the different forcing datasets specifically humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 used multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep data and era5 air temperature data and we used cgdpa precipitation data and cn05 1 air temperature data in the mainland of china the daily mswep data underestimate the actual precipitation in most cases xu et al 2019 while the cgdpa data based on in situ measurements from 2400 meteorological stations throughout china are more accurate shen and xiong 2016 fig 7 shows a comparison of the reconstructed twsa with the grace twsa after averaging the daily twsa to the monthly scale there is a high consistency between the two with the r value above 0 9 and the nse above 0 8 except for the hurb nevertheless the monthly twsa appears to be smoother because grace can only observe the monthly mean twsa and cannot detect the twsa fluctuations within a month in contrast the reconstructed daily twsa can reflect the variation of twsa within a month to some extent to sum up the reconstructed daily twsa obtained in this study can be considered to be relatively reliable and robust 5 2 accuracy of the four et models the uncertainties of the four models in the nine basins are shown in fig 5 we further calculated the annual changes in the precipitation forcing data from 2003 to 2018 for three models pml v2 gleam and noah fig a10 zhong et al 2020a combining fig a4 and fig a10 when the precipitation data values obtained by one model are markedly higher than the values obtained by the other two models the corresponding et model estimates are also higher and vice versa as for the gldas 2 1 noah model in the srb and lrb the precipitation data values are higher than the results of the other two models and its corresponding et values are also the highest in these two basins the cmfd precipitation data values are lower than the results of the other two models in the uyrb and the pml v2 model forced by these data has the lowest values in the uyrb among the three models this indicates that the model performance is strongly influenced by the precipitation forcing data but in addition it is also dependent on the other types of forcing data and the model algorithms although both the pml v2 and cr models are forced by the cmfd data the pml v2 model uses precipitation from the cmfd data while the cr model uses the downward shortwave radiation longwave radiation etc of cmfd and does not use the precipitation data in addition the two models differ in their processing flow pml v2 calculates the actual global et through the penman monteith equation and the leuning surface conductance model the parameters are then calibrated using data from 95 flux towers distributed globally to obtain the et products with a 500 m spatial resolution and an 8 day temporal resolution zhang et al 2019 the subtle spatial temporal resolution and improved algorithms allow the pml v2 model to capture micro scale changes in surface state and flux so that it can represent et changes with high accuracy the cr model relies solely on routine meteorological data as input without the need for precipitation data or surface vegetation and soil data ma and szilagyi 2019 to avoid time consuming calibration using ground observed data the cr et product was developed in a calibration free mode where a spatially and temporally constant of the model parameter i e the priestley taylor alpha coefficient is set by inversely solving the priestley taylor equation over wet grids ma et al 2019 however the climate condition in china varies greatly across the different regions therefore a constant parameter value may not be optimal in all places of china because of the intricate effect of topography land cover conditions and the resulting atmospheric boundary layer this may be the reason why the cr model performed worse in certain basins in the mrb because the grace data have relatively high uncertainty it causes the rmse values of the seven sequences calculated by the tch method to be biased as a result these values cannot represent the actual accuracy of the four models in the mrb we further evaluated the relative uncertainty of the four models over etrec according to eq 14 and the results are presented in fig 8 in the following equation ru represents the relative uncertainty and e represents the mean of etrec 14 ru rms e k e k 1 2 7 fig 8 describes the performance of the models in terms of the relative magnitude of the error the et errors calculated for all four models and the reconstruction method are within an acceptable range less than 30 in most cases the two interpolation methods result in the highest ru values above 30 indicating that the twsc estimate from grace may still contain relatively high uncertainty which is consistent with the conclusions of long et al 2014 5 3 uncertainty analysis for the typical basins from the perspective of the different basins the highest uncertainty occurs in the hurb and mrb in the hurb the cause of this deviation may be the influence of human factors the hurb is in the transition region between the north and south climates and the land is fertile and suitable for large areas of crop cultivation and irrigation the land use map in fig 2 shows that cropland is the dominant land type in the hurb therefore water resources and et in this basin are highly influenced by agricultural activities according to the data provided by the water resources bulletin of the huaihe river basin in 2018 the hurb had an arable land area of about 221 million acres accounting for about 11 of the national arable land area and its grain production accounted for about one sixth of the total national production providing about one quarter of the country s commodity grain of this 66 of the arable land is harvested twice in a year which results in a substantial amount of water for irrigation zhang et al 2021b the proportion of agricultural irrigation water to total water consumption in the hurb has remained at about 60 for years such a large area of agricultural irrigation can have a significant impact on the twsc we used the method of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 to reconstruct the interannual and subseasonal terms of the twsa which mainly reflect the climate driven twsa variability to compensate for this drawback we used the seasonal and trend terms of grace to derive a daily twsa series the anthropogenic influence is usually more evident in the trend and seasonal terms however in the hurb this effect may also be considerably weighted in the subseasonal and interannual terms thus leading to poor reconstruction results the largest rmse and the lowest nse and r values the cause of the sizable uncertainty in the mrb may be that its area is only 5 5 104 km2 which is smaller than the general resolution of the grace satellite 100 000 km2 the signal amplitude must be large enough to obtain a good signal to noise ratio when using grace data in such a small area e g areas with wet climate and abundant precipitation several previous studies have been conducted with grace data for small scale applications chanu et al 2020 ouma et al 2015 yi et al 2017 this tentatively demonstrates the reliability of grace data for small area applications but it still needs to be applied with caution in practice in addition as shown in fig a8 runoff from the mrb is greater than precipitation in some periods which may be related to the water management of cascade reservoirs in the mrb fujian province water resources bulletin 2018 5 4 limitations of the reconstruction method despite the outperformance of daily twsa in the estimate of basin et it also has several limitations it should be noted that the etrec shows new negative et values in the hurb which is resulted from the worst performance in the reconstruction the reconstructed twsa using precipitation and temperature could only capture climate driven changes humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in most basins using this approach could generate a high quality reconstructed twsa fig 7 however in the hurb it leads to a relatively poorer reconstruction result the uncertainty of the reconstructed results would come from inputs of precipitation temperature and grace twsa precipitation is the only input data in eq 5 in regions where rain gauges are sparse or unavailable the quality of precipitation data is limited the reconstructed twsa would also be unreliable the uncertainty of grace twsa can also have a significant impact on the reconstruction data as mentioned above for the application of grace in basins with small areas large rmse values appeared between the reconstructed twsa and grace twsa e g fig 7h and i although the reconstruction method shows a significant improvement in the estimation of et compared with the other two commonly used interpolation methods its performance also varies widely in different basins 6 conclusions in this study the et of nine exorheic basins in china was derived using the water balance method and from four different et models three different methods of calculating twsc in the wbe were compared we also combine four et models to calculate the uncertainty of different et estimates through the tch method the major findings in this study are summarized as follows i etrec performed the best among the three water balance results in terms of the number of monthly negative et values the magnitude of the uncertainty or the accordance with grace twsa we also found that the interpolation methods did not accurately reflect actual changes in et due to their inherent deficiencies the accuracy of both interpolation methods was similar and their uncertainties were the highest among all seven sequences between the two interpolation methods the decomposition and interpolation method showed a better performance than the cubic spline method the results of tch indicate that the rmse of the reconstruction method is at the optimal or suboptimal level in most basins which adequately shows the reliability of the reconstruction method ii the performance of the four et models noah gleam pml v2 cr in different basins was distinct which is closely related to the structure of the model and the forcing data while the diverse topography and the hydrometeorological conditions between and within basins are also important influences in summary in this paper we have demonstrated how a significant improvement in twsc can be achieved based on the daily precipitation reconstruction method for basin scale et estimation compared to the other methods the precipitation reconstruction method can provide a more accurate twsc estimate for the natural month which represents an important data source for et model evaluation and data assimilation the results and the method presented in this paper will provide a valuable reference for basin et and water cycle research credit authorship

3327,lakes play an important role in global hydrologically and provide substantial water resources in hyperarid regions and they are becoming even more significant as climate change impacts hydrological processes especially in these sensitive regions this study proposes a lake monitoring framework that uses multisource satellite data to automatically estimate the spatiotemporal variations from 1987 to 2020 of lake area lake water level and lake water storage lws in the qaidam basin qb which is a typical hyperarid basin in northwest china the global surface water dataset provides long time series data for lake areas multisource satellite images landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 2 and altimetry data cryosat 2 icesat icesat 2 sentinel 3 are used to build hypsometric curves the fit to the curve of lake area vs lake water level to reconstruct lake water level before the 21st century in contrast with traditional methods we propose to verify the construction of a hypsometric curve to select a reasonable curve and thereby improve the accuracy of the extrapolation of lake water level on this basis we estimated the variation of lws from 1987 to 2020 and to use products of the gravity recovery and climate experiment and of land surface model simulations to estimate the variation in total lws in the qb for comparative analysis the results show that the total lws in the qb has increased by 82 63 over the past 33 years compared with the mean value from 2004 to 2009 the total lws in 2020 increased by 4 41 km3 which is equivalent to 12 53 19 49 of the increase in terrestrial water storage this ratio cannot be ignored the analysis of spatiotemporal variations in lakes shows that large shallow lakes are disappearing leading to ecological deterioration in some areas conversely there is increased water storage in small deep lakes which may be beneficial for water conservation in hyperarid basins in conclusion the proposed automated processing program should facilitate the rapid monitoring of lake dynamics around the world we emphasize that the variation of lake water storage in hyperarid basins cannot be ignored which should stimulate more relevant research keywords multisource satellite data lakes spatiotemporal variations qaidam basin long term changes 1 introduction lakes are an important part of the terrestrial hydrosphere there are more than 1 42 million lakes in the world accounting for about 1 8 of earth s land surface area messager et al 2016 lakes connect the layers of earth s surface system yechieli et al 1995 and have the special functions of regulating regional climate recording regional environmental changes and maintaining the balance of regional ecosystems and of the diversity of derivatives woolway and merchant 2019 the formation disappearance expansion and contraction of lakes all depend on regional and global climate change especially in hyperarid basins cao et al 2021 in hyperarid basins water resources are scarce and the ecological environment is very fragile panahi et al 2020 in particular the qaidam basin qb in the northeast part of the tibetan plateau tp has an extremely dry climate with scarce precipitation and serious desertification wang and qin 2017 recent studies have shown that the warming rate 0 53 c 10a of the basin greatly exceeds that of other basins on the tp wang et al 2014 making it now a typical region for studying the effects of global climate change lakes are a sensitive indicator of climate change adrian et al 2009 zhang and duan 2021 and are widespread in the qb which contains the world s densest set of salt lakes yang et al 2017 all fed by glacial meltwater from the surrounding mountains therefore variations in lake water levels reflect the water balance of the entire basin and even the climate variations of the tp and by extension of the world legesse et al 2004 in addition the qb is known as a cornucopia because the lakes within it contain significant mineral resources han et al 2021 which are almost the only available resources for economic and social development in areas with poor soil water scarcity constrains the development of resources in the qb especially salt lake resources zhao et al 2021 therefore monitoring the lakes in this basin is useful not only to understand the process of global climate change but also for the sustainable development of the local economy and ecology unfortunately the complex terrain and harsh climate of the basin prevent the application of traditional methods to monitor spatiotemporal variations in lake water level which relies on ground stations lei et al 2018 qiao et al 2019a remote sensing provides a feasible means to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of lakes on a large scale dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 lake area and water level are the most direct indexes to reflect lake fluctuation by using nasa s open access optical imagery lake area can be easily and quickly captured which facilitates the generation of a series of long term datasets of lake area two examples are the global surface water gsw dataset published by pekel et al 2016 and the global lake and reservoir dataset constructed by yao et al 2019 these datasets have been used in numerous investigations into lake area busker et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b resulting in outstanding contributions to the study of global lake area over the past 40 years however few studies have focused on long term changes in lake water levels dettmering et al 2020 because altimeter satellites which are commonly used to monitor lake water levels e g cryosat 2 jiang et al 2017 icesat zhang et al 2011 icesat 2 yuan et al 2020 and sentinel 3 xu et al 2022 only offer data since 2003 earlier altimetry missions such as topex poseidon fu et al 1994 envisat tourian et al 2013 and jason lambin et al 2010 had low transorbital resolution and were mostly used to monitor polar ice caps and sea levels rather than lake water level in addition due to the limitation of altimetry satellite orbit configuration dettmering et al 2020 almost no fixed and continuous observation records exist for single lakes therefore long term continuous monitoring of lake levels is difficult a hypsometric curve is a function that represents the relationship between lake area and water level and is used to predict lake water levels in the absence of satellite altimeter observations extrapolating lake water level vickers et al 2019 as early as 1952 strahler 1952 established the hypsometric curve to determine the geological maturity of a region on this basis håkanson 1977 introduced the hypsometric curve to lake research and changed the concavity of the curve by adjusting parameters of the basic type of function to adapt to the topographic variations of different lakes similar studies have continued to this day and a series of lake water level products represented by dahiti schwatke et al 2015 have been derived currently ordinary least squares ols regression kilmer and rodríguez 2017 is a commonly used method to construct hypsometric curves it seeks the optimal relationship between lake area and water level by minimizing the sum of squares of errors previous reports have used linear polynomial exponential and logarithmic curves to describe lakes busker et al 2019 weekley and li 2021 yao et al 2018 the optimal hypsometric curve has the maximum r2 minimum root mean square error rmse and increases monotonically but this only indicates the best fit to the data it cannot prove the optimality of the hypsometric curve when extrapolating lake water level therefore a verification process must be added to select the hypsometric curve most suitable for extrapolation however few studies have taken this into account this paper discusses the problem in detail and proposes a new verification method to select the optimal hypsometric curve and ensure an accurate extrapolation of the curve the variation in lake water storage lws is very important for an accurate assessment of the impacts of climate change and of the hydrological environment in hyperarid basins wang and qin 2017 however the lws of the qb a typical hyperarid basin has received little attention on the contrary groundwater and terrestrial water storage tws have become research hotspots for example bibi et al 2019 calculated groundwater and analyzed its response to climate change based on the water balance equation wei et al 2021 analyzed variations in tws in the qb derived from meteorological data and from products of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace these studies provide valuable data and methods for understanding the water cycle in the qb but the contribution of lakes is ignored without exception these previous works all follow the conclusions of jiao et al 2015 that variations in lws only account for 1 1 of tws variations however jiao et al only considered variations in seven small and medium sized lakes and ignored many lakes ignoring the lws in the qb will inevitably lead to miscalculations of other water resources which will have serious consequences it can also cause researchers to lose track of variations in lws in this basin and to not recognize climate processes in typical hyperarid basins therefore a comprehensive estimate of variations in lws is required to understand the composition of water resources in the qb and to provide accurate data for subsequent research the present study thus combines multisource remote sensing data to estimate and analyze the spatiotemporal variations in lake area lake water level and lws in the arid area of the qb over the last 30 years the study accomplishes four major tasks i all lakes with a surface area greater than 10 km2 from 1987 to 2020 are investigated and their long term trends are analyzed sections 4 1 and 5 2 ii we reconstruct lake water levels from 1987 to 2020 and propose a new method to verify the rationality of lake water levels extrapolated from hypsometric curves sections 4 2 and 5 3 iii we estimate and discuss the spatiotemporal variations in lws for 16 major lakes from 1987 to 2020 and re evaluate the fractional variation of the total lws with respect to the tws sections 4 3 5 1 and 5 2 iv we discuss the limitations and prospects of lws estimation methods in this study and in other studies section 5 4 this study thus provides a method and theory for comprehensive monitoring of lake dynamics the variations in lws highlight the importance of lakes in water resources research and break the stereotype of water composition within the qb which should lead to a new benchmark for studying water resources in the qb and provide a reference for water resource research in other basins 2 study area the qaidam basin qb 34 37 57 39 18 42 n 90 27 56 99 25 51 e is a huge tectonic subsidence basin in the northeastern part of the tp fig 1 it is about 800 km long from east to west and 300 km wide from north to south with a total area of 276 000 km2 the basin is surrounded by the kunlun mountains to the south the qilian mountains in the northeast and the qimantage and aerjin mountains in the northwest the highest lowest elevation of the basin is 6826 m 2676 3200 m the basin is one of the world s most arid inland basins with a dry climate and scarce precipitation precipitation decreases in going from the surrounding areas to the center of the basin annual precipitation in the surrounding mountainous areas ranges from 150 to 300 mm and less than 50 mm in the center of the basin with only 25 mm in the northwest the evaporation capacity in this basin exceeds 1800 mm jia et al 2011 the region contains 30 lakes with an area greater than 10 km2 the terminal lakes labeled in red in fig 1 are mainly in the center of the basin e g dabuxun senie beihuobuxun nanhuobuxun they are at the end of rivers and are fed by glacier meltwater from the surrounding mountains the lake water is highly concentrated and mineralized because there is no outflow and strong evaporation yang et al 2017 the overflow lakes labeled in blue in fig 1 have seasonal inflow and outflow and contain significant freshwater resources these are mainly distributed to the north of the kunlun mountains at elevations of more than 4000 m the largest overflow lake in the qb is dongjicuona 3 data and methodologies 3 1 data 3 1 1 global surface water dataset we use the monthly gsw dataset https global surface water appspot com accessed 21 june 2021 to analyze the variations in the annual area of lakes and spatial patterns pekel et al 2016 this dataset is based on 4 453 989 scenarios of landsat 5 7 8 obtained from 16 march 1984 to 31 december 2020 by using an expert system each pixel is individually classified as water non water or invalid observation and the results are collated into a monthly history the time span of the gsw in this study area is 33 years 1987 to 2020 to compare the annual areas and exclude the influence of seasonal variations the lake areas from august to october each year are considered as the annual lake area zhang et al 2021b 3 1 2 multisource satellite optical image and altimetry data altimeter satellites have proved useful for observing lake water levels duan and bastiaanssen 2013 satellite altimetry data from icesat icesat 2 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 were used in this study obtained from the european space agency https eocat esa int the national aeronautics and space administration https nsidc org data and the copernicus open access hub accessed 08 july 2021 the tracks and coverage are shown in fig s1 and table s1 in supplementary the method of lin et al 2020 was used to correct systematic deviations in the data due to the limitations of satellite orbit and launch time these data have a short time span and different time intervals which makes it impossible to study the long term variations in lake water level to solve this problem we constructed hypsometric curves by combining the lake area provided by landsat 7 8 and sentinel 2 satellites and reconstructed the annual lake water level dataset by using the annual lake area dataset described in section 3 1 1 these satellites provide commonly used high spatial resolution optical images and the accuracy of the extracted lake area has been widely verified yao et al 2019 in addition the tuple of lake area and water level within seven days of collecting the data serves to construct the hypsometric curve which allows us to compensate to the extent possible for errors caused by time inconsistency lin et al 2020 3 1 3 products from the gravity recovery and climate experiment and hydrological model simulation data numerous studies discuss how to combine grace products with hydrological model simulation data to estimate the variations in lws for large lakes or multiple lakes lin et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020 we further explore this approach and evaluate the fraction of variations in the total lws in the qb with respect to tws three grace products with a monthly scale are used obtained from the center for space research at the university of texas csr https www2 csr utexas edu grace the german research center for geosciences gfz https isdc gfz potsdam de grace isdc and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov accessed 25 september

al 2020 which provides an outlier relative to the average from april 2002 to march 2020 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 the product has made numerous corrections to the level 2 spherical harmonic function to accurately represent quality variations in earth s surface the jpl product version is jpl rl06 v02 which uses corrections such as c20 degree 1 cia on level 1 products caron et al 2018 and the spatial resolution after correction by a scale factor is 0 5 0 5 hydrological model simulation data are derived from the widely used global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa

resolution of 0 25 0 25 as suggested by wei et al 2021 the groundwater storage gws is obtained from the gldas clsm daily product li et al 2019 https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gldas clsm025 da1 d 2 2 accessed 28 september 2021 we converted the above data into annual data and consolidated the baseline anomalies relative to the mean from 2004 to 2009 to compare with variations in the total lws fig 2 shows all data used in this study 3 2 methodologies 3 2 1 a framework for estimating variations in lake area lake water level and lake water storage we propose a framework for estimating variations in lake area lake water level and lws using multisource satellite data fig 3 the framework consists of four parts a monthly gsw products based on google earth engine gee the annual time series of lake area from 1987 to 2020 was constructed with september as the main month and other months as auxiliary months the few years 1995 1997 missing lake area records are filled in by linear interpolation meng et al 2019 in addition the striping and misclassification of some water bodies in the gsw products are filled in and corrected by manual visual interpretation li et al 2021 b the modified normalized difference water index mndwi singh et al 2015 was calculated based on multisource satellite images landsat 7 8 and sentinel 2 with less than 30 cloud cover for each lake region the otsu algorithm otsu 1979 was used to obtain the water segmentation threshold to calculate the area of each lake to deal with cloud occlusion in some images we used artificial visual interpretation to restore the lake boundary by referring to the lake boundary of adjacent periods tiede et al 2021 multisource satellite altimetry data within seven days of multisource satellite image differences were selected and corrected for system deviation lin et al 2020 the outliers of the lake elevation point set were then removed zhang et al 2021a to calculate the lake water level c the lake area and water level were revised again to eliminate errors caused by the environment or instruments that cannot be eliminated algorithmically the hypsometric curve was then constructed by using ordinary least squares ols regression for the modified lake area and water level data pairs and the cross validation method served to select the optimal curve finally the lake water level from 1987 to 2020 was reconstructed by combining the lake area obtained in a d variations in lws could not be measured directly and were generally estimated by using the relevant data lin et al 2020 the most accurate estimation was based on lake bathymetric data lei et al 2018 however this method cannot be used in regions with a harsh natural environment because it requires significant manpower and material resources the most commonly used estimation method is therefore a combination of lake area lake water level and eq 1 the variation in lws is given by the volume of pyramidal frustum 1 δ l w s t t 1 1 3 a t a t 1 a t a t 1 e t 1 e t where δ l w s t t 1 is the variation in lws at and et are the lake area and water level at time t respectively and at 1 and et 1 are the lake area and water level at time t 1 respectively another method to estimate variation in lws uses the tws derived from grace products and hydrological model simulation data xu et al 2020 as shown in 2 δ l w s total δ t w s δ s w e δ s m δ c i δ g w where the variables are described in section 3 1 3 however the low spatial resolution of grace products makes this method more suitable for very large lakes or multiple lakes within a watershed in this study we used this method to estimate the variations in total lws in this basin and used it for a comparative analysis with the above method 3 2 2 hypsometric curve construction and evaluation the common hypsometric curves include basic types such as linear polynomial exponential logarithmic and power curves table 1 busker et al 2019 schwatke et al 2020 based on lake area and water level data pairs we use the ols regression to determine the parameters of the basic type taking the linear curve as an example we assume that there exist n pairs of lake area and water level samples a1 e1 a n e n a linear curve is then obtained by determining the parameters a and b to minimize the sum of the square of errors of lake water levels estimated by all samples and the corresponding curves 3 arg min f a b arg min a b i 1 n e i e p 2 arg min a b i 1 n e i a a i b 2 where argminf a b is the value of parameters a and b when the sum of the square of errors f a b is taken as the minimum and ei is the lake water level given by the sample data to find the minimum of the function f a b let the partial derivatives in both directions a and b be zero 4 a f a b 2 i 1 n a i 2 b i 1 n a i i 1 n a i e i 0 b f a b 2 a i 1 n a i n b i 1 n e i 0 solving eqs 4 gives the parameters that minimize the sum of the square of the errors which in turn gives the linear hypsometric curve that best fits the sample data we use these principles to construct the hypsometric curves for each lake previous studies follow the principle of the maximal r2 and minimal rmse to select the curve that best fits the sample data schwatke et al 2020 in terms of practical significance the construction of the hypsometric curve not only provides high precision fits based on existing samples but also enables curve extrapolation therefore we must verify the accuracy of the extrapolation of the hypsometric curve unfortunately we have few sample data of small and medium sized lakes because of the limited amount of data and the size of the lakes to maximize the accuracy we use leave one out cross validation vehtari et al 2016 fig 4 assuming that the lake contains m pairs of samples m 1 pairs serve to construct the curve and one pair serves to verify the accuracy of the extrapolated curve the cycle is repeated m times so that each pair of samples participates in a validation and the absolute errors of all validations and the final mean absolute errors are counted 3 2 3 uncertainty of lake area lake water level and lake water storage changes the uncertainty of changes in lws is related to the estimations of lake area and water level the gsw dataset is produced by a series of landsat satellites therefore the uncertainty of lake area σ a t can be defined as the area of water covered by 0 5 pixels a t 0 5 a t 0 5 around the lake boundary bolch et al 2011 salerno et al 2012 zhang et al 2021b the uncertainty of lake water level σ e t and change in lws change σ δ l w s t t 1 can be determined by the hypsometric curves and the error propagation billeter et al 2008 of eq 1 respectively 5 σ a t a t 0 5 a t 0 5 σ e t e a t 0 5 e a t 0 5 6 σ δ l w s t t 1 t t 1 σ a t 2 δ l w s a t 2 t t 1 σ e t 2 δ l w s e t 2 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal analysis of long series variations in lake area the lakes in the qb are divided into overflow lakes and terminal lakes the overflow lakes have both inflow and outflow rivers and their variations in area are relatively stable fig 5 blue bar chart terminal lakes have only inflow rivers the inflow of water increases the lake area a lake is rapidly depleted if the river supply is cut off or in the event of extreme drought fig 5 red bar chart therefore regional and even global anomalous climate events may be revealed by terminal lakes fig 6 shows the variation in area of all lakes in the qb with historical areas greater than 10 km2 from 1987 to 2020 the variation in total lake area increases from 1442 94 18 48 to 2635 29 40 69 km2 corresponding to a growth of 1192 35 22 21 km2 or 82 63 the onset of the 21st century is thus an important time point for variations in lake area from 1987 to 1999 the lake area increased only slightly 6 39 whereas it varied dramatically since the year 2000 the variations increase in magnitude since 2000 and reached a local maximum at 2709 54 21 85 km2 in 2010 which equates to an increase of 70 67 over this time span lakes such as beihuobuxun dabuxun dongjicuona etc expanded significantly in particular the areas of beihuobuxun dabuxun nanhuobuxun etc have reached historic highs fig 6b after 2010 lake area decreases and reaches the low of 1759 95 34 39 km2 in 2014 which is the size before the year 2000 subsequently the total lake area continues to expand in 2019 the total lake area reaches the historical maximum of 2722 60 42 40 km2 the total lake area decreases in 2020 with a small difference 2 74 compared with 2010 however individual lakes undergo dramatic changes for example dongjicuona doucuo gahai etc have reached their historical maximal area the medium and large lakes such as beihuobuxun xitaijinaier and yiliping disappeared completely accordingly these results reflect the dramatic spatial changes of the lakes supplementary fig s2 4 2 reconstruction of level of long series lake based on hypsometric curve based on lake area and water level data pairs the hypsometric curve was constructed using ols regression and the optimal curve was selected according to the new criterion fig 7 the 16 lake hypsometric curves are of various types including exponential logarithmic and polynomial table 2 this differs from previous studies for example busker et al 2019 studied 137 lakes around the world and found that the area and water level of almost all lakes are linearly related in contrast we use multisource remote sensing images and satellite altimetry data with better temporal resolution which has the advantage of reducing the time interval between lake area and water level and reducing the uncertainty caused by short term fluctuations in the lake in contrast busker s study used the gsw monthly lake area product and the dahiti monthly lake water level product resulting in a more uncertain curve in addition due to the limitation of satellite orbit configuration some lake areas and water levels even had a time difference of 30 days dettmering et al 2020 the increasing uncertainty makes it difficult to capture the precise relationship between them we present various hypsometric curves for lakes in fig 7 which show the subtle differences in lake topography of the 16 hypsometric curves eleven have r2 0 9 four have r2 in the range 0 7 0 9 one has r2 less than 0 7 and the average r2 is 0 88 table 2 this shows that most of the curves fit well with existing data except for dongjicuona the rmse of each lake is within 0 25 m which is acceptable considering the variations in lake surface the nrmse is the fraction of rmse that falls within the range of variation of lake water level the larger is the fraction the greater is the error in the variation of lake water level busker et al 2019 the nrmse and rmse of nanhuoluxun are 16 02 and 0 13 m respectively indicating that the range of long term variation in the water level is not large which means that the nrmse is significantly disturbed by short term lake water level fluctuations conversely the water level of tuosu rises significantly 8 14 m and observation errors or variations in lake level have little impact on the accuracy of the hypsometric curve r2 0 99 rmse 0 21 nrmse 2 54 in brief in addition to observational errors the rmse and nrmse are related to the range of variation of lake water level or lake area weak variations in lake water level or lake area hinders the construction of the hypsometric curve of the lake are section 5 4 from 1987 to 2020 the water level of lakes in this basin changed dramatically fig 8 over this period the change in water level of these lakes varied from 1 54 0 03 to 9 01 0 68 m beihuobuxun is the only lake where the water level dropped compared with 1987 it decreased by 1 54 0 03 m yiliping reached its highest water level 2623 54 0 03 m in 2010 and completely dried up 2621 63 m in 2020 with a maximum water depth of 1 91 m given the maximum area of yiliping was 318 28 5 61 km2 it is a large shallow lake this type of lake is very vulnerable in the qb because it offers plenty of light but little rain and the large lake area inevitably leads to significant water evaporation due in part to damming yiliping disappeared in just four years thus climate and human activities can significantly affect the lakes in this basin especially large shallow lakes in addition ya increased from 2625 55 0 02 m at its birth in 1989 to 2630 12 0 07 m in 2020 the lake has a maximum depth of 4 57 0 07 m and a maximum area of 393 30 6 00 km2 making it also a large shallow lake given that it is directly fed by glacial melt from the kunlun mountains it may endure for a long time but its strong evaporation may still cause a significant loss of water in comparison the water level of tuosu and kekao increased by 7 89 0 58 and 9 01 0 68 m respectively and have maximum areas of 178 49 1 54 and 87 15 1 37 km2 respectively the ratio of lake area to lake water level is thus less than that of ya so these two lakes may be better suited for water storage and offer a more stable ecological environment 4 3 spatiotemporal analysis of long time series variations in lake water storage from 1987 to 2020 the lws in the qb underwent significant temporal variations fig 9 increasing by 4 82 0 36 km3 in 33 years which is equivalent to the total domestic water consumption of 2 5 million people over 30 years wa el a et al 2016 in terms of time scale the total variation in lws can be divided into two stages before the 21st century the lws was relatively stable with only a slight rate of decrease of 0 02 0 01 km3 a on average the maximum and minimum occurred in 1989 0 78 0 27 km3 and 1998 0 43 0 22 km3 respectively after the year 2000 the lws was relatively stable for five years then began an increased variation in 2005 that peaked in 2020 the total lws increased by 5 01 0 43 km3 from 2000 to 2020 at a rate of 0 25 0 02 km3 a in terms of individual lakes tuosu underwent the largest variation in lws by 2020 accounting for 26 30 of the total variation in lws followed by ya 23 66 and kekao 12 82 in particular the period 2009 to 2011 saw a special trend in the variation of lws the water storage of dabusun dachaidan nanhuobuxun etc increased sharply and then declined rapidly which may reflect extreme glacial melting or climate warming events the spatial lws in the qb also varied significantly fig 10 from 1987 to 2000 the total lws decreased only by 0 19 0 25 km3 which consists of a slight increase 0 0 2 km3 in ten lakes and a decrease in six lakes 0 2 km3 0 tuosu in the east was the most significant with a decrease of 0 59 0 11 km3 from 2000 to 2010 the total lws increased by 2 31 0 38 km3 whereas tuosu increased by 0 53 0 15 km3 other lakes such as yiliping xitaijinaier xiaochaidan dabuxun and dongjicuona increased by 0 2 0 5 km3 unlike nearby lakes the lws of dongtaijinaier decreased by 0 34 0 08 km3 which is related to the damming activities from 2010 to 2020 the total lws increased by 2 70 0 45 km3 with most of the lakes undergoing an increasing trend in 2020 the two lakes with the largest increase over this period were tuosu 1 3 0 12 km3 and ya 0 81 0 04 km3 during the periods 1987 2000 and 2010 2020 the total lake area increased whereas the total lws decreased total lws decreased from 1987 to 2000 with tuosu making the largest contribution due to the depth of tuosu a large reduction in water storage translates into only a slight reduction in lake area in contrast other shallower lakes that undergo small increases in water storage 0 0 2 km3 have a large increase in lake area which contributes significantly to the increase in total lake area similarly from 2010 to 2020 more water was funneled into steeper lakes tuosu while shallow lakes yiliping and xitaijinaier gradually shrank or even disappeared resulting in a significant reduction in total lake area with little impact on total lws for example yiliping went from the second largest lake in this basin 318 28 5 61 km2 to complete disappearance by losing only 0 29 0 01 km3 of water however during the same time period tuosu increased from 145 38 1 48 to 178 49 1 54 km2 and the overall amount of water increased by 1 30 0 14 km3 this shows that water resource decisions should not rely on the variations in lake area because different lakes have different underwater topography so variations in lws can be very different from variations in lake area thus the real situation of lakes is not given only by the variations in lake area 5 discussion 5 1 variations in lake water storage driven by different mechanisms numerous investigations have attempted to estimate variations in lws by using grace data combined with hydrological simulations however the feasibility of such an approach remains debatable because of the limitations imposed by grace s low resolution and the uncertainty of hydrological models for example for individual lakes xu et al 2020 and wang et al 2019 estimated the lws changes in poyang lake 3000 km2 and three gorges reservoir 1000 km2 respectively and the results showed that the method is not reliable however lin et al 2020 show that this method was reliable for victoria 69 000 km2 therefore this method is more suitable for estimating the variation of lws in large lakes studies at the basin scale such as qiao et al 2021 have pointed out sizeable spatial differences between changes in tws and changes in lws fig 11 a compares the variation of total lws estimated by different methods note that the variations in total lws estimated by grace and gldas differ significantly most likely because the different spatial resolution of grace products especially grace gfz which has the lowest spatial resolution 1 1 results in large leakage errors and uncertainties another phenomenon is that the three estimates of total lws provided by grace and gldas began to decrease significantly in 2016 and reached a minimum in 2019 which differs completely from the variation in total lws derived from hypsometric curves tlws hypsometric according to gldas data fig 11b gws gradually increased as of 2016 and increased suddenly from 9 84 to 22 42 km3 in 2018 which was an abnormal phenomenon gws is derived from gldas clsm data published by li et al 2019 which assimilates grace products into nasa s catchment land surface model to simulate groundwater content meaning that the product does not separate the lake water from groundwater which clearly is not conducive to the study of a watershed water cycle according to the results shown in fig 11b groundwater in the period 2016 2020 was overestimated by approximately 3 93 11 68 km3 resulting in an abnormal decline in tlws jpl tlws csr and tlws gfz over this period at present most estimates of groundwater do not consider variations in lws bibi et al 2019 jiao et al 2015 wei et al 2021 which is not reasonable 5 2 verification of lake area and discussion of causes of changes in lake water storage the dataset from the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc zhang et al 2021b was used to verify the area of the lakes in the qb this dataset contains a series of synthetic annual images derived from landsat mss tm etm oli imagery each lake was segmented using ndwi and otsu algorithms combined with manual visual interpretation to ensure accurate delineation of lake boundaries zhang et al 2019 all available data from the tpdc dataset were compared with the lake area extracted by gsw the results for 1995 2010 2019 2020 fig 12 a are controversial we found that tpdc undercounted some lakes for example dongtaijinaier fig 12b and nanhuobuxun are not included in the year 2020 of the tpdc dataset in addition the tpdc dataset for the entire period also does not contain two new lakes noname2 fig 12c and noname3 fig 12d after including these lakes in tpdc the real total lake area in 2020 is 2626 42 38 48 km2 and the total lake area obtained from gsw is 2635 29 40 69 km2 the area of ya is 380 85 5 25 km2 and 393 30 6 00 km2 based on the tpdc and gsw products respectively fig 12b this difference appears at lake boundaries the lake boundaries from gsw enclose shallow waters and wetlands that are difficult to discern by humans and algorithms whereas the lake boundaries from tpdc are more conservatively located and have apparently been edited by humans however the gsw products are more suitable for this study with more lakes and more complete time series several studies have investigated changes in lws and the water balance on the tp qiao et al 2019b zhang et al 2017 however our study investigates changes in lakes in the qb more comprehensively the results of the present study indicate that compared with the mean value from 2004 to 2009 the total lws in 2020 has increased by 4 41 km3 which is equivalent to 19 49 12 53 and 16 85 based on grace jpl grace csr and grace gfz respectively supplementary table s2 the previous value was 1 1 jiao et al 2015 because that study used a single satellite and could only count seven small and medium lakes numerous studies still use this conclusion and argue that the change of lws in the qb is negligible which is not reasonable therefore the results presented herein are necessary and timely and contribute to a renewed understanding of the importance of lws in this basin the rapid increase in lws in the qb is consistent with the temperature changes reported by wang et al 2017 significantly increased glacier mass loss rates chen et al 2021 and the precipitation cycle zhang et al 2019 are important reasons for the increase of lws in tp however more research is needed to explain the increase in lws in the qb because this basin is extremely dry the impact of potential evapotranspiration is more pronounced than in other basins yang et al 2014 in addition the large increase in groundwater in recent years may need further verification li et al 2019 it can be expected that the drought conditions in the qb will be alleviated as global temperatures warm but potential water resource threats should still be noted 5 3 validation of hypsometric curve extrapolation accuracy assuming a fixed sample size the type of hypsometric curve directly affects the accuracy of its extrapolation fig 13 taking tuosu as an example and assuming that only fifteen pairs of sample data are available 30 of the total data and that the hypsometric curve increases monotonically the traditional criterion of highest r2 and lowest rmse will select the quadratic polynomial green r2 0 9615 rmse 0 1476 m to estimate the lake water level however using the remaining data to test the accuracy of the curve shows that the predicted lake water level differs from the actual lake water level by 7 16 0 28 m while the extrapolation accuracy of the unpromising logarithmic curve is between 0 04 and 1 81 m when the sample size is increased by 60 the extrapolation of the logarithmic curve r2 0 9904 rmse 0 1759 m is more accurate than that of the cubic polynomial curve r2 0 9911 rmse 0 1756 m therefore when the curve is extrapolated the traditional criterion is not reliable in practice all samples are generally used to fit the curve to ensure the accuracy of curve extrapolation therefore choosing a curve that works for extrapolation is a challenge we use the cross validation method and found that when using the sample of 30 of the data the mean absolute error of the logarithmic curve red is less than the quadratic polynomial curve green when we use 60 of the data as sample the mean absolute error of the logarithmic curve blue is less than the cubic polynomial curve magenta and this is the same as testing phase that is cross validation can identify curves with high extrapolation accuracy given sufficient data 98 data as samples the extrapolation accuracy of the cubic polynomial chosen by the proposed method is slightly lower 0 02 m 0 03 m but overall the proposed method avoids the risk of choosing a worse curve especially when the amount of data is insufficient the curve extrapolation accuracy of the proposed method is significantly higher than that of the traditional method as with the concept of geological maturity schwatke et al 2020 strahler 1952 this shows that the curve well represents the lake topography for the existing sample data however due to the diversity of lake topography the amount of data required for the maturity of different lake curves is uncertain in other words the traditional method is only effective when the amount of data satisfies the maturity of curves whereas the proposed method can select the correct curve regardless of the amount of data the hypsometric curve is used to predict lake water level so it is necessary to verify its prediction accuracy in the field of machine learning and deep learning lecun et al 2015 training and verification are required to build a model whereas verification is generally lacking when constructing a hypsometric curve for a lake busker et al 2019 dettmering et al 2020 lin et al 2020 weekley and li 2021 therefore our new criterion is an important theoretical supplement for constructing hypsometric curves for lakes 5 4 limitations and prospects of estimates of variations in lake water storage limited by the coverage of satellite altimetry data even if combined with multisource satellite data the lake water level of some lakes still lack observation making it impossible to construct hypsometric curves for these lakes four overflow lakes in the qb and one terminal lake fall into this category accounting for 5 09 of the total lake area in addition given the small variation in lake area 2 09 km2 and water level 0 97 m during the satellite observation period no strong relationship r2 0 222 can be established between them which indicated a weak correlation and anomalous trend of lake area and water level similarly doucuo has a similar situation fig 14 in summary the lake area for which the variations in lws cannot be estimated is 19 59 of the total lake area and increased from 253 47 12 58 km2 in 1987 to 516 32 18 65 km2 in 2020 accounting for 22 04 of the total variation in lake area if the rate of variation in lake area is equated with the rate of variation in lws the real variation in lws in 2020 was about 6 18 km3 another representative approach is to use lake areas and lake water levels derived from digital elevation models to estimate changes in lws the accuracy of this method has been verified by numerous studies qiao et al 2019b song et al 2013 yang et al 2017 and is widely used in the investigation of lakes on the tp this method does not face the above dilemma and even changes in the lws of small lakes can be estimated which makes large scale and long term comprehensive lake surveys a reality for example zhang et al 2021b investigated the change in lws of the tp and reported that the qb increased by 3 17 km3 from 1979 to 2019 this difference is explainable given the number of lakes investigated the time frame and the research methodology however this method is limited by the production time and accuracy of digital elevation models and the changing characteristics of lakes which may lead to low accuracy in estimating changes in lws of small lakes or of lakes with insignificant changes in water level although it is difficult for the proposed method to cover small lakes with the launch of more satellites especially the swot satellite biancamaria et al 2016 which has high spatiotemporal resolution and captures time synchronized lake water levels and lake areas the proposed method has broader prospects 6 conclusion this study uses multisource satellite data to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of 30 lakes over 10 km2 in hyperarid basins of northwest china from 1987 to 2020 the total lake area in the qaidam basin expanded by 82 63 with terminal lakes increasing more than overflow lakes the lake area varied most significantly in the center of the basin damming activities both created lakes and led to their disappearance and even the largest lakes in this basin are constantly being replaced in previous studies the construction of hypsometric curves of lakes lacked verification taking tuosu lake as an example we show herein that an error in predicting the lake water level can be as high as 7 16 m when selecting the hypsometric curve based only on the fit to sample data i e r2 and rmse we thus suggest selecting hypsometric curves based on cross validation which uses long time series data to accurately reconstruct lake water levels from 1987 to 2020 the total lws in the qb increased by 4 82 km3 as of the year 2000 both the rate and magnitude of increase in lws are evident from 2010 to 2020 damming activities caused water to shift from large shallow lakes to smaller deeper lakes although the lake area in 2010 was the same as in 2020 the lws was 43 93 of that in 2020 this shows that water conditions cannot be judged based only on lake area because of the diverse underwater topography of lakes at present variations in lws receive very little attention in the study of water cycles the present study shows that relative to the mean from 2004 to 2009 the increase in total lws accounts for 12 53 19 49 of the increase in terrestrial water storage in 2020 to better understand the water cycle process of the qb we hope that the subsequent research into water resources will fully consider variations in lws especially in basins with numerous lakes credit authorship contribution statement chuanhui zhang

3327,lakes play an important role in global hydrologically and provide substantial water resources in hyperarid regions and they are becoming even more significant as climate change impacts hydrological processes especially in these sensitive regions this study proposes a lake monitoring framework that uses multisource satellite data to automatically estimate the spatiotemporal variations from 1987 to 2020 of lake area lake water level and lake water storage lws in the qaidam basin qb which is a typical hyperarid basin in northwest china the global surface water dataset provides long time series data for lake areas multisource satellite images landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 2 and altimetry data cryosat 2 icesat icesat 2 sentinel 3 are used to build hypsometric curves the fit to the curve of lake area vs lake water level to reconstruct lake water level before the 21st century in contrast with traditional methods we propose to verify the construction of a hypsometric curve to select a reasonable curve and thereby improve the accuracy of the extrapolation of lake water level on this basis we estimated the variation of lws from 1987 to 2020 and to use products of the gravity recovery and climate experiment and of land surface model simulations to estimate the variation in total lws in the qb for comparative analysis the results show that the total lws in the qb has increased by 82 63 over the past 33 years compared with the mean value from 2004 to 2009 the total lws in 2020 increased by 4 41 km3 which is equivalent to 12 53 19 49 of the increase in terrestrial water storage this ratio cannot be ignored the analysis of spatiotemporal variations in lakes shows that large shallow lakes are disappearing leading to ecological deterioration in some areas conversely there is increased water storage in small deep lakes which may be beneficial for water conservation in hyperarid basins in conclusion the proposed automated processing program should facilitate the rapid monitoring of lake dynamics around the world we emphasize that the variation of lake water storage in hyperarid basins cannot be ignored which should stimulate more relevant research keywords multisource satellite data lakes spatiotemporal variations qaidam basin long term changes 1 introduction lakes are an important part of the terrestrial hydrosphere there are more than 1 42 million lakes in the world accounting for about 1 8 of earth s land surface area messager et al 2016 lakes connect the layers of earth s surface system yechieli et al 1995 and have the special functions of regulating regional climate recording regional environmental changes and maintaining the balance of regional ecosystems and of the diversity of derivatives woolway and merchant 2019 the formation disappearance expansion and contraction of lakes all depend on regional and global climate change especially in hyperarid basins cao et al 2021 in hyperarid basins water resources are scarce and the ecological environment is very fragile panahi et al 2020 in particular the qaidam basin qb in the northeast part of the tibetan plateau tp has an extremely dry climate with scarce precipitation and serious desertification wang and qin 2017 recent studies have shown that the warming rate 0 53 c 10a of the basin greatly exceeds that of other basins on the tp wang et al 2014 making it now a typical region for studying the effects of global climate change lakes are a sensitive indicator of climate change adrian et al 2009 zhang and duan 2021 and are widespread in the qb which contains the world s densest set of salt lakes yang et al 2017 all fed by glacial meltwater from the surrounding mountains therefore variations in lake water levels reflect the water balance of the entire basin and even the climate variations of the tp and by extension of the world legesse et al 2004 in addition the qb is known as a cornucopia because the lakes within it contain significant mineral resources han et al 2021 which are almost the only available resources for economic and social development in areas with poor soil water scarcity constrains the development of resources in the qb especially salt lake resources zhao et al 2021 therefore monitoring the lakes in this basin is useful not only to understand the process of global climate change but also for the sustainable development of the local economy and ecology unfortunately the complex terrain and harsh climate of the basin prevent the application of traditional methods to monitor spatiotemporal variations in lake water level which relies on ground stations lei et al 2018 qiao et al 2019a remote sensing provides a feasible means to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of lakes on a large scale dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 lake area and water level are the most direct indexes to reflect lake fluctuation by using nasa s open access optical imagery lake area can be easily and quickly captured which facilitates the generation of a series of long term datasets of lake area two examples are the global surface water gsw dataset published by pekel et al 2016 and the global lake and reservoir dataset constructed by yao et al 2019 these datasets have been used in numerous investigations into lake area busker et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b resulting in outstanding contributions to the study of global lake area over the past 40 years however few studies have focused on long term changes in lake water levels dettmering et al 2020 because altimeter satellites which are commonly used to monitor lake water levels e g cryosat 2 jiang et al 2017 icesat zhang et al 2011 icesat 2 yuan et al 2020 and sentinel 3 xu et al 2022 only offer data since 2003 earlier altimetry missions such as topex poseidon fu et al 1994 envisat tourian et al 2013 and jason lambin et al 2010 had low transorbital resolution and were mostly used to monitor polar ice caps and sea levels rather than lake water level in addition due to the limitation of altimetry satellite orbit configuration dettmering et al 2020 almost no fixed and continuous observation records exist for single lakes therefore long term continuous monitoring of lake levels is difficult a hypsometric curve is a function that represents the relationship between lake area and water level and is used to predict lake water levels in the absence of satellite altimeter observations extrapolating lake water level vickers et al 2019 as early as 1952 strahler 1952 established the hypsometric curve to determine the geological maturity of a region on this basis håkanson 1977 introduced the hypsometric curve to lake research and changed the concavity of the curve by adjusting parameters of the basic type of function to adapt to the topographic variations of different lakes similar studies have continued to this day and a series of lake water level products represented by dahiti schwatke et al 2015 have been derived currently ordinary least squares ols regression kilmer and rodríguez 2017 is a commonly used method to construct hypsometric curves it seeks the optimal relationship between lake area and water level by minimizing the sum of squares of errors previous reports have used linear polynomial exponential and logarithmic curves to describe lakes busker et al 2019 weekley and li 2021 yao et al 2018 the optimal hypsometric curve has the maximum r2 minimum root mean square error rmse and increases monotonically but this only indicates the best fit to the data it cannot prove the optimality of the hypsometric curve when extrapolating lake water level therefore a verification process must be added to select the hypsometric curve most suitable for extrapolation however few studies have taken this into account this paper discusses the problem in detail and proposes a new verification method to select the optimal hypsometric curve and ensure an accurate extrapolation of the curve the variation in lake water storage lws is very important for an accurate assessment of the impacts of climate change and of the hydrological environment in hyperarid basins wang and qin 2017 however the lws of the qb a typical hyperarid basin has received little attention on the contrary groundwater and terrestrial water storage tws have become research hotspots for example bibi et al 2019 calculated groundwater and analyzed its response to climate change based on the water balance equation wei et al 2021 analyzed variations in tws in the qb derived from meteorological data and from products of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace these studies provide valuable data and methods for understanding the water cycle in the qb but the contribution of lakes is ignored without exception these previous works all follow the conclusions of jiao et al 2015 that variations in lws only account for 1 1 of tws variations however jiao et al only considered variations in seven small and medium sized lakes and ignored many lakes ignoring the lws in the qb will inevitably lead to miscalculations of other water resources which will have serious consequences it can also cause researchers to lose track of variations in lws in this basin and to not recognize climate processes in typical hyperarid basins therefore a comprehensive estimate of variations in lws is required to understand the composition of water resources in the qb and to provide accurate data for subsequent research the present study thus combines multisource remote sensing data to estimate and analyze the spatiotemporal variations in lake area lake water level and lws in the arid area of the qb over the last 30 years the study accomplishes four major tasks i all lakes with a surface area greater than 10 km2 from 1987 to 2020 are investigated and their long term trends are analyzed sections 4 1 and 5 2 ii we reconstruct lake water levels from 1987 to 2020 and propose a new method to verify the rationality of lake water levels extrapolated from hypsometric curves sections 4 2 and 5 3 iii we estimate and discuss the spatiotemporal variations in lws for 16 major lakes from 1987 to 2020 and re evaluate the fractional variation of the total lws with respect to the tws sections 4 3 5 1 and 5 2 iv we discuss the limitations and prospects of lws estimation methods in this study and in other studies section 5 4 this study thus provides a method and theory for comprehensive monitoring of lake dynamics the variations in lws highlight the importance of lakes in water resources research and break the stereotype of water composition within the qb which should lead to a new benchmark for studying water resources in the qb and provide a reference for water resource research in other basins 2 study area the qaidam basin qb 34 37 57 39 18 42 n 90 27 56 99 25 51 e is a huge tectonic subsidence basin in the northeastern part of the tp fig 1 it is about 800 km long from east to west and 300 km wide from north to south with a total area of 276 000 km2 the basin is surrounded by the kunlun mountains to the south the qilian mountains in the northeast and the qimantage and aerjin mountains in the northwest the highest lowest elevation of the basin is 6826 m 2676 3200 m the basin is one of the world s most arid inland basins with a dry climate and scarce precipitation precipitation decreases in going from the surrounding areas to the center of the basin annual precipitation in the surrounding mountainous areas ranges from 150 to 300 mm and less than 50 mm in the center of the basin with only 25 mm in the northwest the evaporation capacity in this basin exceeds 1800 mm jia et al 2011 the region contains 30 lakes with an area greater than 10 km2 the terminal lakes labeled in red in fig 1 are mainly in the center of the basin e g dabuxun senie beihuobuxun nanhuobuxun they are at the end of rivers and are fed by glacier meltwater from the surrounding mountains the lake water is highly concentrated and mineralized because there is no outflow and strong evaporation yang et al 2017 the overflow lakes labeled in blue in fig 1 have seasonal inflow and outflow and contain significant freshwater resources these are mainly distributed to the north of the kunlun mountains at elevations of more than 4000 m the largest overflow lake in the qb is dongjicuona 3 data and methodologies 3 1 data 3 1 1 global surface water dataset we use the monthly gsw dataset https global surface water appspot com accessed 21 june 2021 to analyze the variations in the annual area of lakes and spatial patterns pekel et al 2016 this dataset is based on 4 453 989 scenarios of landsat 5 7 8 obtained from 16 march 1984 to 31 december 2020 by using an expert system each pixel is individually classified as water non water or invalid observation and the results are collated into a monthly history the time span of the gsw in this study area is 33 years 1987 to 2020 to compare the annual areas and exclude the influence of seasonal variations the lake areas from august to october each year are considered as the annual lake area zhang et al 2021b 3 1 2 multisource satellite optical image and altimetry data altimeter satellites have proved useful for observing lake water levels duan and bastiaanssen 2013 satellite altimetry data from icesat icesat 2 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 were used in this study obtained from the european space agency https eocat esa int the national aeronautics and space administration https nsidc org data and the copernicus open access hub accessed 08 july 2021 the tracks and coverage are shown in fig s1 and table s1 in supplementary the method of lin et al 2020 was used to correct systematic deviations in the data due to the limitations of satellite orbit and launch time these data have a short time span and different time intervals which makes it impossible to study the long term variations in lake water level to solve this problem we constructed hypsometric curves by combining the lake area provided by landsat 7 8 and sentinel 2 satellites and reconstructed the annual lake water level dataset by using the annual lake area dataset described in section 3 1 1 these satellites provide commonly used high spatial resolution optical images and the accuracy of the extracted lake area has been widely verified yao et al 2019 in addition the tuple of lake area and water level within seven days of collecting the data serves to construct the hypsometric curve which allows us to compensate to the extent possible for errors caused by time inconsistency lin et al 2020 3 1 3 products from the gravity recovery and climate experiment and hydrological model simulation data numerous studies discuss how to combine grace products with hydrological model simulation data to estimate the variations in lws for large lakes or multiple lakes lin et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020 we further explore this approach and evaluate the fraction of variations in the total lws in the qb with respect to tws three grace products with a monthly scale are used obtained from the center for space research at the university of texas csr https www2 csr utexas edu grace the german research center for geosciences gfz https isdc gfz potsdam de grace isdc and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov accessed 25 september 2021 the csr product version is rl06 v02 and the spatial resolution is 0 25 0 25 it applies the latest c20 c30 gia corrections richard peltier et al 2018 the gfz product version is level 3 dobslaw et al 2020 which provides an outlier relative to the average from april 2002 to march 2020 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 the product has made numerous corrections to the level 2 spherical harmonic function to accurately represent quality variations in earth s surface the jpl product version is jpl rl06 v02 which uses corrections such as c20 degree 1 cia on level 1 products caron et al 2018 and the spatial resolution after correction by a scale factor is 0 5 0 5 hydrological model simulation data are derived from the widely used global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa

resolution of 0 25 0 25 as suggested by wei et al 2021 the groundwater storage gws is obtained from the gldas clsm daily product li et al 2019 https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gldas clsm025 da1 d 2 2 accessed 28 september 2021 we converted the above data into annual data and consolidated the baseline anomalies relative to the mean from 2004 to 2009 to compare with variations in the total lws fig 2 shows all data used in this study 3 2 methodologies 3 2 1 a framework for estimating variations in lake area lake water level and lake water storage we propose a framework for estimating variations in lake area lake water level and lws using multisource satellite data fig 3 the framework consists of four parts a monthly gsw products based on google earth engine gee the annual time series of lake area from 1987 to 2020 was constructed with september as the main month and other months as auxiliary months the few years 1995 1997 missing lake area records are filled in by linear interpolation meng et al 2019 in addition the striping and misclassification of some water bodies in the gsw products are filled in and corrected by manual visual interpretation li et al 2021 b the modified normalized difference water index mndwi singh et al 2015 was calculated based on multisource satellite images landsat 7 8 and sentinel 2 with less than 30 cloud cover for each lake region the otsu algorithm otsu 1979 was used to obtain the water segmentation threshold to calculate the area of each lake to deal with cloud occlusion in some images we used artificial visual interpretation to restore the lake boundary by referring to the lake boundary of adjacent periods tiede et al 2021 multisource satellite altimetry data within seven days of multisource satellite image differences were selected and corrected for system deviation lin et al 2020 the outliers of the lake elevation point set were then removed zhang et al 2021a to calculate the lake water level c the lake area and water level were revised again to eliminate errors caused by the environment or instruments that cannot be eliminated algorithmically the hypsometric curve was then constructed by using ordinary least squares ols regression for the modified lake area and water level data pairs and the cross validation method served to select the optimal curve finally the lake water level from 1987 to 2020 was reconstructed by combining the lake area obtained in a d variations in lws could not be measured directly and were generally estimated by using the relevant data lin et al 2020 the most accurate estimation was based on lake bathymetric data lei et al 2018 however this method cannot be used in regions with a harsh natural environment because it requires significant manpower and material resources the most commonly used estimation method is therefore a combination of lake area lake water level and eq 1 the variation in lws is given by the volume of pyramidal frustum 1 δ l w s t t 1 1 3 a t a t 1 a t a t 1 e t 1 e t where δ l w s t t 1 is the variation in lws at and et are the lake area and water level at time t respectively and at 1 and et 1 are the lake area and water level at time t 1 respectively another method to estimate variation in lws uses the tws derived from grace products and hydrological model simulation data xu et al 2020 as shown in 2 δ l w s total δ t w s δ s w e δ s m δ c i δ g w where the variables are described in section 3 1 3 however the low spatial resolution of grace products makes this method more suitable for very large lakes or multiple lakes within a watershed in this study we used this method to estimate the variations in total lws in this basin and used it for a comparative analysis with the above method 3 2 2 hypsometric curve construction and evaluation the common hypsometric curves include basic types such as linear polynomial exponential logarithmic and power curves table 1 busker et al 2019 schwatke et al 2020 based on lake area and water level data pairs we use the ols regression to determine the parameters of the basic type taking the linear curve as an example we assume that there exist n pairs of lake area and water level samples a1 e1 a n e n a linear curve is then obtained by determining the parameters a and b to minimize the sum of the square of errors of lake water levels estimated by all samples and the corresponding curves 3 arg min f a b arg min a b i 1 n e i e p 2 arg min a b i 1 n e i a a i b 2 where argminf a b is the value of parameters a and b when the sum of the square of errors f a b is taken as the minimum and ei is the lake water level given by the sample data to find the minimum of the function f a b let the partial derivatives in both directions a and b be zero 4 a f a b 2 i 1 n a i 2 b i 1 n a i i 1 n a i e i 0 b f a b 2 a i 1 n a i n b i 1 n e i 0 solving eqs 4 gives the parameters that minimize the sum of the square of the errors which in turn gives the linear hypsometric curve that best fits the sample data we use these principles to construct the hypsometric curves for each lake previous studies follow the principle of the maximal r2 and minimal rmse to select the curve that best fits the sample data schwatke et al 2020 in terms of practical significance the construction of the hypsometric curve not only provides high precision fits based on existing samples but also enables curve extrapolation therefore we must verify the accuracy of the extrapolation of the hypsometric curve unfortunately we have few sample data of small and medium sized lakes because of the limited amount of data and the size of the lakes to maximize the accuracy we use leave one out cross validation vehtari et al 2016 fig 4 assuming that the lake contains m pairs of samples m 1 pairs serve to construct the curve and one pair serves to verify the accuracy of the extrapolated curve the cycle is repeated m times so that each pair of samples participates in a validation and the absolute errors of all validations and the final mean absolute errors are counted 3 2 3 uncertainty of lake area lake water level and lake water storage changes the uncertainty of changes in lws is related to the estimations of lake area and water level the gsw dataset is produced by a series of landsat satellites therefore the uncertainty of lake area σ a t can be defined as the area of water covered by 0 5 pixels a t 0 5 a t 0 5 around the lake boundary bolch et al 2011 salerno et al 2012 zhang et al 2021b the uncertainty of lake water level σ e t and change in lws change σ δ l w s t t 1

have both inflow and outflow rivers and their variations in area are relatively stable fig 5 blue bar chart terminal lakes have only inflow rivers the inflow of water increases the lake area a lake is rapidly depleted if the river supply is cut off or in the event of extreme drought fig 5 red bar chart therefore regional and even global anomalous climate events may be revealed by terminal lakes fig 6 shows the variation in area of all lakes in the qb with historical areas greater than 10 km2 from 1987 to 2020 the variation in total lake area increases from 1442 94 18 48 to 2635 29 40 69 km2 corresponding to a growth of 1192 35 22 21 km2 or 82 63 the onset of the 21st century is thus an important time point for variations in lake area from 1987 to 1999 the lake area increased only slightly 6 39 whereas it varied dramatically since the year 2000 the variations increase in magnitude since 2000 and reached a local maximum at 2709 54 21 85 km2 in 2010 which equates to an increase of 70 67 over this time span lakes such as beihuobuxun dabuxun dongjicuona etc expanded significantly in particular the areas of beihuobuxun dabuxun nanhuobuxun etc have reached historic highs fig 6b after 2010 lake area decreases and reaches the low of 1759 95 34 39 km2 in 2014 which is the size before the year 2000 subsequently the total lake area continues to expand in 2019 the total lake area reaches the historical maximum of 2722 60 42 40 km2 the total lake area decreases in 2020 with a small difference 2 74 compared with 2010 however individual lakes undergo dramatic changes for example dongjicuona doucuo gahai etc have reached their historical maximal area the medium and large lakes such as beihuobuxun xitaijinaier and yiliping disappeared completely accordingly these results reflect the dramatic spatial changes of the lakes supplementary fig s2 4 2 reconstruction of level of long series lake based on hypsometric curve based on lake area and water level data pairs the hypsometric curve was constructed using ols regression and the optimal curve was selected according to the new criterion fig 7 the 16 lake hypsometric curves are of various types including exponential logarithmic and polynomial table 2 this differs from previous studies for example busker et al 2019 studied 137 lakes around the world and found that the area and water level of almost all lakes are linearly related in contrast we use multisource remote sensing images and satellite altimetry data with better temporal resolution which has the advantage of reducing the time interval between lake area and water level and reducing the uncertainty caused by short term fluctuations in the lake in contrast busker s study used the gsw monthly lake area product and the dahiti monthly lake water level product resulting in a more uncertain curve in addition due to the limitation of satellite orbit configuration some lake areas and water levels even had a time difference of 30 days dettmering et al 2020 the increasing uncertainty makes it difficult to capture the precise relationship between them we present various hypsometric curves for lakes in fig 7 which show the subtle differences in lake topography of the 16 hypsometric curves eleven have r2 0 9 four have r2 in the range 0 7 0 9 one has r2 less than 0 7 and the average r2 is 0 88 table 2 this shows that most of the curves fit well with existing data except for dongjicuona the rmse of each lake is within 0 25 m which is acceptable considering the variations in lake surface the nrmse is the fraction of rmse that falls within the range of variation of lake water level the larger is the fraction the greater is the error in the variation of lake water level busker et al 2019 the nrmse and rmse of nanhuoluxun are 16 02 and 0 13 m respectively indicating that the range of long term variation in the water level is not large which means that the nrmse is significantly disturbed by short term lake water level fluctuations conversely the water level of tuosu rises significantly 8 14 m and observation errors or variations in lake level have little impact on the accuracy of the hypsometric curve r2 0 99 rmse 0 21 nrmse 2 54 in brief in addition to observational errors the rmse and nrmse are related to the range of variation of lake water level or lake area weak variations in lake water level or lake area hinders the construction of the hypsometric curve of the lake are section 5 4 from 1987 to 2020 the water level of lakes in this basin changed dramatically fig 8 over this period the change in water level of these lakes varied from 1 54 0 03 to 9 01 0 68 m beihuobuxun is the only lake where the water level dropped compared with 1987 it decreased by 1 54 0 03 m yiliping reached its highest water level 2623 54 0 03 m in 2010 and completely dried up 2621 63 m in 2020 with a maximum water depth of 1 91 m given the maximum area of yiliping was 318 28 5 61 km2 it is a large shallow lake this type of lake is very vulnerable in the qb because it offers plenty of light but little rain and the large lake area inevitably leads to significant water evaporation due in part to damming yiliping disappeared in just four years thus climate and human activities can significantly affect the lakes in this basin especially large shallow lakes in addition ya increased from 2625 55 0 02 m at its birth in 1989 to 2630 12 0 07 m in 2020 the lake has a maximum depth of 4 57 0 07 m and a maximum area of 393 30 6 00 km2 making it also a large shallow lake given that it is directly fed by glacial melt from the kunlun mountains it may endure for a long time but its strong evaporation may still cause a significant loss of water in comparison the water level of tuosu and kekao increased by 7 89 0 58 and 9 01 0 68 m respectively and have maximum areas of 178 49 1 54 and 87 15 1 37 km2 respectively the ratio of lake area to lake water level is thus less than that of ya so these two lakes may be better suited for water storage and offer a more stable ecological environment 4 3 spatiotemporal analysis of long time series variations in lake water storage from 1987 to 2020 the lws in the qb underwent significant temporal variations fig 9 increasing by 4 82 0 36 km3 in 33 years which is equivalent to the total domestic water consumption of 2 5 million people over 30 years wa el a et al 2016 in terms of time scale the total variation in lws can be divided into two stages before the 21st century the lws was relatively stable with only a slight rate of decrease of 0 02 0 01 km3 a on average the maximum and minimum occurred in 1989 0 78 0 27 km3 and 1998 0 43 0 22 km3 respectively after the year 2000 the lws was relatively stable for five years then began an increased variation in 2005 that peaked in 2020 the total lws increased by 5 01 0 43 km3 from 2000 to 2020 at a rate of 0 25 0 02 km3 a in terms of individual lakes tuosu underwent the largest variation in lws by 2020 accounting for 26 30 of the total variation in lws followed by ya 23 66 and kekao 12 82 in particular the period 2009 to 2011 saw a special trend in the variation of lws the water storage of dabusun dachaidan nanhuobuxun etc increased sharply and then declined rapidly which may reflect extreme glacial melting or climate warming events the spatial lws in the qb also varied significantly fig 10 from 1987 to 2000 the total lws decreased only by 0 19 0 25 km3 which consists of a slight increase 0 0 2 km3 in ten lakes and a decrease in six lakes 0 2 km3 0 tuosu in the east was the most significant with a decrease of 0 59 0 11 km3 from 2000 to 2010 the total lws increased by 2 31 0 38 km3 whereas tuosu increased by 0 53 0 15 km3 other lakes such as yiliping xitaijinaier xiaochaidan dabuxun and dongjicuona increased by 0 2 0 5 km3 unlike nearby lakes the lws of dongtaijinaier decreased by 0 34 0 08 km3 which is related to the damming activities from 2010 to 2020 the total lws increased by 2 70 0 45 km3 with most of the lakes undergoing an increasing trend in 2020 the two lakes with the largest increase over this period were tuosu 1 3 0 12 km3 and ya 0 81 0 04 km3 during the periods 1987 2000 and 2010 2020 the total lake area increased whereas the total lws decreased total lws decreased from 1987 to 2000 with tuosu making the largest contribution due to the depth of tuosu a large reduction in water storage translates into only a slight reduction in lake area in contrast other shallower lakes that undergo small increases in water storage 0 0 2 km3 have a large increase in lake area which contributes significantly to the increase in total lake area similarly from 2010 to 2020 more water was funneled into steeper lakes tuosu while shallow lakes yiliping and xitaijinaier gradually shrank or even disappeared resulting in a significant reduction in total lake area with little impact on total lws for example yiliping went from the second largest lake in this basin 318 28 5 61 km2 to complete disappearance by losing only 0 29 0 01 km3 of water however during the same time period tuosu increased from 145 38 1 48 to 178 49 1 54 km2 and the overall amount of water increased by 1 30 0 14 km3 this shows that water resource decisions should not rely on the variations in lake area because different lakes have different underwater topography so variations in lws can be very different from variations in lake area thus the real situation of lakes is not given only by the variations in lake area 5 discussion 5 1 variations in lake water storage driven by different mechanisms numerous investigations have attempted to estimate variations in lws by using grace data combined with hydrological simulations however the feasibility of such an approach remains debatable because of the limitations imposed by grace s low resolution and the uncertainty of hydrological models for example for individual lakes xu et al 2020 and wang et al 2019 estimated the lws changes in poyang lake 3000 km2 and three gorges reservoir 1000 km2 respectively and the results showed that the method is not reliable however lin et al 2020 show that this method was reliable for victoria 69 000 km2 therefore this method is more suitable for estimating the variation of lws in large lakes studies at the basin scale such as qiao et al 2021 have pointed out sizeable spatial differences between changes in tws and changes in lws fig 11 a compares the variation of total lws estimated by different methods note that the variations in total lws estimated by grace and gldas differ significantly most likely because the different spatial resolution of grace products especially grace gfz which has the lowest spatial resolution 1 1 results in large leakage errors and uncertainties another phenomenon is that the three estimates of total lws provided by grace and gldas began to decrease significantly in 2016 and reached a minimum in 2019 which differs completely from the variation in total lws derived from hypsometric curves tlws hypsometric according to gldas data fig 11b gws gradually increased as of 2016 and increased suddenly from 9 84 to 22 42 km3 in 2018 which was an abnormal phenomenon gws is derived from gldas clsm data published by li et al 2019 which assimilates grace products into nasa s catchment land surface model to simulate groundwater content meaning that the product does not separate the lake water from groundwater which clearly is not conducive to the study of a watershed water cycle according to the results shown in fig 11b groundwater in the period 2016 2020 was overestimated by approximately 3 93 11 68 km3 resulting in an abnormal decline in tlws jpl tlws csr and tlws gfz over this period at present most estimates of groundwater do not consider variations in lws bibi et al 2019 jiao et al 2015 wei et al 2021 which is not reasonable 5 2 verification of lake area and discussion of causes of changes in lake water storage the dataset from the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc zhang et al 2021b was used to verify the area of the lakes in the qb this dataset contains a series of synthetic annual images derived from landsat mss tm etm oli imagery each lake was segmented using ndwi and otsu algorithms combined with manual visual interpretation to ensure accurate delineation of lake boundaries zhang et al 2019 all available data from the tpdc dataset were compared with the lake area extracted by gsw the results for 1995 2010 2019 2020 fig 12 a are controversial we found that tpdc undercounted some lakes for example dongtaijinaier fig 12b and nanhuobuxun are not included in the year 2020 of the tpdc dataset in addition the tpdc dataset for the entire period also does not contain two new lakes noname2 fig 12c and noname3 fig 12d after including these lakes in tpdc the real total lake area in 2020 is 2626 42 38 48 km2 and the total lake area obtained from gsw is 2635 29 40 69 km2 the area of ya is 380 85 5 25 km2 and 393 30 6 00 km2 based on the tpdc and gsw products respectively fig 12b this difference appears at lake boundaries the lake boundaries from gsw enclose shallow waters and wetlands that are difficult to discern by humans and algorithms whereas the lake boundaries from tpdc are more conservatively located and have apparently been edited by humans however the gsw products are more suitable for this study with more lakes and more complete time series several studies have investigated changes in lws and the water balance on the tp qiao et al 2019b zhang et al 2017 however our study investigates changes in lakes in the qb more comprehensively the results of the present study indicate that compared with the mean value from 2004 to 2009 the total lws in 2020 has increased by 4 41 km3 which is equivalent to 19 49 12 53 and 16 85 based on grace jpl grace csr and grace gfz respectively supplementary table s2 the previous value was 1 1 jiao et al 2015 because that study used a single satellite and could only count seven small and medium lakes numerous studies still use this conclusion and argue that the change of lws in the qb is negligible which is not reasonable therefore the results presented herein are necessary and timely and contribute to a renewed understanding of the importance of lws in this basin the rapid increase in lws in the qb is consistent with the temperature changes reported by wang et al 2017 significantly increased glacier mass loss rates chen et al 2021 and the precipitation cycle zhang et al 2019 are important reasons for the increase of lws in tp however more research is needed to explain the increase in lws in the qb because this basin is extremely dry the impact of potential evapotranspiration is more pronounced than in other basins yang et al 2014 in addition the large increase in groundwater in recent years may need further verification li et al 2019 it can be expected that the drought conditions in the qb will be alleviated as global temperatures warm but potential water resource threats should still be noted 5 3 validation of hypsometric curve extrapolation accuracy assuming a fixed sample size the type of hypsometric curve directly affects the accuracy of its extrapolation fig 13 taking tuosu as an example and assuming that only fifteen pairs of sample data are available 30 of the total data and that the hypsometric curve increases monotonically the traditional criterion of highest r2 and lowest rmse will select the quadratic polynomial green r2 0 9615 rmse 0 1476 m to estimate the lake water level however using the remaining data to test the accuracy of the curve shows that the predicted lake water level differs from the actual lake water level by 7 16 0 28 m while the extrapolation accuracy of the unpromising logarithmic curve is between 0 04 and 1 81 m when the sample size is increased by 60 the extrapolation of the logarithmic curve r2 0 9904 rmse 0 1759 m is more accurate than that of the cubic polynomial curve r2 0 9911 rmse 0 1756 m therefore when the curve is extrapolated the traditional criterion is not reliable in practice all samples are generally used to fit the curve to ensure the accuracy of curve extrapolation therefore choosing a curve that works for extrapolation is a challenge we use the cross validation method and found that when using the sample of 30 of the data the mean absolute error of the logarithmic curve red is less than the quadratic polynomial curve green when we use 60 of the data as sample the mean absolute error of the logarithmic curve blue is less than the cubic polynomial curve magenta and this is the same as testing phase that is cross validation can identify curves with high extrapolation accuracy given sufficient data 98 data as samples the extrapolation accuracy of the cubic polynomial chosen by the proposed method is slightly lower 0 02 m 0 03 m but overall the proposed method avoids the risk of choosing a worse curve especially when the amount of data is insufficient the curve extrapolation accuracy of the proposed method is significantly higher than that of the traditional method as with the concept of geological maturity schwatke et al 2020 strahler 1952 this shows that the curve well represents the lake topography for the existing sample data however due to the diversity of lake topography the amount of data required for the maturity of different lake curves is uncertain in other words the traditional method is only effective when the amount of data satisfies the maturity of curves whereas the proposed method can select the correct curve regardless of the amount of data the hypsometric curve is used to predict lake water level so it is necessary to verify its prediction accuracy in the field of machine learning and deep learning lecun et al 2015 training and verification are required to build a model whereas verification is generally lacking when constructing a hypsometric curve for a lake busker et al 2019 dettmering et al 2020 lin et al 2020 weekley and li 2021 therefore our new criterion is an important theoretical supplement for constructing hypsometric curves for lakes 5 4 limitations and prospects of estimates of variations in lake water storage limited by the coverage of satellite altimetry data even if combined with multisource satellite data the lake water level of some lakes still lack observation making it impossible to construct hypsometric curves for these lakes four overflow lakes in the qb and one terminal lake fall into this category accounting for 5 09 of the total lake area in addition given the small variation in lake area 2 09 km2 and water level 0 97 m during the satellite observation period no strong relationship r2 0 222 can be established between them which indicated a weak correlation and anomalous trend of lake area and water level similarly doucuo has a similar situation fig 14 in summary the lake area for which the variations in lws cannot be estimated is 19 59 of the total lake area and increased from 253 47 12 58 km2 in 1987 to 516 32 18 65 km2 in 2020 accounting for 22 04 of the total variation in lake area if the rate of variation in lake area is equated with the rate of variation in lws the real variation in lws in 2020 was about 6 18 km3 another representative approach is to use lake areas and lake water levels derived from digital elevation models to estimate changes in lws the accuracy of this method has been verified by numerous studies qiao et al 2019b song et al 2013 yang et al 2017 and is widely used in the investigation of lakes on the tp this method does not face the above dilemma and even changes in the lws of small lakes can be estimated which makes large scale and long term comprehensive lake surveys a reality for example zhang et al 2021b investigated the change in lws of the tp and reported that the qb increased by 3 17 km3 from 1979 to 2019 this difference is explainable given the number of lakes investigated the time frame and the research methodology however this method is limited by the production time and accuracy of digital elevation models and the changing characteristics of lakes which may lead to low accuracy in estimating changes in lws of small lakes or of lakes with insignificant changes in water level although it is difficult for the proposed method to cover small lakes with the launch of more satellites especially the swot satellite biancamaria et al 2016 which has high spatiotemporal resolution and captures time synchronized lake water levels and lake areas the proposed method has broader prospects 6 conclusion this study uses multisource satellite data to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of 30 lakes over 10 km2 in hyperarid basins of northwest china from 1987 to 2020 the total lake area in the qaidam basin expanded by 82 63 with terminal lakes increasing more than overflow lakes the lake area varied most significantly in the center of the basin damming activities both created lakes and led to their disappearance and even the largest lakes in this basin are constantly being replaced in previous studies the construction of hypsometric curves of lakes lacked verification taking tuosu lake as an example we show herein that an error in predicting the lake water level can be as high as 7 16 m when selecting the hypsometric curve based only on the fit to sample data i e r2 and rmse we thus suggest selecting hypsometric curves based on cross validation which uses long time series data to accurately reconstruct lake water levels from 1987 to 2020 the total lws in the qb increased by 4 82 km3 as of the year 2000 both the rate and magnitude of increase in lws are evident from 2010 to 2020 damming activities caused water to shift from large shallow lakes to smaller deeper lakes although the lake area in 2010 was the same as in 2020 the lws was 43 93 of that in 2020 this shows that water conditions cannot be judged based only on lake area because of the diverse underwater topography of lakes at present variations in lws receive very little attention in the study of water cycles the present study shows that relative to the mean from 2004 to 2009 the increase in total lws accounts for 12 53 19 49 of the increase in terrestrial water storage in 2020 to better understand the water cycle process of the qb we hope that the subsequent research into water resources will fully consider variations in lws especially in basins with numerous lakes credit authorship contribution statement chuanhui zhang

editor in chief with the assistance of habib basha associate editor the effects of rainfall intensity and terrain structure on hillslope storage behavior upon saturation excess overland flow sof generation are not yet fully understood analytical solution techniques that provide direct insights into the hillslope storage behavior were adopted in this study the threshold of storage tso at critical rainfall intensity n 0 the minimum rainfall intensity to generate sof and the storage upon sof generation so at rainfall intensity n n 0 were derived using analytical solutions of the kinematic wave equation over unit width shallow sloping aquifers the derived analytical solutions match the results of the numerical models of the boussinesq equation for 25 idealized hillslopes under various rainfall intensities it was found that as n n 0 tso is determined by hillslope structures i e tso on the convex hillslopes is always greater than that on concave hillslopes with the same gradient and tso on convex and concave hillslopes gradually approaches as the gradient increases as n n 0 hillslope storage dynamics is characterised by variable storage behavior as rainfall intensity increasing i e so increases with n an inflection point of rainfall intensity n 1 below which the curvature of the bedrock profile has a limited effect on so was found although n 1 was greater on steeper hillslope the corresponding values of so 1 on hillslopes under different gradients are close which means that the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so is balanced at n n 1 this study helps to deepen our understanding of the quantitative role of rainfall intensity and profile structure in the process of runoff generation and has the potential to improve the free storage capacity parameter in conceptual models keywords saturation excess overland flow storage threshold kinematic wave equation analytical solution 1 introduction the threshold phenomenon for saturation excess overland flow sof is critical for peak flow prediction in many humid catchments with steep shallow soil mantled hillslopes western and grayson 1998 as the discharge of overland flow is often several times greater than that of subsurface flow during heavy precipitation events taha et al 1997 the threshold of storage upon sof generation tso is defined as the minimum hillslope storage for initiating sof dunne et al 1975 freeze 1974 gburek 1990 kirkby 1988 sof occurs firstly at the toe of a hillslope and the saturated area as well as the corresponding storage can vary during a rainfall event dunne and black 1970a 1970b freeze 1974 that is as rainfall increases the saturated area can expand upslope causing increased hillslope storage dunne et al 1975 bernier 1985 hence quantifying the variable storage behavior during rainfall events will be helpful in deepening our understanding of hillslope runoff generation in a forested headwater catchment fluctuations in the subsurface water table during rainfall events have been found to be the main cause of surface saturation glaser et al 2020 antonelli et al 2020 and they hence impact the hillslope storage upon sof generation so surface and bedrock topography have been found to play important roles in the hydrodynamics of forest hillslopes and catchments anderson and burt 1978 detty and mcguire 2010 freer et al 2002 han et al 2021 haught and van meerveld 2011 tani 2013 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wang and chen 2021 wu et al 2021 as an important driving factor rainfall intensity is also correlated with water table dynamics and the formation of saturated area han et al 2020 observed that with increasing rainfall intensity the subsurface water table level can increase greatly and the saturated area can be extended mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 found that the water table responded noticeably to rainfall intensity however the quantitative effects of rainfall intensity and hillslope structure on the storage behavior upon sof generation is not explicitly understood so how to quantitatively evaluate the effects of rainfall intensity and hillslope structure on the storage behavior upon sof generation due to the large scale nature of field experiments gevaert et al 2014 the inherent uncertainty of field data dusek and vogel 2016 and the simultaneous effects of various controls it is so far difficult to accurately define the effects of rainfall intensity and hillslope structure on sof generation through field observations analytical solutions can provide direct insights into the dynamic behavior of subsurface flows fan and bras 1998 troch et al 2003 although analytical solutions can only be obtained through permissible assumptions under predefined conditions they are important especially in the absence of sufficient aquifer characteristics wang and luo 2020 many approximate solutions have been proposed in the literature these include the solutions of the linearized boussinesq equation for hillslopes with gentle to moderate gradients and the kinematic wave equation for steep hillslopes beldring et al 2000 beven 1981 brutsaert 1994 germann et al 1986 hogarth and parlange 1999 lockington et al 2000 parlange et al 2001 verhoest and troch 2000 the theoretical solutions of hillslope storage dynamics equations proposed by fan and bras 1998 and troch et al 2002 troch et al 2003 even describe the processes of subsurface stormflow for hillslopes with more complex structures through a one dimensional storage capacity function however the representative unit width boussinesq hillslope aquifer bha is still widely used in the study of flow generation mechanisms and effects of various factors on the hydrological response alemie et al 2019 bitew et al 2020 harman and sivapalan 2009 harman and kim 2018 for instance harman and sivapalan 2009 developed a dimensionless framework for saturated subsurface lateral flow through unit width hillslopes based on the boussinesq equation alemie et al 2019 developed a model for predicting groundwater table heights for unit width bha bitew et al 2020 developed and applied a dynamic interflow model of a unit width bha to simulate interflow processes with percolation this is because simplified unit width structured hillslopes can provide elegant and revealing insights into first order controls that are difficult to tease out from more complex models harman and kim 2018 hence this study focuses on the subsurface water dynamics on unit width hillslopes to further explore the potential of classical analytical solutions to kinematic wave subsurface flow the aim of this study was to explore the quantitative effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on the storage behavior upon sof generation under simplified and or controlled conditions instead of quantifying the hillslope storage upon sof generation in the real world in section 2 the related methodology and theoretical background are introduced in detail the analytical solutions of tso at critical rainfall intensity so as rainfall intensity greater than critical rainfall intensity hereinafter referred to as so and related parameters of these two terms are derived from the kinematic wave equations in section 3 the setting of hillslope parameters and rainfall intensity are introduced in section 4 the derived values of so and occurrence time are compared with those determined by the boussinesq numerical model and the results for the water table height profile tso and so are presented the variable storage behavior and the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so are discussed in section 5 2 formulation of analytical expressions 2 1 background the kinematic wave equation was applied to a unit width sloping bha with a thin soil mantle underlain by impermeable sloping bedrock fig 1 a the model is limited to the saturated component of the hillslope response and unsaturated flow is not included alemie et al 2019 beldring et al 2000 beven 1981 henderson and wooding 1964 in forest hillslopes it is expected that rainfall will be directly converted into subsurface stormflow once the highly permeable soil is in or beyond the state of field capacity kirkby 1988 in addition the height of capillary rise can be ignored as the soils in these areas are usually coarse textured and highly pervious ogden and watts 2000 furthermore the kinematic wave approximation is applicable to moderate to steep hillslopes the lower limit of the relevant applicable hillslopes for the kinematic wave equation is defined by the value of λ index λ 4 n cos θ k sin 2 θ where n is the rainfall intensity θ is the hillslope gradient and k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity being less than 0 75 which is the ratio of rainfall accumulation to soil water drainage beven 1981 in this study it was assumed that the hydraulic characteristics of the hillslope were spatially homogeneous and the rainfall intensity over the hillslope was uniformly distributed along the hillslope the continuity equation is given as 1 q x μ h t n where q is the lateral flow l3 t h is the height of the water table above the bedrock l n is the rainfall intensity l t and μ is the drainable porosity fig 1a defines the coordinate system and symbols it is assumed that the hydraulic gradient at any point within the saturated zone is equal to the bedrock gradient therefore the flow can be described by a kinematic form of darcy s equation such that 2 q k h z where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t and z is the bedrock gradient also the first derivative of the bedrock terrain function z x with respect to x this is the form of the equation used by fan and bras 1998 as well as by troch et al 2002 combining the continuity equation eq 1 and the kinematic form of darcy s equation eq 2 a quasi linear wave equation in terms of the subsurface water table height can be obtained 3 h t k z μ h x n μ k z μ h where z is the second derivative of the bedrock terrain function with respect to x 1 l eq 3 is the kinematic wave equation for a hillslope with bedrock profile curvature in this study the bedrock profile is described with two functions as in liu et al 2016 that is a second order polynomial function given by eq 4 and a linear function given by eq 5 as a special case 4 z z 0 α x β x 2 5 z z 0 α x where α is the gradient of the linear bedrock profile and is the coefficient of the first order term of the second order polynomial profile the value of β is the curvature of the bedrock profile z 0 l is the bedrock elevation at x 0 the bedrock elevation at x l is set to 0 so according to eq 4 α in the second order polynomial function can be represented by z 0 and β as 6 α z 0 l β l the initial and boundary dirichlet conditions are assumed as follows norbiato and borga 2008 7 h x 0 p x 0 x l 8 h 0 t 0 t where h x 0 is the subsurface water table height l at distance x from the divide and at time t 0 p x denotes the initial subsurface water table height along with the hillslope l l is the length of the hillslope in the horizontal direction l and h 0 t is the subsurface water table height at the divide at time t l eq 3 in storage forms can be analytically solved according to the method of characteristics subject to the above initial and boundary condition the details of the solutions are presented in appendix a the solution is given by for bedrock profiles described by second order polynomial functions β 0 9 h nx k α 2 β x x α 2 β exp 2 k β μ t 1 h p ξ exp 2 k β μ t

the soil moisture reaches the field water capacity a subsurface water table is formed gevaert et al 2014 tso is defined as the free water storage from the formation of the subsurface water table to the rise of the subsurface water table at the toe of the hillslope to the ground surface the initial condition is the formation of a subsurface water table that is the initial subsurface water table

mechanism of tso and so fig 1c e as shown in fig 1c for n n 0 the water table cannot rise to the ground surface for n n 0 the water table at the toe of the hillslope can just rise to the ground surface and tso is the minimum storage for yielding sof on a given hillslope fig 1d for n n 0 fig 1e the water table in the lower hillslope near the outlet rises to the ground surface simultaneously and the storage at this time is so 3 ideal hillslopes and parameters set in section 2 a second order polynomial function and linear function eqs 4 and 5 to describe the elevation as a function of the distance from the top of the hillslope in the coordinate system shown in fig 1a the hillslopes with a larger z 0 are steeper assuming that all hillslopes are of the same length in this case z 0 can be used to reflect the gradient of the hillslope to simulate the values of so and t under different rainfall intensities 25 idealized hillslopes with different combinations of z 0 and β were adopted there were a total of five different profile curvatures β 0 0025 0 0015 0 0 0015 and 0 0025 multiplied by five gradients z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m within three types of hillslope geometries straight concave and convex see in fig 2 the different parameterizations are presented in table 2 we assumed that l 100 m k 1 m h μ 0 04 d 1 m and p x 0 for all 25 idealized hillslopes rainfall intensities ranging from 1 to 20 mm h with intervals of 1 mm h were initially set as mentioned in section 2 1 the kinematic wave method works well for λ 4 n cos θ k sin 2 θ 0 75 where θ is the hillslope gradient θ arctan z 0 l in the coordinate system of fig 1a beven 1981 to satisfy this condition the rainfall intensities were set to range from 1 to 16 mm h for hillslopes with z 0 30 m moreover in the numerical boussinesq model q 0 0 was adopted as the upper boundary to represent that the hillslope divide is a no flow boundary and the lower boundary was set to h x 0 at a fictitious location far away from the actual boundary at x 10l so that the presence of the fictitious boundary has no effect on the water table or the flow rate at the real boundary that is free drainage conditions at the outlet fig 1b in addition relative bias γ of so as the results of the analytical solution and the numerical solution is obtained by dividing their difference by the numerical solution here γ greater than 0 represents an overestimation and γ less than 0 represents an underestimation 4 results 4 1 comparison of the kinematic wave and the boussinesq methods the so t and water table height h on 25 hillslopes were simulated using both the kinematic wave analytical solution and the boussinesq numerical solution the values of so and t derived using the kinematic wave analytical solutions match those derived using the boussinesq numerical solutions for all experimental hillslopes the relative bias γ of the so between the analytical solution and numerical solution is shown in table s1 the missing values in table s1 represent the scenarios in which sof did not occur under the corresponding rainfall intensity there is no hillslope on which sof occurs at n 1 mm h for rainfall events with 1 mm h n 13 mm h sof was observed only on some of the 25 hillslopes however for the events with n 13 mm h sof occurred on all 25 hillslopes the values of γ range from 1 18 to 1 01 in all scenarios table s1 the vast majority of the values of γ are larger than 0 which means that most values of so obtained through the analytical solutions were slightly overestimated compared to those using numerical solutions the main reason for the overestimation of so is that the computed profiles of the water table height by the exact solutions of the kinematic wave equation are characterized by sharp fronts however the profiles of water table height by the numerical solutions of the boussinesq equation would show smoother fronts owing to numerical dissipation the difference between the two methods is illustrated in 2a 2c in fig 3 4 2 the simulated profile of subsurface water table height understanding the rising process of the water table is also of great significance for understanding the hillslope storage behavior upon sof generation the profile of the water table height consists of two main parts the steady state part on the upper section of the hillslope and the uniform water depth part on the lower section of the hillslope before the entire hillslope reaches equilibrium t t c 1a 1c in fig 3 shows the evolution of the profiles of water table height on straight concave and convex hillslopes at characteristic time instances under a constant rainfall event with n 8 mm h here only a rainfall intensity of 8 mm h was adopted for the display under which a wide range of scenarios so fulfilled or unfulfilled can be observed as shown in 1a 1c in fig 3 hillslopes can be divided into two categories according to whether the water table rises to the ground surface the first category is made up of hillslopes where the water table can rise to the ground surface i e where so can be fulfilled including hillslopes 1 14 16 18 and 23 at n 8 mm h in this category one situation is that the water table on these hillslopes rises directly to the ground surface before the equilibrium time t c and thus the lower part of the hillslope will be saturated simultaneously owing to the uniform water depth however for a hillslope where the water table rises to the ground surface just at the equilibrium time t c only the toe of the hillslope will be saturated the corresponding soil water storage when the water table rises to the surface of this category of hillslope is treated as so in the second category so cannot be fulfilled which includes hillslopes 15 19 22 and 24 25 at n 8 mm h after the entire hillslope reaches a steady state at equilibrium time t c the water table in these hillslopes cannot rise to the ground surface i e sof will be missed in the rainfall event chosen moreover the steeper is the hillslope the shallower is the steady state water depth hillslopes 1 6 11 16 and 21 are examples of this phenomenon it is evident that uniform water depth can rise at the same rate on hillslopes with the same curvature albeit with different gradients as shown in 1a 1c in fig 3 as an example the uniform water depths on the lower parts of hillslopes 2 7 12 17 and 22 hillslopes with the same curvature β 0 0015 all rise from 0 21 m at 1 h to 0 70 m at 3 h 4 3 estimations of tso there is a corresponding n 0 for a hillslope with a given profile structure fig 4 summarizes the effects of hillslope characteristics on n 0 tso and t 0 for 25 hillslopes the values of n 0 derived using the kinematic wave analytical solutions are equal to those derived using the boussinesq numerical solutions and the values of tso also matches those of numerical solutions only the values of t 0 were underestimated the main reason is that when the water table height profile of the numerical solution is close to a steady state the water table height will rise at a very slow rate in particular these values were significantly underestimated on gentle hillslopes this is because the diffusive term in the boussinesq model is less important for such terrains n 0 increases linearly with z 0 and decreases with increasing β the convex hillslope requires a larger critical rainfall intensity to produce sof than a concave hillslope similarly the value of tso on convex hillslopes is larger than that on concave hillslopes fig 4b the variation trend for the value of tso as a function of the bedrock gradient z 0 is markedly different under different profile shape scenarios β the value of tso on a straight hillslope is the same with different gradients and the value of tso on concave hillslopes is positively correlated with z 0 while the value of tso on convex hillslopes is negatively correlated with z 0 as z 0 increases tso on steep hillslopes with different profile curvatures gradually approaches tso on straight hillslopes which are 20 mm the opposite curvatures e g β 0 0025 result in an unexpectedly identical t 0 fig 4c in addition t 0 on hillslopes with greater gradients and smaller absolute profile curvatures is smaller as z 0 60 m for z 0 greater than 60 m and less than 100 m t 0 on hillslopes with different profile shapes tends to be the same 4 4 estimations of so as n n 0 the average values of so are 33 50 31 30 29 66 28 09 and 26 11 mm on hillslopes with z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m respectively fig 5 it is evident that the steeper the hillslope the smaller the value of so under the same rainfall intensity as a steep hillslope is not conducive to storing water the value of the so on a given hillslope increased with rainfall intensity as an example for the hillslope with z 0 30 m and β 0 0025 fig 5a so 11 77 mm for n 1 mm h whereas so 34 29 mm for n 16 mm h furthermore the slope of the lines so n on convex hillslopes is greater than that on straight and concave hillslopes which indicates that the values of so on convex hillslopes are more sensitive to rainfall intensity than those on straight and concave hillslopes thus these lines of s n for different profile curvatures at each gradient fig 5a e tend to intersect each other and the points of intersection are extremely close when the rain intensity is lower than the rain intensity near these intersections the values of so on hillslopes with different shapes are relatively close when the rain intensity is higher than the rain intensity near these intersections the values of so on convex hillslopes are significantly larger than those on concave hillslopes here we define the rain intensity below which the curvature of the bedrock profile has a limited effect on so as the inflection point of rainfall intensity namely n 1 and the corresponding so is defined as so 1 fig 5 the physical meaning of n 1 and so 1 is discussed in more detail in section 5 the values of n 1 and so 1 are approximated empirically by averaging the abscissa and ordinate of all intersections the empirical values of n 1 differ notably among hillslopes with different gradients for z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m the values of n 1 are 3 5 6 0 7 9 10 2 and 13 4 mm h respectively these figures suggest that the steeper the hillslope the larger the empirical value of n 1 for z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m so 1 23 3 24 8 24 8 25 2 and 25 1 mm respectively the values of so 1 on hillslopes with different gradients are very close with an average of 24 6 mm the occurrence times of 25 hillslopes under different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 6 the average values of t are 4 50 3 94 3 47 3 15 and 2 75 h on hillslopes with z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m respectively it is worth noting that a steep hillslope cannot be saturated under a low rainfall intensity i e t is inconsequential in these scenarios however with different gradients the occurrence times are the same on hillslopes with the same curvatures under a given rainfall intensity however with the same z 0 the values of t on concave hillslopes are less than those on straight and convex hillslopes under the same rainfall intensity furthermore results indicate that t decreases with an increase in rainfall intensity 5 discussions 5 1 variable storage behavior impacted by rainfall intensity the value of the so on a given hillslope increases with rainfall intensity which reflects the variable storage behavior this is due to the increase in the subsurface saturation zone caused by the higher water table with rising rainfall intensity as an example for hillslopes 1 2 and 4 with z 0 30 m the profiles of water table height at time t under four different rainfall intensities n 5 10 15 and 20 mm h are shown in 2a 2c in fig 3 the profiles of water table height on all 25 hillslopes are shown in fig s1 rainfall intensity is an indispensable contributing factor in models for predicting the subsurface water table on hillslopes alemie et al 2019 dralle et al 2014 in addition to subsurface water dynamics the widely studied variable source area can also help verify the variable storage behavior as rainfall increases the saturated area can expand upslope dunne et al 1975 bernier 1985 causing increased hillslope storage for example when n increases from 5 mm h to 20 mm h the saturated area on hillslope 1 2a in fig 3 expands by 45 m and the corresponding so increases from 28 mm to 37 mm some field experiments have found similar phenomena tanaka et al 1988 found that the maximum extent of the saturated area occurred following the peak rainfall and it contracted quickly as rainfall intensity decreased han et al 2020 observed that with increasing rainfall intensity the saturated area can be extended as expected the numerical results by ogden and watts 2000 also indicated that the saturated area increased with rainfall intensity in this study we present the quantitative relationships between rainfall intensity and so using analytical solution techniques this quantification of so has the potential to improve the free storage capacity parameter in some conceptual models free storage capacity which is the so in this study is an essential parameter which determines the partitioning of runoff into subsurface flow and saturation excess overland flow in conceptual models as in the sacramento model e g burnash and ferral 1973 duan et al 2001 and the xinanjiang model e g zhao 1992 liu et al 2012 however these conceptual models set the free water storage capacity to a constant and can not account for lateral redistribution of water e g duan et al 2001 van esse et al 2013 zhao 1992 which however was a crucial mechanism of overland flow generation on a hillslope what we found here is that the free storage capacity is not really a constant but a function of rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity soil depth etc the calculation formula of so has been given which can be used to estimate the free water storage capacity in the conceptual model 5 2 the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so the existence of n 1 and so 1 results from the differences in the sensitivities of so to rainfall intensity on concave and convex hillslopes reflecting the compound effect of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so as seen in 2a 2c in fig 3 the extent to which the water table rises to the ground surface i e surface saturated area on the convex hillslope is larger than those on the straight or concave hillslopes with the same z 0 under equal increments of rainfall intensity therefore the so on a convex hillslope is more sensitive to rainfall intensity when the rainfall intensity increases from 5 mm h to 20 mm h the surface saturated area on hillslope 4 expanded by 67 m while it expanded by 45 m on hillslope 1 and 37 m on hillslope 2 this is because the concave hillslope gradually steepened upward while the gradient of the convex hillslope demonstrated the opposite trend when rainfall intensity is low saturated area is formed near the hillslope toe but with increasingly heavier rainfall the saturated extent will move upslope correspondingly during this time the upslope gradient plays an important role in runoff generation the upslope part of the concave hillslope is steep and water can be quickly drained however the upslope of the convex hillslope is gentle which is conducive to storing water so the water table rises more under equal increments of rainfall intensity an explicit expression for n 1 was derived using the taylor s series expansion of analytical solution of so for small values of β expanding eq 26 in a taylor s series for small values of β a second order equation in β was obtained equating the formulas for β and β we then obtain an approximation to n 1 for the intersection point as 28 n 1 4 d k z 0 3 l 2 n 1 turned out to be independent of β as shown on fig 5 and proportional to z 0 for the given hillslope parameters n 1 4 6 8 10 and 13 3 mm h for z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m which are similar to the empirical values one notable finding is that the values of so 1 on hillslopes with different gradients are very similar all approximately 24 6 mm as mentioned above the values of n 1 on steep hillslopes are larger that is the negative effect of a larger gradient on so is partially compensated by the positive increasing effect of larger n 1 on so which makes so 1 on hillslopes with different gradients approximately equal in the case of different parameter combinations of rainfall intensity gradient and profile curvature the values of all sos are similar when n is close to n 1 this can be explained by the balancing of the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so as for t it decreases with an increase in n and the values of t on hillslopes with different profile curvatures tend to be close to the increase in n this indicates that the effect of rainfall intensity controls t during heavy rainfall events rather than profile curvature another important finding is that the occurrence times are the same on hillslopes with the same curvature under a given rainfall intensity even though their z 0 values differ because the uniform water depths on them have the same rising intensity as shown in 1a 1c in fig 3 this is a result of the balancing effects of different influencing factors the steep hillslopes drain faster and therefore store water more slowly but the corresponding value of so on steep hillslopes is also smaller the smaller so compensates for the negative effects of faster drainage on steep hillslopes resulting in the same t as that on a gentle hillslope compared with concave convex and straight hillslopes the hillslope in the real world is more likely to be a mixture of these three profile shapes to better understand the interaction of rain intensity and profile shape the storage behavior upon sof generation on mixed shape hillslopes were also discussed using boussinesq numerical solution see supplementary material for details only convex top and concave base hillslopes were studied which are more common in nature pelletier and rasmussen 2009 roering et al 1999 the mixed shape hillslope profile is described with piecewise function the upper part of the convex hillslope the lower part of the concave hillslope and the middle segment described with linear function we found that the storage behavior upon sof generation on mixed shape hillslopes are more similar to that on concave hillslopes this is because the middle linear segment with steep gradient makes it difficult for the surface saturated area to reach the upper part under the rainfall intensities of 1 20 mm h studied therefore the lower part of the hillslope plays a more important role in the generation of sof 6 summary and conclusions in this study the analytical expressions of hillslope storage behavior upon sof generation were derived based on the kinematic wave equation and the derived analytical solutions matched the results of the numerical boussinesq equation well the simulation results of 25 idealized hillslopes under different rainfall intensities 1 n 20 mm h were studied we summarize our findings as follows 1 tso critical rainfall intensity n 0 that controls whether sof occurs and occurrence time t 0 were derived from the hillslope structure parameters n 0 and tso on convex hillslopes are greater than those on concave hillslopes while n 0 increases linearly with the gradient and the tso on concave and convex hillslopes gradually approaches as the gradient increases the opposite curvatures can result in identical t 0 values t 0 on hillslopes with different curvatures gradually decreases and tends to be equal as the gradient increases 2 as rainfall intensity greater than critical rainfall intensity n 0 the variable storage behavior with increasing rainfall intensity was found i e so increases with n the occurrence time t decreases with an increase in rainfall intensity the inflection point of rainfall intensity n 1 below which the curvature of the bedrock profile has a limited effect on so was found n 1 is larger on steeper hillslopes but the values of so 1 corresponding to n 1 on hillslopes with different gradients are very close which means that the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure are balanced in this study the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on hillslope storage behavior upon sof generation were quantified this can contribute to our understanding the hillslope runoff generation further research should be conducted to extend the analytical framework to consider complex hillslope structures with convergence and divergence

editor in chief with the assistance of habib basha associate editor the effects of rainfall intensity and terrain structure on hillslope storage behavior upon saturation excess overland flow sof generation are not yet fully understood analytical solution techniques that provide direct insights into the hillslope storage behavior were adopted in this study the threshold of storage tso at critical rainfall intensity n 0 the minimum rainfall intensity to generate sof and the storage upon sof generation so at rainfall intensity n n 0 were derived using analytical solutions of the kinematic wave equation over unit width shallow sloping aquifers the derived analytical solutions match the results of the numerical models of the boussinesq equation for 25 idealized hillslopes under various rainfall intensities it was found that as n n 0 tso is determined by hillslope structures i e tso on the convex hillslopes is always greater than that on concave hillslopes with the same gradient and tso on convex and concave hillslopes gradually approaches as the gradient increases as n n 0 hillslope storage dynamics is characterised by variable storage behavior as rainfall intensity increasing i e so increases with n an inflection point of rainfall intensity n 1 below which the curvature of the bedrock profile has a limited effect on so was found although n 1 was greater on steeper hillslope the corresponding values of so 1 on hillslopes under different gradients are close which means that the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so is balanced at n n 1 this study helps to deepen our understanding of the quantitative role of rainfall intensity and profile structure in the process of runoff generation and has the potential to improve the free storage capacity parameter in conceptual models keywords saturation excess overland flow storage threshold kinematic wave equation analytical solution 1 introduction the threshold phenomenon for saturation excess overland flow sof is critical for peak flow prediction in many humid catchments with steep shallow soil mantled hillslopes western and grayson 1998 as the discharge of overland flow is often several times greater than that of subsurface flow during heavy precipitation events taha et al 1997 the threshold of storage upon sof generation tso is defined as the minimum hillslope storage for initiating sof dunne et al 1975 freeze 1974 gburek 1990 kirkby 1988 sof occurs firstly at the toe of a hillslope and the saturated area as well as the corresponding storage can vary during a rainfall event dunne and black 1970a 1970b freeze 1974 that is as rainfall increases the saturated area can expand upslope causing increased hillslope storage dunne et al 1975 bernier 1985 hence quantifying the variable storage behavior during rainfall events will be helpful in deepening our understanding of hillslope runoff generation in a forested headwater catchment fluctuations in the subsurface water table during rainfall events have been found to be the main cause of surface saturation glaser et al 2020 antonelli et al 2020 and they hence impact the hillslope storage upon sof generation so surface and bedrock topography have been found to play important roles in the hydrodynamics of forest hillslopes and catchments anderson and burt 1978 detty and mcguire 2010 freer et al 2002 han et al 2021 haught and van meerveld 2011 tani 2013 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wang and chen 2021 wu et al 2021 as an important driving factor rainfall intensity is also correlated with water table dynamics and the formation of saturated area han et al 2020 observed that with increasing rainfall intensity the subsurface water table level can increase greatly and the saturated area can be extended mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 found that the water table responded noticeably to rainfall intensity however the quantitative effects of rainfall intensity and hillslope structure on the storage behavior upon sof generation is not explicitly understood so how to quantitatively evaluate the effects of rainfall intensity and hillslope structure on the storage behavior upon sof generation due to the large scale nature of field experiments gevaert et al 2014 the inherent uncertainty of field data dusek and vogel 2016 and the simultaneous effects of various controls it is so far difficult to accurately define the effects of rainfall intensity and hillslope structure on sof generation through field observations analytical solutions can provide direct insights into the dynamic behavior of subsurface flows fan and bras 1998 troch et al 2003 although analytical solutions can only be obtained through permissible assumptions under predefined conditions they are important especially in the absence of sufficient aquifer characteristics wang and luo 2020 many approximate solutions have been proposed in the literature these include the solutions of the linearized boussinesq equation for hillslopes with gentle to moderate gradients and the kinematic wave equation for steep hillslopes beldring et al 2000 beven 1981 brutsaert 1994 germann et al 1986 hogarth and parlange 1999 lockington et al 2000 parlange et al 2001 verhoest and troch 2000 the theoretical solutions of hillslope storage dynamics equations proposed by fan and bras 1998 and troch et al 2002 troch et al 2003 even describe the processes of subsurface stormflow for hillslopes with more complex structures through a one dimensional storage capacity function however the representative unit width boussinesq hillslope aquifer bha is still widely used in the study of flow generation mechanisms and effects of various factors on the hydrological response alemie et al 2019 bitew et al 2020 harman and sivapalan 2009 harman and kim 2018 for instance harman and sivapalan 2009 developed a dimensionless framework for saturated subsurface lateral flow through unit width hillslopes based on the boussinesq equation alemie et al 2019 developed a model for predicting groundwater table heights for unit width bha bitew et al 2020 developed and applied a dynamic interflow model of a unit width bha to simulate interflow processes with percolation this is because simplified unit width structured hillslopes can provide elegant and revealing insights into first order controls that are difficult to tease out from more complex models harman and kim 2018 hence this study focuses on the subsurface water dynamics on unit width hillslopes to further explore the potential of classical analytical solutions to kinematic wave subsurface flow the aim of this study was to explore the quantitative effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on the storage behavior upon sof generation under simplified and or controlled conditions instead of quantifying the hillslope storage upon sof generation in the real world in section 2 the related methodology and theoretical background are introduced in detail the analytical solutions of tso at critical rainfall intensity so as rainfall intensity greater than critical rainfall intensity hereinafter referred to as so and related parameters of these two terms are derived from the kinematic wave equations in section 3 the setting of hillslope parameters and rainfall intensity are introduced in section 4 the derived values of so and occurrence time are compared with those determined by the boussinesq numerical model and the results for the water table height profile tso and so are presented the variable storage behavior and the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so are discussed in section 5 2 formulation of analytical expressions 2 1 background the kinematic wave equation was applied to a unit width sloping bha with a thin soil mantle underlain by impermeable sloping bedrock fig 1 a the model is limited to the saturated component of the hillslope response and unsaturated flow is not included alemie et al 2019 beldring et al 2000 beven 1981 henderson and wooding 1964 in forest hillslopes it is expected that rainfall will be directly converted into subsurface stormflow once the highly permeable soil is in or beyond the state of field capacity kirkby 1988 in addition the height of capillary rise can be ignored as the soils in these areas are usually coarse textured and highly pervious ogden and watts 2000 furthermore the kinematic wave approximation is applicable to moderate to steep hillslopes the lower limit of the relevant applicable hillslopes for the kinematic wave equation is defined by the value of λ index λ 4 n cos θ k sin 2 θ where n is the rainfall intensity θ is the hillslope gradient and k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity being less than 0 75 which is the ratio of rainfall accumulation to soil water drainage beven 1981 in this study it was assumed that the hydraulic characteristics of the hillslope were spatially homogeneous and the rainfall intensity over the hillslope was uniformly distributed along the hillslope the continuity equation is given as 1 q x μ h t n where q is the lateral flow l3 t h is the height of the water table above the bedrock l n is the rainfall intensity l t and μ is the drainable porosity fig 1a defines the coordinate system and symbols it is assumed that the hydraulic gradient at any point within the saturated zone is equal to the bedrock gradient therefore the flow can be described by a kinematic form of darcy s equation such that 2 q k h z where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t and z is the bedrock gradient also the first derivative of the bedrock terrain function z x with respect to x this is the form of the equation used by fan and bras 1998 as well as by troch et al 2002 combining the continuity equation eq 1 and the kinematic form of darcy s equation eq 2 a quasi linear wave equation in terms of the subsurface water table height can be obtained 3 h t k z μ h x n μ k z μ h where z is the second derivative of the bedrock terrain function with respect to x 1 l eq 3 is the kinematic wave equation for a hillslope with bedrock profile curvature in this study the bedrock profile is described with two functions as in liu et al 2016 that is a second order polynomial function given by eq 4 and a linear function given by eq 5 as a special case 4 z z 0 α x β x 2 5 z z 0 α x where α is the gradient of the linear bedrock profile and is the coefficient of the first order term of the second order polynomial profile the value of β is the curvature of the bedrock profile z 0 l is the bedrock elevation at x 0 the bedrock elevation at x l is set to 0 so according to eq 4 α in the second order polynomial function can be represented by z 0 and β as 6 α z 0 l β l the initial and boundary dirichlet conditions are assumed as follows norbiato and borga 2008 7 h x 0 p x 0 x l 8 h 0 t 0 t where h x 0 is the subsurface water table height l at distance x from the

the soil moisture reaches the field water capacity a subsurface water table is formed gevaert et al 2014 tso is defined as the free water storage from the formation of the subsurface water table to the rise of the subsurface water table at the toe of the hillslope to the ground surface the initial condition is the formation of a subsurface water table that is the initial subsurface water table

mechanism of tso and so fig 1c e as shown in fig 1c for n n 0 the water table cannot rise to the ground surface for n n 0 the water table at the toe of the hillslope can just rise to the ground surface and tso is the minimum storage for yielding sof on a given hillslope fig 1d for n n 0 fig 1e the water table in the lower hillslope near the outlet rises to the ground surface simultaneously and the storage at this time is so 3 ideal hillslopes and parameters set in section 2 a second order polynomial function and linear function eqs 4 and 5 to describe the elevation as a function of the distance from the top of the hillslope in the coordinate system shown in fig 1a the hillslopes with a larger z 0 are steeper assuming that all hillslopes are of the same length in this case z 0 can be used to reflect the gradient of the hillslope to simulate the values of so and t under different rainfall intensities 25 idealized hillslopes with different combinations of z 0 and β were adopted there were a total of five different profile curvatures β 0 0025 0 0015 0 0 0015 and 0 0025 multiplied by five gradients z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m within three types of hillslope geometries straight concave and convex see in fig 2 the different parameterizations are presented in table 2 we assumed that l 100 m k 1 m h μ 0 04 d 1 m and p x 0 for all 25 idealized hillslopes rainfall intensities ranging from 1 to 20 mm h with intervals of 1 mm h were initially set as mentioned in section 2 1 the kinematic wave method works well for λ 4 n cos θ k sin 2 θ 0 75 where θ is the hillslope gradient θ arctan z 0 l in the coordinate system of fig 1a beven 1981 to satisfy this condition the rainfall intensities were set to range from 1 to 16 mm h for hillslopes with z 0 30 m moreover in the numerical boussinesq model q 0 0 was adopted as the upper boundary to represent that the hillslope divide is a no flow boundary and the lower boundary was set to h x 0 at a fictitious location far away from the actual boundary at x 10l so that the presence of the fictitious boundary has no effect on the water table or the flow rate at the real boundary that is free drainage conditions at the outlet fig 1b in addition relative bias γ of so as the results of the analytical solution and the numerical solution is obtained by dividing their difference by the numerical solution here γ greater than 0 represents an overestimation and γ less than 0 represents an underestimation 4 results 4 1 comparison of the kinematic wave and the boussinesq methods the so t and water table height h on 25 hillslopes were simulated using both the kinematic wave analytical solution and the boussinesq numerical solution the values of so and t derived using the kinematic wave analytical solutions match those derived using the boussinesq numerical solutions for all experimental hillslopes the relative bias γ of the so between the analytical solution and numerical solution is shown in table s1 the missing values in table s1 represent the scenarios in which sof did not occur under the corresponding rainfall intensity there is no hillslope on which sof occurs at n 1 mm h for rainfall events with 1 mm h n 13 mm h sof was observed only on some of the 25 hillslopes however for the events with n 13 mm h sof occurred on all 25 hillslopes the values of γ range from 1 18 to 1 01 in all scenarios table s1 the vast majority of the values of γ are larger than 0 which means that most values of so obtained through the analytical solutions were slightly overestimated compared to those using numerical solutions the main reason for the overestimation of so is that the computed profiles of the water table height by the exact solutions of the kinematic wave equation are characterized by sharp fronts however the profiles of water table height by the numerical solutions of the boussinesq equation would show smoother fronts owing to numerical dissipation the difference between the two methods is illustrated in 2a 2c in fig 3 4 2 the simulated profile of subsurface water table height understanding the rising process of the water table is also of great significance for understanding the hillslope storage behavior upon sof generation the profile of the water table height consists of two main parts the steady state part on the upper section of the hillslope and the uniform water depth part on the lower section of the hillslope before the entire hillslope reaches equilibrium t t c 1a 1c in fig 3 shows the evolution of the profiles of water table height on straight concave and convex hillslopes at characteristic time instances under a constant rainfall event with n 8 mm h here only a rainfall intensity of 8 mm h was adopted for the display under which a wide range of scenarios so fulfilled or unfulfilled can be observed as shown in 1a 1c in fig 3 hillslopes can be divided into two categories according to whether the water table rises to the ground surface the first category is made up of hillslopes where the water table can rise to the ground surface i e where so can be fulfilled including hillslopes 1 14 16 18 and 23 at n 8 mm h in this category one situation is that the water table on these hillslopes rises directly to the ground surface before the equilibrium time t c and thus the lower part of the hillslope will be saturated simultaneously owing to the uniform water depth however for a hillslope where the water table rises to the ground surface just at the equilibrium time t c only the toe of the hillslope will be saturated the corresponding soil water storage when the water table rises to the surface of this category of hillslope is treated as so in the second category so cannot be fulfilled which includes hillslopes 15 19 22 and 24 25 at n 8 mm h after the entire hillslope reaches a steady state at equilibrium time t c the water table in these hillslopes cannot rise to the ground surface i e sof will be missed in the rainfall event chosen moreover the steeper is the hillslope the shallower is the steady state water depth hillslopes 1 6 11 16 and 21 are examples of this phenomenon it is evident that uniform water depth can rise at the same rate on hillslopes with the same curvature albeit with different gradients as shown in 1a 1c in fig 3 as an example the uniform water depths on the lower parts of hillslopes 2 7 12 17 and 22 hillslopes with the same curvature β 0 0015 all rise from 0 21 m at 1 h to 0 70 m at 3 h 4 3 estimations of tso there is a corresponding n 0 for a hillslope with a given profile structure fig 4 summarizes the effects of hillslope characteristics on n 0 tso and t 0 for 25 hillslopes the values of n 0 derived using the kinematic wave analytical solutions are equal to those derived using the boussinesq numerical solutions and the values of tso also matches those of numerical solutions only the values of t 0 were underestimated the main reason is that when the water table height profile of the numerical solution is close to a steady state the water table height will rise at a very slow rate in particular these values were significantly underestimated on gentle hillslopes this is because the diffusive term in the boussinesq model is less important for such terrains n 0 increases linearly with z 0 and decreases with increasing β the convex hillslope requires a larger critical rainfall intensity to produce sof than a concave hillslope similarly the value of tso on convex hillslopes is larger than that on concave hillslopes fig 4b the variation trend for the value of tso as a function of the bedrock gradient z 0 is markedly different under different profile shape scenarios β the value of tso on a straight hillslope is the same with different gradients and the value of tso on concave hillslopes is positively correlated with z 0 while the value of tso on convex hillslopes is negatively correlated with z 0 as z 0 increases tso on steep hillslopes with different profile curvatures gradually approaches tso on straight hillslopes which are 20 mm the opposite curvatures e g β 0 0025 result in an unexpectedly identical t 0 fig 4c in addition t 0 on hillslopes with greater gradients and smaller absolute profile curvatures is smaller as z 0 60 m for z 0 greater than 60 m and less than 100 m t 0 on hillslopes with different profile shapes tends to be the same 4 4 estimations of so as n n 0 the average values of so are 33 50 31 30 29 66 28 09 and 26 11 mm on hillslopes with z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m respectively fig 5 it is evident that the steeper the hillslope the smaller the value of so under the same rainfall intensity as a steep hillslope is not conducive to storing water the value of the so on a given hillslope increased with rainfall intensity as an example for the hillslope with z 0 30 m and β 0 0025 fig 5a so 11 77 mm for n 1 mm h whereas so 34 29 mm for n 16 mm h furthermore the slope of the lines so n on convex hillslopes is greater than that on straight and concave hillslopes which indicates that the values of so on convex hillslopes are more sensitive to rainfall intensity than those on straight and concave hillslopes thus these lines of s n for different profile curvatures at each gradient fig 5a e tend to intersect each other and the points of intersection are extremely close when the rain intensity is lower than the rain intensity near these intersections the values of so on hillslopes with different shapes are relatively close when the rain intensity is higher than the rain intensity near these intersections the values of so on convex hillslopes are significantly larger than those on concave hillslopes here we define the rain intensity below which the curvature of the bedrock profile has a limited effect on so as the inflection point of rainfall intensity namely n 1 and the corresponding so is defined as so 1 fig 5 the physical meaning of n 1 and so 1 is discussed in more detail in section 5 the values of n 1 and so 1 are approximated empirically by averaging the abscissa and ordinate of all intersections the empirical values of n 1 differ notably among hillslopes with different gradients for z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m the values of n 1 are 3 5 6 0 7 9 10 2 and 13 4 mm h respectively these figures suggest that the steeper the hillslope the larger the empirical value of n 1 for z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m so 1 23 3 24 8 24 8 25 2 and 25 1 mm respectively the values of so 1 on hillslopes with different gradients are very close with an average of 24 6 mm the occurrence times of 25 hillslopes under different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 6 the average values of t are 4 50 3 94 3 47 3 15 and 2 75 h on hillslopes with z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m respectively it is worth noting that a steep hillslope cannot be saturated under a low rainfall intensity i e t is inconsequential in these scenarios however with different gradients the occurrence times are the same on hillslopes with the same curvatures under a given rainfall intensity however with the same z 0 the values of t on concave hillslopes are less than those on straight and convex hillslopes under the same rainfall intensity furthermore results indicate that t decreases with an increase in rainfall intensity 5 discussions 5 1 variable storage behavior impacted by rainfall intensity the value of the so on a given hillslope increases with rainfall intensity which reflects the variable storage behavior this is due to the increase in the subsurface saturation zone caused by the higher water table with rising rainfall intensity as an example for hillslopes 1 2 and 4 with z 0 30 m the profiles of water table height at time t under four different rainfall intensities n 5 10 15 and 20 mm h are shown in 2a 2c in fig 3 the profiles of water table height on all 25 hillslopes are shown in fig s1 rainfall intensity is an indispensable contributing factor in models for predicting the subsurface water table on hillslopes alemie et al 2019 dralle et al 2014 in addition to subsurface water dynamics the widely studied variable source area can also help verify the variable storage behavior as rainfall increases the saturated area can expand upslope dunne et al 1975 bernier 1985 causing increased hillslope storage for example when n increases from 5 mm h to 20 mm h the saturated area on hillslope 1 2a in fig 3 expands by 45 m and the corresponding so increases from 28 mm to 37 mm some field experiments have found similar phenomena tanaka et al 1988 found that the maximum extent of the saturated area occurred following the peak rainfall and it contracted quickly as rainfall intensity decreased han et al 2020 observed that with increasing rainfall intensity the saturated area can be extended as expected the numerical results by ogden and watts 2000 also indicated that the saturated area increased with rainfall intensity in this study we present the quantitative relationships between rainfall intensity and so using analytical solution techniques this quantification of so has the potential to improve the free storage capacity parameter in some conceptual models free storage capacity which is the so in this study is an essential parameter which determines the partitioning of runoff into subsurface flow and saturation excess overland flow in conceptual models as in the sacramento model e g burnash and ferral 1973 duan et al 2001 and the xinanjiang model e g zhao 1992 liu et al 2012 however these conceptual models set the free water storage capacity to a constant and can not account for lateral redistribution of water e g duan et al 2001 van esse et al 2013 zhao 1992 which however was a crucial mechanism of overland flow generation on a hillslope what we found here is that the free storage capacity is not really a constant but a function of rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity soil depth etc the calculation formula of so has been given which can be used to estimate the free water storage capacity in the conceptual model 5 2 the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so the existence of n 1 and so 1 results from the differences in the sensitivities of so to rainfall intensity on concave and convex hillslopes reflecting the compound effect of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so as seen in 2a 2c in fig 3 the extent to which the water table rises to the ground surface i e surface saturated area on the convex hillslope is larger than those on the straight or concave hillslopes with the same z 0 under equal increments of rainfall intensity therefore the so on a convex hillslope is more sensitive to rainfall intensity when the rainfall intensity increases from 5 mm h to 20 mm h the surface saturated area on hillslope 4 expanded by 67 m while it expanded by 45 m on hillslope 1 and 37 m on hillslope 2 this is because the concave hillslope gradually steepened upward while the gradient of the convex hillslope demonstrated the opposite trend when rainfall intensity is low saturated area is formed near the hillslope toe but with increasingly heavier rainfall the saturated extent will move upslope correspondingly during this time the upslope gradient plays an important role in runoff generation the upslope part of the concave hillslope is steep and water can be quickly drained however the upslope of the convex hillslope is gentle which is conducive to storing water so the water table rises more under equal increments of rainfall intensity an explicit expression for n 1 was derived using the taylor s series expansion of analytical solution of so for small values of β expanding eq 26 in a taylor s series for small values of β a second order equation in β was obtained equating the formulas for β and β we then obtain an approximation to n 1 for the intersection point as 28 n 1 4 d k z 0 3 l 2 n 1 turned out to be independent of β as shown on fig 5 and proportional to z 0 for the given hillslope parameters n 1 4 6 8 10 and 13 3 mm h for z 0 30 45 60 75 and 100 m which are similar to the empirical values one notable finding is that the values of so 1 on hillslopes with different gradients are very similar all approximately 24 6 mm as mentioned above the values of n 1 on steep hillslopes are larger that is the negative effect of a larger gradient on so is partially compensated by the positive increasing effect of larger n 1 on so which makes so 1 on hillslopes with different gradients approximately equal in the case of different parameter combinations of rainfall intensity gradient and profile curvature the values of all sos are similar when n is close to n 1 this can be explained by the balancing of the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on so as for t it decreases with an increase in n and the values of t on hillslopes with different profile curvatures tend to be close to the increase in n this indicates that the effect of rainfall intensity controls t during heavy rainfall events rather than profile curvature another important finding is that the occurrence times are the same on hillslopes with the same curvature under a given rainfall intensity even though their z 0 values differ because the uniform water depths on them have the same rising intensity as shown in 1a 1c in fig 3 this is a result of the balancing effects of different influencing factors the steep hillslopes drain faster and therefore store water more slowly but the corresponding value of so on steep hillslopes is also smaller the smaller so compensates for the negative effects of faster drainage on steep hillslopes resulting in the same t as that on a gentle hillslope compared with concave convex and straight hillslopes the hillslope in the real world is more likely to be a mixture of these three profile shapes to better understand the interaction of rain intensity and profile shape the storage behavior upon sof generation on mixed shape hillslopes were also discussed using boussinesq numerical solution see supplementary material for details only convex top and concave base hillslopes were studied which are more common in nature pelletier and rasmussen 2009 roering et al 1999 the mixed shape hillslope profile is described with piecewise function the upper part of the convex hillslope the lower part of the concave hillslope and the middle segment described with linear function we found that the storage behavior upon sof generation on mixed shape hillslopes are more similar to that on concave hillslopes this is because the middle linear segment with steep gradient makes it difficult for the surface saturated area to reach the upper part under the rainfall intensities of 1 20 mm h studied therefore the lower part of the hillslope plays a more important role in the generation of sof 6 summary and conclusions in this study the analytical expressions of hillslope storage behavior upon sof generation were derived based on the kinematic wave equation and the derived analytical solutions matched the results of the numerical boussinesq equation well the simulation results of 25 idealized hillslopes under different rainfall intensities 1 n 20 mm h were studied we summarize our findings as follows 1 tso critical rainfall intensity n 0 that controls whether sof occurs and occurrence time t 0 were derived from the hillslope structure parameters n 0 and tso on convex hillslopes are greater than those on concave hillslopes while n 0 increases linearly with the gradient and the tso on concave and convex hillslopes gradually approaches as the gradient increases the opposite curvatures can result in identical t 0 values t 0 on hillslopes with different curvatures gradually decreases and tends to be equal as the gradient increases 2 as rainfall intensity greater than critical rainfall intensity n 0 the variable storage behavior with increasing rainfall intensity was found i e so increases with n the occurrence time t decreases with an increase in rainfall intensity the inflection point of rainfall intensity n 1 below which the curvature of the bedrock profile has a limited effect on so was found n 1 is larger on steeper hillslopes but the values of so 1 corresponding to n 1 on hillslopes with different gradients are very close which means that the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure are balanced in this study the effects of rainfall intensity and profile structure on hillslope storage behavior upon sof generation were quantified this can contribute to our understanding the hillslope runoff generation further research should be conducted to extend the analytical framework to consider complex hillslope structures with convergence and divergence

3329,runoff movement in karst catchments is of great complexity although many models have been developed for the rainfall runoff simulation in karst catchments the distributed ones capable of taking into consideration the impacts of the spatial variability of hydrogeological factors are few and can only be applied to well explored karst catchments of commonly less than 100 km2 in area in this study the previously published dem digital elevation model based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm was applied and modified for distributed rainfall runoff simulation in a large scale karst catchment by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing for each grid cell to be a function of karst landform and topographic index i e the mathematical expression of topographic features to represent the hydrological effects of epikarst and underground river system for model structure investigation three versions of the modified ddrms i e the ddrm considering only karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were set up and compared with the original ddrm i e the original ddrm termed as ddrm o all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective optimization framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and the autocorrelation function of streamflow kg e acf as objective functions to improve parameter identifiability the investigation was conducted in the xijiang basin which is a typical karst catchment in southwest china with an area of 309300 km2 the results show that compared with ddrm o ddrm t barely benefits the rainfall runoff simulation while both ddrm k and ddrm kt noticeably enhance the simulation accuracy in terms of kg e q due to the better performance in high flow and autocorrelation function of streamflow ddrm kt outperforms ddrm k in general and has the potential to be successfully applied to large scale karst catchments keywords distributed rainfall runoff simulation large scale karst catchment karst landform topographic index multi objective calibration 1 introduction karst areas cover 15 2 of the earth s ice free continental surface and people living on karst surfaces account for 16 5 of the global population goldscheider et al 2020 rainfall runoff simulations in karst catchments are of great importance for sustainable water resource management however flow in karst areas is one of the most complex hydrogeological phenomena mainly due to the formation of epikarst and underground river karst conduit system caused by the dissolution of soluble rocks atkinson 1977 white and sully 1987 bakalowicz 2005 makropoulos et al 2008 chalikakis et al 2011 bailly comte et al 2012 koit et al 2020 numerous models have been successfully developed for karst rainfall runoff simulation black box models which transfer input to output with analytical transfer functions or neural networks are the simplest models hartmann et al 2014 due to the lack of physical process representation the black box models can only provide reliable simulation results for the conditions they have been calibrated for and can hardly be used under changing environments kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 for prediction purposes process based models such as lumped models semi distributed and distributed models are preferred qiu et al 2019 lumped models conceptualize the physical processes at the scale of the entire karst system mostly based on linear or nonlinear relationship between discharge and storage while semi distributed models and distributed models segment discretize the karst system into small sub systems and two or three dimensional grid cells and then apply physical equations of water flow for each sub system and grid cell respectively adinehvand et al 2017 lodouche et al 2014 hartmann et al 2012 even without any need for karst data lumped models can simulate karst hydrological processes such as epikarst storage and flow diffusion and concentrated recharge to karst conduits and conduit flow and therefore have been applied the most extensively rimmer and salingar 2006 geyer et al 2008 jukic and denic jukic 2009 majone et al 2010 tritz et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 however the lumped models cannot cater to the spatial variability of hydrogeological factors including karst landform topography land use cover evapotranspiration and precipitation which are especially critical for karst catchments dreiss 1982 labat et al 2000 morrissey et al 2020 in contrast semi distributed and distributed models provide more insights into karst hydrological processes especially distributed models which can be better used to evaluate the impacts of karst landform land use cover and climatic change on water resources bittner et al 2018 dubois et al 2020 ladouche et al 2014 malard et al 2016 ollivier et al 2020 sarrazin et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 at present however these distributed models can only be applied to well explored karst catchments of commonly less than 100 km2 in area because of the extensive input data requirements regarding the geometry and structure of karst aquifers hartmann et al 2013a chang et al 2019 it is to say distributed rainfall runoff models applicable for large scale karst catchments which make more sense in water resource management hartmann et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013b need further investigation large scale karst catchments generally consist of karst areas and non karst areas zhou et al 2019 within fissures and fractures whose development degree decreases with the increasing depth the epikarst functions as a water storage system as the infiltration capacity at the surface is much greater than that at the base which is similar to the soil in non karst areas clemens et al 1999 aquilina et al 2006 williams 2008 in terms of underground rivers the network morphological structure is similar to that of surface rivers obeying the horton stream number and length law labarbera and rosso 1989 with a large quantity quick speed and steep gradient the flow in underground rivers has common dynamic change characteristics with surface river runoff white 2002 yang et al 2019 however on the other hand the water storage capacity of epikarst is different from that of the soil in non karst areas due to the existence of well developed fissures and fractures williams 2008 and the runoff generation volume in underground rivers which is regulated by the fissured and fractured matrix varies from that in surface rivers cornaton and perrochet 2002 chen et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013c zhang et al 2017 furthermore driven by the chemical corrosion of water in soluble rocks the development of epikarst is affected by topography with larger thickness and fissure content in areas where the water is easily collected as a result the water storage capacity of epikarst exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity and is correlated with topography adji et al 2019 although highly heterogeneous the epikarst in each grid can be represented by an equivalent porous medium for large scale simulation since the hydraulic properties of a sufficiently large fractured element tend to stabilize bear and bachmat 1990 pankow et al 1986 scanlon et al 2003 rodriguez et al 2013 therefore in view of the hydrologic characteristics of karst areas and non karst areas the distributed rainfall runoff models may be modified for large scale karst catchments by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing for each grid cell to be a function of karst landform and topographic index which refer to the landform developed with epikarst and underground river system and the mathematical expression of topographic feature respectively an excellent model should be capable of simulating key hydrological processes with a simple structure in addition to few data requirements a simple model structure often means low prediction uncertainty as a small number of parameters can be easily identified in the calibration process beven 2006 however a rainfall runoff model simple enough to be well calibrated with only one goodness of fit as objective function which is widely used in previous studies can hardly simulate the complex hydrological processes in kart catchments typically one particular goodness of fit can be used to estimate no more than four to six parameters jakeman and hornberger 1993 to improve the parameter identifiability some additional objective functions have been introduced into the calibration framework of karst rainfall runoff models moussu et al 2011 hartmann et al 2014 chang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 as stated in many studies the autocorrelation function acf of streamflow time series which characterizes the memory effect of karst system can provide meaningful insight into the hydrodynamic properties of karst catchments mangin 1984 hartmann et al 2013d katsanou et al 2015 given the representativeness of karst system functional characteristics moussu et al 2011 used the acf of streamflow time series as an additional information to calibrate the parameters of karst rainfall runoff models and consequently achieved robust and low uncertainty simulation results the objective of this study is to provide a simple and practical approach for distributed rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments with limited karst data to this end the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm proposed by xiong et al 2004 which has simple structure and can be successfully applied to humid non karst catchments long et al 2012 xiong et al 2018 2019 xiong and zeng 2019 yang et al 2021a a was modified by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing for each grid cell to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effects of epikarst and underground river system for model structure investigation three versions of the modified ddrms i e the ddrm considering only karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were set up and compared with the original ddrm ddrm o all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective optimization framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and autocorrelation function of streamflow kg e acf as objective functions to improve parameter identifiability all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective calibration framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and autocorrelation function of streamflow kg e acf as objective functions to improve the parameter identifiability the investigation was conducted in the xijiang basin of southwest china which is a typical large scale karst catchment with an area of 309300 km2 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the xijiang basin up to the changzhou reservoir fig 1 which is a large part of the pearl river basin in southwest china was selected as the study area it covers an area of 309300 km2 with karst areas accounting for 56 6 of the area the elevation ranges from 25 to 2852 m and increases from the southeast to northwest the catchment consists mainly of mountains and hills where soluble rocks are widely distributed and karst landforms such as funnels sinkholes shafts karst caves and underground rivers are well formed the area is dominated by subtropical monsoon and tropical monsoon climates with a mean annual precipitation of 1200 1900 mm and a mean temperature of 14 22 c in addition to the changzhou reservoir there are seven main reservoirs i e tianyi reservoir guangzhao reservoir longtan reservoir yantan reservoir baise reservoir xijin reservoir and honghua reservoir inside the catchment based on the 1 km resolution dem data and the reservoirs spatial data a digital catchment comprised of eight sub catchments fig 1 was generated by using arc hydro tools within arcgis software it is noted that the dem was first modified by imposing the real river network onto it using agree method and filling the sinks and then used for the delineation of catchment and sub catchments 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 hydro meteorological data the hydro meteorological data required to drive ddrms include the discharge data of the catchment outlet and the spatial data of precipitation and reference crop potential evapotranspiration the outlet discharge data used in this study refer to the observed daily inflow of the changzhou reservoir from january 1 2008 to december 31 2018 the daily precipitation and other observed data i e maximum and minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity levels used to compute reference crop potential evapotranspiration pet using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 from 42 meteorological stations fig 1 over the same time period were downloaded from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the point data of daily precipitation and reference crop potential evapotranspiration were further interpolated to 1 km resolution using the inverse distance weighted idw method to match the discrete grids of the digital catchment for distributed rainfall runoff simulation 2 2 2 karst landform data the spatial distribution of soluble rock types fig 2 provided by the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences cags was used to identify the karst landform the order from high to low carbonate contents is pure carbonate rock pure subpure carbonate rock sub pure carbonate rock and impure carbonate rock pure carbonate can be divided into limestone dolomite and limestone dolomite based on lithological differences by contrasting the soluble rock map with the underground river map we found that the distribution of all soluble rocks except the impure carbonate one i e limestone limestone dolomite dolomite pure subpure carbonate rock and sub pure carbonate rock can match well the distribution of underground rivers thus the soluble rocks except the impure carbonate one were identified as karst landform and the others i e impure carbonate rock and non soluble rock were identified as non karst landform in this study 3 methodology 3 1 the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm developed by xiong et al 2004 has simple structure and can well simulate the hydrological process of the humid non karst catchments long et al 2012 xiong et al 2018 xiong and zeng 2019 yang et al 2019 the simulation of ddrm requires to divide catchment into sub catchments with outlets connected by river network each of which is further discretized into regular square gird elements with known elevation fig 3 a generally the hydrologic stations inside the catchment are adopted as the outlets of sub catchments and then the sub catchments are delineated based on the oulets and the flow direction derived from dem data by using arc hydro tools within arcgis software if there is no hydrologic station inside the catchment the outlets can be customized by researchers for sub catchments delineation for each grid element three layers namely soil layer surface layer and river channel layer the grey part green part and cyan part in fig 3b respectively are designed to describe the main hydrological processes ddrm consists of three calculation procedures grid runoff generation grid channel runoff routing and river network runoff routing this original ddrm is termed as ddrm o in order to distinguish from the modified ddrms described later 3 1 1 grid runoff generation the grid runoff generation procedure in ddrm is based on the theory of saturation excess runoff i e surface runoff generation only occurs in the situation where the soil layer becomes saturated fig 3b assuming soil water storage capacity is evenly distributed over the whole catchment the soil water storage capacity of grid i denoted by sm c i can be given as 1 sm c i s where s is the average soil water storage capacity across the catchment and a parameter to be calibrated according to the article of dejonge et al 2012 and chen et al 2019 the actual evapotranspiration e t i can be calculated by 2 e t i s i sm c i k c p e t i where s i is the soil water storage pe t i is the reference crop potential evapotranspiration k c is the crop coefficient but not necessarily the same as the crop coefficient in the traditional sense described by allen et al 1998 due to the lack of the cropping industrial structure data the crop types are considered to be the same throughout the catchment the value of k c ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 was obtained in calibration process to represent the overall features of various crop types instead of specifying the crop type ahead moreover in view of low proportion of the whole catchment area the non crop vegetation cover is not differentiated from the crop vegetation cover in this paper by defining the reference crop as a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evaporation of an extension surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered the reference crop potential evapotranspiration pet can be expressed with the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 3 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation flux at the reference grassland alfalfa surface mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d t is the mean air temperature c u 2 is the wind speed m s at a height of 2 m es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure level kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c for grid i when the soil water storage s i exceeds a specific threshold s t i there will be flow out from its soil layer and into the downstream grid soil layer the soil outflow qsou t i is calculated with the following equation 4 qsou t i max s i s t i 0 ts tan β i b where ts is a time constant reflecting the velocity of soil water flow tan β i represents the average slope throughout the catchment and b is an empirical constant reflecting the impact of slope on soil water flow in terms of threshold s t i the calculation is given by s t i α s m c i with α ranging from 0 to 1 noting that ts b and α are parameters to be calibrated in accordance with the principle of water balance soil water storage is updated as 5 s i t s i t δ t p i t e t i t δ a δ t qsi n i t q s o u t i t δ t where p i t denotes the precipitation qsi n i t is the soil inflow of grid i and calculated as the sum of soil outflow from the upstream grids δ a is the grid area δ t is the simulation time step if the water storage in soil layer s i t exceeds its storage capacity sm c i the excess part s i t s m c i will spill out into surface layer and supply the surface ponding s p i t then s i t is update to be equal to sm c i i e 6 s p i t s p i t δ t max s i t s m c i 0 7 s i t min s i t s m c i under the force of gravity some surface ponding water turns into the surface runoff entering the river channel layer the expression for surface runoff generation q p i t is given by the classic linear reservoir model as 8 q p i t s p i t tp where tp is a time constant reflecting the velocity of surface runoff generation and a parameter to be calibrated 3 1 2 grid channel runoff routing by applying the muskingum routing method gill 1978 to each grid river channel the surface flow calculated in grid runoff generation procedure is routed from upstream grids to downstream grids to obtain the local outflow of each sub catchment for grid i and time t the routed surface outflow for river channel denoted by qou t i t is estimated as follows 9 qou t i t c 0 qi n i t q p i t c 1 qi n i t δ t q p i t δ t 1 c 0 c 1 q o u t i t δ t where qi n i t is the surface inflow and calculated as the sum of the surface outflow from the upstream grids both c 0 and c 1 are grid channel routing parameters with regard to the muskingum method ranging from 0 and 1 and parameters to be calibrated 3 1 3 river network runoff routing the local outflow of each sub catchment calculated in grid channel runoff routing procedure continues to be routed through surface river network also via the muskingum routing method in the case of catchment shown in fig 3a the streamflow at the whole catchment outlet g denoted by o g is composed of three parts i e the streamflow routed from the sub catchment outlet m denoted by o mg the streamflow routed from the sub catchment outlet n denoted by o ng and the local outflow of sub catchment g denoted by oou t g 10 o g t o mg t o ng t q o u t g t 11 o mg t h c 0 o m t h c 1 o m t δ t 1 h c 0 h c 1 o mg t δ t 12 o n g t h c 0 o n t h c 1 o n t δ t 1 h c 0 h c 1 o n g t δ t where o m and o n are the streamflow at the sub catchment outlet m and n respectively both h c 0 and h c 1 denote river network routing parameters with regard to the muskingum method that ranges from 0 to 1 and parameters to be calibrated for sub catchments acting as head watersheds sub catchment m and n in the case shown in fig 3a the outlet streamflow is equal to the local outflow 13 o m t q o u t m t 14 o n t q o u t n t where qou t m t and qou t n t are the local outflow of sub catchment m and n respectively 3 2 model modification for large scale karst catchments 3 2 1 hydrological processes in karst areas large scale karst catchments generally consist of karst areas and non karst areas as shown in fig 4 the hydrological processes in karst areas are complex and differ from those in non karst areas mainly due to the effects of well developed epikarst and underground river system a epikarst effect with more fissures and fractures developed at the surface than at the base epikarst mainly functions as a water storage system in the hydrologic cycle which is similar to the soil in non karst areas however relative to soil epikarst exhibits high water storage capacity in general since the available storage space is greatly enlarged by well developed fissures and fractures williams 1983 b underground river system effect underground river system refers to the set of underground rivers fissures in saturated zone and karst depressions including sinkholes and shafts providing supply passage for underground river runoff rainfall can replenish underground rivers in two ways diffuse flow across fissures and fractures and concentrated flow along sinkholes and shafts once a rainfall event occurs part of the rainfall diffusely infiltrates into the underground saturated zone through the fissures and fractures of the epikarst and unsaturated zone and then laterally flows to recharge underground rivers compared with the surface runoff diffuse flow has a low velocity due to the weak transmissibility in fissures and fractures if rainfall is sufficiently heavy to fill the epikarst the excess rainfall turns into surface runoff with one part flowing to surface rivers and another part concentrating toward karst depressions and subsequently sinking into underground rivers through sinkholes and shafts regulated by the fissures in saturated zone the concentrated flow arriving to underground rivers recharges matrix in the early days when the underground river water level is higher than the matrix water level and later the matrix water in turn recharges underground rivers as underground river water receds the lagging drainage of regulated flow prolongs the rainfall runoff response time and contributes to a gentle streamflow attenuation process despite the high flow velocity at the surface and through the sinkholes and shafts therefore both diffuse flow and concentrated flow need more time to turn into underground river runoff 3 2 2 model setup epikarst with well developed fissures and fractures has a high water storage capacity and the underground river system contributes to an extended rainfall runoff response time as explained in section 3 2 1 in addition topography provides information about the interplay between uplift weathering and erosion and hence about the past morphological development of a landform loritz et al 2019 in terms of karst landform the development of epikarst driven by the chemical corrosion of water in soluble rocks is affected by topography as a result the water storage capacity of epikarst exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity and is correlated with topography adji et al 2019 in the hydrologic cycle epikarst and underground rivers mainly function as water storage system and water conducted channels similar to the soil and surface rivers of non karst areas respectively given that one karst depression covers a small drainage area in general the grid cell covering more than 1 km2 area which often consists of several karst depressions drainage area and other areas can be regarded as a uniform thus the routing sequence change resulting from karst depressions such as sinkholes and shafts whose spatial distribution is generally unavailable can be neglected for the rainfall runoff simulations in large scale karst catchments moreover underground rivers and surface rivers have similar network morphological structures and often connect to each other therefore it is unnecessary to distinguish underground rivers from surface rivers for large scale karst catchments that commonly have extensive underground and surface rivers since underground rivers act as the small tributary streams of surface rivers in most cases the digital river network was extracted with a relatively small drainage area threshold to include underground rivers therefore the topological structures of the surface river system and underground river system i e underground rivers and the channels of underground river flow supply such as karst depressions fissures and fractures were built together by using the traditional method instead of constructing an individual system specific to the underground river system on the other hand meeting with low resistance the runoff routing through underground rivers has common dynamic change characteristics compared with surface river flow white 2002 bonacci et al 2009 luo et al 2016 and thus can be calculated using the muskingum routing method given that the hydraulic properties of a sufficiently large fractured element tend to stabilize the highly heterogeneous karst system in each grid element can be represented by an equivalent porous medium scanlon et al 2003 rodriguez et al 2013 thus the ddrm was modified for large scale karst catchments by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing in each grid element to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effects of epikarst and underground river system in addition to the original ddrm termed ddrm o described in section 3 1 three versions of the modified ddrms were set up to investigate whether the introduction of karst landform and topographic index information benefits the distributed rainfall runoff simulation for large scale karst catchments namely 1 the ddrm considering only impacts of karst landform termed ddrm k in this case the water storage capacity of grid element i sm c i is assumed to be related to the landform types rather than uniformly distributed over the entire catchment and is computed as 15 sm c i s for l i n k l k s s for l i k l where s is the average soil water storage capacity across the non karstic landforms k s is a correction parameter that reflects the effects of epikarst on average water storage capacity l i is the landform type of grid element i and nkl and kl represent the non karst landform and karst landform respectively noting that s and k s are parameters to be calibrated the regulation of fissured matrix on diffuse flow and concentrated flow entering underground rivers is represented by a prolonged grid runoff generation process for large scale karst catchments thus the grid runoff generation q p i t is expressed with the following equation 16 q p i t s p i t tp for l i n k l s p i t k tp t p for l i k l where tp is a time constant reflecting the surface runoff generation velocity in non karstic landforms k tp is a correction parameter that reflects the effects of underground river system on runoff generation velocity noting that tp and k tp are parameters to be calibrated thus in the ddrm k version equation 15 is used for calculating sm c i and equation 16 for calculating q p i t and all other formulas used are the same as those in the ddrm o version 2 the ddrm considering only impacts of topography termed as ddrm t to account for the impact of topography the water storage capacity of each grid element is considered to be related to the corresponding topographic index ti the topographic index defined as the logarithm of the ratio of upslope contributing area per contour length to the local slope is the mathematical expression of topographic features beven and kirkby 1979 xiong and guo 2004 17 t i i ln a i tan β i where t i i denotes the topographic index of grid element i a i is the upslope contributing area per unit contour length for grid element i and tan β i is the slope of the ground surface at the location the equation for estimating the spatial distribution of smc is expressed as 18 sm c i s 0 t i i t i min t i max t i min n s m where s 0 and sm denote the minimum value and variation range of the water storage capacity throughout the catchment respectively n denotes an empirical constant reflecting the heterogeneity degree of smc which ranges from 0 to 1 and t i max and t i min denote the maximum and minimum value of grid based topographic indexes throughout the catchment respectively note that s 0 sm and n belong to the parameters required to be calibrated thus in the ddrm t version equation 18 is used to calculate sm c i and all other formulas used are the same as those in the ddrm o version 3 the ddrm considering the impacts of both karst landform and topography termed ddrm kt in this case the water storage capacity parameter smc is assumed to be controlled by both the landform type and topography and thus calculated by taking into account both the landform type information and the topographic index thus the water storage capacity for a particular location is determined by the following equation 19 sm c i s 0 t i i t i min t i max t i min n s m for l i n k l s 0 t i i t i min t i max t i min n k sm s m for l i k l where sm denotes the variation range of the water storage capacity throughout the non karstic landforms k sm is a correction parameter that reflects the effect of epikarst on the variation range of water storage capacity note that sm and k sm belong to the parameters required to be calibrated the grid runoff generation calculation in ddrm kt is modified to be the same as in ddrm k by employing equation 16 thus in the ddrm kt version equation 19 is used for calculating sm c i and equation 16 for calculating q p i t and all other formulas used are the same as those in the ddrm o version all the four ddrms were programmed using c language and run at a daily time step extracted from 1 km resolution dem data the digital catchment consists of approximately 309 300 grid cells involved in the model simulation 3 3 model calibration and evaluation a multi objective optimization procedure based on the nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 using the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 of streamflow kg e q and the autocorrelation function larocque et al 1998 of streamflow time series kg e acf as objective functions was carried out to calibrate the model parameters details of the ddrm parameters required to be calibrated are presented in table 1 in the nsga iii based multi objective calibration the maximum generation of 300 and population size of 100 were set to acquire the pareto front of kg e q and kg e acf the 2008 2015 and 2016 2018 data were used for calibration and validation respectively the outlet discharge data for model calibration refer to the observed daily inflow of the changzhou reservoir for both the calibration and validation the first 100 days was set as the warm up period incorporating three basic assessment indices i e pearson s linear correlation coefficient bias and a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values the kling gupta efficiency kge is defined as follows 20 kge 1 r 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between observations and simulations and μ o σ o and μ s σ s represent the means and standard deviations of observations and simulations respectively the kge value ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 indicating a better simulation performance with the observed and simulated streamflow data the kge statistic of streamflow denoted by kg e q can be easily obtained evaluating to what extent streamflow depends on the preceding values over a specified time period lag time the autocorrelation function acf of streamflow time series is classically used to characterize the memory effect of karst catchments mangin 1984 herman et al 2009 hartmann et al 2013b katsanou et al 2015 li et al 2017 for lag time l the autocorrelation function of a streamflow time series is computed as 21 a c f l t 1 n l q t q q t l q t 1 n q t q 2 where l is the lag time n is the length of the time series q t and q t l are the streamflow at times t and t l respectively and q is the mean value of streamflow over the entire record period as an acf below 0 2 is essentially identical to the acf of noise the lag time corresponding to an acf value of 0 2 is considered the characteristic lag time which represents the memory of the karst catchment mangin 1984 fu et al 2016 the kge of the streamflow autocorrelation function kg e acf which assesses the ability to reproduce the autocorrelation functional characteristic of the karst system is calculated with the following equation 22 kg e acf 1 r ac f s a c f o 1 2 μ ac f s μ ac f o 1 2 σ ac f s σ ac f o 1 2 where ac f s and ac f o represent the acf of simulated and observed streamflow respectively it is noted that the acf used to compute kg e acf refers to those with lag times no larger than the characteristic lag time to clearly show the performance difference of the four ddrms three pareto front optimal solutions were selected to represent the typical calibration scenarios including s1 the extreme solution with the lowest kg e q and highest kg e acf s2 the trade off solution with the median kg e q and kg e acf and s3 the extreme solution with the highest kg e q and lowest kg e acf the evaluation content of model performance in these three typical calibration scenarios consists of statistical indices the autocorrelation function acf of streamflow time series and the flow duration curve fdc the fdc represents the probability of a time specified flow being exceeded or equaled as one of the typical hydrological signatures to evaluate the model behavior of a catchment the fdc provides insights into how streamflow is distributed across high to low flow regimes euser et al 2013 wide margins between simulated and observed series in the fdc indicate that the bias of simulated streamflow is significant apart from kg e q and kg e acf the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of streamflow traditionally used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological modeling was also computed as a referenced statistical index the expression of the nse is given as follows 23 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where q sim t and q obs t are the simulated and observed streamflow for time t respectively and q obs is the mean value of the observed streamflow the nse value ranges from to 1 and a value of 1 indicates a perfect match between the simulations and observations 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis due to the extra consideration of hydrological characteristics the revised ddrms involve more calibrated parameters in comparsion to the original ddrm model ddrm o e g there are two more parameters in ddrm k and ddrm t and four more parameters in ddrm kt to identify whether the extra parameters benefit the rainfall runoff simulation parameter sensitivity was evaluated through the regional sensitivity analysis rsa method which is based on random sampling of parameter space and could be easily used with multiple objectives chang et al 2017 the rsa method was implemented within the safe sensitivity analysis for everybody toolbox pianosi et al 2015 2020 wagener et al 2001 for each ddrm the upper and lower values of each parameter extracted from the pareto solutions i e the multi objective calibration result sets were increased and decreased by 20 respectively as the bounds of each parameter and 5 000 parameter samples were generated within this range using the latin hypercube method over a uniform distribution then each ddrm was run with its parameter samples to obtain objective function values and the parameter samples were divided into ten groups of equal size according to the objective function values finally the distance between every two cumulative distribution functions cdfs of parameter groups was measured by the kolmogorov smirnov ks statistic and the maximum ks was extracted as the sensitivity index si 24 s i x max k s x max max x f i x f j x where f i x and f j x are the cdfs of parameter x in groups i and j respectively the sensitivity index si ranges from 0 to 1 with a value closer to 1 indicating the higher sensitivity of the parameter 4 results and discussion 4 1 multi objective calibration and validation result sets fig 5 illustrates the variation of model parameter sets along the pareto front obtained in the calibration process all parameter values are normalized with respect to the upper and lower bounds given in table 1 therefore their ranges are between 0 and 1 it is noteworthy that the normalized values of k s k sm and k tp being equal to 0 05 indicate that the water storage capacity of epikarst remains constant with that of the soil in non karst areas and that the rainfall runoff response time in karst areas is not affected by the underground river system respectively the higher the degree of parameter k s k sm and k tp exceeding 0 05 the more significant effect of epikarst and underground rivers system the large k s in ddrm k and k sm in ddrm kt with normalized values of 0 26 0 91 and 0 11 0 53 respectively show the high water storage capacity of epikarst in terms of parameter k tp the normalized values are even greater ranging from 0 88 to 0 99 for ddrm k and from 0 92 to 0 99 for ddrm kt which indicates that the rainfall runoff response time in karst areas is significantly prolonged by the underground river system given the significant differences of both the water storage capacity and rainfall runoff response time between karst areas and non karst areas it can be inferred that the karst landform is well developed in the xijiang basin and thus the simulation results may be improved by the ddrms considering karst landform i e ddrm k and ddrm kt the pareto fronts of the four ddrms acquired in the multi objective calibration process and the corresponding validation result sets are shown in fig 6 it can be found from the pareto fronts that there is a significant trade off relationship between the two objective functions kg e q and kg e acf indicating that a single objective calibration cannot fully capture the hydrological characteristics of karst catchments and the multi objective calibration will be helpful this is in line with the finding of moussu et al 2011 furthermore the shape of validation result sets is very different from that of the pareto fronts for ddrm o and ddrm t which may be attributed to the error in model structure and measurement data as pointed out by fenicia et al 2008 in contrast the validation result sets for ddrm k and ddrm kt retain similar shapes with the pareto fronts acquired in the calibration process thus it can be inferred that both ddrm k and ddrm kt are more likely to have reasonable structures relative to ddrm o and ddrm t accuracy comparison of the three modified ddrms with ddrm o illustrates that ddrm t can hardly benefit the simulation results while both ddrm k and ddrm kt effectively improve the simulation accuracy in terms of kg e q despite the futility of ddrm o the introduction of topographic index does work on the condition that the karst landform has been considered in general ddrm kt shows better performance than ddrm k particularly with trade off solutions where both kg e q and kg e acf reach a high value 4 2 model performance in typical calibration scenarios 4 2 1 evaluation statistics table 2 illustrates the evaluation statistics of the four ddrms in the three typical scenarios during the calibration and validation period the performance in the validation period remains consistent with that in the calibration period for example the ddrm with better performance in the calibration period also performs better in the validation period and for both the calibration and validation periods an increase in kg e q and nse values and a decrease in the kg e acf value can be found in the four ddrms from s1 to s3 in s1 ddrm kt significantly outperforms the other three ddrms with kg e q and nse values 3 8 4 6 and 7 4 9 4 higher in the calibration period respectively and 2 6 3 7 and 7 8 8 2 higher in validation period respectively in s2 compared with ddrm o and ddrm t the performance associated with kg e q and nse gets improved in ddrm k and ddrm kt and the performance with regard to kg e acf remains almost the same for ddrm kt and gets worse for ddrm k in terms of the improvement degree of kg e q and nse performance ddrm kt is more pronounced than ddrm k in calibration period and similar to ddrm k in the validation period in s3 ddrm kt provides higher accuracy in terms of kg e q kg e acf and nse and ddrm k contributes to better kg e q and nse performances at the expense of kg e acf relative to ddrm o 4 2 2 flow duration curve the fdcs derived from the simulated and observed streamflows in three typical scenarios are displayed in fig 7 the curve shape shows a disproportionate representation of high medium and low flow with the low flow being dominant for the high flow simulation that determines the flood forecast quality ddrm kt with relatively small estimation bias performs best in general followed by ddrm k and then ddrm t and ddrm o unlike the steady performance of ddrm kt the performance of ddrm k declines drastically from s1 to s3 in s3 ddrm k even performs worse than ddrm t and ddrm o during the validation period it is therefore concluded that the great advantage of high flow simulation enables ddrm kt to be most attractive for the flood forecasting in large scale karst catchments 4 2 3 autocorrelation function of streamflow time series both diffuse flow and concentrated flow need more time to turn into underground river runoff and thus underground river system contributes to an extended rainfall runoff response time and characteristic lag time as shown in fig 8 the characteristic lag times computed from the observed streamflow are very large with values of 59 days in the calibration period of 2008 2015 and 70 days in the validation period of 2016 2018 indicating that the epikarst and underground river system in xijiang basin are well developed for both the calibration and validation periods the acf curve can be divided into two parts namely the steep decrease in the first few days and the gentle decrease in the following several weeks these two types of decreases can be attributed to the fast flow and the slow flow which are associated with large fractures and conduits as well as small fissures and fractures respectively with regard to the acf of simulated streamflow the performance varies with the model structure and calibration scenario for the initial stage with a steep decrease all four ddrms have ideal acf performance in s1 and the performances suffer from different degrees of decline with the degradation of the objective function kg e acf as a result there exists an apparent performance discrepancy between ddrm kt and ddrm k in s2 and s3 i e the former performs best and the latter performs worst for the following stage with a gentle decrease ddrm kt and ddrm k are superior to ddrm t and ddrm o with the exception of s3 in the validation period in addition the comparison between ddrm kt and ddrm k demonstrates that better acf performance can be achieved by ddrm kt in short therefore ddrm kt performs best across all stages and ddrm t performs worst in the initial stage but outperforms ddrm k and ddrm o in terms of the acf simulation 4 3 parameter sensitivity analysis as described in section 3 4 the maximum kolmogorov smirnov ks was extracted as the sensitivity index si of the parameters using the rsa method the parameters with si values greater than 0 1 are considered to be sensitive otherwise they are considered to be insensitive jiang et al 2018 table 3 shows the si statistics of the parameters in the four ddrms during the calibration period of 2008 2015 and the validation period of 2016 2018 it can be seen that the parameter sensitivity varies with the objective function analysis period model structure and parameter for instance the parameter k c is highly sensitive for kg e q but reluctantly sensitive or insensitive for kg e acf which indicates that different parameters may control different aspects of streamflow thus multi objective calibration facilitates the identification of more parameters with regard to the revised ddrms all additional parameters are sensitive for at least one of the objective functions kg e q and kg e acf specifically both kg e q and kg e acf are sensitive to the parameters k s and k tp in ddrm t the parameters s0 sm and n in ddrm k and the parameters s0 sm and k tp in ddrm kt and kg e q is sensitive to the parameters n and k sm in ddrm kt noting that kg e acf is also sensitive to the parameter k sm in ddrm kt in the validation period thus it can be concluded that the additional parameters induced in the revised ddrms provide useful information for the rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments 4 4 spatial distributions of the simulated soil epikarst moisture and streamflow as distributed rainfall runoff models the original and modified ddrms can simulate not only the streamflow at the catchment outlet but also the soil or epikarst moisture and streamflow at each grid element due to the unavailability of soil and epikarst depth water storage cannot be converted to moisture content and thus the saturation degree s r i t computed as the ratio of water storage s i t to the water storage capacity sm c i for grid i and time t is used to characterize moisture conditions taking three typical days of flood event 20090707 for the changzhou reservoir i e 3 july water rising day 7 july flood peak day and 12 july water falling day in year 2009 for instance both spatial distributions of gridded saturation degree fig 9 and gridded streamflow fig 10 simulated by ddrm o and ddrm kt with parameters of s2 are compared fig 9 shows the saturation degrees in many downstream grids are nearly 1 on water rising days and flood peak days and those in upstream grids exhibit a downtrend from the water rising day to the flood peak day on water falling days the saturation degree decreases largely for almost all grids because of the continuous evapotranspiration unlike that of ddrm o there is distinct variation in the simulated saturation degree between the two types of landforms for ddrm kt with values in karst landform obviously less than those in non karst landform the reason for the variation can be attributed to the fact that the high water storage capacity of epikarst makes the karst landform less likely to be saturated than the non karst landform after a given rainfall event with regard to the simulated streamflow an increase can be found from upstream to downstream and the values in upstream and downstream grids reach a high level on water rising days and flood peak days respectively fig 10 furthermore the spatial distribution of simulated streamflow is very different between ddrm o and ddrm kt on water rising days the streamflow simulated by ddrm kt is generally lower than that simulated by ddrm o in karst landform grids and higher than that simulated by ddrm o in non karst landform grids especially upstream of the catchment on water falling days however the spatial distribution is the opposite with ddrm kt simulating lower streamflow in karst landform grids and higher streamflow in non karst landform grids than ddrm o 4 5 impacts of reservoir regulation on rainfall runoff simulation reservoir regulation is one major factor that affects the natural rainfall runoff process gao et al 2019 due to the temporal mismatch between water supply and demand regulated reservoirs often store water during the rainy season and supply irrigated fields and urban areas during the dry season which results in a decrease in peak flow and an increase in minimum flow doll et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in this section the impacts of reservoir regulation on rainfall runoff simulation will be investigated although reservoir regulation impacts may be partly implicit in the calibrated parameters a rainfall runoff model without reservoir regulation practice incorporated can hardly contribute to perfect simulation results because of its limited physical process representation compared with lumped models distributed rainfall runoff models are capable of incorporating reservoir regulation practice easily because they simulate the hydrological process for each geo spatial location regulation practice determines the reservoir outflow which can be estimated by the simulated inflow reservoir properties and operation rules or observed with a flowmeter chen et al 2018 with complicated and time consuming processes reservoir outflow estimation is not the focus of this paper and therefore reservoir regulation practice was incorporated into the four ddrms by treating the observed outflow of regulated reservoirs as model inputs specifically the simulated streamflow at regulated reservoir locations were replaced with the observed reservoir outflow for the downstream river network routing calculation to exclude the regulation impacts to recognize the regulated reservoirs the goodness of fit between daily inflow and outflow was evaluated with indicator kg e q for the main reservoirs inside the xijiang basin except the baise reservoir whose data were unavailable given the small drainage area of the upstream region nearly 5 5 of the entire catchment the baise reservoir even with regulation practice will have little impact on the rainfall runoff simulation table 4 in this study the hydrological impacts of the baise reservoir were neglected and the reservoirs with kg e q values far lower than 90 0 i e guangzhao tianyi and longtan reservoirs were recognized as regulated reservoirs as the guangzhao reservoir and tianyi reservoir are located upstream of the longtan reservoir only the observed outflow of the longtan reservoir was involved in the catchment outlet i e the changzhou reservoir runoff calculation that is the model parameters for the upstream of the longtan reservoir which covers 34 4 of the entire catchment were not calibrated using the inflow data of the changzhou reservoir these parameters can be calibrated with the observed inflow and outflow data of the guangzhao reservoir and tianyi reservoir as well as the observed inflow data of the longtan reservoir but were set to be the same as the other areas in the xijiang basin because the discussion was mainly directed at the catchment outlet instead of the sub catchment outlets for model performance comparison the four ddrms with reservoir regulation practice incorporated were calibrated for the period of 2008 2015 and validated for the period of 2016 2018 the calibration was also based on the nsga iii algorithm with kg e q and kg e acf as objective functions and the normalized parameter values along the pareto optimal solutions obtained in calibration are displayed in fig 11 it can be found that the calibrated parameter values of the four ddrms changed compared with those without regulation practice incorporated fig 5 the large k s and k sm in the ddrms with reservoir regulation practice incorporated indicates that the difference in water storage capacity between epikarst and soil should be given sufficient attention in the rainfall runoff simulation of large scale karst catchments as the impacts of reservoir regulation have been eliminated ddrms incorporating regulation practice may contribute to better performance in parameter estimation and rainfall runoff simulation the comparison of table 2 and 5 demonstrates that the model performance can be improved by incorporating reservoir regulation practice and the improvement is especially pronounced in the validation period on the other hand ddrm kt outperforms the other three ddrms in the situation where reservoir regulation practice has been incorporated table 5 which remains consistent with the situation without regulation practice incorporated table 2 as the simulated streamflow in the upstream of the longtan reservoir which covers 34 4 of the xijiang basin is replaced with the observed outflow of the longtan reservoir for the catchment outlet runoff calculation the outperformance degree of ddrm kt declines after the incorporation of reservoir regulation practice 4 6 discussion three modified versions of the ddrm i e the ddrm considering only the karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only the topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both the karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were provided and compared regarding the rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing in each grid element to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effect of epikarst and underground river system the modified ddrms have simple structure and just need karst landform data as additional input the application results in xijiang basin with an area of 309300 km2 showed that both ddrm k and ddrm kt noticeably enhance the simulation accuracy in terms of kg e q and ddrm kt also contributes to better performance in high flow and autocorrelation function of streamflow thus ddrm kt has the potential to be successfully applied to large scale karst catchments that commonly lacks detailed karst data such as the location and geometry of karst depressions underground rivers matrices and springs benefiting from the distributed modeling pattern ddrm kt has comparative advantages in rainfall runoff simulation under the influence of human activities and climate change and thus can play a crucial role in the water resource management of karst catchments in view of the fact that the crop growth module is so mature that can be easily incorporated into ddrm kt the spatial variability of vegetation not considered in the current version can be fully captured in the future if necessary the modifications for the distributed rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments depend on several assumptions 1 the routing sequence change resulting from karst depressions can be neglected due to the small drainage area each karst depression covers 2 the routing sequence change resulting from underground rivers can be neglected because of the similar network morphological structure with surface rivers 3 the runoff routing through underground rivers can be calculated using the muskingum routing method in view of the common dynamic changes characteristic with surface river flow and 4 the highly heterogeneous karst system in each grid element can be represented by an equivalent porous medium since the hydraulic properties of a sufficiently large fractured element tend to be stable although making sense in theory these assumptions especially the first two that are not fully tested in practical applications need further investigation for example an experiment regarding a comparison of two kinds of distributed models i e one neglecting the routing sequence change resulting from karst depressions and underground rivers and one not neglecting is expected to be conducted in some well explored large scale karst catchments to better support the second kind of model it is necessary to develop a novel system for the digital basin auto extraction of large scale karst catchments including the identification of karst depressions extraction of underground rivers and determination of gridded flow direction although researchers have been studying karst depression identification wu et al 2016 moreno gomez et al 2019 zumpano et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 it is still far from being used in the application for large scale karst catchments because of the high spatial resolution of the dem used for karst depression identification commonly ranging from 1 m to 10 m another question worth exploring is at what spatial scale the model assumptions can be successfully extended to in this research the study area i e the xijiang basin with an area of 309300 km2 is sufficiently large to conform with the model assumptions for karst catchments covering relatively small areas however the assumptions may no longer apply in this case the scale threshold associated with the characteristics of karst aquifers needs further investigation through applications in vast karst catchments 5 conclusions this paper applied and modified the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm for distributed rainfall runoff simulation over a large scale karst catchment by assuming the main parameters related to runoff generation and routing for each grid element to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effect of epikarst and underground river system three versions of the modified ddrms i e the ddrm considering only the karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only the topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both the karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were investigated and compared with the original ddrm model ddrm o all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective optimization framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and autocorrelation function of streamflow time series kg e acf as objective functions to improve parameter identifiability the investigation was conducted in a typical large scale karst catchment i e the xijiang basin in southwest china which has an area of 309300 km2 the main conclusions are given as follows 1 ddrm t barely improves the simulation accuracy over ddrm o while both ddrm k and ddrm kt effectively improve the simulation accuracy associated with kg e q compared with ddrm k ddrm kt contributes to better performance in both the high flow and autocorrelation function of streamflow time series in general in terms of the three revised ddrms all additional parameters are sensitive for at least one of the objective functions kg e q and kg e acf demonstrating that the new parameters provide useful information for the rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments 2 a significant trade off relationship exists between the two objective functions kg e q and kg e acf and the shape of the validation result sets is similar to that of the calibration result sets pareto front for ddrm k and ddrm kt which is very different from the case for ddrm o and ddrm t thus it can be inferred that both ddrm k and ddrm kt are more likely to have reasonable model structures relative to ddrm o and ddrm t 3 the original and modified ddrms are able to simulate hydrological processes for each grid element and thus can easily take into consideration the spatial variability of hydrogeological factors e g karst landform precipitation evapotranspiration and topography as well as reservoir regulation impacts with the observed reservoir outflow instead of the simulated streamflow at regulated reservoir locations used for downstream river network routing calculations ddrms generate better simulation results for the outlet of the xijiang basin especially in the validation period on the whole ddrm kt by considering the impacts of both the karst landform and topography on the spatial distributions of hydrological properties such as soil water storage capacity and hydrological processes in the xijiang basin performs best in rainfall runoff simulation and has the potential to be successfully applied to large scale karst

3329,runoff movement in karst catchments is of great complexity although many models have been developed for the rainfall runoff simulation in karst catchments the distributed ones capable of taking into consideration the impacts of the spatial variability of hydrogeological factors are few and can only be applied to well explored karst catchments of commonly less than 100 km2 in area in this study the previously published dem digital elevation model based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm was applied and modified for distributed rainfall runoff simulation in a large scale karst catchment by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing for each grid cell to be a function of karst landform and topographic index i e the mathematical expression of topographic features to represent the hydrological effects of epikarst and underground river system for model structure investigation three versions of the modified ddrms i e the ddrm considering only karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were set up and compared with the original ddrm i e the original ddrm termed as ddrm o all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective optimization framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and the autocorrelation function of streamflow kg e acf as objective functions to improve parameter identifiability the investigation was conducted in the xijiang basin which is a typical karst catchment in southwest china with an area of 309300 km2 the results show that compared with ddrm o ddrm t barely benefits the rainfall runoff simulation while both ddrm k and ddrm kt noticeably enhance the simulation accuracy in terms of kg e q due to the better performance in high flow and autocorrelation function of streamflow ddrm kt outperforms ddrm k in general and has the potential to be successfully applied to large scale karst catchments keywords distributed rainfall runoff simulation large scale karst catchment karst landform topographic index multi objective calibration 1 introduction karst areas cover 15 2 of the earth s ice free continental surface and people living on karst surfaces account for 16 5 of the global population goldscheider et al 2020 rainfall runoff simulations in karst catchments are of great importance for sustainable water resource management however flow in karst areas is one of the most complex hydrogeological phenomena mainly due to the formation of epikarst and underground river karst conduit system caused by the dissolution of soluble rocks atkinson 1977 white and sully 1987 bakalowicz 2005 makropoulos et al 2008 chalikakis et al 2011 bailly comte et al 2012 koit et al 2020 numerous models have been successfully developed for karst rainfall runoff simulation black box models which transfer input to output with analytical transfer functions or neural networks are the simplest models hartmann et al 2014 due to the lack of physical process representation the black box models can only provide reliable simulation results for the conditions they have been calibrated for and can hardly be used under changing environments kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 for prediction purposes process based models such as lumped models semi distributed and distributed models are preferred qiu et al 2019 lumped models conceptualize the physical processes at the scale of the entire karst system mostly based on linear or nonlinear relationship between discharge and storage while semi distributed models and distributed models segment discretize the karst system into small sub systems and two or three dimensional grid cells and then apply physical equations of water flow for each sub system and grid cell respectively adinehvand et al 2017 lodouche et al 2014 hartmann et al 2012 even without any need for karst data lumped models can simulate karst hydrological processes such as epikarst storage and flow diffusion and concentrated recharge to karst conduits and conduit flow and therefore have been applied the most extensively rimmer and salingar 2006 geyer et al 2008 jukic and denic jukic 2009 majone et al 2010 tritz et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 however the lumped models cannot cater to the spatial variability of hydrogeological factors including karst landform topography land use cover evapotranspiration and precipitation which are especially critical for karst catchments dreiss 1982 labat et al 2000 morrissey et al 2020 in contrast semi distributed and distributed models provide more insights into karst hydrological processes especially distributed models which can be better used to evaluate the impacts of karst landform land use cover and climatic change on water resources bittner et al 2018 dubois et al 2020 ladouche et al 2014 malard et al 2016 ollivier et al 2020 sarrazin et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 at present however these distributed models can only be applied to well explored karst catchments of commonly less than 100 km2 in area because of the extensive input data requirements regarding the geometry and structure of karst aquifers hartmann et al 2013a chang et al 2019 it is to say distributed rainfall runoff models applicable for large scale karst catchments which make more sense in water resource management hartmann et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013b need further investigation large scale karst catchments generally consist of karst areas and non karst areas zhou et al 2019 within fissures and fractures whose development degree decreases with the increasing depth the epikarst functions as a water storage system as the infiltration capacity at the surface is much greater than that at the base which is similar to the soil in non karst areas clemens et al 1999 aquilina et al 2006 williams 2008 in terms of underground rivers the network morphological structure is similar to that of surface rivers obeying the horton stream number and length law labarbera and rosso 1989 with a large quantity quick speed and steep gradient the flow in underground rivers has common dynamic change characteristics with surface river runoff white 2002 yang et al 2019 however on the other hand the water storage capacity of epikarst is different from that of the soil in non karst areas due to the existence of well developed fissures and fractures williams 2008 and the runoff generation volume in underground rivers which is regulated by the fissured and fractured matrix varies from that in surface rivers cornaton and perrochet 2002 chen et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013c zhang et al 2017 furthermore driven by the chemical corrosion of water in soluble rocks the development of epikarst is affected by topography with larger thickness and fissure content in areas where the water is easily collected as a result the water storage capacity of epikarst exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity and is correlated with topography adji et al 2019 although highly heterogeneous the epikarst in each grid can be represented by an equivalent porous medium for large scale simulation since the hydraulic properties of a sufficiently large fractured element tend to stabilize bear and bachmat 1990 pankow et al 1986 scanlon et al 2003 rodriguez et al 2013 therefore in view of the hydrologic characteristics of karst areas and non karst areas the distributed rainfall runoff models may be modified for large scale karst catchments by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing for each grid cell to be a function of karst landform and topographic index which refer to the landform developed with epikarst and underground river system and the mathematical expression of topographic feature respectively an excellent model should be capable of simulating key hydrological processes with a simple structure in addition to few data requirements a simple model structure often means low prediction uncertainty as a small number of parameters can be easily identified in the calibration process beven 2006 however a rainfall runoff model simple enough to be well calibrated with only one goodness of fit as objective function which is widely used in previous studies can hardly simulate the complex hydrological processes in kart catchments typically one particular goodness of fit can be used to estimate no more than four to six parameters jakeman and hornberger 1993 to improve the parameter identifiability some additional objective functions have been introduced into the calibration framework of karst rainfall runoff models moussu et al 2011 hartmann et al 2014 chang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 as stated in many studies the autocorrelation function acf of streamflow time series which characterizes the memory effect of karst system can provide meaningful insight into the hydrodynamic properties of karst catchments mangin 1984 hartmann et al 2013d katsanou et al 2015 given the representativeness of karst system functional characteristics moussu et al 2011 used the acf of streamflow time series as an additional information to calibrate the parameters of karst rainfall runoff models and consequently achieved robust and low uncertainty simulation results the objective of this study is to provide a simple and practical approach for distributed rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments with limited karst data to this end the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm proposed by xiong et al 2004 which has simple structure and can be successfully applied to humid non karst catchments long et al 2012 xiong et al 2018 2019 xiong and zeng 2019 yang et al 2021a a was modified by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing for each grid cell to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effects of epikarst and underground river system for model structure investigation three versions of the modified ddrms i e the ddrm considering only karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were set up and compared with the original ddrm ddrm o all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective optimization framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and autocorrelation function of streamflow kg e acf as objective functions to improve parameter identifiability all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective calibration framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and autocorrelation function of streamflow kg e acf as objective functions to improve the parameter identifiability the investigation was conducted in the xijiang basin of southwest china which is a typical large scale karst catchment with an area of 309300 km2 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the xijiang basin up to the changzhou reservoir fig 1 which is a large part of the pearl river basin in southwest china was selected as the study area it covers an area of 309300 km2 with karst areas accounting for 56 6 of the area the elevation ranges from 25 to 2852 m and increases from the southeast to northwest the catchment consists mainly of mountains and hills where soluble rocks are widely distributed and karst landforms such as funnels sinkholes shafts karst caves and underground rivers are well formed the area is dominated by subtropical monsoon and tropical monsoon climates with a mean annual precipitation of 1200 1900 mm and a mean temperature of 14 22 c in addition to the changzhou reservoir there are seven main reservoirs i e tianyi reservoir guangzhao reservoir longtan reservoir yantan reservoir baise reservoir xijin reservoir and honghua reservoir inside the catchment based on the 1 km resolution dem data and the reservoirs spatial data a digital catchment comprised of eight sub catchments fig 1 was generated by using arc hydro tools within arcgis software it is noted that the dem was first modified by imposing the real river network onto it using agree method and filling the sinks and then used for the delineation of catchment and sub catchments 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 hydro meteorological data the hydro meteorological data required to drive ddrms include the discharge data of the catchment outlet and the spatial data of precipitation and reference crop potential evapotranspiration the outlet discharge data used in this study refer to the observed daily inflow of the changzhou reservoir from january 1 2008 to december 31 2018 the daily precipitation and other observed data i e maximum and minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity levels used to compute reference crop potential evapotranspiration pet using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 from 42 meteorological stations fig 1 over the same time period were downloaded from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the point data of daily precipitation and reference crop potential evapotranspiration were further interpolated to 1 km resolution using the inverse distance weighted idw method to match the discrete grids of the digital catchment for distributed rainfall runoff simulation 2 2 2 karst landform data the spatial distribution of soluble rock types fig 2 provided by the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences cags was used to identify the karst landform the order from high to low carbonate contents is pure carbonate rock pure subpure carbonate rock sub pure carbonate rock and impure carbonate rock pure carbonate can be divided into limestone dolomite and limestone dolomite based on lithological differences by contrasting the soluble rock map with the underground river map we found that the distribution of all soluble rocks except the impure carbonate one i e limestone limestone dolomite dolomite pure subpure carbonate rock and sub pure carbonate rock can match well the distribution of underground rivers thus the soluble rocks except the impure carbonate one were identified as karst landform and the others i e impure carbonate rock and non soluble rock were identified as non karst landform in this study 3 methodology 3 1 the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm developed by xiong et al 2004 has simple structure and can well simulate the hydrological process of the humid non karst catchments long et al 2012 xiong et al 2018 xiong and zeng 2019 yang et al 2019 the simulation of ddrm requires to divide catchment into sub catchments with outlets connected by river network each of which is further discretized into regular square gird elements with known elevation fig 3 a generally the hydrologic stations inside the catchment are adopted as the outlets of sub catchments and then the sub catchments are delineated based on the oulets and the flow direction derived from dem data by using arc hydro tools within arcgis software if there is no hydrologic station inside the catchment the outlets can be customized by researchers for sub catchments delineation for each grid element three layers namely soil layer surface layer and river channel layer the grey part green part and cyan part in fig 3b respectively are designed to describe the main hydrological processes ddrm consists of three calculation procedures grid runoff generation grid channel runoff routing and river network runoff routing this original ddrm is termed as ddrm o in order to distinguish from the modified ddrms described later 3 1 1 grid runoff generation the grid runoff generation procedure in ddrm is based on the theory of saturation excess runoff i e surface runoff generation only occurs in the situation where the soil layer becomes saturated fig 3b assuming soil water storage capacity is evenly distributed over the whole catchment the soil water storage capacity of grid i denoted by sm c i can be given as 1 sm c i s where s is the average soil water storage capacity across the catchment and a parameter to be calibrated according to the article of dejonge et al 2012 and chen et al 2019 the actual evapotranspiration e t i can be calculated by 2 e t i s i sm c i k c p e t i where s i is the soil water storage pe t i is the reference crop potential evapotranspiration k c is the crop coefficient but not necessarily the same as the crop coefficient in the traditional sense described by allen et al 1998 due to the lack of the cropping industrial structure data the crop types are considered to be the same throughout the catchment the value of k c ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 was obtained in calibration process to represent the overall features of various crop types instead of specifying the crop type ahead moreover in view of low proportion of the whole catchment area the non crop vegetation cover is not differentiated from the crop vegetation cover in this paper by defining the reference crop as a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of

routing by applying the muskingum routing method gill 1978 to each grid river channel the surface flow calculated in grid runoff generation procedure is routed from upstream grids to downstream grids to obtain the local outflow of each sub catchment for grid i and time t the routed surface outflow for river channel denoted by qou t i t is estimated as follows 9 qou t i t c 0 qi n i t q p i t c 1 qi n i t δ t q p i t δ t 1 c 0 c 1 q o u t i t δ t where qi n i t is the surface inflow and calculated as the sum of the surface outflow from the upstream grids both c 0 and c 1 are grid channel routing parameters with regard to the muskingum method ranging from 0 and 1 and parameters to be calibrated 3 1 3 river network runoff routing the local outflow of each sub catchment calculated in grid channel runoff routing procedure continues to be routed through surface river network also via the muskingum routing method in the case of catchment shown in fig 3a the streamflow at the whole catchment outlet g denoted by o g is composed of three parts i e the streamflow routed from the sub catchment outlet m denoted by o mg the streamflow routed from the sub catchment outlet n denoted by

muskingum method that ranges from 0 to 1 and parameters to be calibrated for sub catchments acting as head watersheds sub catchment m and n in the case shown in fig 3a the outlet streamflow is equal to the local outflow 13 o m t q o u t m t 14 o n t q o u t n t where qou t m t and qou t n t are the local outflow of sub catchment m and n respectively 3 2 model modification for large scale karst catchments 3 2 1 hydrological processes in karst areas large scale karst catchments generally consist of karst areas and non karst areas as shown in fig 4 the hydrological processes in karst areas are complex and differ from those in non karst areas mainly due to the effects of well developed epikarst and underground river system a epikarst effect with more fissures and fractures developed at the surface than at the base epikarst mainly functions as a water storage system in the hydrologic cycle which is similar to the soil in non karst areas however relative to soil epikarst exhibits high water storage capacity in general since the available storage space is greatly enlarged by well developed fissures and fractures williams 1983 b underground river system effect underground river system refers to the set of underground rivers fissures in saturated zone and karst depressions including sinkholes and shafts providing supply passage for underground river runoff rainfall can replenish underground rivers in two ways diffuse flow across fissures and fractures and concentrated flow along sinkholes and shafts once a rainfall event occurs part of the rainfall diffusely infiltrates into the underground saturated zone through the fissures and fractures of the epikarst and unsaturated zone and then laterally flows to recharge underground rivers compared with the surface runoff diffuse flow has a low velocity due to the weak transmissibility in fissures and fractures if rainfall is sufficiently heavy to fill the epikarst the excess rainfall turns into surface runoff with one part flowing to surface rivers and another part concentrating toward karst depressions and subsequently sinking into underground rivers through sinkholes and shafts regulated by the fissures in saturated zone the concentrated flow arriving to underground rivers recharges matrix in the early days when the underground river water level is higher than the matrix water level and later the matrix water in turn recharges underground rivers as underground river water receds the lagging drainage of regulated flow prolongs the rainfall runoff response time and contributes to a gentle streamflow attenuation process despite the high flow velocity at the surface and through the sinkholes and shafts therefore both diffuse flow and concentrated flow need more time to turn into underground river runoff 3 2 2 model setup epikarst with well developed fissures and fractures has a high water storage capacity and the underground river system contributes to an extended rainfall runoff response time as explained in section 3 2 1 in addition topography provides information about the interplay between uplift weathering and erosion and hence about the past morphological development of a landform loritz et al 2019 in terms of karst landform the development of epikarst driven by the chemical corrosion of water in soluble rocks is affected by topography as a result the water storage capacity of epikarst exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity and is correlated with topography adji et al 2019 in the hydrologic cycle epikarst and underground rivers mainly function as water storage system and water conducted channels similar to the soil and surface rivers of non karst areas respectively given that one karst depression covers a small drainage area in general the grid cell covering more than 1 km2 area which often consists of several karst depressions drainage area and other areas can be regarded as a uniform thus the routing sequence change resulting from karst depressions such as sinkholes and shafts whose spatial distribution is generally unavailable can be neglected for the rainfall runoff simulations in large scale karst catchments moreover underground rivers and surface rivers have similar network morphological structures and often connect to each other therefore it is unnecessary to distinguish underground rivers from surface rivers for large scale karst catchments that commonly have extensive underground and surface rivers since underground rivers act as the small tributary streams of surface rivers in most cases the digital river network was extracted with a relatively small drainage area threshold to include underground rivers therefore the topological structures of the surface river system and underground river system i e underground rivers and the channels of underground river flow supply such as karst depressions fissures and fractures were built together by using the traditional method instead of constructing an individual system specific to the underground river system on the other hand meeting with low resistance the runoff routing through underground rivers has common dynamic change characteristics compared with surface river flow white 2002 bonacci et al 2009 luo et al 2016 and thus can be calculated using the muskingum routing method given that the hydraulic properties of a sufficiently large fractured element tend to stabilize the highly heterogeneous karst system in each grid element can be represented by an equivalent porous medium scanlon et al 2003 rodriguez et al 2013 thus the ddrm was modified for large scale karst catchments by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing in each grid element to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effects of epikarst and underground river system in addition to the original ddrm termed ddrm o described in section 3 1 three versions of the modified ddrms were set up to investigate whether the introduction of karst landform and topographic index information benefits the distributed rainfall runoff simulation for large scale karst catchments namely 1 the ddrm considering only impacts of karst landform termed ddrm k in this case the water storage capacity of grid element i sm c i is assumed to be related to the landform types rather than uniformly distributed over the entire catchment and is computed as 15 sm c i s for l i n k l k s s for l i k l where s is the average soil water storage capacity across the non karstic landforms k s is a correction parameter that reflects the effects of epikarst on average water storage capacity l i is the landform type of grid element i and nkl and kl represent the non karst landform and karst landform respectively noting that s and k s are parameters to be calibrated the regulation of fissured matrix on diffuse flow and concentrated flow entering underground rivers is represented by a prolonged grid runoff generation process for large scale karst catchments thus the grid runoff generation q p i t is expressed with the following equation 16 q p i t s p i t tp for l i n k l s p i t k tp t p for l i k l where tp is a time constant reflecting the surface runoff generation velocity in non karstic landforms k tp is a correction parameter that reflects the effects of underground river system on runoff generation velocity noting that tp and k tp are parameters to be calibrated thus in the ddrm k version equation 15 is used for calculating sm c i and equation 16 for calculating q p i t and all other formulas used are the same as those in the ddrm o version 2 the ddrm considering only impacts of topography termed as ddrm t to account for the impact of topography the water storage capacity of each grid element is considered to be related to the corresponding topographic index ti the topographic index defined as the logarithm of the ratio of upslope contributing area per contour length to the local slope is the mathematical expression of topographic features beven and kirkby 1979 xiong and guo 2004 17 t i i ln a i tan β i where t i i denotes the topographic index of grid element i a i is the upslope contributing area per unit contour length for grid element i and tan β i is the slope of the ground surface at the location the equation for estimating the spatial distribution of smc is expressed as 18 sm c i s 0 t i i t i min t i max t i min n s m where s 0 and sm denote the minimum value and variation range of the water storage capacity throughout the catchment respectively n denotes an empirical constant reflecting the heterogeneity degree of smc which ranges from 0 to 1 and t i max and t i min denote the maximum and minimum value of grid based topographic indexes throughout the catchment respectively note that s 0 sm and n belong to the parameters required to be calibrated thus in the ddrm t version equation 18 is used to calculate sm c i and all other formulas used are the same as those in the ddrm o version 3 the ddrm considering the impacts of both karst landform and topography termed ddrm kt in this case the water storage capacity parameter smc is assumed to be controlled by both the landform type and topography and thus calculated by taking into account both the landform type information and the topographic index thus the water storage capacity for a particular location is determined by the following equation 19 sm c i s 0 t i i t i min t i max t i min n s m for l i n k l s 0 t i i t i min t i max t i min n k sm s m for l i k l where sm denotes the variation range of the water storage capacity throughout the non karstic landforms k sm is a correction parameter that reflects the effect of epikarst on the variation range of water storage capacity note that sm and k sm belong to the parameters required to be calibrated the grid runoff generation calculation in ddrm kt is modified to be the same as in ddrm k by employing equation 16 thus in the ddrm kt version equation 19 is used for calculating sm c i and equation 16 for calculating q p i t and all other formulas used are the same as those in the ddrm o version all the four ddrms were programmed using c language and run at a daily time step extracted from 1 km resolution dem data the digital catchment consists of approximately 309 300 grid cells involved in the model simulation 3 3 model calibration and evaluation a multi objective optimization procedure based on the nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 using the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 of streamflow kg e q and the autocorrelation function larocque et al 1998 of streamflow time series kg e acf as objective functions was carried out to calibrate the model parameters details of the ddrm parameters required to be calibrated are presented in table 1 in the nsga iii based multi objective calibration the maximum generation of 300 and population size of 100 were set to acquire the pareto front of kg e q and kg e acf the 2008 2015 and 2016 2018 data were used for calibration and validation respectively the outlet discharge data for model calibration refer to the observed daily inflow of the changzhou reservoir for both the calibration and validation the first 100 days was set as the warm up period incorporating three basic assessment indices i e pearson s linear correlation coefficient bias and a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values the kling gupta efficiency kge is defined as follows 20 kge 1 r 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between observations and simulations and μ o σ o and μ s σ s represent the means and standard deviations of observations and simulations respectively the kge value ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 indicating a better simulation performance with the observed and simulated streamflow data the kge statistic of streamflow denoted by kg e q can be easily obtained evaluating to what extent streamflow depends on the preceding values over a specified time period lag time the autocorrelation function acf of streamflow time series is classically used to characterize the memory effect of karst catchments mangin 1984 herman et al 2009 hartmann et al 2013b katsanou et al 2015 li et al 2017 for lag time l the autocorrelation function of a streamflow time series is computed as 21 a c f l t 1 n l q t q q t l q t 1 n q t q 2 where l is the lag time n is the length of the time series q t and q t l are the streamflow at times t and t l respectively and q is the mean value of streamflow over the entire record period as an acf below 0 2 is essentially identical to the acf of noise the lag time corresponding to an acf value of 0 2 is considered the characteristic lag time which represents the memory of the karst catchment mangin 1984 fu et al 2016 the kge of the streamflow autocorrelation function kg e acf which assesses the ability to reproduce the autocorrelation functional characteristic of the karst system is calculated with the following equation 22 kg e acf 1 r ac f s a c f o 1 2 μ ac f s μ ac f o 1 2 σ ac f s σ ac f o 1 2 where ac f s and ac f o represent the acf of simulated and observed streamflow respectively it is noted that the acf used to compute kg e acf refers to those with lag times no larger than the characteristic lag time to clearly show the performance difference of the four ddrms three pareto front optimal solutions were selected to represent the typical calibration scenarios including s1 the extreme solution with the lowest kg e q and highest kg e acf s2 the trade off solution with the median kg e q and kg e acf and s3 the extreme solution with the highest kg e q and lowest kg e acf the evaluation content of model performance in these three typical calibration scenarios consists of statistical indices the autocorrelation function acf of streamflow time series and the flow duration curve fdc the fdc represents the probability of a time specified flow being exceeded or equaled as one of the typical hydrological signatures to evaluate the model behavior of a catchment the fdc provides insights into how streamflow is distributed across high to low flow regimes euser et al 2013 wide margins between simulated and observed series in the fdc indicate that the bias of simulated streamflow is significant apart from kg e q and kg e acf the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of streamflow traditionally used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological modeling was also computed as a referenced statistical index the expression of the nse is given as follows 23 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where q sim t and q obs t are the simulated and observed streamflow for time t respectively and q obs is the mean value of the observed streamflow the nse value ranges from to 1 and a value of 1 indicates a perfect match between the simulations and observations 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis due to the extra consideration of hydrological characteristics the revised ddrms involve more calibrated parameters in comparsion to the original ddrm model ddrm o e g there are two more parameters in ddrm k and ddrm t and four more parameters in ddrm kt to identify whether the extra parameters benefit the rainfall runoff simulation parameter sensitivity was evaluated through the regional sensitivity analysis rsa method which is based on random sampling of parameter space and could be easily used with multiple objectives chang et al 2017 the rsa method was implemented within the safe sensitivity analysis for everybody toolbox pianosi et al 2015 2020 wagener et al 2001 for each ddrm the upper and lower values of each parameter extracted from the pareto solutions i e the multi objective calibration result sets were increased and decreased by 20 respectively as the bounds of each parameter and 5 000 parameter samples were generated within this range using the latin hypercube method over a uniform distribution then each ddrm was run with its parameter samples to obtain objective function values and the parameter samples were divided into ten groups of equal size according to the objective function values finally the distance between every two cumulative distribution functions cdfs of parameter groups was measured by the kolmogorov smirnov ks statistic and the maximum ks was extracted as the sensitivity index si 24 s i x max k s x max max x f i x f j x where f i x and f j x are the cdfs of parameter x in groups i and j respectively the sensitivity index si ranges from 0 to 1 with a value closer to 1 indicating the higher sensitivity of the parameter 4 results and discussion 4 1 multi objective calibration and validation result sets fig 5 illustrates the variation of model parameter sets along the pareto front obtained in the calibration process all parameter values are normalized with respect to the upper and lower bounds given in table 1 therefore their ranges are between 0 and 1 it is noteworthy that the normalized values of k s k sm and k tp being equal to 0 05 indicate that the water storage capacity of epikarst remains constant with that of the soil in non karst areas and that the rainfall runoff response time in karst areas is not affected by the underground river system respectively the higher the degree of parameter k s k sm and k tp exceeding 0 05 the more significant effect of epikarst and underground rivers system the large k s in ddrm k and k sm in ddrm kt with normalized values of 0 26 0 91 and 0 11 0 53 respectively show the high water storage capacity of epikarst in terms of parameter k tp the normalized values are even greater ranging from 0 88 to 0 99 for ddrm k and from 0 92 to 0 99 for ddrm kt which indicates that the rainfall runoff response time in karst areas is significantly prolonged by the underground river system given the significant differences of both the water storage capacity and rainfall runoff response time between karst areas and non karst areas it can be inferred that the karst landform is well developed in the xijiang basin and thus the simulation results may be improved by the ddrms considering karst landform i e ddrm k and ddrm kt the pareto fronts of the four ddrms acquired in the multi objective calibration process and the corresponding validation result sets are shown in fig 6 it can be found from the pareto fronts that there is a significant trade off relationship between the two objective functions kg e q and kg e acf indicating that a single objective calibration cannot fully capture the hydrological characteristics of karst catchments and the multi objective calibration will be helpful this is in line with the finding of moussu et al 2011 furthermore the shape of validation result sets is very different from that of the pareto fronts for ddrm o and ddrm t which may be attributed to the error in model structure and measurement data as pointed out by fenicia et al 2008 in contrast the validation result sets for ddrm k and ddrm kt retain similar shapes with the pareto fronts acquired in the calibration process thus it can be inferred that both ddrm k and ddrm kt are more likely to have reasonable structures relative to ddrm o and ddrm t accuracy comparison of the three modified ddrms with ddrm o illustrates that ddrm t can hardly benefit the simulation results while both ddrm k and ddrm kt effectively improve the simulation accuracy in terms of kg e q despite the futility of ddrm o the introduction of topographic index does work on the condition that the karst landform has been considered in general ddrm kt shows better performance than ddrm k particularly with trade off solutions where both kg e q and kg e acf reach a high value 4 2 model performance in typical calibration scenarios 4 2 1 evaluation statistics table 2 illustrates the evaluation statistics of the four ddrms in the three typical scenarios during the calibration and validation period the performance in the validation period remains consistent with that in the calibration period for example the ddrm with better performance in the calibration period also performs better in the validation period and for both the calibration and validation periods an increase in kg e q and nse values and a decrease in the kg e acf value can be found in the four ddrms from s1 to s3 in s1 ddrm kt significantly outperforms the other three ddrms with kg e q and nse values 3 8 4 6 and 7 4 9 4 higher in the calibration period respectively and 2 6 3 7 and 7 8 8 2 higher in validation period respectively in s2 compared with ddrm o and ddrm t the performance associated with kg e q and nse gets improved in ddrm k and ddrm kt and the performance with regard to kg e acf remains almost the same for ddrm kt and gets worse for ddrm k in terms of the improvement degree of kg e q and nse performance ddrm kt is more pronounced than ddrm k in calibration period and similar to ddrm k in the validation period in s3 ddrm kt provides higher accuracy in terms of kg e q kg e acf and nse and ddrm k contributes to better kg e q and nse performances at the expense of kg e acf relative to ddrm o 4 2 2 flow duration curve the fdcs derived from the simulated and observed streamflows in three typical scenarios are displayed in fig 7 the curve shape shows a disproportionate representation of high medium and low flow with the low flow being dominant for the high flow simulation that determines the flood forecast quality ddrm kt with relatively small estimation bias performs best in general followed by ddrm k and then ddrm t and ddrm o unlike the steady performance of ddrm kt the performance of ddrm k declines drastically from s1 to s3 in s3 ddrm k even performs worse than ddrm t and ddrm o during the validation period it is therefore concluded that the great advantage of high flow simulation enables ddrm kt to be most attractive for the flood forecasting in large scale karst catchments 4 2 3 autocorrelation function of streamflow time series both diffuse flow and concentrated flow need more time to turn into underground river runoff and thus underground river system contributes to an extended rainfall runoff response time and characteristic lag time as shown in fig 8 the characteristic lag times computed from the observed streamflow are very large with values of 59 days in the calibration period of 2008 2015 and 70 days in the validation period of 2016 2018 indicating that the epikarst and underground river system in xijiang basin are well developed for both the calibration and validation periods the acf curve can be divided into two parts namely the steep decrease in the first few days and the gentle decrease in the following several weeks these two types of decreases can be attributed to the fast flow and the slow flow which are associated with large fractures and conduits as well as small fissures and fractures respectively with regard to the acf of simulated streamflow the performance varies with the model structure and calibration scenario for the initial stage with a steep decrease all four ddrms have ideal acf performance in s1 and the performances suffer from different degrees of decline with the degradation of the objective function kg e acf as a result there exists an apparent performance discrepancy between ddrm kt and ddrm k in s2 and s3 i e the former performs best and the latter performs worst for the following stage with a gentle decrease ddrm kt and ddrm k are superior to ddrm t and ddrm o with the exception of s3 in the validation period in addition the comparison between ddrm kt and ddrm k demonstrates that better acf performance can be achieved by ddrm kt in short therefore ddrm kt performs best across all stages and ddrm t performs worst in the initial stage but outperforms ddrm k and ddrm o in terms of the acf simulation 4 3 parameter sensitivity analysis as described in section 3 4 the maximum kolmogorov smirnov ks was extracted as the sensitivity index si of the parameters using the rsa method the parameters with si values greater than 0 1 are considered to be sensitive otherwise they are considered to be insensitive jiang et al 2018 table 3 shows the si statistics of the parameters in the four ddrms during the calibration period of 2008 2015 and the validation period of 2016 2018 it can be seen that the parameter sensitivity varies with the objective function analysis period model structure and parameter for instance the parameter k c is highly sensitive for kg e q but reluctantly sensitive or insensitive for kg e acf which indicates that different parameters may control different aspects of streamflow thus multi objective calibration facilitates the identification of more parameters with regard to the revised ddrms all additional parameters are sensitive for at least one of the objective functions kg e q and kg e acf specifically both kg e q and kg e acf are sensitive to the parameters k s and k tp in ddrm t the parameters s0 sm and n in ddrm k and the parameters s0 sm and k tp in ddrm kt and kg e q is sensitive to the parameters n and k sm in ddrm kt noting that kg e acf is also sensitive to the parameter k sm in ddrm kt in the validation period thus it can be concluded that the additional parameters induced in the revised ddrms provide useful information for the rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments 4 4 spatial distributions of the simulated soil epikarst moisture and streamflow as distributed rainfall runoff models the original and modified ddrms can simulate not only the streamflow at the catchment outlet but also the soil or epikarst moisture and streamflow at each grid element due to the unavailability of soil and epikarst depth water storage cannot be converted to moisture content and thus the saturation degree s r i t computed as the ratio of water storage s i t to the water storage capacity sm c i for grid i and time t is used to characterize moisture conditions taking three typical days of flood event 20090707 for the changzhou reservoir i e 3 july water rising day 7 july flood peak day and 12 july water falling day in year 2009 for instance both spatial distributions of gridded saturation degree fig 9 and gridded streamflow fig 10 simulated by ddrm o and ddrm kt with parameters of s2 are compared fig 9 shows the saturation degrees in many downstream grids are nearly 1 on water rising days and flood peak days and those in upstream grids exhibit a downtrend from the water rising day to the flood peak day on water falling days the saturation degree decreases largely for almost all grids because of the continuous evapotranspiration unlike that of ddrm o there is distinct variation in the simulated saturation degree between the two types of landforms for ddrm kt with values in karst landform obviously less than those in non karst landform the reason for the variation can be attributed to the fact that the high water storage capacity of epikarst makes the karst landform less likely to be saturated than the non karst landform after a given rainfall event with regard to the simulated streamflow an increase can be found from upstream to downstream and the values in upstream and downstream grids reach a high level on water rising days and flood peak days respectively fig 10 furthermore the spatial distribution of simulated streamflow is very different between ddrm o and ddrm kt on water rising days the streamflow simulated by ddrm kt is generally lower than that simulated by ddrm o in karst landform grids and higher than that simulated by ddrm o in non karst landform grids especially upstream of the catchment on water falling days however the spatial distribution is the opposite with ddrm kt simulating lower streamflow in karst landform grids and higher streamflow in non karst landform grids than ddrm o 4 5 impacts of reservoir regulation on rainfall runoff simulation reservoir regulation is one major factor that affects the natural rainfall runoff process gao et al 2019 due to the temporal mismatch between water supply and demand regulated reservoirs often store water during the rainy season and supply irrigated fields and urban areas during the dry season which results in a decrease in peak flow and an increase in minimum flow doll et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in this section the impacts of reservoir regulation on rainfall runoff simulation will be investigated although reservoir regulation impacts may be partly implicit in the calibrated parameters a rainfall runoff model without reservoir regulation practice incorporated can hardly contribute to perfect simulation results because of its limited physical process representation compared with lumped models distributed rainfall runoff models are capable of incorporating reservoir regulation practice easily because they simulate the hydrological process for each geo spatial location regulation practice determines the reservoir outflow which can be estimated by the simulated inflow reservoir properties and operation rules or observed with a flowmeter chen et al 2018 with complicated and time consuming processes reservoir outflow estimation is not the focus of this paper and therefore reservoir regulation practice was incorporated into the four ddrms by treating the observed outflow of regulated reservoirs as model inputs specifically the simulated streamflow at regulated reservoir locations were replaced with the observed reservoir outflow for the downstream river network routing calculation to exclude the regulation impacts to recognize the regulated reservoirs the goodness of fit between daily inflow and outflow was evaluated with indicator kg e q for the main reservoirs inside the xijiang basin except the baise reservoir whose data were unavailable given the small drainage area of the upstream region nearly 5 5 of the entire catchment the baise reservoir even with regulation practice will have little impact on the rainfall runoff simulation table 4 in this study the hydrological impacts of the baise reservoir were neglected and the reservoirs with kg e q values far lower than 90 0 i e guangzhao tianyi and longtan reservoirs were recognized as regulated reservoirs as the guangzhao reservoir and tianyi reservoir are located upstream of the longtan reservoir only the observed outflow of the longtan reservoir was involved in the catchment outlet i e the changzhou reservoir runoff calculation that is the model parameters for the upstream of the longtan reservoir which covers 34 4 of the entire catchment were not calibrated using the inflow data of the changzhou reservoir these parameters can be calibrated with the observed inflow and outflow data of the guangzhao reservoir and tianyi reservoir as well as the observed inflow data of the longtan reservoir but were set to be the same as the other areas in the xijiang basin because the discussion was mainly directed at the catchment outlet instead of the sub catchment outlets for model performance comparison the four ddrms with reservoir regulation practice incorporated were calibrated for the period of 2008 2015 and validated for the period of 2016 2018 the calibration was also based on the nsga iii algorithm with kg e q and kg e acf as objective functions and the normalized parameter values along the pareto optimal solutions obtained in calibration are displayed in fig 11 it can be found that the calibrated parameter values of the four ddrms changed compared with those without regulation practice incorporated fig 5 the large k s and k sm in the ddrms with reservoir regulation practice incorporated indicates that the difference in water storage capacity between epikarst and soil should be given sufficient attention in the rainfall runoff simulation of large scale karst catchments as the impacts of reservoir regulation have been eliminated ddrms incorporating regulation practice may contribute to better performance in parameter estimation and rainfall runoff simulation the comparison of table 2 and 5 demonstrates that the model performance can be improved by incorporating reservoir regulation practice and the improvement is especially pronounced in the validation period on the other hand ddrm kt outperforms the other three ddrms in the situation where reservoir regulation practice has been incorporated table 5 which remains consistent with the situation without regulation practice incorporated table 2 as the simulated streamflow in the upstream of the longtan reservoir which covers 34 4 of the xijiang basin is replaced with the observed outflow of the longtan reservoir for the catchment outlet runoff calculation the outperformance degree of ddrm kt declines after the incorporation of reservoir regulation practice 4 6 discussion three modified versions of the ddrm i e the ddrm considering only the karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only the topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both the karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were provided and compared regarding the rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments by assuming the main parameters of runoff generation and routing in each grid element to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effect of epikarst and underground river system the modified ddrms have simple structure and just need karst landform data as additional input the application results in xijiang basin with an area of 309300 km2 showed that both ddrm k and ddrm kt noticeably enhance the simulation accuracy in terms of kg e q and ddrm kt also contributes to better performance in high flow and autocorrelation function of streamflow thus ddrm kt has the potential to be successfully applied to large scale karst catchments that commonly lacks detailed karst data such as the location and geometry of karst depressions underground rivers matrices and springs benefiting from the distributed modeling pattern ddrm kt has comparative advantages in rainfall runoff simulation under the influence of human activities and climate change and thus can play a crucial role in the water resource management of karst catchments in view of the fact that the crop growth module is so mature that can be easily incorporated into ddrm kt the spatial variability of vegetation not considered in the current version can be fully captured in the future if necessary the modifications for the distributed rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments depend on several assumptions 1 the routing sequence change resulting from karst depressions can be neglected due to the small drainage area each karst depression covers 2 the routing sequence change resulting from underground rivers can be neglected because of the similar network morphological structure with surface rivers 3 the runoff routing through underground rivers can be calculated using the muskingum routing method in view of the common dynamic changes characteristic with surface river flow and 4 the highly heterogeneous karst system in each grid element can be represented by an equivalent porous medium since the hydraulic properties of a sufficiently large fractured element tend to be stable although making sense in theory these assumptions especially the first two that are not fully tested in practical applications need further investigation for example an experiment regarding a comparison of two kinds of distributed models i e one neglecting the routing sequence change resulting from karst depressions and underground rivers and one not neglecting is expected to be conducted in some well explored large scale karst catchments to better support the second kind of model it is necessary to develop a novel system for the digital basin auto extraction of large scale karst catchments including the identification of karst depressions extraction of underground rivers and determination of gridded flow direction although researchers have been studying karst depression identification wu et al 2016 moreno gomez et al 2019 zumpano et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 it is still far from being used in the application for large scale karst catchments because of the high spatial resolution of the dem used for karst depression identification commonly ranging from 1 m to 10 m another question worth exploring is at what spatial scale the model assumptions can be successfully extended to in this research the study area i e the xijiang basin with an area of 309300 km2 is sufficiently large to conform with the model assumptions for karst catchments covering relatively small areas however the assumptions may no longer apply in this case the scale threshold associated with the characteristics of karst aquifers needs further investigation through applications in vast karst catchments 5 conclusions this paper applied and modified the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm for distributed rainfall runoff simulation over a large scale karst catchment by assuming the main parameters related to runoff generation and routing for each grid element to be a function of karst landform and topographic index to represent the hydrological effect of epikarst and underground river system three versions of the modified ddrms i e the ddrm considering only the karst landform ddrm k the ddrm considering only the topographic index ddrm t and the ddrm considering both the karst landform and topographic index ddrm kt were investigated and compared with the original ddrm model ddrm o all four ddrms were calibrated with a multi objective optimization framework that uses the kling gupta efficiency of streamflow kg e q and autocorrelation function of streamflow time series kg e acf as objective functions to improve parameter identifiability the investigation was conducted in a typical large scale karst catchment i e the xijiang basin in southwest china which has an area of 309300 km2 the main conclusions are given as follows 1 ddrm t barely improves the simulation accuracy over ddrm o while both ddrm k and ddrm kt effectively improve the simulation accuracy associated with kg e q compared with ddrm k ddrm kt contributes to better performance in both the high flow and autocorrelation function of streamflow time series in general in terms of the three revised ddrms all additional parameters are sensitive for at least one of the objective functions kg e q and kg e acf demonstrating that the new parameters provide useful information for the rainfall runoff simulation in large scale karst catchments 2 a significant trade off relationship exists between the two objective functions kg e q and kg e acf and the shape of the validation result sets is similar to that of the calibration result sets pareto front for ddrm k and ddrm kt which is very different from the case for ddrm o and ddrm t thus it can be inferred that both ddrm k and ddrm kt are more likely to have reasonable model structures relative to ddrm o and ddrm t 3 the original and modified ddrms are able to simulate hydrological processes for each grid element and thus can easily take into consideration the spatial variability of hydrogeological factors e g karst landform precipitation evapotranspiration and topography as well as reservoir regulation impacts with the observed reservoir outflow instead of the simulated streamflow at regulated reservoir locations used for downstream river network routing calculations ddrms generate better simulation results for the outlet of the xijiang basin especially in the validation period on the whole ddrm kt by considering the impacts of both the karst landform and topography on the spatial distributions of hydrological properties such as soil water storage capacity and hydrological processes in the xijiang basin performs best in rainfall runoff simulation and has the potential to be successfully applied to large scale karst
