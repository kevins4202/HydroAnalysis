6450,the agro hydrological soil water atmosphere plant world food study swap wofost model in a distributed manner represents an important tool for evaluating agro hydrological cycles and irrigation strategies at different spatiotemporal scales the reliability of the model simulations and evaluations is dependent on the generation of the distributed simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors as well as parameter calibration and model validation in this study we focused on the most typical overexploited deep groundwater area in the north china plain ncp first the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast was used to conduct global sensitivity analyses for three modules in the swap wofost model to identify the parameters that significantly influence the objective variables for calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area on this basis the parameters were calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed data from each station the normalized root mean square error nrmse values for soil water content soil salt concentration winter wheat leaf area index lai winter wheat aboveground biomass winter wheat yield summer maize lai summer maize aboveground biomass and summer maize yield were 14 93 27 20 24 60 25 27 23 12 24 55 21 33 and 17 94 respectively during the calibration period and the corresponding nrmse values were 16 26 29 36 24 20 22 75 21 77 22 03 24 38 and 18 62 respectively during the validation period the model provided a good simulation for the soil water contents and summer maize yields and a fair simulation for the other objective variables furthermore a distributed swap wofost model was generated by overlaying 12 maps involving meteorology soil crops land use water resources and administrative divisions yielding 2809 simulation units finally the simulation accuracy of the distributed model was evaluated under the current irrigation conditions the results showed that the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize were consistent with the statistical values and the simulated evapotranspiration matched the remote sensing data with acceptable precision in summary the distributed swap wofost model could be used as an effective tool for simulating crop water productivity in time and space under limited irrigation scenarios and for evaluating the effect of optimized limited irrigation schemes on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region keywords overexploited deep groundwater area distributed swap wofost model regional heterogeneity multisource data multiscale validation global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial water source for irrigation and plays a substantial role in securing global food production giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 wada et al 2012 döll et al 2012 deep groundwater is characterized by slower renewal and lower recharge than shallow groundwater alley et al 2002 shi et al 2011 russo and lall 2017 even so with an increasing population and an ever expanding irrigated area deep groundwater has been more or less exploited for irrigation in several countries e g china foster et al 2004 the united states scanlon et al 2012 kang and jackson 2016 russo and lall 2017 india reshmidevi and kumar 2014 iran mahmoudi et al 2017 tunisia alaya et al 2014 and other countries the north china plain ncp the east central ncp i e heilonggang region in particular is a fairly representative area for studying this issue and deep groundwater has been overexploited for irrigation over the past 40 years foster et al 2004 zheng et al 2010 huang et al 2015 however the ncp is not only a key grain producing region for china liu et al 2001 jeong et al 2014 but also a core area for increasing the grain production capacity the central people s government of the people s republic of china 2009 clearly the dilemma between deep groundwater depletion and grain production in the heilonggang region has been intensified further for this reason this region can be viewed as a massive and optimal laboratory for the entire world thus providing an opportunity to study how to plant crops with limited water to adapt to the goal of deep groundwater conservation in other words this study could provide a reference for areas in the world that are experiencing or will experience similar deep groundwater security crises and facilitate meeting the urgent agricultural water management demands in this typical region which is facing sharp contradictions between water and food needs there are spatial variabilities in meteorological elements e g precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation ren et al 2007 wang et al 2008 soil types sdc 1990 land use types resdc 2005 crop varieties and cultivation practices wang 2004 in the ncp therefore using an agro hydrological model in a distributed manner that can account for the spatial heterogeneities of abovementioned factors droogers et al 2000 singh 2005 would be an important and possibly unique scientific tool for evaluating the agro hydrological cycles and agricultural water management strategies at a regional scale over the past 20 years abundant data on meteorology land use soil crop cultivation farmland irrigation hydrogeology exploration and groundwater resource assessments from the study area have been accumulated these data which are related to the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac provide a good basis for establishing a distributed agro hydrological model calibrating parameters and validating the model in this area in view of these multisource and multiscale data the soil water atmosphere plant swap model which is a deterministic agro hydrological model based on hydrological chemical and biological processes singh et al 2006c was used in this study in particular the embedded detailed crop growth module of the swap model is based on the world food study wofost model boogaard et al 1998 singh et al 2006c kroes et al 2009 the swap or swap wofost model has been used to evaluate the effects of irrigation strategies on crop yield water productivity wp and water balance at the field scale sarwar et al 2000 sarwar and bastiaanssen 2001 singh et al 2006c vazifedoust et al 2008 ma et al 2011 rodrigues and van vliet 2014 furthermore when the model is used in a distributed manner and integrated with geographic information system gis data it has been used to assess irrigation performance and quantitatively analyze the crop yield wp and water balance responses to irrigation scenarios at regional scales for one or many years droogers et al 2000 singh et al 2006b singh et al 2006a noory et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 this evidence indicates that the distributed swap wofost model is an effective tool for the quantitative study of agro hydrological cycle and regional water resource management from the results of these studies it is clear that the simulation and assessment credibility depend considerably on reliable parameters and reasonable boundary conditions obviously these criteria are heavily reliant on the data richness and completeness hence fully mining multisource and multiscale data to obtain the required information is critical for high quality parameter calibration and model validation as noted above the heilonggang region is an area that has as of today accumulated the most relatively abundant data in china in relation to agro hydrology including field experimental data field investigation data and evaluation results these data not only make it possible to perform detailed parameter calibration and validation based on the identification results of global sensitivity analysis but also allow for the generation of simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors at the regional scale these premises are ideal for properly evaluating the effects of limited irrigation on wp and reducing deep groundwater exploitation using the swap wofost model in a distributed manner the objectives of this study are to 1 conduct a global sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters that require calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area 2 perform detailed parameter calibration and validation based on the sensitivity analysis results and observed data at each station 3 generate simulation units for the distributed swap wofost model by overlaying 12 types of information related to the meteorology soil crops irrigation land use water resources and administrative divisions and 4 run a simulation for a period of 20 years under the current irrigation conditions and then evaluate the simulation accuracy of the distributed swap wofost model using statistical yields and remote sensing evapotranspiration et 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area which is the heilonggang region is located in the ncp and represents the main overexploited deep groundwater area in hebei province fig 1 a the study region covers approximately 40 000 km2 and lies between 36 03 39 37 n latitude and 114 43 117 48 e longitude and administratively it contains 53 counties wang 2010 the region is in the warm temperate semi arid and semi humid monsoon climate zone the annual average precipitation is 544 7 mm and the annual average frost free period is approximately 206 days long wang 2010 the annual average temperature and sunshine duration vary from 13 c to 14 c and from 2103 h to 2363 h respectively wang 2010 the climate has sufficient light appropriate temperatures and a synchronization of temperature and precipitation that result in a high agricultural yield potential wang 2010 the geomorphological types of the study area are primarily low elevation alluvial plain and low elevation river floodplain national earth system science data sharing infrastructure and national science and technology infrastructure of china 1996 the elevation gradually decreases from approximately 50 m in the southwest to approximately 1 m in the coastal plain international scientific and technical data mirror site et al 2009 the dominant soil type is fluvio aquatic soil sdc 1990 the average cultivated area is 33 619 km2 resdc 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 which accounts for 83 38 of the study area this region is one of the main grain production areas in hebei province and the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the most important planting pattern wang 2010 general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 therefore we focused on this predominant planting pattern when conducting the agro hydrological simulations in this study researchers have conducted field experiments at several experimental stations in this region and six of these stations i e langfang xiongxian nanpi shenzhou wuqiao and quzhou stations fig 1b with relatively abundant data were selected from north to south for the parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation 2 2 brief introduction to the swap model the swap model simulates soil water movement solute transport and heat transfer in the vadose zone in interactions with crop growth kroes et al 2009 in this study the soil water flow simulation was based on the richards equation which includes root water uptake by plants and the convection dispersion equation was used to simulate solute transport kroes et al 2009 canopy interception for agricultural crops is computed according to the von hoyningen hüne and braden formula kroes et al 2009 potential evapotranspiration etp is estimated by the penman monteith equation using daily weather data and crop characteristics furthermore etp is subdivided into potential transpiration tp and potential evaporation ep which accounts for partial soil cover wet dry and saline soil conditions may affect root water extraction and reduce the conversion of tp to actual transpiration ta wet or dry water stress is described by the function in feddes et al 1978 and salinity stress is described by the function in maas and hoffman 1977 when the soil becomes drier ep becomes actual evaporation ea kroes et al 2009 the swap model contains both simple and detailed crop growth modules the simple module describes crop growth by the observed leaf area index lai crop height and rooting depth as a function of the crop development stage dvs singh et al 2006c the main function of this module is to provide proper upper boundary conditions for soil water movement kroes et al 2009 compared with the simple module the detailed module simulates photosynthesis and crop development and calculates the potential yield and actual yield due to water and or salt stress kroes et al 2009 for the sake of distinction the model in this study is called swap when the simple module is used and swap wofost when the detailed module is used the swap model offers eight lower boundary conditions for a typical scale of applications kroes et al 2009 2 3 parameter sensitivity analysis the swap wofost is a complex agro hydrological model involving spac and the complexity of the swap wofost is such that the model has many parameters because these parameters are difficult time consuming and laborious to measure performing a sensitivity analysis that identifies the parameters that do or do not have a significant influence on the model outputs can reduce the number of parameters that require calibration in this study the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 saltelli et al 2005 which is a combination of sobol s method and the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast was adopted for the global sensitivity analysis efast is a variance based method in which the total variance can be decomposed into partial variances the first order sensitivity index si and total sensitivity index sti of parameter xi were calculated higher sti values indicate greater effects of xi and the interactions of xi with all the other parameters on model outputs saltelli et al 2004 saltelli et al 2008 the key steps of the sensitivity analysis were as follows 1 determination of parameters and output variables for sensitivity analysis three modules i e soil water movement soil salt transport and crop growth were applied in this study in addition a sensitivity analysis can be conducted to improve the parameter calibration efficiency thus a sensitivity analysis was proposed to identify the parameters in the above three modules that could significantly influence the outputs that had observed values for calibration fig 2 because soil water movement affects soil salt transport sensitivity analyses of the two modules were conducted jointly specifically the sensitivities of six van genuchten mualem vg m hydraulic parameters and the dispersion length l of three layers 0 20 cm 20 70 cm and 70 200 cm for a total of 21 parameters to the soil water content and soil salt concentration of each layer were analyzed at each of the six stations the six hydraulic parameters include the residual water content ores saturated water content osat saturated conductivity k s and three shape factors α n and λ notably the soil profile at each station was uniformly divided into a top layer 0 20 cm subsurface layer 20 70 cm and bottom layer 70 200 cm to ensure the comparability of the sensitivity analysis results four soil properties i e the percentages of sand silt and clay and the bulk density of the three layers were calculated using the thickness weighted average considering that winter wheat and summer maize were involved in this study the sensitivity analyses for the growth modules of the two crops were performed separately fifty four parameters of winter wheat and 56 parameters of summer maize table 1 were used for the sensitivity analyses the sensitivities were assessed for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of the two crops 2 determination of the value ranges and probability density distribution of the parameters the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 was used to define the default values of the six vg m parameters using the four studied soil properties at each station furthermore the default values of λ ores k s α n and osat were changed with 50 50 40 20 15 and 10 perturbations respectively resulting in the value ranges the perturbation percentage of each parameter was determined as follows 1 the parameters were arranged by decreasing the perturbation percentage i e λ ores k s α n and osat considering the coefficient of variation cv of parameters in the rosetta database and 2 the rationality of the value ranges of each parameter after perturbation was verified l is generally estimated at one tenth of the water flow distance fetter 1993 in addition the typical value of l is 0 5 2 0 cm in packed laboratory columns and 5 20 cm in the field kroes et al 2009 thus the value range of l for the sensitivity analysis was from 1 cm to 20 cm the value ranges of the winter wheat and summer maize parameters for the sensitivity analysis and the bases of these parameters are listed in table 1 given that no further information was available a uniform distribution was assigned to each parameter 3 determination of the sample size for each parameter sample size ns is defined as ns 2mωmax 1 nr where m is the interference factor ωmax is the largest among the set of ωi frequencies and nr indicates the number of curves used saltelli et al 1999 when using a low sample size 65 implies m 4 nr 1 and ωi 8 is the recommended value saltelli et al 1999 in general the ns value ranges from 500 to 1000 saltelli et al 2005 the sample size distinctly affects the convergence of the sensitivity measures and a sample size of 129 implies m 4 nr 1 ωi 16 in the efast analysis can yield a reliable ranking result wang et al 2013 therefore the sample size was set to 513 implies m 4 nr 1 ωi 64 in this study the number of model runs c was defined as c pns where p denotes the number of parameters the values of c for the soil water movement salt transport winter wheat and summer maize growth modules at one station were 10 773 27 702 and 28 728 respectively and a total of 403 218 runs were performed for all six stations 4 selection of tools for sensitivity analysis simlab which was developed by the european commission joint research center http simlab jrc ec europa eu and the sensan module in parameter estimation pest software doherty 2010 were jointly used to perform the sensitivity analysis the first step i e sample generation was implemented in simlab next the sampling parameters were written into swap input files swap was run and the swap output files were read in batches using sensan during the third step the sensan results were sorted into a format that was recognizable by simlab and the sensitivity analysis was subsequently conducted in simlab 2 4 parameter calibration and model validation based on the results of parameter sensitivity analysis the soil hydraulic parameters were initially calibrated and validated at the experimental station level then the soil salt transport parameter was calibrated and validated when the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters were fixed and the crop growth parameters were calibrated and validated when the previous calibrated parameters were fixed then the soil salt transport and crop growth parameters after calibration at the station scale were expanded to the regional scale whereas the soil hydraulic parameters at the regional scale were estimated by applying the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 using high resolution soil data 2 4 1 parameter calibration and validation steps at the experimental stations according to the period and source of the observed data collected at the six experimental stations table 2 the parameter calibration and validation steps were as follows 1 calibrate and validate the parameters in the soil water movement module of the swap model using the observed soil water content at six stations 2 calibrate and validate the parameter in the soil salt transport module of the swap model using the observed soil salt concentration at three stations 3 calibrate and validate the parameters in the winter wheat growth module of the swap wofost model using the observed lai at four stations the aboveground biomass at four stations and the yield at six stations and 4 calibrate and validate the parameters in the summer maize growth module of the swap wofost model using the observed lai at five stations the aboveground biomass at four stations and the yield at six stations 2 4 2 evaluation indicators of simulation accuracy no single indicator can adequately describe the model performance therefore researchers should report an array of complementary measures willmott 1982 four widely used statistical indicators were selected to evaluate the agreement between the simulated and observed values in this study these indicators were the mean bias error mbe willmott 1982 root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 normalized root mean square error nrmse jamieson et al 1991 and index of agreement d willmott 1982 and they were calculated as follows 1 mbe 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 3 nrmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 100 o 4 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 where si is the ith simulated value oi is the ith observed value o is the mean of the observed values and n is the number of paired observed simulated values the evaluation criteria were as follows 1 mbe a positive value of mbe indicates that the simulated value overestimates the observed value and vice versa iqbal et al 2014 2 rmse values closer to zero reveal better model performance than values farther from zero iqbal et al 2014 3 nrmse the simulation accuracy is considered excellent if the nrmse is less than 10 good if the nrmse is greater than 10 and less than 20 fair if the nrmse is greater than 20 and less than 30 and poor if the nrmse is greater than 30 jamieson et al 1991 and 4 d the values of d vary from zero to one in which a value of one indicates perfect agreement between the simulated and observed values and a value of zero denotes complete disagreement willmott 1981 iqbal et al 2014 akumaga et al 2017 2 4 3 calibration method the nonlinear parameter estimation software pest was used to calibrate the parameters in the soil water movement and soil salt transport modules pest is based on the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm which is described in detail by doherty 2010 the trial and error method was used to calibrate the crop growth parameters following the approach of singh et al 2006c and vazifedoust et al 2008 2 5 generation of the simulation units in the distributed swap wofost model when the swap wofost model is extended in a distributed manner at the regional scale data reflecting spatial heterogeneity should be aggregated using gis which results in so called homogenous simulation units in this study the simulation units were derived from the combination of 12 types of information with respect to the meteorology soils crops irrigation land use water resources and administrative divisions fig 2 the descriptions and resources related to this information are presented in table 3 and each piece of zoning information is described below 2 5 1 meteorological zones a considerable amount of meteorological data were collected from four sources table 3 and disparities were observed in the richness of the meteorological elements over space and time precipitation which is part of the upper boundary was the most abundant element collected from three sources according to the time periods for the precipitation data from the three sources the precipitation zones were obtained by superposing the two thiessen polygons generated separately for the stations that had precipitation data during 1975 2006 and 2007 2012 similarly temperature zones and other element zones were produced the study area was segmented into 133 meteorological zones fig 3 a by overlaying all the precipitation temperature and other element zones 2 5 2 soil data and their zones the soil data with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km included the percentages of sand silt and clay and the bulk density of five layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 70 cm and 70 cm there were 125 soil hydraulic parameter zones fig 3b resulting from the combinations of the four soil properties and the five layers the method of indirectly estimating soil hydraulic parameters with pedotransfer functions ptfs has been used for agro hydrological simulation studies singh et al 2006b noory et al 2011 mishra et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 xue and ren 2017 thus the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 based on ptfs was applied to predict the five vg m hydraulic parameters ores osat k s α and n using the four soil properties and λ value was set to 0 5 mualem 1976 schaap et al 2001 in this study another reason for applying rosetta was that the main soil textures are loam clay loam and sandy loam and the bulk density mainly ranges between 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 in the study area shi et al 2004 shi et al 2010 and rosetta performs well for these soil textures and bulk density values when the sand silt and clay percentages and bulk density are used as predictors schaap et al 2001 the predicted hydraulic parameters were acceptable at the regional scale with relatively high accuracy for predicting the soil water content in the root zone of irrigated farmland schaap et al 2001 in limiting the collection to the observed soil salt concentration data the soil salt transport parameter was calibrated and validated at only the nanpi shenzhou and quzhou stations the study area was divided into three soil salt transport parameter zones fig 3c by considering the spatial distribution of the three stations the soil salt content data of 39 sampling points in the study area and its adjacent area in the 1990s were reported by bai 1999 assuming that one sampling point could represent its surrounding area the study area was subdivided into 39 initial soil salt content zones fig 3d 2 5 3 irrigation schedule zones more than 80 of the cropland was irrigated in the study area and approximately 2 000 km2 of dry land was mainly distributed over the coastal area yu 2015 tian 2008 enlightened us that the spatial difference in the winter wheat yield might indirectly reflect the spatial variability of the current irrigation schedule in the study area on this basis the study area consisted of three irrigation schedule zones fig 3e that could be distinguished by comparing the average statistical yield of winter wheat from 1994 to 2012 in each county general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 to the three yield levels that were described in tian 2008 specifically a county was classified as zone iii if the average statistical yield was less than 3000 kg hm 2 zone ii if the average statistical yield was greater than or equal to 3000 kg hm 2 and no greater than 3750 kg hm 2 and zone i if the average statistical yield was greater than 3750 kg hm 2 according to the literature listed in table 4 irrigation was applied in the pre sowing raising to jointing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages for winter wheat and the sowing and heading stages for summer maize the irrigation amount for each irrigation period was 75 mm based on the water intake norms for hebei province hebei provincial administration of quality and technical supervision and water resources department of hebei province 2009 the irrigation frequency and quota the sum of the irrigation amount of the two crops depended on the seasonal precipitation hebei provincial administration of quality and technical supervision and water resources department of hebei province 2009 therefore the precipitation exceedance probabilities peps of the two crops during the simulation period were calculated using a pearson type iii curve based on the seasonal precipitation of the crops from 1975 to 2012 the generalized current irrigation schedules with different peps in the three zones are shown in table 4 2 5 4 bottom boundary condition and initial soil water content zones based on the shallow groundwater depth data collected from five sources table 3 the bottom boundary condition was uniformly specified as the free drainage of a 2 m soil profile in the area where the shallow groundwater depth was primarily greater than 4 m during the simulation period zone a however in the area where the shallow groundwater depth ranged within 4 m zone b the bottom boundary was considered an impermeable layer with zero flux the depth of the impermeable layer was estimated at 15 0 m chen 1999 zhang et al 2009 and the soil profile thickness was also set at 15 0 m here the prescribed groundwater level option was not selected as the bottom boundary in zone b for the following reasons 1 it is difficult to collect the shallow groundwater depth dynamics at a fine time scale in this area 2 the zero flux at the bottom of the model domain is more suitable than the prescribed groundwater levels for the regional scale kroes et al 2009 and 3 simulated phreatic surface fluctuations are very sensitive to the soil hydraulic functions and the top boundary conditions and require a proper match between the top and bottom boundaries kroes et al 2009 but the observed shallow groundwater levels and the generalized current irrigation schedules may be incompatible over time and space notably groundwater runoff is relatively stagnant in the coastal plain of the ncp with a hydraulic gradient of 0 1 zhang et al 2009 thus the shallow groundwater movement in the coastal plain can be considered one dimensional vertical movement because the simulation started with winter wheat sowing under adequate soil water conditions the initial soil water content was specified as the field capacity pressure head equals 100 cm in zone a in zone b there were 17 monitoring wells and this area was divided into 17 regions in terms of the spatial distribution of these wells the collected shallow groundwater depth in the first october was defined as the initial value in each region consequently 18 bottom boundary condition and initial soil water content zones were obtained fig 3f the initial salt concentration in the saturated zone in zone b should represent shallow groundwater salinity hence a shallow groundwater salinity map zhang and fei 2009 fig 3g was needed to generate simulation units 2 5 5 crop data and their zones the winter wheat and summer maize parameters were calibrated and validated separately at the six experimental stations usually every city in hebei province has the recommended varieties of the two crops jia and guo 2009 therefore the study area was grouped into six crop growth parameter zones fig 3h by following the principle of parameters calibrated at an experimental station in a particular city could be generalized to the corresponding city and by considering the zones reported from the administration office of bohai sea granary hebei project region 2013 the crop planting and harvest time zones fig 3i were identical to the crop growth parameter zones 2 5 6 other zones the agro hydrological simulation was conducted on cropland only the statistical results of five land use maps resdc 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and yearbook statistical values general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1996 2011 showed that the cropland area tended to be stable during 1990 2010 the land use map in 2005 which was approximately the middle of the simulation period was used to identify cropland and noncropland fig 3j to facilitate further joint analyses of the simulation results and the water resource survey and assessment data at a spatial matching scale we also superimposed water resource zones when creating simulation units the study area involved seven water resource zones ren et al 2007 fig 3k to upscale the model outputs from the simulation unit level to the county level the generation of simulation units also had to aggregate the county boundary map fig 3l this aggregation was convenient not only for model validation but also for providing quantitative suggestions for policy makers to account for the simulation and analysis results overall the aggregation of the abovementioned 12 zoning maps yielded 2809 simulation units fig 3m the matlab vba and c languages were combined to prepare the input files in batches and an access database was used to process the outputs to improve the computational efficiency the simulation period lasted from october 1992 to october 2012 20 rotation years and the warming up period was from october 1989 to september 1992 these periods were determined by considering the time periods for which meteorological data observed experimental data statistical crop yields and water resource data could be collected and the time when nitrogen stress could not constitute a major factor that affected crop growth in the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 soil water movement salt transport module at each experimental station the highest ranked parameter for soil water content selected from the first order sensitivity index was consistent with the parameter selected from the total sensitivity index in detail the most sensitive parameter was the shape factor n of each layer at all the stations except for the wuqiao station where the soil water content of 0 20 cm swc1 was the most sensitive to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of this layer k s1 fig 4 a this result can be explained by the fact that n determines the slope of the soil water retention curve van genuchten 1980 which indirectly reflects the soil texture lei et al 1988 and water holding capacity a first order sensitivity index greater than 0 01 or a total sensitivity index greater than 0 1 was categorized as a sensitive parameter ma et al 2013 from the total sensitivity index fig 4a the soil water content was highly influenced by the n and osat at all the stations moreover the soil water content was sensitive to α at some of the stations these sensitive parameters for soil water content were generally consistent with the results in xu et al 2016 and stahn et al 2017 therefore when the soil water content was the objective variable the three hydraulic parameters n osat and α were calibrated the other two parameters ores and k s were set to the default values defined by the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 and the λ value was set to 0 5 mualem 1976 schaap et al 2001 the most sensitive parameters for the soil salt concentration were n ks and l fig 4a xu et al 2016 found that the soil salt concentration was most sensitive to l and it was also highly influenced by n and these findings were similar to the results in this study after calibrating the hydraulic parameters only l was calibrated at the nanpi shenzhou and quzhou stations when the soil salt concentration was the objective variable 3 1 2 winter wheat growth module according to the first order sensitivity index the lai and aboveground biomass of winter wheat were the most sensitive to slatb0 00 and the yield was the most sensitive to rsc at the langfang xiongxian and shenzhou stations slatb0 00 was the most important parameter for the lai aboveground biomass and yield at the nanpi and wuqiao stations and tbase tdwi and amaxtb1 00 dominated the highest parameter rank for the lai aboveground biomass and yield respectively at the quzhou station differences were observed in the most sensitive parameters between the first order and total sensitivity indices because the latter estimates the importance of a given parameter and its interactions with other parameters baroni and tarantola 2014 specifically slatb0 00 and not rsc played the most important role in simulating the yield at the langfang and xiongxian stations and slatb0 78 rather than tdwi and amaxtb1 00 was the most sensitive for the aboveground biomass and yield at quzhou station fig 4b the most sensitive parameter for the abovementioned output variables was important for simulating light interception e g slatb0 00 slatb0 78 and tbase and co2 assimilation e g amaxtb1 00 which are the main growth driving processes in the swap wofost model kroes et al 2009 and for calculating et e g rsc excluding the previously mentioned parameters other sensitive parameters were identified for the lai e g tdwi slatb0 78 kdif amaxtb1 00 tmnftb3 and grglai aboveground biomass e g amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 00 tbase kdif rsc and tmnftb3 and yield e g cvo amaxtb0 00 tdwi kdif tmnftb3 eff span amaxtb2 00 and tmpftb25 fig 4b 3 1 3 summer maize growth module from the first order sensitivity index tdwi was the most sensitive parameter for both the lai and aboveground biomass of summer maize at all six stations however for the yield the most sensitive parameter was tdwi at the langfang and shenzhou stations tmnftb8 at the xiongxian wuqiao and quzhou stations and slatb0 78 at the nanpi station the most sensitive parameter from the total sensitivity index was similar to that from the first order sensitivity index with slight differences tdwi rather than tmnftb8 was the most sensitive parameter for the yield at the xiongxian station and slatb0 00 rather than tdwi was the most sensitive parameter for the lai at the wuqiao station fig 4c wang et al 2013 found that four parameters i e span cvo tbase and eff had the highest sensitivities to maize yield the differences in the sensitive parameters between this study and wang et al 2013 might be attributed to the different environmental conditions e g soil meteorology and irrigation or value ranges in addition some other parameters were sensitive for the lai e g tmnftb8 span slatb0 78 slatb2 00 eff grglai laiem kdif and amaxtb1 25 aboveground biomass e g slatb0 00 slatb0 78 slatb2 00 tmnftb8 eff span grglai kdif amaxtb0 00 ecmax and ecslop and yield e g slatb0 00 cvo eff span amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 25 ecmax and ecslop fig 4c the important parameters of summer maize mentioned above related to the leaf expansion light interception and assimilation were consistent with the results of wang et al 2013 for the same output variable there were some sensitivity generalizations among all six stations for example the winter wheat lai was sensitive to tbase slatb0 78 and tdwi at all of the stations however some scattered appearances of sensitive parameters and their ranks were identified among the stations indicating that the sensitivity analysis results were probably influenced by the meteorology soil irrigation and crop planting and harvest times for specific modules there were clear differences in the sensitive parameters for different output variables which was consistent with wang et al 2013 for example the amaxtb0 00 of winter wheat was slightly sensitive for the yield and sensitive for the aboveground biomass at the langfang xiongxian wuqiao and quzhou stations in summary the efast method was used to conduct the global sensitivity analysis at the six experimental stations to recognize the sensitive parameters for eight variables thus preparing the ground for improving calibration efficiency in addition the results of the sensitivity analysis also indicate the parameters that should be measured to reduce the uncertainty in the simulation 3 2 parameter calibration and validation at the experimental stations 3 2 1 soil hydraulic parameters the mbe values for the soil water content prediction showed that the simulated values did not significantly overestimate or underestimate the observed values on average during both the calibration fig 5a 1 and validation fig 5b 1 periods which had mbes of 0 00 cm3 cm 3 and 0 01 cm3 cm 3 respectively a good simulation of the soil water content was achieved during the calibration period with a rmse of 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nrmse of 14 93 and d of 0 91 fig 5a 1 the validation also showed good results rmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nrmse 16 26 and d 0 88 fig 5b 1 the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters at the six stations are given in table 5 3 2 2 soil salt transport parameter the simulated soil salt concentration approximated the observed values during the calibration period with a mbe of 0 01 mg cm 3 fig 5a 2 but it was overestimated during the validation period with a mbe of 0 21 mg cm 3 fig 5b 2 the rmse values were 0 81 mg cm 3 and 0 91 mg cm 3 for calibration and validation respectively the nrmse values were within the range of fair simulation accuracy with values of 27 20 for calibration and 29 36 for validation the d values were 0 91 and 0 87 for the calibration and validation periods respectively these indicators and the 1 1 line fitting diagram showed that the simulation of the soil salt concentrations was acceptable and applicable during the calibration fig 5a 2 and validation fig 5b 2 periods and the calibrated parameter l values at the three stations are listed in table 5 3 2 3 growth parameters of winter wheat the mbe values showed that the simulated winter wheat lai was close to the observed values during the calibration period fig 5a 3 but was overestimated compared to the observed values during the validation period fig 5b 3 the mbe results also showed an overestimation of the aboveground biomass fig 5a 4 and fig 5b 4 and an underestimation of the yield fig 5a 5 and fig 5b 5 during the two periods during the calibration period the values of the rmse nrmse and d were 0 90 cm2 cm 2 24 60 and 0 95 respectively for the lai the corresponding values were 1893 68 kg hm 2 25 27 and 0 97 for aboveground biomass and 1490 69 kg hm 2 23 12 and 0 69 for yield these indicators showed that the matches between the simulated and observed values were fair and reliable the validation also resulted in fair statistical results for the lai aboveground biomass and yield based on the rmse 0 95 cm2 cm 2 1529 41 kg hm 2 and 1398 78 kg hm 2 respectively nrmse 24 20 22 75 and 21 77 respectively and d 0 95 0 98 and 0 68 respectively values during the calibration and validation processes the winter wheat parameters after calibration at the six stations table 6 could not only simulate the yield well but also fairly simulate the lai and the aboveground biomass which reflect the dynamic growth processes the calibrated parameters for winter wheat that had high sensitivity included the rsc tdwi slatb0 00 slatb0 78 span kdif tbase eff amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 00 amaxtb2 00 and cvo notably two sensitive parameters tmnftb3 and tmpftb25 were not calibrated these two parameters reflect the reduction in the maximum co2 assimilation rate due to inappropriate temperatures and their values partly depend on the values of amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 00 and amaxtb2 00 and they were not calibrated to reduce the equifinality which is consistent with other studies singh et al 2006b noory et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 the adjusted rsc values ranged from 44 to 47 s m 1 at the six stations the rsc value varies between 30 s m 1 for arable crops and 150 s m 1 for trees kroes et al 2009 and the rsc values of wheat cotton and rice were set to 70 s m 1 by singh et al 2006b using the swap wofost model in india moreover the average rsc of winter wheat at different development stages at the yucheng experimental station in the ncp was 20 3 s m 1 yuan et al 2002 these values demonstrate the rationality of the adjusted rsc to some extent the calibrated tdwi varied from 100 to 110 kg hm 2 at the six stations notably qiao 1999 measured a value of 100 kg hm 2 at the quzhou station in 1998 the estimated specific leaf area of winter wheat at the quzhou station in 1998 1999 was 0 0025 hm2 kg 1 before the overwintering stage it reached a maximum of 0 0040 hm2 kg 1 at the regreening stage and it decreased to 0 0018 0 0020 hm2 kg 1 at the grain filling stage qiao et al 2002 moreover qiao et al 2002 found no significant difference in the specific leaf area between winter wheat varieties the results from qiao et al 2002 showed that the calibrated slatb0 00 slatb0 78 and slatb2 00 were reasonable to a certain extent the default value of tbase which is 0 c is the threshold below which low temperatures influence the leaf growth of winter wheat in the ncp chen et al 2008 thus 0 c was set as the calibrated value at all stations furthermore the recommended value ranges of span kdif eff and cvo were 26 36 d zhou et al 2012 0 44 0 70 boogaard et al 1998 zhou et al 2012 0 40 0 50 kg hm 2 hr 1 j 1 m 2 s 1 boogaard et al 1998 and 0 60 0 80 kg kg 1 zhou et al 2012 respectively indicating that the calibrated results of all four parameters were within the recommended ranges additionally several parameters that reflect the effects of water stress i e h1 h2u h2l h3h h3l and h4 and salt stress i e ecmax and ecslop on root water extraction were slightly sensitive for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat but were adjusted according to the related literature the critical pressure head values including h1 h2u h2l h3h h3l and h4 referenced the default values in the simple module rather than those in the detailed module of the swap model because winter wheat breeding has been aimed at primarily increasing the drought resistance since the 1990s in the study area chen et al 2008 jia and guo 2009 yu 2015 the default values in the simple module reflect a lower influence of drought stress on the winter wheat growth than the values in the detailed module the results of ecmax and ecslop referred to values from the literature kroes et al 2009 li and yang 2017 furthermore two parameters the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis tsumea and the temperature sum from anthesis to maturity tsumam were estimated using the observed dates of emergence anthesis and maturity of winter wheat and the temperature data at each station it is necessary to translate the simulated salinity concentration in the soil water c act mg cm 3 to the electrical conductivity in the saturated paste extract ecsat ds m 1 to reduce root water uptake caused by salt stress according to the reduction function in maas and hoffman 1977 therefore the following three parameters should be supplied to the crop input file the two empirical coefficients a and b and the f that accounts for over saturation in the soil paste a value of 2 0 is recommended for f and the values of a and b should be 1 492 and 1 0 respectively as suggested by fao48 kroes et al 2009 the relation between ecsat and c act with an a of 1 492 b of 1 0 and f of 2 0 was similar to the relation that was fitted using the measured ecsat and c act in nanpi county in the study area he et al 2017 3 2 4 growth parameters of summer maize comparisons of the simulated and observed values of the lai aboveground biomass and yield of summer maize during the calibration fig 5a 6 to fig 5a 8 and validation fig 5b 6 to fig 5b 8 periods revealed relatively consistent results overall the mbe results showed that all of the lai aboveground biomass and yield values for summer maize were underestimated during the two periods the calibrated parameters table 6 of summer maize could simulate the lai and aboveground biomass fairly well as indicated by the nrmse values of 24 55 and 21 33 respectively during the calibration period and the corresponding values of 22 03 and 24 38 respectively during the validation period additionally reliable rmse and d values were achieved the evaluation indicators showed a good simulation of the yield for calibration and validation with rmse values of 1525 51 kg hm 2 and 1486 48 kg hm 2 respectively nrmse values of 17 94 and 18 62 respectively and low d values of 0 54 and 0 57 respectively the calibrated parameters which were sensitive for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of summer maize included the rsc tdwi slatb0 00 slatb0 78 span kdif eff amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 25 amaxtb2 00 cvo ecmax and ecslop consistent with winter wheat the most sensitive parameter tmnftb8 was not calibrated because it reflects the reduction in the maximum co2 assimilation rate of summer maize because of inappropriate temperatures the recommended rsc value is 30 s m 1 for arable crops kroes et al 2009 and the estimated rsc value of summer maize by wang et al 2006 at the yucheng experimental station in the ncp was 19 21 s m 1 indicating the relative reliability of the calibrated rsc at the six stations which varied from 30 to 32 s m 1 the default value of tdwi which is 5 kg hm 2 was not adjusted because the observed biomass at emergence at quzhou station in 1998 1999 was approximatively 5 kg hm 2 qiao 1999 the results of span kdif eff and cvo after calibration were within their suggested ranges of 32 40 d ceglar et al 2011 wang et al 2011 0 44 0 65 boogaard et al 1998 ceglar et al 2011 0 40 0 50 kg hm 2 hr 1 j 1 m 2 s 1 boogaard et al 1998 and 0 60 0 80 kg kg 1 li et al 2014 respectively the calibrated ecmax and ecslop were suggested by kroes et al 2009 in addition the six critical pressure head values also referenced the default values in the simple module to be consistent with the winter wheat furthermore both tsumea and tsumam were calculated using the observed dates of different growth stages and temperature data the values of a b and f were 1 492 1 0 and 2 0 respectively because these values were irrelevant to the crop detailed calibrations and validations at the station level provide rich parameters for researchers to conduct relevant simulation studies using the swap swap wofost or wofost model in this globally representative area 3 3 model validation at the regional scale 3 3 1 crop yields the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize under the generalized current irrigation schedule were aggregated from the simulation unit level to the county level using the area weighted mean a comparison of the average simulated winter wheat yields during 1994 2012 notably the observed crop yields could be collected from yearbooks during these years in each county with the corresponding observed values indicated that the simulated was consistent with the observed data fig 6a a good agreement was also achieved in the summer maize yield fig 6b the yield was underestimated for winter wheat which presented a mbe of 274 26 kg hm 2 but it was overestimated for summer maize which presented a mbe of 454 83 kg hm 2 the evaluation indicators also showed good simulation results for the winter wheat yield in the study area rmse 672 82 kg hm 2 nrmse 13 47 and d 0 87 respectively additionally a satisfactory validation of the summer maize yield was generally achieved with a rmse of 839 96 kg hm 2 nrmse of 15 74 and d of 0 73 overall the distributed swap wofost model and the generalized current irrigation schedule could describe the spatial differences in crop yields quite well 3 3 2 et to further evaluate the simulation accuracy of the distributed model the simulated et values were compared with the corresponding values estimated by remote sensing using modis and a detailed description of the remote sensing et data was reported by wu et al 2012 the remote sensing et data during 2002 2008 with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km were clipped using the land use map in 2005 with the same resolution which resulted in consistency between the remote sensing et data for the cropland and the spatial scale of the simulated et furthermore both the simulated and remote sensing et values were accumulated at the yearly scale and the averages and standard deviations of both the simulated and remote sensing et values on 33 888 grid cells in each year were calculated as shown in fig 7 the et was generally overestimated with a mbe of 157 07 mm which may be related to the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system which is a high water consumption cropping pattern that was applied to all cropland for simplification purposes the rmse nrmse and d values were 167 48 mm 29 25 and 0 21 respectively indicating an acceptable match between the simulated et and remote sensing data moreover the simulated et values during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons from 1993 to 2012 were 406 58 30 61 mm and 325 38 17 24 mm respectively fig 8 a the water requirement of winter wheat is estimated to be 400 600 mm chen et al 2008 jia and guo 2009 in hebei province the et values during the winter wheat growing season associated with yields of 3000 kg hm 2 and 7500 kg hm 2 are 285 mm and 525 mm respectively jia and guo 2009 in central and southern hebei province the et of winter wheat is 468 mm in a normal year with an irrigation quota of 210 mm and 497 mm in a dry year with an irrigation quota of 270 mm li and yang 2017 the water requirement is approximately 376 mm for summer maize with et varying from 237 to 589 mm in central and southern hebei province jia and guo 2009 thus the simulated et values for the two crops were close to the values reported above 3 3 3 wp the wp quantifies the crop production per unit of water used singh et al 2006c singh et al 2006b and is defined as the ratio of crop yield to seasonal water use the seasonal water use in this study referred to the et the average simulated wps of winter wheat and summer maize under the current irrigation schedule in 1993 2012 in the study area were 1 14 kg m 3 and 1 72 kg m 3 respectively the broad average wp ranges of the two crops in 1993 2012 were 0 75 1 73 kg m 3 and 0 79 2 58 kg m 3 fig 8b the globally measured average wp was 1 09 kg m 3 for wheat and 1 80 kg m 3 for maize with large ranges 0 60 1 70 kg m 3 and 1 10 2 70 kg m 3 for wheat and maize respectively zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in china the average wp of winter wheat was 1 32 kg m 3 in irrigated farmland and 1 01 kg m 3 in dry farmland and the average wp of summer maize was 1 74 kg m 3 in irrigated farmland deng et al 2006 in the part of the ncp belonging to hebei province the simulated wps of winter wheat in 1992 and summer maize in 1993 for irrigated areas ranged from 1 23 to 1 58 kg m 3 and from 1 10 to 1 93 kg m 3 respectively when using the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model mo et al 2005 in the ncp the range of the simulated wp in 1997 2006 was 0 78 1 51 kg m 3 for winter wheat and 1 04 1 88 kg m 3 for summer maize according to the vegetation interface processes vip model mo et al 2009 overall the simulated wp values of the two crops were close to the values presented above to summarize the distributed swap wofost model could well simulate the crop yields at the county scale and performed acceptable simulations of et at the regional scale this model provided an effective tool for the simulation and analysis of crop yields and water balance components of the agro hydrological cycle in the study area 4 conclusions a representative deep groundwater irrigated area in china was selected in this study by fully mining and using abundant agricultural and hydrological data 2809 simulation units of the distributed swap wofost model were aggregated to capture the regional heterogeneity the parameters were calibrated on the basis of global sensitivity analysis results and the model was validated using multisource and multi spatiotemporal scale data several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 at the six stations according to the total sensitivity index the soil water content and salt concentration were the most sensitive to parameter n in most of the soil layers the most sensitive parameter for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat included slatb0 00 slatb0 78 tbase and rsc and for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of summer maize included tdwi slatb0 00 slatb0 78 and tmnftb8 the identification of common and different sensitive parameters for these eight variables among the six stations provides definitive guidance for improving parameter calibration efficiency 2 at the six stations two variables the soil water content and summer maize yield were simulated well during both the calibration and validation periods with all nrmses less than 20 five other variables i e the lai aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat and the lai and aboveground biomass of summer maize were more fairly simulated with nrmses mostly in the range of 20 25 during the two periods the remaining variable the soil salt concentration was fairly simulated during the two periods with nrmses within the range of 25 30 in summary after calibration and validation the swap wofost model acceptably simulated the soil water and salt dynamics and the lai aboveground biomass and yield of the two studied crops at the six stations in addition each of the calibrated parameters was within a reasonable range 3 the nrmse value was 13 47 for winter wheat and 15 74 for summer maize based on a comparison between the average statistical yields of the two crops in 1994 2012 in each county and the corresponding simulated values under the current irrigation conditions this result indicates that the distributed swap wofost model was able to predict the crop yields and their spatial variability well and indirectly demonstrates the rationality of the generalized current irrigation schedule the simulated et was somewhat higher than the remote sensing data at the regional scale due to the adopted uniform cropping pattern of winter wheat summer maize the simulated et and wp of the two crops were consistent with the reported values from the literature in conclusion the soil water movement salt transport and crop growth parameters after detailed calibration at the six stations which were based on global sensitivity analyses and observed values could provide valuable parameter values for future agro hydrological simulation research in this region the distributed swap wofost model could be used not only to simulate and analyze agro hydrological cycle processes under current irrigation practices but also to simulate and evaluate both the wp and the contribution to reducing deep groundwater exploitation under limited

6450,the agro hydrological soil water atmosphere plant world food study swap wofost model in a distributed manner represents an important tool for evaluating agro hydrological cycles and irrigation strategies at different spatiotemporal scales the reliability of the model simulations and evaluations is dependent on the generation of the distributed simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors as well as parameter calibration and model validation in this study we focused on the most typical overexploited deep groundwater area in the north china plain ncp first the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast was used to conduct global sensitivity analyses for three modules in the swap wofost model to identify the parameters that significantly influence the objective variables for calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area on this basis the parameters were calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed data from each station the normalized root mean square error nrmse values for soil water content soil salt concentration winter wheat leaf area index lai winter wheat aboveground biomass winter wheat yield summer maize lai summer maize aboveground biomass and summer maize yield were 14 93 27 20 24 60 25 27 23 12 24 55 21 33 and 17 94 respectively during the calibration period and the corresponding nrmse values were 16 26 29 36 24 20 22 75 21 77 22 03 24 38 and 18 62 respectively during the validation period the model provided a good simulation for the soil water contents and summer maize yields and a fair simulation for the other objective variables furthermore a distributed swap wofost model was generated by overlaying 12 maps involving meteorology soil crops land use water resources and administrative divisions yielding 2809 simulation units finally the simulation accuracy of the distributed model was evaluated under the current irrigation conditions the results showed that the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize were consistent with the statistical values and the simulated evapotranspiration matched the remote sensing data with acceptable precision in summary the distributed swap wofost model could be used as an effective tool for simulating crop water productivity in time and space under limited irrigation scenarios and for evaluating the effect of optimized limited irrigation schemes on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region keywords overexploited deep groundwater area distributed swap wofost model regional heterogeneity multisource data multiscale validation global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial water source for irrigation and plays a substantial role in securing global food production giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 wada et al 2012 döll et al 2012 deep groundwater is characterized by slower renewal and lower recharge than shallow groundwater alley et al 2002 shi et al 2011 russo and lall 2017 even so with an increasing population and an ever expanding irrigated area deep groundwater has been more or less exploited for irrigation in several countries e g china foster et al 2004 the united states scanlon et al 2012 kang and jackson 2016 russo and lall 2017 india reshmidevi and kumar 2014 iran mahmoudi et al 2017 tunisia alaya et al 2014 and other countries the north china plain ncp the east central ncp i e heilonggang region in particular is a fairly representative area for studying this issue and deep groundwater has been overexploited for irrigation over the past 40 years foster et al 2004 zheng et al 2010 huang et al 2015 however the ncp is not only a key grain producing region for china liu et al 2001 jeong et al 2014 but also a core area for increasing the grain production capacity the central people s government of the people s republic of china 2009 clearly the dilemma between deep groundwater depletion and grain production in the heilonggang region has been intensified further for this reason this region can be viewed as a massive and optimal laboratory for the entire world thus providing an opportunity to study how to plant crops with limited water to adapt to the goal of deep groundwater conservation in other words this study could provide a reference for areas in the world that are experiencing or will experience similar deep groundwater security crises and facilitate meeting the urgent agricultural water management demands in this typical region which is facing sharp contradictions between water and food needs there are spatial variabilities in meteorological elements e g precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation ren et al 2007 wang et al 2008 soil types sdc 1990 land use types resdc 2005 crop varieties and cultivation practices wang 2004 in the ncp therefore using an agro hydrological model in a distributed manner that can account for the spatial heterogeneities of abovementioned factors droogers et al 2000 singh 2005 would be an important and possibly unique scientific tool for evaluating the agro hydrological cycles and agricultural water management strategies at a regional scale over the past 20 years abundant data on meteorology land use soil crop cultivation farmland irrigation hydrogeology exploration and groundwater resource assessments from the study area have been accumulated these data which are related to the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac provide a good basis for establishing a distributed agro hydrological model calibrating parameters and validating the model in this area in view of these multisource and multiscale data the soil water atmosphere plant swap model which is a deterministic agro hydrological model based on hydrological chemical and biological processes singh et al 2006c was used in this study in particular the embedded detailed crop growth module of the swap model is based on the world food study wofost model boogaard et al 1998 singh et al 2006c kroes et al 2009 the swap or swap wofost model has been used to evaluate the effects of irrigation strategies on crop yield water productivity wp and water balance at the field scale sarwar et al 2000 sarwar and bastiaanssen 2001 singh et al 2006c vazifedoust et al 2008 ma et al 2011 rodrigues and van vliet 2014 furthermore when the model is used in a distributed manner and integrated with geographic information system gis data it has been used to assess irrigation performance and quantitatively analyze the crop yield wp and water balance responses to irrigation scenarios at regional scales for one or many years droogers et al 2000 singh et al 2006b singh et al 2006a noory et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 this evidence indicates that the distributed swap wofost model is an effective tool for the quantitative study of agro hydrological cycle and regional water resource management from the results of these studies it is clear that the simulation and assessment credibility depend considerably on reliable parameters and reasonable boundary conditions obviously these criteria are heavily reliant on the data richness and completeness hence fully mining multisource and multiscale data to obtain the required information is critical for high quality parameter calibration and model validation as noted above the heilonggang region is an area that has as of today accumulated the most relatively abundant data in china in relation to agro hydrology including field experimental data field investigation data and evaluation results these data not only make it possible to perform detailed parameter calibration and validation based on the identification results of global sensitivity analysis but also allow for the generation of simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors at the regional scale these premises are ideal for properly evaluating the effects of limited irrigation on wp and reducing deep groundwater exploitation using the swap wofost model in a distributed manner the objectives of this study are to 1 conduct a global sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters that require calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area 2 perform detailed parameter calibration and validation based on the sensitivity analysis results and observed data at each station 3 generate simulation units for the distributed swap wofost model by overlaying 12 types of information related to the meteorology soil crops irrigation land use water resources and administrative divisions and 4 run a simulation for a period of 20 years under the current irrigation conditions and then evaluate the simulation accuracy of the distributed swap wofost model using statistical yields and remote sensing evapotranspiration et 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area which is the heilonggang region is located in the ncp and represents the main overexploited deep groundwater area in hebei province fig 1 a the study region covers approximately 40 000 km2 and lies between 36 03 39 37 n latitude and 114 43 117 48 e longitude and administratively it contains 53 counties wang 2010 the region is in the warm temperate semi arid and semi humid monsoon climate zone the annual average precipitation is 544 7 mm and the annual average frost free period is approximately 206 days long wang 2010 the annual average temperature and sunshine duration vary from 13 c to 14 c and from 2103 h to 2363 h respectively wang 2010 the climate has sufficient light appropriate temperatures and a synchronization of temperature and precipitation that result in a high agricultural yield potential wang 2010 the geomorphological types of the study area are primarily low elevation alluvial plain and low elevation river floodplain national earth system science data sharing infrastructure and national science and technology infrastructure of china 1996 the elevation gradually decreases from approximately 50 m in the southwest to approximately 1 m in the coastal plain international scientific and technical data mirror site et al 2009 the dominant soil type is fluvio aquatic soil sdc 1990 the average cultivated area is 33 619 km2 resdc 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 which accounts for 83 38 of the study area this region is one of the main grain production areas in hebei province and the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the most important planting pattern wang 2010 general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 therefore we focused on this predominant planting pattern when conducting the agro hydrological simulations in this study researchers have conducted field experiments at several experimental stations in this region and six of these stations i e langfang xiongxian nanpi shenzhou wuqiao and quzhou stations fig 1b with relatively abundant data were selected from north to south for the parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation 2 2 brief introduction to the swap model the swap model simulates soil water movement solute transport and heat transfer in the vadose zone in interactions with crop growth kroes et al 2009 in this study the soil water flow simulation was based on the richards equation which includes root water uptake by plants and the convection dispersion equation was used to simulate solute transport kroes et al 2009 canopy interception for agricultural crops is computed according to the von hoyningen hüne and braden formula kroes et al 2009 potential evapotranspiration etp is estimated by the penman monteith equation using daily weather data and crop characteristics furthermore etp is subdivided into potential transpiration tp and potential evaporation ep which accounts for partial soil cover wet dry and saline soil conditions may affect root water extraction and reduce the conversion of tp to actual transpiration ta wet or dry water stress is described by the function in feddes et al 1978 and salinity stress is described by the function in maas and hoffman 1977 when the soil becomes drier ep becomes actual evaporation ea kroes et al 2009 the swap model contains both simple and detailed crop growth modules the simple module describes crop growth by the observed leaf area index lai crop height and rooting depth as a function of the crop development stage dvs singh et al 2006c the main function of this module is to provide proper upper boundary conditions for soil water movement kroes et al 2009 compared with the simple module the detailed module simulates photosynthesis and crop development and calculates the potential yield and actual yield due to water and or salt stress kroes et al 2009 for the sake of distinction the model in this study is called swap when the simple module is used and swap wofost when the detailed module is used the swap model offers eight lower boundary conditions for a typical scale of applications kroes et al 2009 2 3 parameter sensitivity analysis the swap wofost is a complex agro hydrological model involving spac and the complexity of the swap wofost is such that the model has many parameters because these parameters are difficult time consuming and laborious to measure performing a sensitivity analysis that identifies the parameters that do or do not have a significant influence on the model outputs can reduce the number of parameters that require calibration in this study the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 saltelli et al 2005 which is a combination of sobol s method and the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast was adopted for the global sensitivity analysis efast is a variance based method in which the total variance can be decomposed into partial variances the first order sensitivity index si and total sensitivity index sti of parameter xi were calculated higher sti values indicate greater effects of xi and the interactions of xi with all the other parameters on model outputs saltelli et al 2004 saltelli et al 2008 the key steps of the sensitivity analysis were as follows 1 determination of parameters and output variables for sensitivity analysis three modules i e soil water movement soil salt transport and crop growth were applied in this study in addition a sensitivity analysis can be conducted to improve the parameter calibration efficiency thus a sensitivity analysis was proposed to identify the parameters in the above three modules that could significantly influence the outputs that had observed values for calibration fig 2 because soil water movement affects soil salt transport sensitivity analyses of the two modules were conducted jointly specifically the sensitivities of six van genuchten mualem vg m hydraulic parameters and the dispersion length l of three layers 0 20 cm 20 70 cm and 70 200 cm for a total of 21 parameters to the soil water content and soil salt concentration of each layer were analyzed at each of the six stations the six hydraulic parameters include the residual water content ores saturated water content osat saturated conductivity k s and three shape factors α n and λ notably the soil profile at each station was uniformly divided into a top layer 0 20 cm subsurface layer 20 70 cm and bottom layer 70 200 cm to ensure the comparability of the sensitivity analysis results four soil properties i e the percentages of sand silt and clay and the bulk density of the three layers were calculated using the thickness weighted average considering that winter wheat and summer maize were involved in this study the sensitivity analyses for the growth modules of the two crops were performed separately fifty four parameters of winter wheat and 56 parameters of summer maize table 1 were used for the sensitivity analyses the sensitivities were assessed for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of the two crops 2 determination of the value ranges and probability density distribution of the parameters the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 was used to define the default values of the six vg m parameters using the four studied soil properties at each station furthermore the default values of λ ores k s α n and osat were changed with 50 50 40 20 15 and 10 perturbations respectively resulting in the value ranges the perturbation percentage of each parameter was determined as follows 1 the parameters were arranged by decreasing the perturbation percentage i e λ ores k s α n and osat considering the coefficient of variation cv of parameters in the rosetta database and 2 the rationality of the value ranges of each parameter after perturbation was verified l is generally estimated at one tenth of the water flow distance fetter 1993 in addition the typical value of l is 0 5 2 0 cm in packed laboratory columns and 5 20 cm in the field kroes et al 2009 thus the value range of l for the sensitivity analysis was from 1 cm to 20 cm the value ranges of the winter wheat and summer maize parameters for the sensitivity analysis and the bases of these parameters are listed in table 1 given that no further information was available a uniform distribution was assigned to each parameter 3 determination of the sample size for each parameter sample size ns is defined as ns 2mωmax 1 nr where m is the interference factor ωmax is the largest among the set of ωi frequencies and nr indicates the number of curves used saltelli et al 1999 when using a low sample size 65 implies m 4 nr 1 and ωi 8 is the recommended value saltelli et al 1999 in general the ns value ranges from 500 to 1000 saltelli et al 2005 the sample size distinctly affects the convergence of the sensitivity measures and a sample size of 129 implies m 4 nr 1 ωi 16 in the efast analysis can yield a reliable ranking result wang et al 2013 therefore the sample size was set to 513 implies m 4 nr 1 ωi 64 in this study the number of model runs c was defined as c pns where p denotes the number of parameters the values of c for the soil water movement salt transport winter wheat and summer maize growth modules at one station were 10 773 27 702 and 28 728 respectively and a total of 403 218 runs were performed for all six stations 4 selection of tools for sensitivity analysis simlab which was developed by the european commission joint research center http simlab jrc ec europa eu and the sensan module in parameter estimation pest software doherty 2010 were jointly used to perform the sensitivity analysis the first step i e sample generation was implemented in simlab next the sampling parameters were written into swap input files swap was run and the swap output files were read in batches using sensan during the third step the sensan results were sorted into a format that was recognizable by simlab and the sensitivity analysis was subsequently conducted in simlab 2 4 parameter calibration and model validation based on the results of parameter sensitivity analysis the soil hydraulic parameters were initially calibrated and validated at the experimental station level then the soil salt transport parameter was calibrated and validated when the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters were fixed and the crop growth parameters were calibrated and validated when the previous calibrated parameters were fixed then the soil salt transport and crop growth parameters after calibration at the station scale were expanded to the regional scale whereas the soil hydraulic parameters at the regional scale were estimated by applying the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 using high resolution soil data 2 4 1 parameter calibration and validation steps at the experimental stations according to the period and source of the observed data collected at the six experimental stations table 2 the parameter calibration and validation steps were as follows 1 calibrate and validate the parameters in the soil water movement module of the swap model using the observed soil water content at six stations 2 calibrate and validate the parameter in the soil salt transport module of the swap model using the observed soil salt concentration at three stations 3 calibrate and validate the parameters in the winter wheat growth module of the swap wofost model using the observed lai at four stations the aboveground biomass at four stations and the yield at six stations and 4 calibrate and validate the parameters in the summer maize growth module of the swap wofost model using the observed lai at five stations the aboveground biomass at four stations and the yield at six stations 2 4 2 evaluation indicators of simulation accuracy no single indicator can adequately describe the model performance therefore researchers should report an array of complementary measures willmott 1982 four widely used statistical indicators were selected to evaluate the agreement between the simulated and observed values in this study these indicators were the mean bias error mbe willmott 1982 root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 normalized root mean square error nrmse jamieson et al 1991 and index of agreement d willmott 1982 and they were calculated as follows 1 mbe 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 3 nrmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 100 o 4 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 where si is the ith simulated value oi is the ith observed value o is the mean of the observed values and n is the number of paired observed simulated values the evaluation criteria were as follows 1 mbe a positive value of mbe indicates that the simulated value overestimates the observed value and vice versa iqbal et al 2014 2 rmse values closer to zero reveal better model performance than values farther from zero iqbal et al 2014 3 nrmse the simulation accuracy is considered excellent if the nrmse is less than 10 good if the nrmse is greater than 10 and less than 20 fair if the nrmse is greater than 20 and less than 30 and poor if the nrmse is greater than 30 jamieson et al 1991 and 4 d the values of d vary from zero to one in which a value of one indicates perfect agreement between the simulated and observed values and a value of zero denotes complete disagreement willmott 1981 iqbal et al 2014 akumaga et al 2017 2 4 3 calibration method the nonlinear parameter estimation software pest was used to calibrate the parameters in the soil water movement and soil salt transport modules pest is based on the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm which is described in detail by doherty 2010 the trial and error method was used to calibrate the crop growth parameters following the approach of singh et al 2006c and vazifedoust et al 2008 2 5 generation of the simulation units in the distributed swap wofost model when the swap wofost model is extended in a distributed manner at the regional scale data reflecting spatial heterogeneity should be aggregated using gis which results in so called homogenous simulation units in this study the simulation units were derived from the combination of 12 types of information with respect to the meteorology soils crops irrigation land use water resources and administrative divisions fig 2 the descriptions and resources related to this information are presented in table 3 and each piece of zoning information is described below 2 5 1 meteorological zones a considerable amount of meteorological data were collected from four sources table 3 and disparities were observed in the richness of the meteorological elements over space and time precipitation which is part of the upper boundary was the most abundant element collected from three sources according to the time periods for the precipitation data from the three sources the precipitation zones were obtained by superposing the two thiessen polygons generated separately for the stations that had precipitation data during 1975 2006 and 2007 2012 similarly temperature zones and other element zones were produced the study area was segmented into 133 meteorological zones fig 3 a by overlaying all the precipitation temperature and other element zones 2 5 2 soil data and their zones the soil data with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km included the percentages of sand silt and clay and the bulk density of five layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 70 cm and 70 cm there were 125 soil hydraulic parameter zones fig 3b resulting from the combinations of the four soil properties and the five layers the method of indirectly estimating soil hydraulic parameters with pedotransfer functions ptfs has been used for agro hydrological simulation studies singh et al 2006b noory et al 2011 mishra et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 xue and ren 2017 thus the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 based on ptfs was applied to predict the five vg m hydraulic parameters ores osat k s α and n using the four soil properties and λ value was set to 0 5 mualem 1976 schaap et al 2001 in this study another reason for applying rosetta was that the main soil textures are loam clay loam and sandy loam and the bulk density mainly ranges between 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 in the study area shi et al 2004 shi et al 2010 and rosetta performs well for these soil textures and bulk density values when the sand silt and clay percentages and bulk density are used as predictors schaap et al 2001 the predicted hydraulic parameters were acceptable at the regional scale with relatively high accuracy for predicting the soil water content in the root zone of irrigated farmland schaap et al 2001 in limiting the collection to the observed soil salt concentration data the soil salt transport parameter was calibrated and validated at only the nanpi shenzhou and quzhou stations the study area was divided into three soil salt transport parameter zones fig 3c by considering the spatial distribution of the three stations the soil salt content data of 39 sampling points in the study area and its adjacent area in the 1990s were reported by bai 1999 assuming that one sampling point could represent its surrounding area the study area was subdivided into 39 initial soil salt content zones fig 3d 2 5 3 irrigation schedule zones more than 80 of the cropland was irrigated in the study area and approximately 2 000 km2 of dry land was mainly distributed over the coastal area yu 2015 tian 2008 enlightened us that the spatial difference in the winter wheat yield might indirectly reflect the spatial variability of the current irrigation schedule in the study area on this basis the study area consisted of three irrigation schedule zones fig 3e that could be distinguished by comparing the average statistical yield of winter wheat from 1994 to 2012 in each county general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 to the three yield levels that were described in tian 2008 specifically a county was classified as zone iii if the average statistical yield was less than 3000 kg hm 2 zone ii if the average statistical yield was greater than or equal to 3000 kg hm 2 and no greater than 3750 kg hm 2 and zone i if the average statistical yield was greater than 3750 kg hm 2 according to the literature listed in table 4 irrigation was applied in the pre sowing raising to jointing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages for winter wheat and the sowing and heading stages for summer maize the irrigation amount for each irrigation period was 75 mm based on the water intake norms for hebei province hebei provincial administration of quality and technical supervision and water resources department of hebei province 2009 the irrigation frequency and quota the sum of the irrigation amount of the two crops depended on the seasonal precipitation hebei provincial administration of quality and technical supervision and water resources department of hebei province 2009 therefore the precipitation exceedance probabilities peps of the two crops during the simulation period were calculated using a pearson type iii curve based on the seasonal precipitation of the crops from 1975 to 2012 the generalized current irrigation schedules with different peps in the three zones are shown in table 4 2 5 4 bottom boundary condition and initial soil water content zones based on the shallow groundwater depth data collected from five sources table 3 the bottom boundary condition was uniformly specified as the free drainage of a 2 m soil profile in the area where the shallow groundwater depth was primarily greater than 4 m during the simulation period zone a however in the area where the shallow groundwater depth ranged within 4 m zone b the bottom boundary was considered an impermeable layer with zero flux the depth of the impermeable layer was estimated at 15 0 m chen 1999 zhang et al 2009 and the soil profile thickness was also set at 15 0 m here the prescribed groundwater level option was not selected as the bottom boundary in zone b for the following reasons 1 it is difficult to collect the shallow groundwater depth dynamics at a fine time scale in this area 2 the zero flux at the bottom of the model domain is more suitable than the prescribed groundwater levels for the regional scale kroes et al 2009 and 3 simulated phreatic surface fluctuations are very sensitive to the soil hydraulic functions and the top boundary conditions and require a proper match between the top and bottom boundaries kroes et al 2009 but the observed shallow groundwater levels and the generalized current irrigation schedules may be incompatible over time and space notably groundwater runoff is relatively stagnant in the coastal plain of the ncp with a hydraulic gradient of 0 1 zhang et al 2009 thus the shallow groundwater movement in the coastal plain can be considered one dimensional vertical movement because the simulation started with winter wheat sowing under adequate soil water conditions the initial soil water content was specified as the field capacity pressure head equals 100 cm in zone a in zone b there were 17 monitoring wells and this area was divided into 17 regions in terms of the spatial distribution of these wells the collected shallow groundwater depth in the first october was defined as the initial value in each region consequently 18 bottom boundary condition and initial soil water content zones were obtained fig 3f the initial salt concentration in the saturated zone in zone b should represent shallow groundwater salinity hence a shallow groundwater salinity map zhang and fei 2009 fig 3g was needed to generate simulation units 2 5 5 crop data and their zones the winter wheat and summer maize parameters were calibrated and validated separately at the six experimental stations usually every city in hebei province has the recommended varieties of the two crops jia and guo 2009 therefore the study area was grouped into six crop growth parameter zones fig 3h by following the principle of parameters calibrated at an experimental station in a particular city could be generalized to the corresponding city and by considering the zones reported from the administration office of bohai sea granary hebei project region 2013 the crop planting and harvest time zones fig 3i were identical to the crop growth parameter zones 2 5 6 other zones the agro hydrological simulation was conducted on cropland only the statistical results of five land use maps resdc 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and yearbook statistical values general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1996 2011 showed that the cropland area tended to be stable during 1990 2010 the land use map in 2005 which was approximately the middle of the simulation period was used to identify cropland and noncropland fig 3j to facilitate further joint analyses of the simulation results and the water resource survey and assessment data at a spatial matching scale we also superimposed water resource zones when creating simulation units the study area involved seven water resource zones ren et al 2007 fig 3k to upscale the model outputs from the simulation unit level to the county level the generation of simulation units also had to aggregate the county boundary map fig 3l this aggregation was convenient not only for model validation but also for providing quantitative suggestions for policy makers to account for the simulation and analysis results overall the aggregation of the abovementioned 12 zoning maps yielded 2809 simulation units fig 3m the matlab vba and c languages were combined to prepare the input files in batches and an access database was used to process the outputs to improve the computational efficiency the simulation period lasted from october 1992 to october 2012 20 rotation years and the warming up period was from october 1989 to september 1992 these periods were determined by considering the time periods for which meteorological data observed experimental data statistical crop yields and water resource data could be collected and the time when nitrogen stress could not constitute a major factor that affected crop growth in the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 soil water movement salt transport module at each experimental station the highest ranked parameter for soil water content selected from the first order sensitivity index was consistent with the parameter selected from the total sensitivity index in detail the most sensitive parameter was the shape factor n of each layer at all the stations except for the wuqiao station where the soil water content of 0 20 cm swc1 was the most sensitive to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of this layer k s1 fig 4 a this result can be explained by the fact that n determines the slope of the soil water retention curve van genuchten 1980 which indirectly reflects the soil texture lei et al 1988 and water holding capacity a first order sensitivity index greater than 0 01 or a total sensitivity index greater than 0 1 was categorized as a sensitive parameter ma et al 2013 from the total sensitivity index fig 4a the soil water content was highly influenced by the n and osat at all the stations moreover the soil water content was sensitive to α at some of the stations these sensitive parameters for soil water content were generally consistent with the results in xu et al 2016 and stahn et al 2017 therefore when the soil water content was the objective variable the three hydraulic parameters n osat and α were calibrated the other two parameters ores and k s were set to the default values defined by the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 and the λ value was set to 0 5 mualem 1976 schaap et al 2001 the most sensitive parameters for the soil salt concentration were n ks and l fig 4a xu et al 2016 found that the soil salt concentration was most sensitive to l and it was also highly influenced by n and these findings were similar to the results in this study after calibrating the hydraulic parameters only l was calibrated at the nanpi shenzhou and quzhou stations when the soil salt concentration was the objective variable 3 1 2 winter wheat growth module according to the first order sensitivity index the lai and aboveground biomass of winter wheat were the most sensitive to slatb0 00 and the yield was the most sensitive to rsc at the langfang xiongxian and shenzhou stations slatb0 00 was the most important parameter for the lai aboveground biomass and yield at the nanpi and wuqiao stations and tbase tdwi and amaxtb1 00 dominated the highest parameter rank for the lai aboveground biomass and yield respectively at the quzhou station differences were observed in the most sensitive parameters between the first order and total sensitivity indices because the latter estimates the importance of a given parameter and its interactions with other parameters baroni and tarantola 2014 specifically slatb0 00 and not rsc played the most important role in simulating the yield at the langfang and xiongxian stations and slatb0 78 rather than tdwi and amaxtb1 00 was the most sensitive for the aboveground biomass and yield at quzhou station fig 4b the most sensitive parameter for the abovementioned output variables was important for simulating light interception e g slatb0 00 slatb0 78 and tbase and co2 assimilation e g amaxtb1 00 which are the main growth driving processes in the swap wofost model kroes et al 2009 and for calculating et e g rsc excluding the previously mentioned parameters other sensitive parameters were identified for the lai e g tdwi slatb0 78 kdif amaxtb1 00 tmnftb3 and grglai aboveground biomass e g amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 00 tbase kdif rsc and tmnftb3 and yield e g cvo amaxtb0 00 tdwi kdif tmnftb3 eff span amaxtb2 00 and tmpftb25 fig 4b 3 1 3 summer maize growth module from the first order sensitivity index tdwi was the most sensitive parameter for both the lai and aboveground biomass of summer maize at all six stations however for the yield the most sensitive parameter was tdwi at the langfang and shenzhou stations tmnftb8 at the xiongxian wuqiao and quzhou stations and slatb0 78 at the nanpi station the most sensitive parameter from the total sensitivity index was similar to that from the first order sensitivity index with slight differences tdwi rather than tmnftb8 was the most sensitive parameter for the yield at the xiongxian station and slatb0 00 rather than tdwi was the most sensitive parameter for the lai at the wuqiao station fig 4c wang et al 2013 found that four parameters i e span cvo tbase and eff had the highest sensitivities to maize yield the differences in the sensitive parameters between this study and wang et al 2013 might be attributed to the different environmental conditions e g soil meteorology and irrigation or value ranges in addition some other parameters were sensitive for the lai e g tmnftb8 span slatb0 78 slatb2 00 eff grglai laiem kdif and amaxtb1 25 aboveground biomass e g slatb0 00 slatb0 78 slatb2 00 tmnftb8 eff span grglai kdif amaxtb0 00 ecmax and ecslop and yield e g slatb0 00 cvo eff span amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 25 ecmax and ecslop fig 4c the important parameters of summer maize mentioned above related to the leaf expansion light interception and assimilation were consistent with the results of wang et al 2013 for the same output variable there were some sensitivity generalizations among all six stations for example the winter wheat lai was sensitive to tbase slatb0 78 and tdwi at all of the stations however some scattered appearances of sensitive parameters and their ranks were identified among the stations indicating that the sensitivity analysis results were probably influenced by the meteorology soil irrigation and crop planting and harvest times for specific modules there were clear differences in the sensitive parameters for different output variables which was consistent with wang et al 2013 for example the amaxtb0 00 of winter wheat was slightly sensitive for the yield and sensitive for the aboveground biomass at the langfang xiongxian wuqiao and quzhou stations in summary the efast method was used to conduct the global sensitivity analysis at the six experimental stations to recognize the sensitive parameters for eight variables thus preparing the ground for improving calibration efficiency in addition the results of the sensitivity analysis also indicate the parameters that should be measured to reduce the uncertainty in the simulation 3 2 parameter calibration and validation at the experimental stations 3 2 1 soil hydraulic parameters the mbe values for the soil water content prediction showed that the simulated values did not significantly overestimate or underestimate the observed values on average during both the calibration fig 5a 1 and validation fig 5b 1 periods which had mbes of 0 00 cm3 cm 3 and 0 01 cm3 cm 3 respectively a good simulation of the soil water content was achieved during the calibration period with a rmse of 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nrmse of 14 93 and d of 0 91 fig 5a 1 the validation also showed good results rmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nrmse 16 26 and d 0 88 fig 5b 1 the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters at the six stations are given in table 5 3 2 2 soil salt transport parameter the simulated soil salt concentration approximated the observed values during the calibration period with a mbe of 0 01 mg cm 3 fig 5a 2 but it was overestimated during the validation period with a mbe of 0 21 mg cm 3 fig 5b 2 the rmse values were 0 81 mg cm 3 and 0 91 mg cm 3 for calibration and validation respectively the nrmse values were within the range of fair simulation accuracy with values of 27 20 for calibration and 29 36 for validation the d values were 0 91 and 0 87 for the calibration and validation periods respectively these indicators and the 1 1 line fitting diagram showed that the simulation of the soil salt concentrations was acceptable and applicable during the calibration fig 5a 2 and validation fig 5b 2 periods and the calibrated parameter l values at the three stations are listed in table 5 3 2 3 growth parameters of winter wheat the mbe values showed that the simulated winter wheat lai was close to the observed values during the calibration period fig 5a 3 but was overestimated compared to the observed values during the validation period fig 5b 3 the mbe results also showed an overestimation of the aboveground biomass fig 5a 4 and fig 5b 4 and an underestimation of the yield fig 5a 5 and fig 5b 5 during the two periods during the calibration period the values of the rmse nrmse and d were 0 90 cm2 cm 2 24 60 and 0 95 respectively for the lai the corresponding values were 1893 68 kg hm 2 25 27 and 0 97 for aboveground biomass and 1490 69 kg hm 2 23 12 and 0 69 for yield these indicators showed that the matches between the simulated and observed values were fair and reliable the validation also resulted in fair statistical results for the lai aboveground biomass and yield based on the rmse 0 95 cm2 cm 2 1529 41 kg hm 2 and 1398 78 kg hm 2 respectively nrmse 24 20 22 75 and 21 77 respectively and d 0 95 0 98 and 0 68 respectively values during the calibration and validation processes the winter wheat parameters after calibration at the six stations table 6 could not only simulate the yield well but also fairly simulate the lai and the aboveground biomass which reflect the dynamic growth processes the calibrated parameters for winter wheat that had high sensitivity included the rsc tdwi slatb0 00 slatb0 78 span kdif tbase eff amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 00 amaxtb2 00 and cvo notably two sensitive parameters tmnftb3 and tmpftb25 were not calibrated these two parameters reflect the reduction in the maximum co2 assimilation rate due to inappropriate temperatures and their values partly depend on the values of amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 00 and amaxtb2 00 and they were not calibrated to reduce the equifinality which is consistent with other studies singh et al 2006b noory et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 the adjusted rsc values ranged from 44 to 47 s m 1 at the six stations the rsc value varies between 30 s m 1 for arable crops and 150 s m 1 for trees kroes et al 2009 and the rsc values of wheat cotton and rice were set to 70 s m 1 by singh et al 2006b using the swap wofost model in india moreover the average rsc of winter wheat at different development stages at the yucheng experimental station in the ncp was 20 3 s m 1 yuan et al 2002 these values demonstrate the rationality of the adjusted rsc to some extent the calibrated tdwi varied from 100 to 110 kg hm 2 at the six stations notably qiao 1999 measured a value of 100 kg hm 2 at the quzhou station in 1998 the estimated specific leaf area of winter wheat at the quzhou station in 1998 1999 was 0 0025 hm2 kg 1 before the overwintering stage it reached a maximum of 0 0040 hm2 kg 1 at the regreening stage and it decreased to 0 0018 0 0020 hm2 kg 1 at the grain filling stage qiao et al 2002 moreover qiao et al 2002 found no significant difference in the specific leaf area between winter wheat varieties the results from qiao et al 2002 showed that the calibrated slatb0 00 slatb0 78 and slatb2 00 were reasonable to a certain extent the default value of tbase which is 0 c is the threshold below which low temperatures influence the leaf growth of winter wheat in the ncp chen et al 2008 thus 0 c was set as the calibrated value at all stations furthermore the recommended value ranges of span kdif eff and cvo were 26 36 d zhou et al 2012 0 44 0 70 boogaard et al 1998 zhou et al 2012 0 40 0 50 kg hm 2 hr 1 j 1 m 2 s 1 boogaard et al 1998 and 0 60 0 80 kg kg 1 zhou et al 2012 respectively indicating that the calibrated results of all four parameters were within the recommended ranges additionally several parameters that reflect the effects of water stress i e h1 h2u h2l h3h h3l and h4 and salt stress i e ecmax and ecslop on root water extraction were slightly sensitive for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat but were adjusted according to the related literature the critical pressure head values including h1 h2u h2l h3h h3l and h4 referenced the default values in the simple module rather than those in the detailed module of the swap model because winter wheat breeding has been aimed at primarily increasing the drought resistance since the 1990s in the study area chen et al 2008 jia and guo 2009 yu 2015 the default values in the simple module reflect a lower influence of drought stress on the winter wheat growth than the values in the detailed module the results of ecmax and ecslop referred to values from the literature kroes et al 2009 li and yang 2017 furthermore two parameters the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis tsumea and the temperature sum from anthesis to maturity tsumam were estimated using the observed dates of emergence anthesis and maturity of winter wheat and the temperature data at each station it is necessary to translate the simulated salinity concentration in the soil water c act mg cm 3 to the electrical conductivity in the saturated paste extract ecsat ds m 1 to reduce root water uptake caused by salt stress according to the reduction function in maas and hoffman 1977 therefore the following three parameters should be supplied to the crop input file the two empirical coefficients a and b and the f that accounts for over saturation in the soil paste a value of 2 0 is recommended for f and the values of a and b should be 1 492 and 1 0 respectively as suggested by fao48 kroes et al 2009 the relation between ecsat and c act with an a of 1 492 b of 1 0 and f of 2 0 was similar to the relation that was fitted using the measured ecsat and c act in nanpi county in the study area he et al 2017 3 2 4 growth parameters of summer maize comparisons of the simulated and observed values of the lai aboveground biomass and yield of summer maize during the calibration fig 5a 6 to fig 5a 8 and validation fig 5b 6 to fig 5b 8 periods revealed relatively consistent results overall the mbe results showed that all of the lai aboveground biomass and yield values for summer maize were underestimated during the two periods the calibrated parameters table 6 of summer maize could simulate the lai and aboveground biomass fairly well as indicated by the nrmse values of 24 55 and 21 33 respectively during the calibration period and the corresponding values of 22 03 and 24 38 respectively during the validation period additionally reliable rmse and d values were achieved the evaluation indicators showed a good simulation of the yield for calibration and validation with rmse values of 1525 51 kg hm 2 and 1486 48 kg hm 2 respectively nrmse values of 17 94 and 18 62 respectively and low d values of 0 54 and 0 57 respectively the calibrated parameters which were sensitive for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of summer maize included the rsc tdwi slatb0 00 slatb0 78 span kdif eff amaxtb0 00 amaxtb1 25 amaxtb2 00 cvo ecmax and ecslop consistent with winter wheat the most sensitive parameter tmnftb8 was not calibrated because it reflects the reduction in the maximum co2 assimilation rate of summer maize because of inappropriate temperatures the recommended rsc value is 30 s m 1 for arable crops kroes et al 2009 and the estimated rsc value of summer maize by wang et al 2006 at the yucheng experimental station in the ncp was 19 21 s m 1 indicating the relative reliability of the calibrated rsc at the six stations which varied from 30 to 32 s m 1 the default value of tdwi which is 5 kg hm 2 was not adjusted because the observed biomass at emergence at quzhou station in 1998 1999 was approximatively 5 kg hm 2 qiao 1999 the results of span kdif eff and cvo after calibration were within their suggested ranges of 32 40 d ceglar et al 2011 wang et al 2011 0 44 0 65 boogaard et al 1998 ceglar et al 2011 0 40 0 50 kg hm 2 hr 1 j 1 m 2 s 1 boogaard et al 1998 and 0 60 0 80 kg kg 1 li et al 2014 respectively the calibrated ecmax and ecslop were suggested by kroes et al 2009 in addition the six critical pressure head values also referenced the default values in the simple module to be consistent with the winter wheat furthermore both tsumea and tsumam were calculated using the observed dates of different growth stages and temperature data the values of a b and f were 1 492 1 0 and 2 0 respectively because these values were irrelevant to the crop detailed calibrations and validations at the station level provide rich parameters for researchers to conduct relevant simulation studies using the swap swap wofost or wofost model in this globally representative area 3 3 model validation at the regional scale 3 3 1 crop yields the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize under the generalized current irrigation schedule were aggregated from the simulation unit level to the county level using the area weighted mean a comparison of the average simulated winter wheat yields during 1994 2012 notably the observed crop yields could be collected from yearbooks during these years in each county with the corresponding observed values indicated that the simulated was consistent with the observed data fig 6a a good agreement was also achieved in the summer maize yield fig 6b the yield was underestimated for winter wheat which presented a mbe of 274 26 kg hm 2 but it was overestimated for summer maize which presented a mbe of 454 83 kg hm 2 the evaluation indicators also showed good simulation results for the winter wheat yield in the study area rmse 672 82 kg hm 2 nrmse 13 47 and d 0 87 respectively additionally a satisfactory validation of the summer maize yield was generally achieved with a rmse of 839 96 kg hm 2 nrmse of 15 74 and d of 0 73 overall the distributed swap wofost model and the generalized current irrigation schedule could describe the spatial differences in crop yields quite well 3 3 2 et to further evaluate the simulation accuracy of the distributed model the simulated et values were compared with the corresponding values estimated by remote sensing using modis and a detailed description of the remote sensing et data was reported by wu et al 2012 the remote sensing et data during 2002 2008 with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km were clipped using the land use map in 2005 with the same resolution which resulted in consistency between the remote sensing et data for the cropland and the spatial scale of the simulated et furthermore both the simulated and remote sensing et values were accumulated at the yearly scale and the averages and standard deviations of both the simulated and remote sensing et values on 33 888 grid cells in each year were calculated as shown in fig 7 the et was generally overestimated with a mbe of 157 07 mm which may be related to the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system which is a high water consumption cropping pattern that was applied to all cropland for simplification purposes the rmse nrmse and d values were 167 48 mm 29 25 and 0 21 respectively indicating an acceptable match between the simulated et and remote sensing data moreover the simulated et values during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons from 1993 to 2012 were 406 58 30 61 mm and 325 38 17 24 mm respectively fig 8 a the water requirement of winter wheat is estimated to be 400 600 mm chen et al 2008 jia and guo 2009 in hebei province the et values during the winter wheat growing season associated with yields of 3000 kg hm 2 and 7500 kg hm 2 are 285 mm and 525 mm respectively jia and guo 2009 in central and southern hebei province the et of winter wheat is 468 mm in a normal year with an irrigation quota of 210 mm and 497 mm in a dry year with an irrigation quota of 270 mm li and yang 2017 the water requirement is approximately 376 mm for summer maize with et varying from 237 to 589 mm in central and southern hebei province jia and guo 2009 thus the simulated et values for the two crops were close to the values reported above 3 3 3 wp the wp quantifies the crop production per unit of water used singh et al 2006c singh et al 2006b and is defined as the ratio of crop yield to seasonal water use the seasonal water use in this study referred to the et the average simulated wps of winter wheat and summer maize under the current irrigation schedule in 1993 2012 in the study area were 1 14 kg m 3 and 1 72 kg m 3 respectively the broad average wp ranges of the two crops in 1993 2012 were 0 75 1 73 kg m 3 and 0 79 2 58 kg m 3 fig 8b the globally measured average wp was 1 09 kg m 3 for wheat and 1 80 kg m 3 for maize with large ranges 0 60 1 70 kg m 3 and 1 10 2 70 kg m 3 for wheat and maize respectively zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in china the average wp of winter wheat was 1 32 kg m 3 in irrigated farmland and 1 01 kg m 3 in dry farmland and the average wp of summer maize was 1 74 kg m 3 in irrigated farmland deng et al 2006 in the part of the ncp belonging to hebei province the simulated wps of winter wheat in 1992 and summer maize in 1993 for irrigated areas ranged from 1 23 to 1 58 kg m 3 and from 1 10 to 1 93 kg m 3 respectively when using the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model mo et al 2005 in the ncp the range of the simulated wp in 1997 2006 was 0 78 1 51 kg m 3 for winter wheat and 1 04 1 88 kg m 3 for summer maize according to the vegetation interface processes vip model mo et al 2009 overall the simulated wp values of the two crops were close to the values presented above to summarize the distributed swap wofost model could well simulate the crop yields at the county scale and performed acceptable simulations of et at the regional scale this model provided an effective tool for the simulation and analysis of crop yields and water balance components of the agro hydrological cycle in the study area 4 conclusions a representative deep groundwater irrigated area in china was selected in this study by fully mining and using abundant agricultural and hydrological data 2809 simulation units of the distributed swap wofost model were aggregated to capture the regional heterogeneity the parameters were calibrated on the basis of global sensitivity analysis results and the model was validated using multisource and multi spatiotemporal scale data several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 at the six stations according to the total sensitivity index the soil water content and salt concentration were the most sensitive to parameter n in most of the soil layers the most sensitive parameter for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat included slatb0 00 slatb0 78 tbase and rsc and for the lai aboveground biomass and yield of summer maize included tdwi slatb0 00 slatb0 78 and tmnftb8 the identification of common and different sensitive parameters for these eight variables among the six stations provides definitive guidance for improving parameter calibration efficiency 2 at the six stations two variables the soil water content and summer maize yield were simulated well during both the calibration and validation periods with all nrmses less than 20 five other variables i e the lai aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat and the lai and aboveground biomass of summer maize were more fairly simulated with nrmses mostly in the range of 20 25 during the two periods the remaining variable the soil salt concentration was fairly simulated during the two periods with nrmses within the range of 25 30 in summary after calibration and validation the swap wofost model acceptably simulated the soil water and salt dynamics and the lai aboveground biomass and yield of the two studied crops at the six stations in addition each of the calibrated parameters was within a reasonable range 3 the nrmse value was 13 47 for winter wheat and 15 74 for summer maize based on a comparison between the average statistical yields of the two crops in 1994 2012 in each county and the corresponding simulated values under the current irrigation conditions this result indicates that the distributed swap wofost model was able to predict the crop yields and their spatial variability well and indirectly demonstrates the rationality of the generalized current irrigation schedule the simulated et was somewhat higher than the remote sensing data at the regional scale due to the adopted uniform cropping pattern of winter wheat summer maize the simulated et and wp of the two crops were consistent with the reported values from the literature in conclusion the soil water movement salt transport and crop growth parameters after detailed calibration at the six stations which were based on global sensitivity analyses and observed values could provide valuable parameter values for future agro hydrological simulation research in this region the distributed swap wofost model could be used not only to simulate and analyze agro hydrological cycle processes under current irrigation practices but also to simulate and evaluate both the wp and the contribution to reducing deep groundwater exploitation under limited

6451,determination of electrical conductivity of soil pore water from measurements of soil bulk electrical conductivity and volumetric water content or dielectric permittivity requires theoretical or empirical models connecting these quantities one such model is the salinity index model which in the original formulation requires the measurement of soil bulk electrical conductivity and apparent dielectric permittivity determined with the time domain reflectometry tdr technique currently many popular soil moisture sensors are operated at a single frequency usually in the low frequency part of the typical tdr bandwidth yet no systematic verification of the salinity index model applied with the use of dielectric permittivity measured at specific frequencies in a broad frequency range has been performed the aim of this paper is to evaluate the salinity index model with the use of dielectric spectra of 277 samples of 14 soils obtained in a 20 mhz 3 ghz frequency range with the use of a coaxial transmission line cell vector network analyzer system a three pole debye model was fitted to the spectra in order to determine bulk electrical conductivity and the real part of dielectric permittivity at chosen frequencies in order to diminish the influence of measurement errors then the salinity index model was applied at each examined frequency and its soil specific parameters were calculated the performance of the model was evaluated with the use of the leave one out cross validation scheme and the frequencies at which the model performed best were found within 0 5 2 ghz range finally the salinity index model parameters obtained at the optimal frequencies were correlated with other soil properties keywords soil dielectric properties vector network analyzer measurements broadband spectra soil pore water electrical conductivity soil salinity index model 1 introduction soil salinity is an important variable e g in environmental research and monitoring and preventing and controlling excessive salinization in agriculture elevated soil salinity levels may be damaging to crops and the risk can be high in dry and coastal areas and for irrigated fields currently standard methods to assess soil salinity without the need of chemical analyses are the measurements of electrical conductivity of saturated extracts or soil water extracts of various proportions most commonly 1 5 w v rhoades et al 1999 visconti et al 2010 however the need of widespread soil salinity characterization requires the use of less laborious and time consuming means one approach is to use remote sensing data abbas et al 2013 or a combination of remote sensing with proximal methods aldabaa et al 2015 in situ measurement of soil bulk electrical conductivity σ b is also attractive since this quantity is measurable by many commercial soil moisture sensors robinson et al 2008 vaz et al 2013 however σ b depends not only on the concentration of solutes but also on various soil properties therefore electrical conductivity of soil pore water σ w is a better indicator of solute concentration rhoades et al 1999 field measurement of σ w can be performed with the use of imbibition type sensors or in lysimeters rhoades et al 1999 electrical conductivity of soil pore water can also be extracted from soil bulk electrical conductivity with the use of theoretical or empirical models connecting these quantities a number of such models have been developed archie 1942 mualem and friedman 1991 rhoades et al 1999 malicki and walczak 1999 amente et al 2000 hilhorst 2000 nadler 2005 muñoz carpena et al 2005 leao et al 2010 lim et al 2017 one of these models is the salinity index model malicki and walczak 1999 which assumes a linear relationship between soil bulk electrical conductivity σ b and bulk dielectric permittivity ε b this is an indirect relationship which is the result of the explicit dependence of electrical conductivity and dielectric permittivity on volumetric water content the slope of the σ b vs ε b indirect relation was linked to soil pore water conductivity σ w to this end a salinity index term si was defined in malicki and walczak 1999 as a partial derivative of bulk electrical conductivity with respect to bulk dielectric permittivity measured with the time domain reflectometry tdr technique 1 si σ b ε b for samples of certain σ w as long as the relation between σ b and ε b is linear si does not depend on ε b and thus it is also independent of moisture content if this condition is satisfied si can be calculated from a single measurement of ε b and σ b with the use of the following formula 2 si σ b σ i ε b ε i where ε i and σ i represent the initial limiting values when the soil is dry enough such that the difference in σ b stemming from the difference in σ w cannot be reliably observed these limits are a consequence of the soil porous structure in order to properly assess σ w from σ b there must be enough water to ensure continuous pathways for electrical current 1 actually rhoades et al 1999 presents a three pathway model of soil bulk electrical conductivity which includes i conduction along the pores filled with the soil pore water of σ w ii conduction along the surfaces of solid particles especially clay minerals coupled in series with the water filled small pores iii conduction through the indurated solid phase which usually can be neglected soil particles surface conductivity contributes in the si model to the residual conductivity σ r see eq 7 in rhoades et al 1999 the volumetric water content of 0 1 m 3 m 3 was provided as a threshold value below which σ w cannot be determined 1 rhoades et al 1999 in malicki and walczak 1999 it was suggested to take the following fixed values 3 ε i 6 2 σ i 8 ms m 1 however in wilczek et al 2012 it was found out that these values depend on soil properties once si is calculated σ w can be determined from the following formula 4 σ w si l where l is the slope of a relation between si and the electrical conductivity of moistening solutions σ s used for calibration of the model based on tdr measurements malicki and walczak 1999 suggested the following empirical relation between the slope l and the sand content s of a given soil 5 l 56 10 4 71 10 6 s the idea of the si model is schematically presented in fig 1 the salinity index model has been developed with the use of tdr measurements currently many commercial soil moisture sensors are capacitance or impedance probes that are operated at a single low frequency usually not higher than 300 mhz vaz et al 2013 oftentimes such sensors measure directly complex relative dielectric permittivity ε ε j ε or just its real part ε at a given frequency also there are ongoing efforts to develop a probe that would measure a wider part of the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum skierucha and wilczek 2010 pelletier et al 2012 szypłowska et al 2016 lewandowski et al 2018 lin et al 2018 one can use the value of ε at a given frequency to calculate si by substituting ε b in eq 2 soil complex dielectric permittivity is frequency dependent and within the frequency range from 20 mhz to several ghz ε can exhibit significant dispersion caused by several overlapping relaxation mechanisms stemming from various interfacial phenomena including bound water relaxation chen and or 2006 wagner et al 2011 these mechanisms depend not only on moisture content and salinity but also on various soil specific properties like the particle size distribution and mineralogy therefore the relation between ε and water content depends on the frequency and on salinity and other properties especially at low frequencies as a consequence the parameters of the si model may also depend on the measurement frequency this was preliminarily confirmed in wilczek et al 2012 where the obtained model parameters differed from malicki and walczak 1999 the salinity index model has been evaluated using various dielectric measurement techniques and devices operating at various frequencies for a range of soils persson 2002 hamed et al 2003 bouksila et al 2008 wilczek et al 2012 scudiero et al 2012 kargas and kerkides 2018 and glass beads szypłowska et al 2017 particularly in kargas and kerkides 2018 the si model was evaluated with the use of the wet sensor operating at 20 mhz and a correction of the model was introduced in order to obtain reliable predictions the existing literature studies utilized different soils measurement equipment and experimental protocols and a custom model calibration was not always performed the aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the si model in the frequency range 20 mhz 3 ghz using samples of 14 soils moistened to various water contents and salinity levels with the use of distilled water and three kcl solutions a total of 277 complex dielectric permittivity spectra of the samples were measured using a coaxial transmission line cell connected to a vector network analyzer firstly for each soil and moistening solution the relation between σ b and ε was examined at each investigated frequency since the linearity of this relation is a key assumption of the salinity index model next the model was calibrated at each frequency and evaluated using the leave one out cross validation scheme based on the validation results the optimal frequency range for which the model predictions exhibited the smallest errors was determined finally the model parameters at the optimal frequencies were correlated with soil properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils a total number of 14 soils were tested in the experiment soil material was air dried and sieved in order to remove stones and gravel the following properties of these soils were characterized particle size distribution total organic carbon content specific surface area solid phase density and ph particle size distribution presented in table 1 was measured using a laser diffractometer mastersizer 2000 with a hydro g dispersion unit uk the stirrer speed was 700 rpm and the pump speed was 1750 rpm the aggregates were dispersed using ultrasounds of 35 w over 4 min the assumed refractive index for soil was 1 52 and the absorption coefficient 0 1 bieganowski et al 2018 the specific surface area measurement was based on the brunauer emmett teller bet nitrogen gas adsorption method with the use of a surface characterization analyzer 3flex micromeritics usa total organic carbon content was determined with the use of a toc v cph analyzer shimadzu corporation japan with solid sample combustion unit ssm 5000a soil ph was measured in water 1 2 5 v v after 24 h stabilization at room temperature solid phase density was measured using a helium pycnometer ultrapyc 1200e v4 01 quantachrome instruments usa the values of the specific surface area total organic carbon content solid phase density and ph are presented in table 2 in order to prepare soil samples for testing air dry soil material was moistened to designated water contents with distilled water of electrical conductivity σ s 2 10 4 sm 1 and three kcl solutions of σ s 0 52 1 02 and 1 50 sm 1 the designated amount of liquid was added to the soil material and thoroughly mixed in order to achieve a uniform moisture distribution for each soil five designated water contents were chosen in order to cover the available moisture range up to saturation therefore with four different salinity levels and five water content levels 20 samples of each soil were prepared which gave 280 separate samples for all 14 soils in total three of these samples were not included in further analysis due to experimental protocol errors giving 277 measured samples in total for each prepared and loaded sample bulk density and volumetric water content were noted 2 2 measurement system each soil sample was loaded into a large diameter coaxial transmission line measurement cell see fig 1 c in lewandowski et al 2017a and b in lewandowski et al 2019 the inner diameter of the outer conductor and the outer diameter of the inner conductor of the cell were 38 8 and 16 9 mm respectively the soil material was supported at both cell ends by two 7 5 mm thick polyoxymethylene pom beads equipped with synthetic rubber o rings in order to prevent the leakage and evaporation during the measurement the position of the supporting beads was adjustable to the loaded sample length which varied from 3 1 to 4 6 cm giving the sample volume from 30 1 to 44 1 cm2 the scattering parameters of the coaxial cell with the loaded sample were measured with the use of a vectorstar ms4642a vna anritsu corporation japan two port vna the large diameter sample cell was connected to precise microwave cables equipped with type n connectors via commercial type n eia15 8 adapters the measurements were performed in the 0 02 3 ghz frequency range prior to the measurements the vna was calibrated with the use of the multiline trl method of marks 1991 using a set of five coaxial transmission lines of various lengths an open circuit standard and a matched load termination lewandowski et al 2017b in order to extend the frequency range of the calibration down to 20 mhz all calibration standards were implemented in the eia 1 5 8 standard as described in lewandowski et al 2017a which allowed us to obtain accurate scattering parameter measurements at reference planes within the large diameter coaxial transmission line cell scattering parameters of the beads supporting the soil samples were measured in the same system and then removed from the cell scattering parameters using the transmission matrix approach lewandowski et al 2017a the dielectric permittivity spectra were extracted from the measured scattering parameters with the use of a nonlinear least squares algorithm taking into account only the transmission parameter lewandowski et al 2019 in this algorithm the implementation of boughriet et al 1997 of the classical nrw method baker jarvis et al 2005 was used to provide a starting point for the nonlinear least squares optimization more details on the experimental setup calibration procedure and dielectric permittivity extraction algorithm were presented in lewandowski et al 2017a lewandowski et al 2017b lewandowski et al 2019 all measurements were done at room temperature ranging from 19 5 to 22 5 c 2 3 data processing and analysis the application of the si model with dielectric spectra data requires the real part of ε at a certain frequency in order to diminish the potential influence of measurement errors soil ε was modeled with the use of a three pole debye model with an added σ b term 6 ε ε i 1 3 δ ε i 1 j ω τ i j σ b ω ε 0 where ω 2 π f f is the measurement frequency ε 0 8 85 10 12 fm 1 is the vacuum permittivity ε is the high frequency dielectric permittivity and δ ε i and τ i are relaxation amplitude and time of an i th pole respectively then ε values were obtained at the frequencies chosen for analysis from 20 mhz to 3 ghz with 10 mhz interval the fitting of eq 6 also enabled determination of σ b from the measured spectra at each examined frequency and for each soil the σ b vs ε relations were investigated for each moistening liquid for all soils and salinity cases the values of si were calculated the frequency dependence of si was examined at all examined frequencies and for all soils the salinity index model parameters were calculated which constituted model calibration the values of the l parameter were obtained from the slopes of the si vs σ s lines the initial limiting values ε i and σ i from eq 2 were calculated from the convergence point of the four lines representing σ b vs ε relations since distilled water and three kcl solutions were used which resulted in four fitted lines the intersection point was calculated for each pair of lines separately and then an arithmetic mean was taken the frequency dependence of the calculated si model parameters was examined data from all 14 soils were analyzed but for the purpose of clarity only results for four soils of various particle size distribution 555 613 kre and orz were presented in detail on the graphs next at each examined frequency the performance of the si model was evaluated with the use of the leave one out cross validation scheme for each soil each moistening solution and at each distinct frequency a measured sample was chosen for evaluation and the rest of the measurements for a given soil were used for model calibration next electrical conductivity of the moistening solution σ s of the sample under question was recovered as argued in malicki and walczak 1999 electrical conductivity of pore water σ w of a sample moistened with a liquid of σ s can be approximated as a sum of σ s and residual electrical conductivity σ r which arises from dissolved ions already present in the soil and electrical conductivity of soil solid phase thus σ s of a given sample was calculated as 7 σ s σ w σ r where σ w is determined from eq 4 with si calculated using eq 2 with the l parameter and limiting values ε i and σ i obtained from the model calibration individual for each sample in the cross validation scheme the residual conductivity was also obtained using eq 4 taking the si limit as σ s 0 which can be calculated as the intersection point on the vertical axis of the si vs σ s relation the cross validation root mean squared error rmse cv was used as a measure of the model performance the results obtained from the cross validation scheme were compared to the results obtained using the original model parameters named si mw model from malicki and walczak 1999 for which appropriate root mean squared error rmse mw was calculated also the dry soil limit of the si model application suggested in malicki and walczak 1999 was examined based on the obtained rmse cv results the optimal frequency range for the application of the si model was determined finally the soil specific si model parameters obtained during model calibration at the optimal frequencies were correlated with soil properties whenever root mean squared error was calculated the following general formula was used 8 rmse i 1 n y i y mi 2 m where y i are the observed known variables y mi are the values obtained from the model n is the number of observations and m is the number of the degrees of freedom specifically in the case of examining the si and si mw model performance during the cross validation m was taken as equal to n and when rmse is calculated during regression analysis m equals the number of observations decreased by the number of the estimated coefficients all calculations were performed with the matlab software environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the model the measurement results comprised a data set of 277 ε spectra of samples of 14 soils of various water content up to saturation moistened with distilled water and three kcl solutions fig 2 presents typical ε spectra of five samples of soil kre moistened with a kcl solution of σ s 1 02 sm 1 the obtained spectra exhibit clear frequency dependence which is especially visible at frequencies below about 200 mhz the three pole debye model fitted to the spectra is also depicted in fig 2 for all measured samples of all tested soils the fitting of eq 6 was accurate with the average root mean squared error of fitting of 0 084 for each soil and at each examined frequency the relations between σ b and ε were linear for each moistening liquid it was observed that for the samples moistened with the kcl solutions the linear regression coefficient of determination r 2 was generally greater than 0 99 with some exceptions mostly at low frequencies for which the lowest r 2 of 0 961 was observed at 20 mhz for σ s 1 02 sm 1 for the measurement series of soil 616 in the case of samples moistened with distilled water for four soils r 2 dropped below 0 9 with the lowest value of 0 78 at 20 mhz for sand orz representative results for selected soils at 500 mhz were presented in fig 3 the slopes of the fitted lines represent si values for given measurement series in accordance to eq 1 these results agree with the previous literature studies kargas and kerkides 2018 wilczek et al 2012 which dealt with the salinity index model applied with the use of dielectric permittivity measured at 20 mhz and 380 440 mhz respectively an r 2 0 96 was reported in these papers for the linear regression of the σ b vs ε relations sand samples moistened with the kcl solution of the lowest applied electrical conductivity were the exception for which a lower value r 2 0 77 was obtained at 20 mhz kargas and kerkides 2018 since ε depends on frequency the values of si also depend on frequency as depicted in fig 4 for the four salinity cases of the four chosen soils generally si increased with the increase in frequency which corresponds to the decrease of ε with an increase in frequency see fig 2 a for an illustration of ε frequency dependence based on presented spectra generally the smallest frequency dependence was observed for the sand soil orz which was caused by the relatively small dielectric dispersion of soils with little clay content in the frequency range of interest since the relations between σ b and ε were observed to be linear si is independent of moisture content and σ w can be calculated from eq 4 the relations between si and the values of moistening solutions electrical conductivity σ s for the four selected soils were presented in fig 5 as seen these relations are also linear in accordance to the si model assumptions with r 2 0 99 there were very few exceptions at low frequencies for which the lowest r 2 0 977 was observed at 20 mhz for soil 558 these results also agree well with kargas and kerkides 2018 2012 where r 2 0 989 was reported since the relations between σ b and ε and between si and σ s are assumed to be linear σ w can be calculated from eq 4 the l parameter present in eq 4 is equal to the slope of the si vs σ s relation and can be determined with the use of the linear regression as a consequence of the si frequency dependence l is also frequency dependent as depicted in fig 6 for the selected soils this parameter also increased with frequency and the sand soil orz displayed little change at frequencies below 2 ghz kargas and kerkides 2018 reported higher values of the l parameter than in malicki and walczak 1999 and in the present study at 20 mhz in scudiero et al 2012 the l parameter values obtained at 70 mhz were also higher than in the present study the span of the values of the l parameter obtained in wilczek et al 2012 where l 0 0074 0 009 roughly corresponds to the span of values obtained in the present study at corresponding frequencies the exception being the most sandy soil in the present study for which l is larger than in wilczek et al 2012 while still lower than in malicki and walczak 1999 the final parameters necessary for the calibration of the si model are the initial limiting values ε i and σ i from eq 2 the results are presented in fig 7 as shown both initial limiting values depend on frequency especially at frequencies below about 400 mhz these values also differ among soils with the malicki and walczak 1999 estimates see eq 3 situated roughly in between the values for sandy and silt loam soils at high frequencies the ε i values obtained from the 20 mhz measurements agree well with kargas and kerkides 2018 for soils with high sand content while for soils with higher clay content ε i values tend to be higher than in kargas and kerkides 2018 also the values of σ i obtained in the present study at 20 mhz are higher than in kargas and kerkides 2018 the differences in both parameters more pronounced in soils with significant clay content may be caused by the correction in dielectric permittivity applied in kargas and kerkides 2018 in scudiero et al 2012 the limiting permittivity and bulk electrical conductivity were found to be constant and set to 7 1 and 0 06 sm 1 respectively the values of ε i obtained in the present paper at corresponding frequencies are also higher than in wilczek et al 2012 especially for soils with low sand content actually in wilczek et al 2012 ε i rises with sand content while in the present study the relation is opposite the values of σ i are higher than in wilczek et al 2012 as well although the difference is smaller than in comparison to kargas and kerkides 2018 it should also be noted that in these other studies kargas and kerkides 2018 scudiero et al 2012 wilczek et al 2012 five soils were tested while in the present study 14 the results pertaining to the si model parameters obtained for all soils are presented explicitly in figs 11 and 12 correlations of these parameters with properties of all tested soils are presented in subsection 3 3 3 2 cross validation of the model the results of σ s recovered for selected soils using the cross validation scheme and with the use of the original malicki and walczak 1999 model parameters for samples with ε 7 at 500 mhz are presented in fig 8 values obtained with the individual model calibration are generally much closer to the true values than with the use of parameters from malicki and walczak 1999 as shown in fig 8 also the salinity index model does not work well for very dry soils which agrees with malicki and walczak 1999 the form of eq 2 indicates that the result could be especially prone to measurement errors if the values of ε b and σ b are close to the limiting values ε i and σ i furthermore the σ b vs ε b relation is nonlinear at very low permittivity values in malicki and walczak 1999 it was recommended to restrict the application of the si model to ε 10 which corresponds to volumetric water content greater than about 0 2 in the present work the root mean squared error of cross validation rmse cv was calculated for a set of samples with i ε 7 and ii ε 10 at all frequencies and the results are presented in fig 9 also in the left column of fig 9 the performance of the si mw model was assessed and root mean squared error rmse mw was calculated for samples with ε 10 at all frequencies as seen in fig 8 and fig 9 the si model individually calibrated for each soil at each frequency performs much better than with the use of original parameters from malicki and walczak 1999 which also confirms the results of kargas and kerkides 2018 obtained at 20 mhz the rmse cv is generally much lower than rmse mw also the si model generally performed better at frequencies higher than 0 2 ghz in the case of si mw model the optimal frequency range significantly differed among the tested soils the inclusion of the lower water content soil samples i e with 7 ε 10 increased the rmse cv values presented in the right column of fig 9 in the insets moreover for three soils there were samples with permittivity and bulk electrical conductivity close to the limiting values of ε i and σ i e g see the most dry samples in fig 3a and b while still satisfying the ε 7 condition these samples exhibited extremely high errors as seen in the large plots in the right column of fig 9 especially at certain frequencies the results confirm the findings of malicki and walczak 1999 where it was found that the model performs best for samples with ε 10 which corresponds to volumetric water content roughly equal to 0 2 therefore the results obtained from the application of the salinity index model for soils of volumetric water content below this threshold might be burdened with errors in order to determine the optimal frequency range of the si model performance for the tested soils for the measurement series of samples of each soil moistened with each solution separately the smallest rmse cv was found rmse cvmin and the frequency at which it occurred next for each measurement series the frequencies were found at which the rmse cv was within two arbitrarily chosen toleration limits i rmse cv 1 2 rmse cvmin and ii rmse cv 1 1 rmse cvmin then the number of measurement series number of cases for which a given frequency was found within those limits was calculated for all tested soils but separately for each moistening liquid 14 measurement series in total for each liquid the maximum number of cases possible and all tested soils and all moistening liquids combined 56 measurement series in total the maximum number of cases possible the results presented in fig 10 show frequencies between 0 5 and 2 ghz having the largest number of cases lower frequencies especially below 300 mhz for the solution of the highest salinity and below 100 mhz for other solutions were rarely found in the optimal performance limits which also confirms the results seen in fig 9 other studies also reported limited accuracy of the si model predictions at frequencies below 100 mhz in kargas and kerkides 2018 satisfactory performance of the salinity index model with dielectric permittivity measured at 20 mhz was demonstrated with moistening solutions of σ s 0 6 sm 1 while in scudiero et al 2012 where dielectric permittivity was measured at 70 mhz the upper bound of pore water electrical conductivity for the si model s satisfactory performance was determined to be at 1 sm 1 in conclusion it can be stated that the optimal frequencies for the salinity index model performance were found in the range 0 5 2 ghz 3 3 salinity index model parameters in kargas and kerkides 2018 the l parameter was found to be a linear function of sand content similar to malicki and walczak 1999 but with values higher than in malicki and walczak 1999 scudiero et al 2012 also found the l parameter to be a linear function of sand content but with different coefficients than in malicki and walczak 1999 in wilczek et al 2012 it was determined that the l parameter was a linear function of clay content but with r 2 of just 0 56 regarding the ε i and σ i limiting parameters in kargas and kerkides 2018 they were found to be linear functions of clay content while in wilczek et al 2012 ε i was found to be a linear function of sand content and σ i of clay content the correlations between soil properties see tables 1 and 2 and the si model parameters ε i σ i and l obtained in the present study at selected frequencies from the optimal frequency range determined in the previous section were investigated table 3 presents the appropriate correlation coefficients in the examined frequency range the correlation coefficients depended less on the frequency either decreasing or increasing slightly with the frequency depending on the si model parameter the si model parameters calculated at 1 ghz with respect to the selected soil properties are presented in figs 11 and 12 the limiting values ε i and σ i are quite well correlated with the specific surface area and texture parameters with the absolute values of correlation coefficient on the order of 0 8 contrary to the results of malicki and walczak 1999 the l parameter was not found to be significantly correlated with sand content also no significant correlations between l and other texture parameters and specific surface area ssa were found however while examining the relation between l and ssa it was found out that l was significantly correlated with the reciprocal of the specific surface area with the correlation coefficient of about 0 6 also l was found to be correlated with the total organic carbon toc content with correlation coefficient of about 0 56 the dependence of the si model parameters on clay content is depicted in fig 12 the kre soil the one with 17 3 clay content stands out from other tested soils since the l parameter lacks good correlations with soil parameters it was investigated whether the exclusion of the kre soil improves the correlations the results are presented in table 4 generally the exclusion of this soil improved the correlations of l with soil properties the most noticeable improvement is with the density of the solid phase d s from less than 0 4 to over 0 7 however due to generally small variability of this parameter this correlation may be of limited use for field applications based on the examined relations between the si model parameters and the tested soil properties various functions for the si model parameters calculation were tested the tested functions were of the form of polynomials of soil properties the reciprocal of the specific surface area was also included in the analysis the performance of the functions was assessed on the basis of the obtained r 2 rmse and the significance of the variables on the basis of p values the following relations were chosen 9 ε i a 1 ssa a 2 10 σ i b 1 ssa b 2 11 l c 1 ssa c 2 ssa 2 c 3 toc c 4 the coefficients obtained with the use of the linear regression and the regression statistics are presented in table 5 in the examined frequency range there is some frequency dependence of the si model parameters the coefficients of determination are not very high in the 0 63 0 77 range the obtained rmse of the fitting was of about 9 and 5 of the mean value for ε i and l respectively and about 41 of the mean for σ i therefore the application of the determined formula for σ i can introduce significant errors for samples of low electrical conductivity for the best model performance a soil specific calibration is advised 4 conclusions the salinity index model was originally developed with the use of tdr apparent dielectric permittivity measurements in the paper the si model was verified with the use of a data set of 277 complex dielectric permittivity spectra of 14 soils measured in the 0 02 3 ghz frequency range the optimal frequency range of 0 5 2 ghz for the model performance was found based on the rmse cv analysis the salinity index model parameters were obtained and correlated with soil properties statistically significant correlations were found and the optimal formulas for si model parameters calculations were obtained considering the determined optimal frequency range it is advisable to apply the si model with high frequency devices however a soil specific calibration is recommended in order to determine the most accurate si model parameters for a given soil especially if the model is used at frequencies below 500 mhz also a care must be taken in the measurement of dry soil samples since for samples with ε 10 corresponding roughly to volumetric water content smaller than 0 2 significant errors may occur therefore it is not advisable to use the si model to extract soil pore water electrical conductivity if the soil water content is below that threshold the enhancements of the model improving the performance especially at low water contents and broadening the operational frequency range will be the subject of further research acknowledgment funding this

6451,determination of electrical conductivity of soil pore water from measurements of soil bulk electrical conductivity and volumetric water content or dielectric permittivity requires theoretical or empirical models connecting these quantities one such model is the salinity index model which in the original formulation requires the measurement of soil bulk electrical conductivity and apparent dielectric permittivity determined with the time domain reflectometry tdr technique currently many popular soil moisture sensors are operated at a single frequency usually in the low frequency part of the typical tdr bandwidth yet no systematic verification of the salinity index model applied with the use of dielectric permittivity measured at specific frequencies in a broad frequency range has been performed the aim of this paper is to evaluate the salinity index model with the use of dielectric spectra of 277 samples of 14 soils obtained in a 20 mhz 3 ghz frequency range with the use of a coaxial transmission line cell vector network analyzer system a three pole debye model was fitted to the spectra in order to determine bulk electrical conductivity and the real part of dielectric permittivity at chosen frequencies in order to diminish the influence of measurement errors then the salinity index model was applied at each examined frequency and its soil specific parameters were calculated the performance of the model was evaluated with the use of the leave one out cross validation scheme and the frequencies at which the model performed best were found within 0 5 2 ghz range finally the salinity index model parameters obtained at the optimal frequencies were correlated with other soil properties keywords soil dielectric properties vector network analyzer measurements broadband spectra soil pore water electrical conductivity soil salinity index model 1 introduction soil salinity is an important variable e g in environmental research and monitoring and preventing and controlling excessive salinization in agriculture elevated soil salinity levels may be damaging to crops and the risk can be high in dry and coastal areas and for irrigated fields currently standard methods to assess soil salinity without the need of chemical analyses are the measurements of electrical conductivity of saturated extracts or soil water extracts of various proportions most commonly 1 5 w v rhoades et al 1999 visconti et al 2010 however the need of widespread soil salinity characterization requires the use of less laborious and time consuming means one approach is to use remote sensing data abbas et al 2013 or a combination of remote sensing with proximal methods aldabaa et al 2015 in situ measurement of soil bulk electrical conductivity σ b is also attractive since this quantity is measurable by many commercial soil moisture sensors robinson et al 2008 vaz et al 2013 however σ b depends not only on the concentration of solutes but also on various soil properties therefore electrical conductivity of soil pore water σ w is a better indicator of solute concentration rhoades et al 1999 field measurement of σ w can be performed with the use of imbibition type sensors or in lysimeters rhoades et al 1999 electrical conductivity of soil pore water can also be extracted from soil bulk electrical conductivity with the use of theoretical or empirical models connecting these quantities a number of such models have been developed archie 1942 mualem and friedman 1991 rhoades et al 1999 malicki and walczak 1999 amente et al 2000 hilhorst 2000 nadler 2005 muñoz carpena et al 2005 leao et al 2010 lim et al 2017 one of these models is the salinity index model malicki and walczak 1999 which assumes a linear relationship between soil bulk electrical conductivity σ b and bulk dielectric permittivity ε b this is an indirect relationship which is the result of the explicit dependence of electrical conductivity and dielectric permittivity on volumetric water content the slope of the σ b vs ε b indirect relation was linked to soil pore water conductivity σ w to this end a salinity index term si was defined in malicki and walczak 1999 as a partial derivative of bulk electrical conductivity with respect to bulk dielectric permittivity measured with the time domain reflectometry tdr technique 1 si σ b ε b for samples of certain σ w as long as the relation between σ b and ε b is linear si does not depend on ε b and thus it is also independent of moisture content if this condition is satisfied si can be calculated from a single measurement of ε b and σ b with the use of the following formula 2 si σ b σ i ε b ε i where ε i and σ i represent the initial limiting values when the soil is dry enough such that the difference in σ b stemming from the difference in σ w cannot be reliably observed these limits are a consequence of the soil porous structure in order to properly assess σ w from σ b there must be enough water to ensure continuous pathways for electrical current 1 actually rhoades et al 1999 presents a three pathway model of soil bulk electrical conductivity which includes i conduction along the pores filled with the soil pore water of σ w ii conduction along the surfaces of solid particles especially clay minerals coupled in series with the water filled small pores iii conduction through the indurated solid phase which usually can be neglected soil particles surface conductivity contributes in the si model to the residual conductivity σ r see eq 7 in rhoades et al 1999 the volumetric water content of 0 1 m 3 m 3 was provided as a threshold value below which σ w cannot be determined 1 rhoades et al 1999 in malicki and walczak 1999 it was suggested to take the following fixed values 3 ε i 6 2 σ i 8 ms m 1 however in wilczek et al 2012 it was found out that these values depend on soil properties once si is calculated σ w can be determined from the following formula 4 σ w si l where l is the slope of a relation between si and the electrical conductivity of moistening solutions σ s used for calibration of the model based on tdr measurements malicki and walczak 1999 suggested the following empirical relation between the slope l and the sand content s of a given soil 5 l 56 10 4 71 10 6 s the idea of the si model is schematically presented in fig 1 the salinity index model has been developed with the use of tdr measurements currently many commercial soil moisture sensors are capacitance or impedance probes that are operated at a single low frequency usually not higher than 300 mhz vaz et al 2013 oftentimes such sensors measure directly complex relative dielectric permittivity ε ε j ε or just its real part ε at a given frequency also there are ongoing efforts to develop a probe that would measure a wider part of the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum skierucha and wilczek 2010 pelletier et al 2012 szypłowska et al 2016 lewandowski et al 2018 lin et al 2018 one can use the value of ε at a given frequency to calculate si by substituting ε b in eq 2 soil complex dielectric permittivity is frequency dependent and within the frequency range from 20 mhz to several ghz ε can exhibit significant dispersion caused by several overlapping relaxation mechanisms stemming from various interfacial phenomena including bound water relaxation chen and or 2006 wagner et al 2011 these mechanisms depend not only on moisture content and salinity but also on various soil specific properties like the particle size distribution and mineralogy therefore the relation between ε and water content depends on the frequency and on salinity and other properties especially at low frequencies as a consequence the parameters of the si model may also depend on the measurement frequency this was preliminarily confirmed in wilczek et al 2012 where the obtained model parameters differed from malicki and walczak 1999 the salinity index model has been evaluated using various dielectric measurement techniques and devices operating at various frequencies for a range of soils persson 2002 hamed et al 2003 bouksila et al 2008 wilczek et al 2012 scudiero et al 2012 kargas and kerkides 2018 and glass beads szypłowska et al 2017 particularly in kargas and kerkides 2018 the si model was evaluated with the use of the wet sensor operating at 20 mhz and a correction of the model was introduced in order to obtain reliable predictions the existing literature studies utilized different soils measurement equipment and experimental protocols and a custom model calibration was not always performed the aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the si model in the frequency range 20 mhz 3 ghz using samples of 14 soils moistened to various water contents and salinity levels with the use of distilled water and three kcl solutions a total of 277 complex dielectric permittivity spectra of the samples were measured using a coaxial transmission line cell connected to a vector network analyzer firstly for each soil and moistening solution the relation between σ b and ε was examined at each investigated frequency since the linearity of this relation is a key assumption of the salinity index model next the model was calibrated at each frequency and evaluated using the leave one out cross validation scheme based on the validation results the optimal frequency range for which the model predictions exhibited the smallest errors was determined finally the model parameters at the optimal frequencies were correlated with soil properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils a total number of 14 soils were tested in the experiment soil material was air dried and sieved in order to remove stones and gravel the following properties of these soils were characterized particle size distribution total organic carbon content specific surface area solid phase density and ph particle size distribution presented in table 1 was measured using a laser diffractometer mastersizer 2000 with a hydro g dispersion unit uk the stirrer speed was 700 rpm and the pump speed was 1750 rpm the aggregates were dispersed using ultrasounds of 35 w over 4 min the assumed refractive index for soil was 1 52 and the absorption coefficient 0 1 bieganowski et al 2018 the specific surface area measurement was based on the brunauer emmett teller bet nitrogen gas adsorption method with the use of a surface characterization analyzer 3flex micromeritics usa total organic carbon content was determined with the use of a toc v cph analyzer shimadzu corporation japan with solid sample combustion unit ssm 5000a soil ph was measured in water 1 2 5 v v after 24 h stabilization at room temperature solid phase density was measured using a helium pycnometer ultrapyc 1200e v4 01 quantachrome instruments usa the values of the specific surface area total organic carbon content solid phase density and ph are presented in table 2 in order to prepare soil samples for testing air dry soil material was moistened to designated water contents with distilled water of electrical conductivity σ s 2 10 4 sm 1 and three kcl solutions of σ s 0 52 1 02 and 1 50 sm 1 the designated amount of liquid was added to the soil material and thoroughly mixed in order to achieve a uniform moisture distribution for each soil five designated water contents were chosen in order to cover the available moisture range up to saturation therefore with four different salinity levels and five water content levels 20 samples of each soil were prepared which gave 280 separate samples for all 14 soils in total three of these samples were not included in further analysis due to experimental protocol errors giving 277 measured samples in total for each prepared and loaded sample bulk density and volumetric water content were noted 2 2 measurement system each soil sample was loaded into a large diameter coaxial transmission line measurement cell see fig 1 c in lewandowski et al 2017a and b in lewandowski et al 2019 the inner diameter of the outer conductor and the outer diameter of the inner conductor of the cell were 38 8 and 16 9 mm respectively the soil material was supported at both cell ends by two 7 5 mm thick polyoxymethylene pom beads equipped with synthetic rubber o rings in order to prevent the leakage and evaporation during the measurement the position of the supporting beads was adjustable to the loaded sample length which varied from 3 1 to 4 6 cm giving the sample volume from 30 1 to 44 1 cm2 the scattering parameters of the coaxial cell with the loaded sample were measured with the use of a vectorstar ms4642a vna anritsu corporation japan two port vna the large diameter sample cell was connected to precise microwave cables equipped with type n connectors via commercial type n eia15 8 adapters the measurements were performed in the 0 02 3 ghz frequency range prior to the measurements the vna was calibrated with the use of the multiline trl method of marks 1991 using a set of five coaxial transmission lines of various lengths an open circuit standard and a matched load termination lewandowski et al 2017b in order to extend the frequency range of the calibration down to 20 mhz all calibration standards were implemented in the eia 1 5 8 standard as described in lewandowski et al 2017a which allowed us to obtain accurate scattering parameter measurements at reference planes within the large diameter coaxial transmission line cell scattering parameters of the beads supporting the soil samples were measured in the same system and then removed from the cell scattering parameters using the transmission matrix approach lewandowski et al 2017a the dielectric permittivity spectra were extracted from the measured scattering parameters with the use of a nonlinear least squares algorithm taking into account only the transmission parameter lewandowski et al 2019 in this algorithm the implementation of boughriet et al 1997 of the classical nrw method baker jarvis et al 2005 was used to provide a starting point for the nonlinear least squares optimization more details on the experimental setup calibration procedure and dielectric permittivity extraction algorithm were presented in lewandowski et al 2017a lewandowski et al 2017b lewandowski et al 2019 all measurements were done at room temperature ranging from 19 5 to 22 5 c 2 3 data processing and analysis the application of the si model with dielectric spectra data requires the real part of ε at a certain frequency in order to diminish the potential influence of measurement errors soil ε was modeled with the use of a three pole debye model with an added σ b term 6 ε ε i 1 3 δ ε i 1 j ω τ i j σ b ω ε 0 where ω 2 π f f is the measurement frequency ε 0 8 85 10 12 fm 1 is the vacuum permittivity ε is the high frequency dielectric permittivity and δ ε i and τ i are relaxation amplitude and time of an i th pole respectively then ε values were obtained at the frequencies chosen for analysis from 20 mhz to 3 ghz with 10 mhz interval the fitting of eq 6 also enabled determination of σ b from the measured spectra at each examined frequency and for each soil the σ b vs ε relations were investigated for each moistening liquid for all soils and salinity cases the values of si were calculated the frequency dependence of si was examined at all examined frequencies and for all soils the salinity index model parameters were calculated which constituted model calibration the values of the l parameter were obtained from the slopes of the si vs σ s lines the initial limiting values ε i and σ i from eq 2 were calculated from the convergence point of the four lines representing σ b vs ε relations since distilled water and three kcl solutions were used which resulted in four fitted lines the intersection point was calculated for each pair of lines separately and then an arithmetic mean was taken the frequency dependence of the calculated si model parameters was examined data from all 14 soils were analyzed but for the purpose of clarity only results for four soils of various particle size distribution 555 613 kre and orz were presented in detail on the graphs next at each examined frequency the performance of the si model was evaluated with the use of the leave one out cross validation scheme for each soil each moistening solution and at each distinct frequency a measured sample was chosen for evaluation and the rest of the measurements for a given soil were used for model calibration next electrical conductivity of the moistening solution σ s of the sample under question was recovered as argued in malicki and walczak 1999 electrical conductivity of pore water σ w of a sample moistened with a liquid of σ s can be approximated as a sum of σ s and residual electrical conductivity σ r which arises from dissolved ions already present in the soil and electrical conductivity of soil solid phase thus σ s of a given sample was calculated as 7 σ s σ w σ r where σ w is determined from eq 4 with si calculated using eq 2 with the l parameter and limiting values ε i and σ i obtained from the model calibration individual for each sample in the cross validation scheme the residual conductivity was also obtained using eq 4 taking the si limit as σ s 0 which can be calculated as the intersection point on the vertical axis of the si vs σ s relation the cross validation root mean squared error rmse cv was used as a measure of the model performance the results obtained from the cross validation scheme were compared to the results obtained using the original model parameters named si mw model from malicki and walczak 1999 for which appropriate root mean squared error rmse mw was calculated also the dry soil limit of the si model application suggested in malicki and walczak 1999 was examined based on the obtained rmse cv results the optimal frequency range for the application of the si model was determined finally the soil specific si model parameters obtained during model calibration at the optimal frequencies were correlated with soil properties whenever root mean squared error was calculated the following general formula was used 8 rmse i 1 n y i y mi 2 m where y i are the observed known variables y mi are the values obtained from the model n is the number of observations and m is the number of the degrees of freedom specifically in the case of examining the si and si mw model performance during the cross validation m was taken as equal to n and when rmse is calculated during regression analysis m equals the number of observations decreased by the number of the estimated coefficients all calculations were performed with the matlab software environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the model the measurement results comprised a data set of 277 ε spectra of samples of 14 soils of various water content up to saturation moistened with distilled water and three kcl solutions fig 2 presents typical ε spectra of five samples of soil kre moistened with a kcl solution of σ s 1 02 sm 1 the obtained spectra exhibit clear frequency dependence which is especially visible at frequencies below about 200 mhz the three pole debye model fitted to the spectra is also depicted in fig 2 for all measured samples of all tested soils the fitting of eq 6 was accurate with the average root mean squared error of fitting of 0 084 for each soil and at each examined frequency the relations between σ b and ε were linear for each moistening liquid it was observed that for the samples moistened with the kcl solutions the linear regression coefficient of determination r 2 was generally greater than 0 99 with some exceptions mostly at low frequencies for which the lowest r 2 of 0 961 was observed at 20 mhz for σ s 1 02 sm 1 for the measurement series of soil 616 in the case of samples moistened with distilled water for four soils r 2 dropped below 0 9 with the lowest value of 0 78 at 20 mhz for sand orz representative results for selected soils at 500 mhz were presented in fig 3 the slopes of the fitted lines represent si values for given measurement series in accordance to eq 1 these results agree with the previous literature studies kargas and kerkides 2018 wilczek et al 2012 which dealt with the salinity index model applied with the use of dielectric permittivity measured at 20 mhz and 380 440 mhz respectively an r 2 0 96 was reported in these papers for the linear regression of the σ b vs ε relations sand samples moistened with the kcl solution of the lowest applied electrical conductivity were the exception for which a lower value r 2 0 77 was obtained at 20 mhz kargas and kerkides 2018 since ε depends on frequency the values of si also depend on frequency as depicted in fig 4 for the four salinity cases of the four chosen soils generally si increased with the increase in frequency which corresponds to the decrease of ε with an increase in frequency see fig 2 a for an illustration of ε frequency dependence based on presented spectra generally the smallest frequency dependence was observed for the sand soil orz which was caused by the relatively small dielectric dispersion of soils with little clay content in the frequency range of interest since the relations between σ b and ε were observed to be linear si is independent of moisture content and σ w can be calculated from eq 4 the relations between si and the values of moistening solutions electrical conductivity σ s for the four selected soils were presented in fig 5 as seen these relations are also linear in accordance to the si model assumptions with r 2 0 99 there were very few exceptions at low frequencies for which the lowest r 2 0 977 was observed at 20 mhz for soil 558 these results also agree well with kargas and kerkides 2018 2012 where r 2 0 989 was reported since the relations between σ b and ε and between si and σ s are assumed to be linear σ w can be calculated from eq 4 the l parameter present in eq 4 is equal to the slope of the si vs σ s relation and can be determined with the use of the linear regression as a consequence of the si frequency dependence l is also frequency dependent as depicted in fig 6 for the selected soils this parameter also increased with frequency and the sand soil orz displayed little change at frequencies below 2 ghz kargas and kerkides 2018 reported higher values of the l parameter than in malicki and walczak 1999 and in the present study at 20 mhz in scudiero et al 2012 the l parameter values obtained at 70 mhz were also higher than in the present study the span of the values of the l parameter obtained in wilczek et al 2012 where l 0 0074 0 009 roughly corresponds to the span of values obtained in the present study at corresponding frequencies the exception being the most sandy soil in the present study for which l is larger than in wilczek et al 2012 while still lower than in malicki and walczak 1999 the final parameters necessary for the calibration of the si model are the initial limiting values ε i and σ i from eq 2 the results are presented in fig 7 as shown both initial limiting values depend on frequency especially at frequencies below about 400 mhz these values also differ among soils with the malicki and walczak 1999 estimates see eq 3 situated roughly in between the values for sandy and silt loam soils at high frequencies the ε i values obtained from the 20 mhz measurements agree well with kargas and kerkides 2018 for soils with high sand content while for soils with higher clay content ε i values tend to be higher than in kargas and kerkides 2018 also the values of σ i obtained in the present study at 20 mhz are higher than in kargas and kerkides 2018 the differences in both parameters more pronounced in soils with significant clay content may be caused by the correction in dielectric permittivity applied in kargas and kerkides 2018 in scudiero et al 2012 the limiting permittivity and bulk electrical conductivity were found to be constant and set to 7 1 and 0 06 sm 1 respectively the values of ε i obtained in the present paper at corresponding frequencies are also higher than in wilczek et al 2012 especially for soils with low sand content actually in wilczek et al 2012 ε i rises with sand content while in the present study the relation is opposite the values of σ i are higher than in wilczek et al 2012 as well although the difference is smaller than in comparison to kargas and kerkides 2018 it should also be noted that in these other studies kargas and kerkides 2018 scudiero et al 2012 wilczek et al 2012 five soils were tested while in the present study 14 the results pertaining to the si model parameters obtained for all soils are presented explicitly in figs 11 and 12 correlations of these parameters with properties of all tested soils are presented in subsection 3 3 3 2 cross validation of the model the results of σ s recovered for selected soils using the cross validation scheme and with the use of the original malicki and walczak 1999 model parameters for samples with ε 7 at 500 mhz are presented in fig 8 values obtained with the individual model calibration are generally much closer to the true values than with the use of parameters from malicki and walczak 1999 as shown in fig 8 also the salinity index model does not work well for very dry soils which agrees with malicki and walczak 1999 the form of eq 2 indicates that the result could be especially prone to measurement errors if the values of ε b and σ b are close to the limiting values ε i and σ i furthermore the σ b vs ε b relation is nonlinear at very low permittivity values in malicki and walczak 1999 it was recommended to restrict the application of the si model to ε 10 which corresponds to volumetric water content greater than about 0 2 in the present work the root mean squared error of cross validation rmse cv was calculated for a set of samples with i ε 7 and ii ε 10 at all frequencies and the results are presented in fig 9 also in the left column of fig 9 the performance of the si mw model was assessed and root mean squared error rmse mw was calculated for samples with ε 10 at all frequencies as seen in fig 8 and fig 9 the si model individually calibrated for each soil at each frequency performs much better than with the use of original parameters from malicki and walczak 1999 which also confirms the results of kargas and kerkides 2018 obtained at 20 mhz the rmse cv is generally much lower than rmse mw also the si model generally performed better at frequencies higher than 0 2 ghz in the case of si mw model the optimal frequency range significantly differed among the tested soils the inclusion of the lower water content soil samples i e with 7 ε 10 increased the rmse cv values presented in the right column of fig 9 in the insets moreover for three soils there were samples with permittivity and bulk electrical conductivity close to the limiting values of ε i and σ i e g see the most dry samples in fig 3a and b while still satisfying the ε 7 condition these samples exhibited extremely high errors as seen in the large plots in the right column of fig 9 especially at certain frequencies the results confirm the findings of malicki and walczak 1999 where it was found that the model performs best for samples with ε 10 which corresponds to volumetric water content roughly equal to 0 2 therefore the results obtained from the application of the salinity index model for soils of volumetric water content below this threshold might be burdened with errors in order to determine the optimal frequency range of the si model performance for the tested soils for the measurement series of samples of each soil moistened with each solution separately the smallest rmse cv was found rmse cvmin and the frequency at which it occurred next for each measurement series the frequencies were found at which the rmse cv was within two arbitrarily chosen toleration limits i rmse cv 1 2 rmse cvmin and ii rmse cv 1 1 rmse cvmin then the number of measurement series number of cases for which a given frequency was found within those limits was calculated for all tested soils but separately for each moistening liquid 14 measurement series in total for each liquid the maximum number of cases possible and all tested soils and all moistening liquids combined 56 measurement series in total the maximum number of cases possible the results presented in fig 10 show frequencies between 0 5 and 2 ghz having the largest number of cases lower frequencies especially below 300 mhz for the solution of the highest salinity and below 100 mhz for other solutions were rarely found in the optimal performance limits which also confirms the results seen in fig 9 other studies also reported limited accuracy of the si model predictions at frequencies below 100 mhz in kargas and kerkides 2018 satisfactory performance of the salinity index model with dielectric permittivity measured at 20 mhz was demonstrated with moistening solutions of σ s 0 6 sm 1 while in scudiero et al 2012 where dielectric permittivity was measured at 70 mhz the upper bound of pore water electrical conductivity for the si model s satisfactory performance was determined to be at 1 sm 1 in conclusion it can be stated that the optimal frequencies for the salinity index model performance were found in the range 0 5 2 ghz 3 3 salinity index model parameters in kargas and kerkides 2018 the l parameter was found to be a linear function of sand content similar to malicki and walczak 1999 but with values higher than in malicki and walczak 1999 scudiero et al 2012 also found the l parameter to be a linear function of sand content but with different coefficients than in malicki and walczak 1999 in wilczek et al 2012 it was determined that the l parameter was a linear function of clay content but with r 2 of just 0 56 regarding the ε i and σ i limiting parameters in kargas and kerkides 2018 they were found to be linear functions of clay content while in wilczek et al 2012 ε i was found to be a linear function of sand content and σ i of clay content the correlations between soil properties see tables 1 and 2 and the si model parameters ε i σ i and l obtained in the present study at selected frequencies from the optimal frequency range determined in the previous section were investigated table 3 presents the appropriate correlation coefficients in the examined frequency range the correlation coefficients depended less on the frequency either decreasing or increasing slightly with the frequency depending on the si model parameter the si model parameters calculated at 1 ghz with respect to the selected soil properties are presented in figs 11 and 12 the limiting values ε i and σ i are quite well correlated with the specific surface area and texture parameters with the absolute values of correlation coefficient on the order of 0 8 contrary to the results of malicki and walczak 1999 the l parameter was not found to be significantly correlated with sand content also no significant correlations between l and other texture parameters and specific surface area ssa were found however while examining the relation between l and ssa it was found out that l was significantly correlated with the reciprocal of the specific surface area with the correlation coefficient of about 0 6 also l was found to be correlated with the total organic carbon toc content with correlation coefficient of about 0 56 the dependence of the si model parameters on clay content is depicted in fig 12 the kre soil the one with 17 3 clay content stands out from other tested soils since the l parameter lacks good correlations with soil parameters it was investigated whether the exclusion of the kre soil improves the correlations the results are presented in table 4 generally the exclusion of this soil improved the correlations of l with soil properties the most noticeable improvement is with the density of the solid phase d s from less than 0 4 to over 0 7 however due to generally small variability of this parameter this correlation may be of limited use for field applications based on the examined relations between the si model parameters and the tested soil properties various functions for the si model parameters calculation were tested the tested functions were of the form of polynomials of soil properties the reciprocal of the specific surface area was also included in the analysis the performance of the functions was assessed on the basis of the obtained r 2 rmse and the significance of the variables on the basis of p values the following relations were chosen 9 ε i a 1 ssa a 2 10 σ i b 1 ssa b 2 11 l c 1 ssa c 2 ssa 2 c 3 toc c 4 the coefficients obtained with the use of the linear regression and the regression statistics are presented in table 5 in the examined frequency range there is some frequency dependence of the si model parameters the coefficients of determination are not very high in the 0 63 0 77 range the obtained rmse of the fitting was of about 9 and 5 of the mean value for ε i and l respectively and about 41 of the mean for σ i therefore the application of the determined formula for σ i can introduce significant errors for samples of low electrical conductivity for the best model performance a soil specific calibration is advised 4 conclusions the salinity index model was originally developed with the use of tdr apparent dielectric permittivity measurements in the paper the si model was verified with the use of a data set of 277 complex dielectric permittivity spectra of 14 soils measured in the 0 02 3 ghz frequency range the optimal frequency range of 0 5 2 ghz for the model performance was found based on the rmse cv analysis the salinity index model parameters were obtained and correlated with soil properties statistically significant correlations were found and the optimal formulas for si model parameters calculations were obtained considering the determined optimal frequency range it is advisable to apply the si model with high frequency devices however a soil specific calibration is recommended in order to determine the most accurate si model parameters for a given soil especially if the model is used at frequencies below 500 mhz also a care must be taken in the measurement of dry soil samples since for samples with ε 10 corresponding roughly to volumetric water content smaller than 0 2 significant errors may occur therefore it is not advisable to use the si model to extract soil pore water electrical conductivity if the soil water content is below that threshold the enhancements of the model improving the performance especially at low water contents and broadening the operational frequency range will be the subject of further research acknowledgment funding this

6452,increasing water demand aggravates water scarcity in water scarce regions e g india pakistan and china where uneven precipitation increases the risk of maintaining sustainable eco economic development ignoring precipitation s effects leads to misguided policy recommendations that either deplete or underuse basin water resources therefore this paper highlights the concept of uneven precipitation and uncertain stream inflow based on scenario analysis within a river basin the regional authority and subarea managers both have water allocation and reallocation privileges motivated by sustainable development of water resource management systems we argue that regional authorities should focus on alleviating the contradiction between supply and demand and then seeking an optimum allocation strategy to ensure societal and economic benefits for its subareas from which the subareas can provide reasonable reaction strategies authorities dominate water transactions between subareas involved in water rights distribution this paper proposes a multi objective multi stage stackelberg nash cournot m2snc game model to cope with conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers concerning multiple activities an interactive dynamic programming based genetic algorithm idp ga is designed to simulate the policies needed for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios the significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for sancha lake an important area in the southeast basin of the dujiangyan irrigation system in china to identify the tradeoffs among stakeholders we apply the proposed model to this basin to gain further insight into climate change and water usage sustainability we simulate the varying spatial and seasonal distribution of stream inflow based on historical climate data and propose different water management strategies for normal slight drought moderate drought and serious drought conditions this creates an emergency response cooperative mechanism based on different climate scenarios for developing countries that need to cope with water deficiency and uncertain situations keywords water deficiency scenario analysis bi level multi stage water allocation process sustainable development 1 introduction unreasonable water policies have exacerbated the problem of water resources deficiency which is a major obstacle to sustainable water resources management chen et al 2013 around the globe diverse water governances have devoted themselves to implementing measures to ensure healthy and sustainable water resource usage over long periods of time özerol et al 2018 in order to adapt to rapid increases in water demand from the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors fu et al 2018 wang et al 2012 in this paper we develop a balance between water supply and demand for the present and future of a river basin water resources allocation optimization has become more complex than ever before especially when it comes to water resources systems designed for multiple activities such as initial water rights allocation water withdrawal and subsequent water rights transactions wang et al 2008 bekchanov et al 2015 in china the strategic interaction within a water resources system is that the regional authority assigns the original water rights after initial water rights are allocated the rights become personal property that can be traded in water markets for profit or withdrawn for use a water market refers to the water rights trading mechanisms that have become an important economic tool in achieving water resource planning optimization because of improved water use and allocation efficiency after water transactions easter and hearne 1995 in many developing countries such as china the water market is not considered a complete market but rather a quasi market because it cannot be separated from the regional authority s macro control it is vital to take into account the different actors and networks that help formulate and implement water policies araral and yu 2013 araral and wu 2016 combined with the bi level structure of water resources systems regional water resource planning under market mechanisms is a type of stackelberg nash game conflicts exist between regional authorities and subarea managers over water allocation the regional authority in the leading position has the fundamental goal to match the water demand of the socioeconomic system to the supply of the water system through administrative control and management water laws regulations and infrastructure without compromising the ecosystem s sustainability in each subarea dong et al 2013 subarea managers as followers focus on economic utilization increasingly in the last decade regions where demand outstripped water resource availability have suffered from severe chronic shortages particularly when faced with rapid population increases and rapid economic development this competitiveness worsens agricultural water shortages and other serious problems e g agricultural sustainability concerns which most often arise because of poorly planned water management systems in which limited water resources are available to multiple competing users xu and zhou 2011 this has intensified the controversial and conflict laden water allocation issues among multiple competing interests e g municipal industrial and agricultural xie et al 2015 we treat the conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers as a form of leader follower behavior stackelberg 1934 where the conflicts can arrive at a stackelberg nash equilibrium at the upper decision making level nash 1951 considering that subarea managers are independent decision makers and that they have incentives to maximize their own benefits a cournot nash equilibrium should be achieved at the lower decision making level cournot 1838 in this paper we propose an optimal strategy for river basin water allocation by pursuing stackelberg nash and cournot nash equilibria which can be called the stackelberg nash cournot snc equilibrium sherali et al 1983 the snc equilibrium reflects the trade offs in the bi level decision conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers many prior studies have focused on regional water resource planning problems and many models and algorithms have been developed ahmad et al 2018 faqiry and das 2017 fu et al 2018 however regional water resource planning is not only a bi level optimization problem but also a dynamic optimization process as the decision makers in both the upper and lower levels need to make decisions over multiple stages li et al considered ecological water demand and optimized water resources allocation through a multi stage stochastic programming method li et al 2018 chen proved that annual inflow was nonstationary and provided a foundation for water managers who manage water resources under nonstationary and stochastic conditions chen et al 2018 tsai et al proposed an intelligent water allocation system iwas to reduce the water pressure in multiple sectors and enhance the resilience of the water allocation system in urban areas during droughts by using system dynamics tsai et al 2019 zhuang et al uncovered the complexities in water allocation problems where interactions and dynamic relationships exist in a multi stage context zhuang et al 2018 to our best knowledge since water resources distribution is spatially and seasonally uneven water allocation should be divided into multiple stages piao et al 2010 gleick 2002 gleick 2003 vörösmarty et al 2000 wang 2012 most importantly it is appropriate to conceptualize water allocation problems in a bi level multi stage framework that fully considers the interests not only of the regional authority but also the subarea managers unfortunately there are only a few studies that have looked at water management in terms of the combination of bi level optimization and multi stage decision making therefore in this paper we combine bi level optimization with dynamic optimization which largely conforms to realistic practices it is worth noting that within a river basin the upper and lower level decision makers all have multiple objectives in order to optimize their satisfaction economic benefits and water use efficiency when modeling many parameters possess imprecise numerical quantities due to their inherent complexity and stochastic uncertainty it is worth noting that climate change and its impact on water resources is a major challenge that china and the rest of the world will have to cope with in the twenty first century mekanik et al 2016 piao et al 2010 grafton et al 2013 uncertainties in future changes in precipitation prevent analysts from making firm statements about how river flows will respond to climate change this has led to uncertain water supplies in different river basins which increased the stress on regional authorities and subarea managers in this case we applied scenario based analysis to consider the influence of various stream inflows as we know scenarios can address a broad range of what if questions such as what if a minor drought occurs what if a severe drought occurs therefore we examined four stream flow patterns and a detailed regional water allocation scenario analysis using the proposed model this paper aspires to contribute to the discussion about regional water resource planning by constructing a bi level multi stage decision making model with multiple lower level decision makers accompanied by a scenario based analysis and by obtaining solutions that optimize both total benefits to society and economic benefits for each subarea i e to satisfy the upper and lower objectives the bi level multi stage decision making method proposed in this paper creates a greater motivation to save water and alleviates the contradiction between supply and demand by introducing a water rights concept and a water market in more complex circumstances that include multiple decision makers on the lower level there is a set of scenarios that describes several possible stream flow patterns for the sancha lake area water resource allocation problem which is more suitable for describing the uncertain environment encountered in real life regional water resource planning when actual representations are available the regional water resource planning problem can be solved more realistically this paper develops an idp ga to solve the model and presents the results and analysis for the sancha lake area to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the key issues in defining the water resource allocation problem in the min river basin and details the modelling approach for the establishment of a bi level multiple objective multi stage decision making model to describe the water resource allocation problem then it develops an idp ga for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios section 3 presents the results and describes an early warning system section 4 summaries the different water allocation strategies under varying stream inflow levels and discusses some policy implications finally section 5 gives some concluding remarks and points to future research possibilities 2 material and methods 2 1 motivation of developmental issues in study area sancha lake reservoir see the right side of fig 1 the farthest and last important node in the dujiangyan irrigation system is located in the eastern foot of longquan near chengdu which is 40 km to the northwest and has 27 square kilometers of open lakes based on its geographical location the tianfu new plan divides the sancha lake area into three subareas the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area the tianfu new plan provides a broad context requiring a water supply management plan to be set up under the government s water strategy the future water resources allocation and planning for the dujiangyan irrigation system area of min river basin in the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 this strategy acknowledges the pressure on future water resources from population growth and housing and climate change traditional water resource allocation plans cannot deal with water demand conflicts in different subareas and thus many problems related to equity efficiency and sustainability have arisen considering the developmental issues above the general aim of this study is to establish an integrated water resource management plan for the sancha lake area in order to achieve both economic and ecological sustainability here we focus on the idea of sustainable water resources allocation in a river basin and analyze the characteristics of the sancha lake area in the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district in the min river basin of china 2 2 conceptual framework bi level multistage water resource allocation before formulating a mathematical model we first constructed a conceptual framework xu and zeng 2013 the sancha lake area committee is the upper level decision maker at each stage the total available water from the sancha lake area is considered a state variable the decision maker on the upper level allocates water rights to different subareas and stores the upstream water in the reservoir the lower level decision maker is the subarea water manager each subarea has a reservoir to store its water and it can trade water in the water market under government regulation the water input for each subarea includes the water obtained from the regional authority the water bought in the water market under government control and the water stored in the subarea reservoir water availability is a key factor in local area development and increased demand for water by the agricultural industrial and municipal sectors increases pressure for equitable allocation at each stage each subarea water manager allocates water to industrial municipal and agricultural water users municipal water use includes residential use drinking water tourist use and municipal services industrial water supplies the chemical food papermaking mechatronics and construction industries agricultural water use includes water for irrigation livestock fisheries and forests it is worth noting that the water resource allocation decision making process is considered a multistage decision making process the entire decision making process is divided into several stages with decision making required in each stage in a multistage decision making process the decisions made in a previous stage influence the state of the next stage xu et al 2013c xu and zeng 2014 as a result the decision maker needs to not only consider the situation in the current stage but also have a full understanding of the influence of the current state on the next stage to optimize decisions over the entire decision making process for the sancha lake area water resource allocation the length of each stage is one month the multistage decision making state transit mechanism for the upper and lower levels is explained in the following 2 3 model proposition a bi level multiple objective multistage programming model is constructed the entire model is composed of the lower and upper level objectives constraints and state transit equations 2 3 1 fundamental assumptions before constructing the model the following assumptions are involved 1 all available water for distribution is provided by a single river basin 2 the sancha lake area committee in the upper level and each subarea manager on the lower level make rational decisions cooperatively to avoid an unsatisfactory situation 3 each decision maker on the upper and lower levels fully understands the objective functions and the inherent constraints each subarea manager on the lower level behaves rationally 4 when the water withdrawal of a subarea is more than its assigned initial water right and the stored water it needs to buy water from the water market under government control conversely it can sell extra water on the water market under government control 5 the total stream flow volume in the river basin is considered a fuzzy random variable with attributes statistically determined using historical data and professional experience which has to be further changed to a deterministic variable 2 3 2 notation 1 subscripts i index of subarea in the river basin where i 1 2 n k index of water user in the subarea where k 1 2 m t index of stages for the regional water resources planning

lower level decision maker three subarea managers seek adequate water to maximize their satisfaction degree and economic benefit in accordance with the sancha lake area committee water rights allocation decisions objective 1 maximize the minimal sectoral satisfaction degree at the lower level each subarea manager distributes water to industrial water users municipal water users and agricultural water users respectively first a satisfaction degree function of each water user is defined below f ikt y ik t 0 y ik t i ik min t y ik t i ik min t i ik max t i ik min t i ik min t y ik t i ik max t 1 y ik t i ik max t the satisfaction degree functions assume that for each sector in each stage there is a basic minimal water use volume denoted by i ik min t as well as a water use maximal volume denoted by i ik max t that is if the water withdrawal volume is reduced to less than i ik min t the satisfaction degree reduces to zero 0 thus if the water withdrawal volume increases to more than i ik max t the satisfaction degree cannot increase to more than one 1 each subarea manager i e the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area wants to maximize the minimal satisfaction degree in each stage for each water user at each subarea thus 1 max y min k t f ikt y ik t for k 1 2 3 and t 1 2 t objective 2 maximize the economic utility to measure the lower level subarea economic performance the economic utility function is employed the subarea economic benefit is k 1 m t 1 t b ik t y ik t and the subarea economic investment is k 1 m t 1 t tax k y ik t p bsw i t bsw i t thus the economic utility function can be expressed as 2 u i y ik t bsw i t k 1 m t 1 t b ik t y ik t k 1 m t 1 t tax k y ik t p bsw i t bsw i t the water manager also wants to maximize each subarea s economic utility i e sancha area xinmin area and dongjiageng area as shown below 3 max y u i y ik t bsw i t for i 1 2 n although the water market is not a completely competitive market coase 1960 as it is controlled by the government market prices are still influenced by the relationship between supply and demand within a reasonable range namely the price rises when demand is greater than supply conversely the price drops according to a theoretical analysis of the oligarch competition model easter and hearne 1995 the water rights transaction price function in a water market under government control can be expressed as 4 p bsw i t κ σ i 1 n bsw i t where i 1 n bsw i t represents the total available water for trading in the water market in stage t bsw i t is the volume of water bought and bsw i t is the volume of water sold κ and σ are the positive parameters lower level constraints state transit of stored water the state transit equation describes the relationship between the decision and state variables in each stage xu et al 2013c for the lower level decision makers the stored water is considered a state variable the input water of a subarea includes the current stored water the allocated water rights from the sancha lake area committee and the traded water in the water market under government control so then the state transit equation for the lower level is 5 s i t 1 s i t k 1 m y ik t x i t bsw i t initial and terminal conditions of stored water the initial and terminal conditions describe the stored water level at the beginning and at the end of the whole decision making procedure 6 s i 1 s i 0 and s i t 1 s i t 1 constraints on stored water the volume of the stored water in each subarea has a maximal limitation i e s i max and should be nonnegative 7 0 s i t s i max wherein zero 0 excludes minimal environmental reservation for livestock and ecological water usage constraints on water withdrawal there are also nonnegative constraints on the decision variable y ik t because the water withdrawal of user k in subarea i in stage t cannot be nonnegative 8 y ik t 0 2 3 4 upper level decision making process as the upper level decision maker the sancha lake area committee considers equity efficiency and sustainability among the three subareas when making the water rights allocation decisions hence three objective functions are considered objective 1 maximize the minimal social satisfaction degree the sancha lake area committee needs to create a plan to effectively allocate the water supply to the subareas to maximize the minimal social satisfaction degree in each subarea i e sancha area xinmin area and dongjiageng area the social satisfaction degree for each subarea is defined by the function 9 g it x i t 0 x i t l i min t x i t l i min t l i max t l i min t l i min t x i t l i max t 1 x i t l i max t the social satisfaction degree function assumes that for each subarea there is a basic minimal volume of water allocated and maximal water use that is if the water allocation volume is less than l i min t the satisfaction degree for that subarea is reduced to zero 0 however if the water allocation volume increases to be more than l i max t the satisfaction degree of that subarea cannot increase to more than one 1 as a result the objective function for the social satisfaction degree is to maximize the minimal social satisfaction degree 10 max x min i t g it x i t objective 2 maximize the water availability to guarantee water resource allocation efficiency in the upper level the sancha lake area committee wants to maximize the water availability level for the whole river basin 11 max x w x i t where the water availability level is defined as w x i t i 1 n t 1 t x i t t 1 t a t ξ t objective 3 maximize the total economic benefit the total economic benefit got from user k in subarea i is defined as 12 q y ik t i 1 n k 1 m t 1 t b ik t y ik t obviously the goal of the upper level decision maker is to maximize the benefit namely 13 max y q y ik t upper level constraints constraints on water trading the water can only be traded among the subareas in the river basin in the water market under government control when bsw i t is positive water is bought and when bsw i t is negative water is sold the following equations clearly show the volume of water bought and sold in the market 14 bsw i t bsw i t bsw i t and bsw i t bsw i t 0 where bsw i t 0 is the volume of water bought and bsw i t 0 is the volume of water sold for each stage therefore the sum of all the bought and sold water should be zero 0 15 i 1 n bsw i t bsw i t 0 the volume of water sold in each stage for subarea i cannot exceed the allocated water rights 16 bsw i t x i t constraints on water allocation there are also nonnegative constraints on the decision variable x i t because the initial water rights for each subarea in each stage cannot be negative 17 x i t 0 the volume of the available water in the sancha lake area has a maximal limitation i e a max and cannot be negative 18 0 a t a max where zero 0 excludes the minimal environmental reservation for livestock and ecological water usage state transit of total available water for the upper level decision maker the total available water is considered a state variable multistage decision making is actually a discrete dynamic process the sancha lake area output water is the allocated water rights to the subareas so the state transit equation for the upper level is as below 19 a t 1 a t i 1 n x i t ξ t initial and terminal conditions for total available water the initial and terminal conditions describe the available water level at the beginning and at the end of the complete decision making process as shown below 20 a 1 a 0 and a t 1 a t 1 2 4 the global model m2snc model there is an interactive relationship between the upper and lower level decision makers the regional authority on the upper level i e the leader makes decisions regarding the initial water rights of the subareas to guarantee equity and efficiency and the followers or lower level decision makers are the subarea managers who decide on the volume of water withdrawal that maximizes satisfaction and economic benefits this relationship can be described as a multi objective multi stage stackelberg nash cournot m2snc problem the state transit equations eqs 5 and 19 describe a dynamic decision making process where the available water in the sancha lake area and the stored water in the reservoirs in each subarea is regarded as a state variable the constraints on the decision variables as well as the initial and terminal conditions restrict the water resource allocation to within feasible limits the objective functions for the two level decision makers as shown in eqs 1 3 10 11 and 13 reflect the multiple goals and conflicts over decisions between the sancha lake area committee and the subarea water managers by integrating the state transit equations constraints initial and terminal conditions and objective functions the m2snc model for optimizing the bi level multiple objective multi stage water resource allocation in the

0 2 5 idp ga solution procedure the proposed model 21 provides the sancha lake area committee with an efficient tool to cope with the realistic stresses resulting from unreasonable water resource allocation however the inherently complicated environment with a changing climate increasing population size and growing economic development usually requires the proposed model to dynamically fit various scenarios hence a procedure for policy simulation based on an idp ga is designed to simulate the optimal strategies for the water resource allocation and further assist each level of authority to develop efficient policies using the idp ga under various climate change scenarios to investigate the impact of climate change on the sancha lake area water resource allocation some scheduling principles for water resource allocation and a framework for the policy simulation are presented this simulation is similar to but not the same as the computable general equilibrium cge model johansen and zabel 1962 which originated from leontief s input output system leontief 1936 an efficient tool to simulate how an economy might react to changes in policy technology or other external factors by developing a series of equations describing model variables the framework for the overall idp based ga procedure the bi level multiple objective regional water resource planning problem is shown in fig 2 and the pseudo code is shown in appendix ii this procedure integrates interactive dynamic programming into a genetic algorithm idp ga to satisfy the four situations bi level structure multiple objectives multiple stages and twofold uncertainty proposed in the model for the sancha lake area water resource allocation 3 results the proposed optimization method has been developed to deal with development issues in the sancha lake area irrigation district in the min river basin 3 1 data collection and parameters determination data collection was conducted by studying the historical data archive and suggestions from experts and was then dealt with using policy and parameter framework principles in the sancha lake area irrigation district the three subareas i e i 1 2 3 representing the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area respectively mainly supply water to three types of water users k 1 2 3 with k 1 for municipal users k 2 for agricultural users and k 3 for industrial users detailed information for the sancha lake area regional authority on the upper level and the subarea managers on the lower level is shown in tables 1 8 the stream inflow in the t th month is shown in table 4 the minimal and maximal satisfaction limitation parameters for the allocated water rights and the stored water parameters in the subareas have been shown in tables 5 and 6 the initial stored quantity at the beginning of january and the final stored quantity at the end of december for the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area are listed below s 1 1 5000 s 1 13 5000 s 2 13 5000 s 2 13 5000 s 3 13 4000 s 3 13 4000 the idp ga based simulation parameters are set from the results of the preliminary experiments that were conducted to observe the behavior of the algorithm at different parameter settings by comparing several sets of parameters including population size i e n 25 iteration number i e i 500 crossover probability i e p c 0 2 and mutation probability i e p m 0 4 the most reasonable parameters are chosen to trade off between the evaluation time and population size kim and ellis 2008 the program was run 10 times on a core i 5 3 20 ghz clock pulse with 4 gb memory 3 2 allocation solution with a normal stream flow if rainfall is relatively adequate all year round then the upstream is able to provide the downstream with enough water in most months then the upper decision maker namely the sancha lake committee considers the lower decision maker s requirements under some essential constraints and their optimum reaction duties table 9 shows the allocation strategy for the subareas fig 3 exhibits the degree of satisfaction and economic utility of the three subareas more than 80 of the months of degree of satisfaction are greater than the reference level of 0 903 in both the sancha and xinmin areas similarly more than 80 of the months of the degree of satisfaction are in the reference interval 0 732 0 903 in the dongjiageng area based on the results we suggest that the upper decision maker namely the sancha lake committee would only need to consider the equity and efficiency of the water resources allocation in order to ensure that the whole basins development is balanced the dongjiageng area would need to formulate efficient measures to cope with a lack of water in some periods for example by ensuring that there is a full reservoir in advance or instructing locals to use less water 3 3 early warning mechanism as a consequence of the increased frequency of droughts and societal vulnerability to extended periods of water deficiency the economic social and environmental impact of droughts has increased significantly worldwide traditionally the response to drought throughout the world has been through a reactive risk management approach this approach to drought management responds to a drought once it occurs in an attempt to improve and accelerate the recovery process before that the subarea needs to propose reasonable reference levels that activate different early warning mechanisms the reference level is calculated according to the following principles first put the normal annual stream inflow of 44 41 million m3 into the proposed model then obtain the reference satisfaction interval 0 903 1 which is considered the reference interval for normal status blue response mechanism brm second given a stream flow of 42 61 44 41 million m3 into the proposed model one obtains the reference satisfaction interval 0 732 0 903 which is considered the slight drought reference interval yellow early warning mechanism yewm third given a stream flow of 39 97 42 61 million m3 into the proposed model one obtains the reference satisfaction interval 0 497 0 732 which is considered the moderate drought reference interval orange early warning mechanism oewm fourth the satisfaction interval 0 0 497 is considered to be the serious drought reference interval red early warning mechanism rewm finally if 80 of the subarea degrees of satisfaction fall into the interval a warning graphic as shown in fig 4 with different colors is created to assist decision makers in responding accurately as shown in fig 5 both the sancha and the xinmin areas are in the brm however in the dongjiageng area the yewm would be activated the reason the dongjiageng area has a different response mechanism than the sancha and xinmin areas is due to their different industrialization levels as is often the case agricultural and municipal water use took place prior to industrialized use of the water the dongjiageng area is the most industrialized region of the three subareas so the sancha lake committee satisfies the agricultural region namely the sancha area and the municipal region namely the xinmin area first when there is a slight lack of water it should also be noted that there are usually no large differences in satisfaction between the various subareas because of sufficient rainfall every month if a subarea encounters a shortage in certain months the committee transfers the water rights from another subarea through economic compensation 4 discussion a long term view of the analysis of the sustainable development of water needs to account for fundamental uncertainties resulting from both a limited understanding of the situation and natural stochastic changes the following section focuses on scenario analysis under changing climate conditions by qualifying stream flow sources these scenarios represent important factors and processes which have an important role in determining water resource dynamics in a changing climate 4 1 climate scenarios determination drought is a multidimensional natural hazard that occurs because of natural climate variability and it is a recurring phenomenon in many areas of the world but its features vary from region to region there are three main drought definitions meteorological hydrological and agricultural wilhite and glantz 1985 we have used the hydrological definition to distinguish the climate scenarios in the sancha lake area s archive of historical weather climate data and station history information from the quality controlled data for the daily monthly seasonal and yearly temperature precipitation wind measurements radar data and dujiangyan irrigation system drainage functions we simulated four climate scenarios for the sancha lake area 1 normal climate when the stream flow is greater than 44 41 million m 3 per year 2 slight drought when the stream flow is around 42 61 44 41 million m 3 per year 3 moderate drought when the stream flow is 39 97 42 61 million m 3 per year and 4 severe drought when the stream flow is less than 39 97 million m3 per year 4 1 1 scenario 1 slight drought s1 drought has been an issue since the beginning of recorded history the sancha lake area committee usually considers there to be a slight drought if the annual stream flow falls into the interval of 42 61 44 41 million m3 as an input parameter it is usually considered to be a fuzzy random number a slight drought results in a slight reduction in the water resource allocation to the downstream subareas leading to a decrease in both subarea economic utility and degrees of satisfaction table 10 from fig 6 the xinmin area issues an oewm and the sancha and dongjiageng areas issue a yewm this means that in 80 of the months the degree of satisfaction of the sancha and dongjiageng areas falls into the reference interval 0 732 0 903 and in more than 80 of the months the degree of satisfaction in the dongjiageng area is in the reference interval 0 497 0 732 in this scenario efficient policies need to be developed the sancha lake area committee needs to design a reasonable coordination mechanism to improve water resource transactions for example financial subsidies could be paid to the subareas at a minimum satisfaction level or non affected areas could be encouraged to transfer some water rights to the oewm subarea the subarea suffering from the slight drought would need to expand their approach to water withdrawal such as using ground water above all the authority should efficiently allocate water resources and the subarea should use the water efficiently 4 1 2 scenario 2 moderate drought s2 the sancha lake area is an irrigation region where agriculture continues to be a major sector for most local economies with 69 of the local economic utility derived from agricultural production especially in the sancha and xinmin areas because the water supply plays a key role in the development of the local agricultural sector the sancha lake area committee usually considers the areas situation under a moderate drought a moderate drought results in a moderate reduction of water resource allocation to the downstream subareas resulting in a decrease in the subareas local economic utility and degrees of satisfaction table 11 from fig 6 it can be seen that in 80 of the months the degree of satisfaction for the sancha and xinmin areas falls into the reference interval 0 497 0 732 and 0 0 497 for the dongjiageng area reference interval hence the sancha and xinmin areas would issue an oewm and the dongjiageng area would issue a rewm the sancha and xinmin areas are agriculture intensive and use most of their water resources for irrigation the local authority usually priorities these areas and provides them with the water they need to satisfy their net irrigation requirements nevertheless widespread and continuing stress on water resources increases the risk that simultaneous water shortages might occur around the world and could even trigger a regional water crisis in this scenario certain strategies need to be employed to cope with a moderate drought to ensure agricultural production technological intervention can be critical for example smaller and minor irrigation schemes with better land use could be developed to enhance soil moisture and water retention and even cloud seeding induced rainfall using solidified carbon dioxide or finely powdered sodium chloride could be a technological measure that alleviates the impact of a moderate drought above all applying new and improved techniques is an efficient way to combat drought 4 1 3 scenario 3 serious drought s3 if a serious drought occurs it would be an extremely difficult situation for the sancha lake area with some of the worst results being regional economic downturns food shortages or social conflict at an annual stream flow of less than 39 97 million m3 the sancha lake area committee would consider this a serious situation that would result in a rapid fall in water resources allocated to downstream subareas resulting in a decrease in the subarea s local economy utility and degrees of satisfaction table 12 following fig 6 all subareas would issue an rewm indicating that the degree of satisfaction in 80 of the months in the three subareas would fall into the reference interval 0 0 497 in this scenario since agricultural and municipal water supplies take precedence over industrial water needs measures can be developed to cope with a serious drought situation groundwater would need to be used wisely and cloud seeding would be applied as and when necessary 4 2 guarantee degree level in addition reasonable evaluation criteria would need to be developed to measure the guaranteed water supply degree level for both the sancha lake area committee and the subarea managers for the sancha lake area committee the guaranteed water supply degree level is defined below to measure the extent to which available water resources can be allocated to those subareas sgr u t a t ξ t i 1 m x i ref t where x i ref t is the reference value of the normal demand of subarea i in period t table 9 for the manager of subarea i the guaranteed water supply degree level is defined below to measure the extent to which available water resources can be allocated to different production activities sgr i l t s i t x i t bsw i t k 1 m y ik ref t where y ik ref t is the reference value of the normal demand of user k of subarea i in period t table 9 the guaranteed degree levels reflect the regulation effect of the reservoirs the larger the guaranteed degree the greater the capability of the sancha lake basin to fight against drought as the fluctuation of the upper reservoir is greater than the lower reservoir the upper reservoir controls the regulatory level and the lower reservoir controls the guaranteed level fig 7 furthermore the lower reservoir has a smaller fluctuation because the allocated upper level water resources are used first in every period the guaranteed degrees under the four scenarios are close which confirms the guaranteed level of the reservoir therefore the guaranteed degree can be considered an index reflecting the level of the reservoir but it is not a suitable early warning index although the degree concept is more intuitive for managerial operations 4 3 policy implication linking jian yang s regional plan on sustainable development goals total water consumption control water conservation and efficient use water resource allocation and water supply security we aim to summarize the policy implications and underscore the roles of the bi level stakeholders namely the sancha lake area committee and the subarea managers proposition 1 the government establishes an emergency response cooperative mechanism for each subarea according to the simulation results under the various climate change scenarios an emergency response cooperative mechanism can be constructed by the comparative analysis of objective functions under different scenarios as seen in tables 13 14 fig 8 shows the different early warning mechanisms under varying annual stream inflow scenarios the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district is devoted to building an intelligent water management system by combining technology modernization and sustainable development the 4 level early warning mechanism for drought scenarios in this river basin has been successfully designed the macro control policy has been formulated for the irrigation areas industrial usage and dynamic residential water usage strategies when it comes to implementation different strategies need to be employed to cope with slight moderate and serious droughts under the slight drought condition the sancha lake area committee could design a reasonable coordination mechanism to improve water resource transactions for example financial subsidies can be paid to the subareas with a minimum satisfaction level or unaffected areas could be encouraged to transfer some water rights to the oewm subarea under the moderate drought condition technological interventions should be adopted that are an efficient way to combat drought under the serious drought situation other types of water resources can be taken into consideration e g groundwater virtual water in addition to improving the irrigation technology proposition 2 the sancha lake area committee should consider apply for special permanent water rights coping with increasing water demand proposition 3 the sancha lake area committee should consider applying for special permanent water rights to cope with increasing water demand since china became a member of the wto the sancha lake area has rapidly developed increasing its water use demands to save water and to reduce the chance of water shortages a stepped water price mechanism for different industrial uses was suggested but neither the sancha lake area committee nor the dujiangyan administration bureau had the right of revision therefore to lessen the impact of water shortages resulting from the increase in demand from the recent implementation of the tianfu new plan the sancha lake area committee was required to apply for special permanently increased water rights rather than applying for temporary water rights every year at the hearing for the new dujiangyan irrigation system water resources allocation plan at the beginning of the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 in preparation for this hearing the dujiangyan administration bureau called on all committees to submit their water resource allocation requirements as a benchmark for the sancha lake area committee water resource allocation plan a set of integrated alternatives were discussed along with the water rights application handed out by the dujiangyan administration bureau to other areas as planning guidelines which included the following operating schedule strategies 1 the committee controls the water rights unifies the water resource allocation operating schedule and executes the prescribed management needs which would allow the subareas to distribute water for municipal industrial and agricultural uses 2 the committee guarantees the use of water for irrigation residential and industrial use while also paying attention to ecological and wider varied water usage needs 3 the committee draws up a water usage contract with the subareas that outlines the charges and fees for water use water trading between subareas is encouraged but supervised by the committee proposition 4 the subarea managers should consider water quota transactions and water saving and water usage efficiency improvements the subareas are required to do business under a fixed total water quota and are also required to save water wherever possible the productive use of water should be improved by a rational application of technology and economics and by logical decision making for industrial and municipal water use water use efficiency can be improved through technological innovations new policies and simple operational improvements for agricultural water use efficient irrigation technologies need to be employed to boost food production while working with a limited water supply for example precision irrigation soil moisture monitoring and the laser leveling of fields have the potential to double the output per unit of water for many crops 4 4 findings and feedbacks the bi level dynamic equilibrium decision based water resources allocation model has been employed in three subareas made up of a total of 41 towns and villages in the sancha lake area during 2011 2012 the committee allocated water rights optimally for around 6 687 hectares of irrigation more than 50 key enterprises and a population of almost 56 000 people achieving a sustainable utilization of water resources in the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district with strong practicability operability and a wide range of applications the model for water resources allocation can be applied to each subarea of the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district this research applied a qualitative technique a team of eight water governance officials and scholars gathered to describe their findings and give feedback after a real world practice process that was collaboratively designed and executed all members participated in regular meetings to discuss the results of the water allocation strategy solved by the proposed model and they gathered the following points 1 the mechanism of dynamic water rights trading can overcome the difficulty of uneven annual inflows the committee controlled the water rights unified the operations schedule for the water resources allocation and executed the prescribed management systems that allowed the subareas themselves to distribute the water for municipal industrial and agricultural uses in the sancha lake area based on the macro control of upstream flow by the administration bureau of the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district the committee overcame the difficulty of uneven annual inflows dominated the dynamic trading of water rights optimized the equilibrium allocation of water resources and balanced the water supply in the sancha lake area 2 quota management is effective in the sancha irrigation area the committee adopted policies that allocated water volumes to subareas in the sancha lake area under fixed total volume and controlled through quota management the subareas were required to make a contract with the committee and were charged strict fees according to the contract the committee first guaranteed residential water use promoted agricultural water saving irrigation techniques and identified water saving requirements for the production value of increased industrial water use while paying attention to both ecological and various other water uses naturally they are also fully committed to the sustainable allocation of water resources in the sancha lake area 5 conclusions the significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for sancha lake an important area in the southeast basin of the dujiangyan irrigation system in china because of the possibility of unpredictable water availability in the min river basin a multi objective multi stage stackelberg nash cournot model was proposed to allocate water resources optimally on the basis of water rights distribution the goals of the upper level authority the sancha lake area committee were to optimize the total social degrees of satisfaction and water availability levels the goals of the three lower level subareas were the degrees of satisfaction for the available water resources and economic benefits compared to previous studies this multi objective multi stage decision making process considered bi level optimization and two types of state transit equations were established for the upper and lower levels in order to optimize their water resource planning dynamically to solve the complex and nonlinear bi level multi objective multi stage decision making model a policy simulation system with an idp ga was designed to create the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios finally the results under four climate change scenarios were presented to demonstrate how efficient water resources allocation could be prescribed the proposed model was applied to optimally allocate water resources and evaluate the effects of several climate scenarios in a river basin in china the dujiangyan basin first under normal stream inflows some important insights were obtained 1 the m2snc model is an efficient tool for tackling this type of problem in complex situations and it provides an efficient allocation mechanism to dynamically cope with potential water crises 2 the subareas were able to develop real time storage production strategies based on the water rights they obtained and available water as regulated by the authority 3 irrigation and municipal water were guaranteed as the upper authority gave priority to areas with major agricultural production and larger populations second according to the simulation results under the various climate change scenarios we can suggest several policy implications for the decision process for example an emergency response cooperative mechanism should be established by the government for each subarea and the sancha lake area committee should consider applying for special permanent water rights to cope with increasing water demand to increase its credibility a group of government officials and scholars were called together to analyze the results of the proposed model in the sancha lake area which confirmed that the mechanism of dynamic trading of water rights can overcome the difficulty of uneven annual inflows and that quota management is effective in the sancha irrigation area according to the third plenary session of the 18th central committee of the chinese communist party it is the government s responsibility to develop a complete market mechanism and to formulate policies to promote and support the reformation of water rights allocation the proposed model can be extended to the world marketplace including developing nations other more complicated situations such as the cat and mouse game played out between lower level decision makers and other uncertain factors integrated on the upper level still need to be modeled to determine the optimum water allocation for realistic problems from a policymaking perspective a reasonable pricing strategy and a transactional code of conduct are provided in the

6452,increasing water demand aggravates water scarcity in water scarce regions e g india pakistan and china where uneven precipitation increases the risk of maintaining sustainable eco economic development ignoring precipitation s effects leads to misguided policy recommendations that either deplete or underuse basin water resources therefore this paper highlights the concept of uneven precipitation and uncertain stream inflow based on scenario analysis within a river basin the regional authority and subarea managers both have water allocation and reallocation privileges motivated by sustainable development of water resource management systems we argue that regional authorities should focus on alleviating the contradiction between supply and demand and then seeking an optimum allocation strategy to ensure societal and economic benefits for its subareas from which the subareas can provide reasonable reaction strategies authorities dominate water transactions between subareas involved in water rights distribution this paper proposes a multi objective multi stage stackelberg nash cournot m2snc game model to cope with conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers concerning multiple activities an interactive dynamic programming based genetic algorithm idp ga is designed to simulate the policies needed for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios the significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for sancha lake an important area in the southeast basin of the dujiangyan irrigation system in china to identify the tradeoffs among stakeholders we apply the proposed model to this basin to gain further insight into climate change and water usage sustainability we simulate the varying spatial and seasonal distribution of stream inflow based on historical climate data and propose different water management strategies for normal slight drought moderate drought and serious drought conditions this creates an emergency response cooperative mechanism based on different climate scenarios for developing countries that need to cope with water deficiency and uncertain situations keywords water deficiency scenario analysis bi level multi stage water allocation process sustainable development 1 introduction unreasonable water policies have exacerbated the problem of water resources deficiency which is a major obstacle to sustainable water resources management chen et al 2013 around the globe diverse water governances have devoted themselves to implementing measures to ensure healthy and sustainable water resource usage over long periods of time özerol et al 2018 in order to adapt to rapid increases in water demand from the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors fu et al 2018 wang et al 2012 in this paper we develop a balance between water supply and demand for the present and future of a river basin water resources allocation optimization has become more complex than ever before especially when it comes to water resources systems designed for multiple activities such as initial water rights allocation water withdrawal and subsequent water rights transactions wang et al 2008 bekchanov et al 2015 in china the strategic interaction within a water resources system is that the regional authority assigns the original water rights after initial water rights are allocated the rights become personal property that can be traded in water markets for profit or withdrawn for use a water market refers to the water rights trading mechanisms that have become an important economic tool in achieving water resource planning optimization because of improved water use and allocation efficiency after water transactions easter and hearne 1995 in many developing countries such as china the water market is not considered a complete market but rather a quasi market because it cannot be separated from the regional authority s macro control it is vital to take into account the different actors and networks that help formulate and implement water policies araral and yu 2013 araral and wu 2016 combined with the bi level structure of water resources systems regional water resource planning under market mechanisms is a type of stackelberg nash game conflicts exist between regional authorities and subarea managers over water allocation the regional authority in the leading position has the fundamental goal to match the water demand of the socioeconomic system to the supply of the water system through administrative control and management water laws regulations and infrastructure without compromising the ecosystem s sustainability in each subarea dong et al 2013 subarea managers as followers focus on economic utilization increasingly in the last decade regions where demand outstripped water resource availability have suffered from severe chronic shortages particularly when faced with rapid population increases and rapid economic development this competitiveness worsens agricultural water shortages and other serious problems e g agricultural sustainability concerns which most often arise because of poorly planned water management systems in which limited water resources are available to multiple competing users xu and zhou 2011 this has intensified the controversial and conflict laden water allocation issues among multiple competing interests e g municipal industrial and agricultural xie et al 2015 we treat the conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers as a form of leader follower behavior stackelberg 1934 where the conflicts can arrive at a stackelberg nash equilibrium at the upper decision making level nash 1951 considering that subarea managers are independent decision makers and that they have incentives to maximize their own benefits a cournot nash equilibrium should be achieved at the lower decision making level cournot 1838 in this paper we propose an optimal strategy for river basin water allocation by pursuing stackelberg nash and cournot nash equilibria which can be called the stackelberg nash cournot snc equilibrium sherali et al 1983 the snc equilibrium reflects the trade offs in the bi level decision conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers many prior studies have focused on regional water resource planning problems and many models and algorithms have been developed ahmad et al 2018 faqiry and das 2017 fu et al 2018 however regional water resource planning is not only a bi level optimization problem but also a dynamic optimization process as the decision makers in both the upper and lower levels need to make decisions over multiple stages li et al considered ecological water demand and optimized water resources allocation through a multi stage stochastic programming method li et al 2018 chen proved that annual inflow was nonstationary and provided a foundation for water managers who manage water resources under nonstationary and stochastic conditions chen et al 2018 tsai et al proposed an intelligent water allocation system iwas to reduce the water pressure in multiple sectors and enhance the resilience of the water allocation system in urban areas during droughts by using system dynamics tsai et al 2019 zhuang et al uncovered the complexities in water allocation problems where interactions and dynamic relationships exist in a multi stage context zhuang et al 2018 to our best knowledge since water resources distribution is spatially and seasonally uneven water allocation should be divided into multiple stages piao et al 2010 gleick 2002 gleick 2003 vörösmarty et al 2000 wang 2012 most importantly it is appropriate to conceptualize water allocation problems in a bi level multi stage framework that fully considers the interests not only of the regional authority but also the subarea managers unfortunately there are only a few studies that have looked at water management in terms of the combination of bi level optimization and multi stage decision making therefore in this paper we combine bi level optimization with dynamic optimization which largely conforms to realistic practices it is worth noting that within a river basin the upper and lower level decision makers all have multiple objectives in order to optimize their satisfaction economic benefits and water use efficiency when modeling many parameters possess imprecise numerical quantities due to their inherent complexity and stochastic uncertainty it is worth noting that climate change and its impact on water resources is a major challenge that china and the rest of the world will have to cope with in the twenty first century mekanik et al 2016 piao et al 2010 grafton et al 2013 uncertainties in future changes in precipitation prevent analysts from making firm statements about how river flows will respond to climate change this has led to uncertain water supplies in different river basins which increased the stress on regional authorities and subarea managers in this case we applied scenario based analysis to consider the influence of various stream inflows as we know scenarios can address a broad range of what if questions such as what if a minor drought occurs what if a severe drought occurs therefore we examined four stream flow patterns and a detailed regional water allocation scenario analysis using the proposed model this paper aspires to contribute to the discussion about regional water resource planning by constructing a bi level multi stage decision making model with multiple lower level decision makers accompanied by a scenario based analysis and by obtaining solutions that optimize both total benefits to society and economic benefits for each subarea i e to satisfy the upper and lower objectives the bi level multi stage decision making method proposed in this paper creates a greater motivation to save water and alleviates the contradiction between supply and demand by introducing a water rights concept and a water market in more complex circumstances that include multiple decision makers on the lower level there is a set of scenarios that describes several possible stream flow patterns for the sancha lake area water resource allocation problem which is more suitable for describing the uncertain environment encountered in real life regional water resource planning when actual representations are available the regional water resource planning problem can be solved more realistically this paper develops an idp ga to solve the model and presents the results and analysis for the sancha lake area to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the key issues in defining the water resource allocation problem in the min river basin and details the modelling approach for the establishment of a bi level multiple objective multi stage decision making model to describe the water resource allocation problem then it develops an idp ga for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios section 3 presents the results and describes an early warning system section 4 summaries the different water allocation strategies under varying stream inflow levels and discusses some policy implications finally section 5 gives some concluding remarks and points to future research possibilities 2 material and methods 2 1 motivation of developmental issues in study area sancha lake reservoir see the right side of fig 1 the farthest and last important node in the dujiangyan irrigation system is located in the eastern foot of longquan near chengdu which is 40 km to the northwest and has 27 square kilometers of open lakes based on its geographical location the tianfu new plan divides the sancha lake area into three subareas the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area the tianfu new plan provides a broad context requiring a water supply management plan to be set up under the government s water strategy the future water resources allocation and planning for the dujiangyan irrigation system area of min river basin in the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 this strategy acknowledges the pressure on future water resources from population growth and housing and climate change traditional water resource allocation plans cannot deal with water demand conflicts in different subareas and thus many problems related to equity efficiency and sustainability have arisen considering the developmental issues above the general aim of this study is to establish an integrated water resource management plan for the sancha lake area in order to achieve both economic and ecological sustainability here we focus on the idea of sustainable water resources allocation in a river basin and analyze the characteristics of the sancha lake area in the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district in the min river basin of china 2 2 conceptual framework bi level multistage water resource allocation before formulating a mathematical model we first constructed a conceptual framework xu and zeng 2013 the sancha lake area committee is the upper level decision maker at each stage the total available water from the sancha lake area is considered a state variable the decision maker on the upper level allocates water rights to different subareas and stores the upstream water in the reservoir the lower level decision maker is the subarea water manager each subarea has a reservoir to store its water and it can trade water in the water market under government regulation the water input for each subarea includes the water obtained from the regional authority the water bought in the water market under government control and the water stored in the subarea reservoir water availability is a key factor in local area development and increased demand for water by the agricultural industrial and municipal sectors increases pressure for equitable allocation at each stage each subarea water manager allocates water to industrial municipal and agricultural water users municipal water use includes residential use drinking water tourist use and municipal services industrial water supplies the chemical food papermaking mechatronics and construction industries agricultural water use includes water for irrigation livestock fisheries and forests it is worth noting that the water resource allocation decision making process is considered a multistage decision making process the entire decision making process is divided into several stages with decision making required in each stage in a multistage decision making process the decisions made in a previous stage influence the state of the next stage xu et al 2013c xu and zeng 2014 as a result the decision maker needs to not only consider the situation in the current stage but also have a full understanding of the influence of the current state on the next stage to optimize decisions over the entire decision making process for the sancha lake area water resource allocation the length of each stage is one month the multistage decision making state transit mechanism for the upper and lower levels is explained in the following 2 3 model proposition a bi level multiple objective multistage programming model is constructed the entire model is composed of the lower and upper level objectives constraints and state transit equations 2 3 1 fundamental assumptions before constructing the model the following assumptions are involved 1 all available water for distribution is provided by a single river basin 2 the sancha lake area committee in the upper level and each subarea manager on the lower level make rational decisions cooperatively to avoid an unsatisfactory situation 3 each decision maker on the upper and lower levels fully understands the objective functions and the inherent constraints each subarea manager on the lower level behaves rationally 4 when the water withdrawal of a subarea is more than its assigned initial water right and the stored water it needs to buy water from the water market under government control conversely it can sell extra water on the water market under government control 5 the total stream flow volume in the river basin is considered a fuzzy random variable with attributes statistically determined using historical data and professional experience which has to be further changed to a deterministic variable 2 3 2 notation 1 subscripts i index of subarea in the river basin where i 1 2 n k index of water user in the subarea where k 1 2 m t index of stages for the regional water resources planning

lower level decision maker three subarea managers seek adequate water to maximize their satisfaction degree and economic benefit in accordance with the sancha lake area committee water rights allocation decisions objective 1 maximize the minimal sectoral satisfaction degree at the lower level each subarea manager distributes water to industrial water users municipal water users and agricultural water users respectively first a satisfaction degree function of each water user is defined below f ikt y ik t 0 y ik t i ik min t y ik t i ik min t i ik max t i ik min t i ik min t y ik t i ik max t 1 y ik t i ik max t the satisfaction degree functions assume that for each sector in each stage there is a basic minimal water use volume denoted by i ik min t as well as a water use maximal volume denoted by i ik max t that is if the water withdrawal volume is reduced to less than i ik min t the satisfaction degree reduces to zero 0 thus if the water withdrawal volume increases to more than i ik max t the satisfaction degree cannot increase to more than one 1 each subarea manager i e the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area wants to maximize the minimal satisfaction degree in each stage for each water user at each subarea thus 1 max y min k t f ikt y ik t for k 1 2 3 and t 1 2 t objective 2 maximize the economic utility to measure the lower level subarea economic performance the economic utility function is employed the subarea economic benefit is k 1 m t 1 t b ik t y ik t and the subarea economic investment is k 1 m t 1 t tax k y ik t p bsw i t bsw i t thus the economic utility function can be expressed as 2 u i y ik t bsw i t k 1 m t 1 t b ik t y ik t k 1 m t 1 t tax k y ik t p bsw i t bsw i t the water manager also wants to maximize each subarea s economic utility i e sancha area xinmin area and dongjiageng area as shown below 3 max y u i y ik t bsw i t for i 1 2 n although the water market is not a completely competitive market coase 1960 as it is controlled by the government market prices are still influenced by the relationship between supply and demand within a reasonable range namely the price rises when demand is greater than supply conversely the price drops according to a theoretical analysis of the oligarch competition model easter and hearne 1995 the water rights transaction price function in a water market under government control can be expressed as 4 p bsw i t κ σ i 1 n bsw i t where i 1 n bsw i t represents the total available water for trading in the water market in stage t bsw i t is the volume of water bought and bsw i t is the volume of water sold κ and σ are the positive parameters lower level constraints state transit of stored water the state transit equation describes the relationship between the decision and state variables in each stage xu et al 2013c for the lower level decision makers the stored water is considered a state variable the input water of a subarea includes the current stored water the allocated water rights from the sancha lake area committee and the traded water in the water market under government control so then the state transit equation for the lower level is 5 s i t 1 s i t k 1 m y ik t x i t bsw i t initial and terminal conditions of stored water the initial and terminal conditions describe the stored water level at the beginning and at the end of the whole decision making procedure 6 s i 1 s i 0 and s i t 1 s i t 1 constraints on stored water the volume of the stored water in each subarea has a maximal limitation i e s i max and should be nonnegative 7 0 s i t s i max wherein zero 0 excludes minimal environmental reservation for livestock and ecological water usage constraints on water withdrawal there are also nonnegative constraints on the decision variable y ik t because the water withdrawal of user k in subarea i in stage t cannot be nonnegative 8 y ik t 0 2 3 4 upper level decision making process as the upper level decision maker the sancha lake area committee considers equity efficiency and sustainability among the three subareas when making the water rights allocation decisions hence three objective functions are considered objective 1 maximize the minimal social satisfaction degree the sancha lake area committee needs to create a plan to effectively allocate the water supply to the subareas to maximize the minimal social satisfaction degree in each subarea i e sancha area xinmin area and dongjiageng area the social satisfaction degree for each subarea is defined by the function 9 g it x i t 0 x i t l i min t x i t l i min t l i max t l i min t l i min t x i t l i max t 1 x i t l i max t the social satisfaction degree function assumes that for each subarea there is a basic minimal volume of water allocated and maximal water use that is if the water allocation volume is less than l i min t the satisfaction degree for that subarea is reduced to zero 0 however if the water allocation volume increases to be more than l i max t the satisfaction degree of that subarea cannot increase to more than one 1 as a result the objective function for the social satisfaction degree is to maximize the minimal social satisfaction degree 10 max x min i t g it x i t objective 2 maximize the water availability to guarantee water resource allocation efficiency in the upper level the sancha lake area committee wants to maximize the water availability level for the whole river basin 11 max x w x i t where the water availability level is defined as w x i t i 1 n t 1 t x i t t 1 t a t ξ t objective 3 maximize the total economic benefit the total economic benefit got from user k in subarea i is defined as 12 q y ik t i 1 n k 1 m t 1 t b ik t y ik t obviously the goal of the upper level decision maker is to maximize the benefit namely 13 max y q y ik t upper level constraints constraints on water trading the water can only be traded among the subareas in the river basin in the water market under government control when bsw i t is positive water is bought and when bsw i t is negative water is sold the following equations clearly show the volume of water bought and sold in the market 14 bsw i t bsw i t bsw i t and bsw i t bsw i t 0 where bsw i t 0 is the volume of water bought and bsw i t 0 is the volume of water sold for each stage therefore the sum of all the bought and sold water should be zero 0 15 i 1 n bsw i t bsw i t 0 the volume of water sold in each stage for subarea i cannot exceed the allocated water rights 16 bsw i t x i t constraints on water allocation there are also nonnegative constraints on the decision variable x i t because the initial water rights for each subarea in each stage cannot be negative 17 x i t 0 the volume of the available water in the sancha lake area has a maximal limitation i e a max and cannot be negative 18 0 a t a max where zero 0 excludes the minimal environmental reservation for livestock and ecological water usage state transit of total available water for the upper level decision maker the total available water is considered a state variable multistage decision making is actually a discrete dynamic process the sancha lake area output water is the allocated water rights to the subareas so the state transit equation for the upper level is as below 19 a t 1 a t i 1 n x i t ξ t initial and terminal conditions for total available water the initial and terminal conditions describe the available water level at the beginning and at the end of the complete decision making process as shown below 20 a 1 a 0 and a t 1 a t 1 2 4 the global model m2snc model there is an interactive relationship between the upper and lower level decision makers the regional authority on the upper level i e the leader makes decisions regarding the initial water rights of the subareas to guarantee equity and efficiency and the followers or lower level decision makers are the subarea managers who decide on the volume of water withdrawal that maximizes satisfaction and economic benefits this relationship can be described as a multi objective multi stage stackelberg nash cournot m2snc problem the state transit equations eqs 5 and 19 describe a dynamic decision making process where the available water in the sancha lake area and the stored water in the reservoirs in each subarea is regarded as a state variable the constraints on the decision variables as well as the initial and terminal conditions restrict the water resource allocation to within feasible limits the objective functions for the two level decision makers as shown in eqs 1 3 10 11 and 13 reflect the multiple goals and conflicts over decisions between the sancha lake area committee and the subarea water managers by integrating the state transit equations constraints initial and terminal conditions and objective functions the m2snc model for optimizing the bi level multiple objective multi stage water resource allocation in the sancha lake area can be formulated as 21 max x min i t g it x i t max x w x i t max y q y ik t i 1 n bsw i t bsw i t 0 bsw i t x i t a t 1 a t i 1 n x i t ξ t a 1 a 0 a t 1 a t 1 0 a t a max x i t 0

0 2 5 idp ga solution procedure the proposed model 21 provides the sancha lake area committee with an efficient tool to cope with the realistic stresses resulting from unreasonable water resource allocation however the inherently complicated environment with a changing climate increasing population size and growing economic development usually requires the proposed model to dynamically fit various scenarios hence a procedure for policy simulation based on an idp ga is designed to simulate the optimal strategies for the water resource allocation and further assist each level of authority to develop efficient policies using the idp ga under various climate change scenarios to investigate the impact of climate change on the sancha lake area water resource allocation some scheduling principles for water resource allocation and a framework for the policy simulation are presented this simulation is similar to but not the same as the computable general equilibrium cge model johansen and zabel 1962 which originated from leontief s input output system leontief 1936 an efficient tool to simulate how an economy might react to changes in policy technology or other external factors by developing a series of equations describing model variables the framework for the overall idp based ga procedure the bi level multiple objective regional water resource planning problem is shown in fig 2 and the pseudo code is shown in appendix ii this procedure integrates interactive dynamic programming into a genetic algorithm idp ga to satisfy the four situations bi level structure multiple objectives multiple stages and twofold uncertainty proposed in the model for the sancha lake area water resource allocation 3 results the proposed optimization method has been developed to deal with development issues in the sancha lake area irrigation district in the min river basin 3 1 data collection and parameters determination data collection was conducted by studying the historical data archive and suggestions from experts and was then dealt with using policy and parameter framework principles in the sancha lake area irrigation district the three subareas i e i 1 2 3 representing the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area respectively mainly supply water to three types of water users k 1 2 3 with k 1 for municipal users k 2 for agricultural users and k 3 for industrial users detailed information for the sancha lake area regional authority on the upper level and the subarea managers on the lower level is shown in tables 1 8 the stream inflow in the t th month is shown in table 4 the minimal and maximal satisfaction limitation parameters for the allocated water rights and the stored water parameters in the subareas have been shown in tables 5 and 6 the initial stored quantity at the beginning of january and the final stored quantity at the end of december for the sancha area the xinmin area and the dongjiageng area are listed below s 1 1 5000 s 1 13 5000 s 2 13 5000 s 2 13 5000 s 3 13 4000 s 3 13 4000 the idp ga based simulation parameters are set from the results of the preliminary experiments that were conducted to observe the behavior of the algorithm at different parameter settings by comparing several sets of parameters including population size i e n 25 iteration number i e i 500 crossover probability i e p c 0 2 and mutation probability i e p m 0 4 the most reasonable parameters are chosen to trade off between the evaluation time and population size kim and ellis 2008 the program was run 10 times on a core i 5 3 20 ghz clock pulse with 4 gb memory 3 2 allocation solution with a normal stream flow if rainfall is relatively adequate all year round then the upstream is able to provide the downstream with enough water in most months then the upper decision maker namely the sancha lake committee considers the lower decision maker s requirements under some essential constraints and their optimum reaction duties table 9 shows the allocation strategy for the subareas fig 3 exhibits the degree of satisfaction and economic utility of the three subareas more than 80 of the months of degree of satisfaction are greater than the reference level of 0 903 in both the sancha and xinmin areas similarly more than 80 of the months of the degree of satisfaction are in the reference interval 0 732 0 903 in the dongjiageng area based on the results we suggest that the upper decision maker namely the sancha lake committee would only need to consider the equity and efficiency of the water resources allocation in order to ensure that the whole basins development is balanced the dongjiageng area would need to formulate efficient measures to cope with a lack of water in some periods for example by ensuring that there is a full reservoir in advance or instructing locals to use less water 3 3 early warning mechanism as a consequence of the increased frequency of droughts and societal vulnerability to extended periods of water deficiency the economic social and environmental impact of droughts has increased significantly worldwide traditionally the response to drought throughout the world has been through a reactive risk management approach this approach to drought management responds to a drought once it occurs in an attempt to improve and accelerate the recovery process before that the subarea needs to propose reasonable reference levels that activate different early warning mechanisms the reference level is calculated according to the following principles first put the normal annual stream inflow of 44 41 million m3 into the proposed model then obtain the reference satisfaction interval 0 903 1 which is considered the reference interval for normal status blue response mechanism brm second given a stream flow of 42 61 44 41 million m3 into the proposed model one obtains the reference satisfaction interval 0 732 0 903 which is considered the slight drought reference interval yellow early warning mechanism yewm third given a stream flow of 39 97 42 61 million m3 into the proposed model one obtains the reference satisfaction interval 0 497 0 732 which is considered the moderate drought reference interval orange early warning mechanism oewm fourth the satisfaction interval 0 0 497 is considered to be the serious drought reference interval red early warning mechanism rewm finally if 80 of the subarea degrees of satisfaction fall into the interval a warning graphic as shown in fig 4 with different colors is created to assist decision makers in responding accurately as shown in fig 5 both the sancha and the xinmin areas are in the brm however in the dongjiageng area the yewm would be activated the reason the dongjiageng area has a different response mechanism than the sancha and xinmin areas is due to their different industrialization levels as is often the case agricultural and municipal water use took place prior to industrialized use of the water the dongjiageng area is the most industrialized region of the three subareas so the sancha lake committee satisfies the agricultural region namely the sancha area and the municipal region namely the xinmin area first when there is a slight lack of water it should also be noted that there are usually no large differences in satisfaction between the various subareas because of sufficient rainfall every month if a subarea encounters a shortage in certain months the committee transfers the water rights from another subarea through economic compensation 4 discussion a long term view of the analysis of the sustainable development of water needs to account for fundamental uncertainties resulting from both a limited understanding of the situation and natural stochastic changes the following section focuses on scenario analysis under changing climate conditions by qualifying stream flow sources these scenarios represent important factors and processes which have an important role in determining water resource dynamics in a changing climate 4 1 climate scenarios determination drought is a multidimensional natural hazard that occurs because of natural climate variability and it is a recurring phenomenon in many areas of the world but its features vary from region to region there are three main drought definitions meteorological hydrological and agricultural wilhite and glantz 1985 we have used the hydrological definition to distinguish the climate scenarios in the sancha lake area s archive of historical weather climate data and station history information from the quality controlled data for the daily monthly seasonal and yearly temperature precipitation wind measurements radar data and dujiangyan irrigation system drainage functions we simulated four climate scenarios for the sancha lake area 1 normal climate when the stream flow is greater than 44 41 million m 3 per year 2 slight drought when the stream flow is around 42 61 44 41 million m 3 per year 3 moderate drought when the stream flow is 39 97 42 61 million m 3 per year and 4 severe drought when the stream flow is less than 39 97 million m3 per year 4 1 1 scenario 1 slight drought s1 drought has been an issue since the beginning of recorded history the sancha lake area committee usually considers there to be a slight drought if the annual stream flow falls into the interval of 42 61 44 41 million m3 as an input parameter it is usually considered to be a fuzzy random number a slight drought results in a slight reduction in the water resource allocation to the downstream subareas leading to a decrease in both subarea economic utility and degrees of satisfaction table 10 from fig 6 the xinmin area issues an oewm and the sancha and dongjiageng areas issue a yewm this means that in 80 of the months the degree of satisfaction of the sancha and dongjiageng areas falls into the reference interval 0 732 0 903 and in more than 80 of the months the degree of satisfaction in the dongjiageng area is in the reference interval 0 497 0 732 in this scenario efficient policies need to be developed the sancha lake area committee needs to design a reasonable coordination mechanism to improve water resource transactions for example financial subsidies could be paid to the subareas at a minimum satisfaction level or non affected areas could be encouraged to transfer some water rights to the oewm subarea the subarea suffering from the slight drought would need to expand their approach to water withdrawal such as using ground water above all the authority should efficiently allocate water resources and the subarea should use the water efficiently 4 1 2 scenario 2 moderate drought s2 the sancha lake area is an irrigation region where agriculture continues to be a major sector for most local economies with 69 of the local economic utility derived from agricultural production especially in the sancha and xinmin areas because the water supply plays a key role in the development of the local agricultural sector the sancha lake area committee usually considers the areas situation under a moderate drought a moderate drought results in a moderate reduction of water resource allocation to the downstream subareas resulting in a decrease in the subareas local economic utility and degrees of satisfaction table 11 from fig 6 it can be seen that in 80 of the months the degree of satisfaction for the sancha and xinmin areas falls into the reference interval 0 497 0 732 and 0 0 497 for the dongjiageng area reference interval hence the sancha and xinmin areas would issue an oewm and the dongjiageng area would issue a rewm the sancha and xinmin areas are agriculture intensive and use most of their water resources for irrigation the local authority usually priorities these areas and provides them with the water they need to satisfy their net irrigation requirements nevertheless widespread and continuing stress on water resources increases the risk that simultaneous water shortages might occur around the world and could even trigger a regional water crisis in this scenario certain strategies need to be employed to cope with a moderate drought to ensure agricultural production technological intervention can be critical for example smaller and minor irrigation schemes with better land use could be developed to enhance soil moisture and water retention and even cloud seeding induced rainfall using solidified carbon dioxide or finely powdered sodium chloride could be a technological measure that alleviates the impact of a moderate drought above all applying new and improved techniques is an efficient way to combat drought 4 1 3 scenario 3 serious drought s3 if a serious drought occurs it would be an extremely difficult situation for the sancha lake area with some of the worst results being regional economic downturns food shortages or social conflict at an annual stream flow of less than 39 97 million m3 the sancha lake area committee would consider this a serious situation that would result in a rapid fall in water resources allocated to downstream subareas resulting in a decrease in the subarea s local economy utility and degrees of satisfaction table 12 following fig 6 all subareas would issue an rewm indicating that the degree of satisfaction in 80 of the months in the three subareas would fall into the reference interval 0 0 497 in this scenario since agricultural and municipal water supplies take precedence over industrial water needs measures can be developed to cope with a serious drought situation groundwater would need to be used wisely and cloud seeding would be applied as and when necessary 4 2 guarantee degree level in addition reasonable evaluation criteria would need to be developed to measure the guaranteed water supply degree level for both the sancha lake area committee and the subarea managers for the sancha lake area committee the guaranteed water supply degree level is defined below to measure the extent to which available water resources can be allocated to those subareas sgr u t a t ξ t i 1 m x i ref t where x i ref t is the reference value of the normal demand of subarea i in period t table 9 for the manager of subarea i the guaranteed water supply degree level is defined below to measure the extent to which available water resources can be allocated to different production activities sgr i l t s i t x i t bsw i t k 1 m y ik ref t where y ik ref t is the reference value of the normal demand of user k of subarea i in period t table 9 the guaranteed degree levels reflect the regulation effect of the reservoirs the larger the guaranteed degree the greater the capability of the sancha lake basin to fight against drought as the fluctuation of the upper reservoir is greater than the lower reservoir the upper reservoir controls the regulatory level and the lower reservoir controls the guaranteed level fig 7 furthermore the lower reservoir has a smaller fluctuation because the allocated upper level water resources are used first in every period the guaranteed degrees under the four scenarios are close which confirms the guaranteed level of the reservoir therefore the guaranteed degree can be considered an index reflecting the level of the reservoir but it is not a suitable early warning index although the degree concept is more intuitive for managerial operations 4 3 policy implication linking jian yang s regional plan on sustainable development goals total water consumption control water conservation and efficient use water resource allocation and water supply security we aim to summarize the policy implications and underscore the roles of the bi level stakeholders namely the sancha lake area committee and the subarea managers proposition 1 the government establishes an emergency response cooperative mechanism for each subarea according to the simulation results under the various climate change scenarios an emergency response cooperative mechanism can be constructed by the comparative analysis of objective functions under different scenarios as seen in tables 13 14 fig 8 shows the different early warning mechanisms under varying annual stream inflow scenarios the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district is devoted to building an intelligent water management system by combining technology modernization and sustainable development the 4 level early warning mechanism for drought scenarios in this river basin has been successfully designed the macro control policy has been formulated for the irrigation areas industrial usage and dynamic residential water usage strategies when it comes to implementation different strategies need to be employed to cope with slight moderate and serious droughts under the slight drought condition the sancha lake area committee could design a reasonable coordination mechanism to improve water resource transactions for example financial subsidies can be paid to the subareas with a minimum satisfaction level or unaffected areas could be encouraged to transfer some water rights to the oewm subarea under the moderate drought condition technological interventions should be adopted that are an efficient way to combat drought under the serious drought situation other types of water resources can be taken into consideration e g groundwater virtual water in addition to improving the irrigation technology proposition 2 the sancha lake area committee should consider apply for special permanent water rights coping with increasing water demand proposition 3 the sancha lake area committee should consider applying for special permanent water rights to cope with increasing water demand since china became a member of the wto the sancha lake area has rapidly developed increasing its water use demands to save water and to reduce the chance of water shortages a stepped water price mechanism for different industrial uses was suggested but neither the sancha lake area committee nor the dujiangyan administration bureau had the right of revision therefore to lessen the impact of water shortages resulting from the increase in demand from the recent implementation of the tianfu new plan the sancha lake area committee was required to apply for special permanently increased water rights rather than applying for temporary water rights every year at the hearing for the new dujiangyan irrigation system water resources allocation plan at the beginning of the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 in preparation for this hearing the dujiangyan administration bureau called on all committees to submit their water resource allocation requirements as a benchmark for the sancha lake area committee water resource allocation plan a set of integrated alternatives were discussed along with the water rights application handed out by the dujiangyan administration bureau to other areas as planning guidelines which included the following operating schedule strategies 1 the committee controls the water rights unifies the water resource allocation operating schedule and executes the prescribed management needs which would allow the subareas to distribute water for municipal industrial and agricultural uses 2 the committee guarantees the use of water for irrigation residential and industrial use while also paying attention to ecological and wider varied water usage needs 3 the committee draws up a water usage contract with the subareas that outlines the charges and fees for water use water trading between subareas is encouraged but supervised by the committee proposition 4 the subarea managers should consider water quota transactions and water saving and water usage efficiency improvements the subareas are required to do business under a fixed total water quota and are also required to save water wherever possible the productive use of water should be improved by a rational application of technology and economics and by logical decision making for industrial and municipal water use water use efficiency can be improved through technological innovations new policies and simple operational improvements for agricultural water use efficient irrigation technologies need to be employed to boost food production while working with a limited water supply for example precision irrigation soil moisture monitoring and the laser leveling of fields have the potential to double the output per unit of water for many crops 4 4 findings and feedbacks the bi level dynamic equilibrium decision based water resources allocation model has been employed in three subareas made up of a total of 41 towns and villages in the sancha lake area during 2011 2012 the committee allocated water rights optimally for around 6 687 hectares of irrigation more than 50 key enterprises and a population of almost 56 000 people achieving a sustainable utilization of water resources in the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district with strong practicability operability and a wide range of applications the model for water resources allocation can be applied to each subarea of the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district this research applied a qualitative technique a team of eight water governance officials and scholars gathered to describe their findings and give feedback after a real world practice process that was collaboratively designed and executed all members participated in regular meetings to discuss the results of the water allocation strategy solved by the proposed model and they gathered the following points 1 the mechanism of dynamic water rights trading can overcome the difficulty of uneven annual inflows the committee controlled the water rights unified the operations schedule for the water resources allocation and executed the prescribed management systems that allowed the subareas themselves to distribute the water for municipal industrial and agricultural uses in the sancha lake area based on the macro control of upstream flow by the administration bureau of the dujiangyan longquanshan irrigation district the committee overcame the difficulty of uneven annual inflows dominated the dynamic trading of water rights optimized the equilibrium allocation of water resources and balanced the water supply in the sancha lake area 2 quota management is effective in the sancha irrigation area the committee adopted policies that allocated water volumes to subareas in the sancha lake area under fixed total volume and controlled through quota management the subareas were required to make a contract with the committee and were charged strict fees according to the contract the committee first guaranteed residential water use promoted agricultural water saving irrigation techniques and identified water saving requirements for the production value of increased industrial water use while paying attention to both ecological and various other water uses naturally they are also fully committed to the sustainable allocation of water resources in the sancha lake area 5 conclusions the significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for sancha lake an important area in the southeast basin of the dujiangyan irrigation system in china because of the possibility of unpredictable water availability in the min river basin a multi objective multi stage stackelberg nash cournot model was proposed to allocate water resources optimally on the basis of water rights distribution the goals of the upper level authority the sancha lake area committee were to optimize the total social degrees of satisfaction and water availability levels the goals of the three lower level subareas were the degrees of satisfaction for the available water resources and economic benefits compared to previous studies this multi objective multi stage decision making process considered bi level optimization and two types of state transit equations were established for the upper and lower levels in order to optimize their water resource planning dynamically to solve the complex and nonlinear bi level multi objective multi stage decision making model a policy simulation system with an idp ga was designed to create the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios finally the results under four climate change scenarios were presented to demonstrate how efficient water resources allocation could be prescribed the proposed model was applied to optimally allocate water resources and evaluate the effects of several climate scenarios in a river basin in china the dujiangyan basin first under normal stream inflows some important insights were obtained 1 the m2snc model is an efficient tool for tackling this type of problem in complex situations and it provides an efficient allocation mechanism to dynamically cope with potential water crises 2 the subareas were able to develop real time storage production strategies based on the water rights they obtained and available water as regulated by the authority 3 irrigation and municipal water were guaranteed as the upper authority gave priority to areas with major agricultural production and larger populations second according to the simulation results under the various climate change scenarios we can suggest several policy implications for the decision process for example an emergency response cooperative mechanism should be established by the government for each subarea and the sancha lake area committee should consider applying for special permanent water rights to cope with increasing water demand to increase its credibility a group of government officials and scholars were called together to analyze the results of the proposed model in the sancha lake area which confirmed that the mechanism of dynamic trading of water rights can overcome the difficulty of uneven annual inflows and that quota management is effective in the sancha irrigation area according to the third plenary session of the 18th central committee of the chinese communist party it is the government s responsibility to develop a complete market mechanism and to formulate policies to promote and support the reformation of water rights allocation the proposed model can be extended to the world marketplace including developing nations other more complicated situations such as the cat and mouse game played out between lower level decision makers and other uncertain factors integrated on the upper level still need to be modeled to determine the optimum water allocation for realistic problems from a policymaking perspective a reasonable pricing strategy and a transactional code of conduct are provided in the

6453,conventional methods for designing infrastructure that is subject to flood risk such as dams and levees assume a stationary design flood however observed and potential non stationarity in floods can result in costly over design or dangerous under design despite substantial attention evidence from the literature makes clear there is no consensus methodology for estimating design variables under climate change practical guidance remains elusive this paper presents a review of the challenges and advances in design of infrastructure for floods under non stationarity first potential sources of non stationarity in time series of floods are described to provide context and motivation second methods for estimating design floods that rely on the stationary assumption are presented and their limitations are discussed third methods for estimating design floods that assume non stationarity resulting from climate change are summarized finally the inadequacies of current design methodologies in view of the pervasive uncertainties are assessed and strategies to manage the consequences of those uncertainties are presented keywords flood design climate change uncertainty 1 introduction infrastructure such as dams and levees are built to reduce risk from hydrological extremes such as riverine floods conventionally such infrastructure is designed to protect against flood events up to a chosen magnitude this so called design flood is commonly defined as the flow quantile with a selected frequency of occurrence or return period for example the 100 year return flood is typical for designing levees and other protection structures e g olsen 2006 more recently the design value is sometimes chosen based on maximizing net economic benefits i e avoided damages by implementing flood protection less the cost of the protection or minimizing the expected damages of flooding e g lund 2002 for infrastructure where failure would lead to tremendous damages such as very large dams some national and regional agencies use the concepts of probable maximum precipitation or flood pmp or pmf rather than statistical approaches for design wmo 2009 all of these approaches to design flood estimation make use of the assumption of stationarity notably however stationarity lacks a well established definition within the hydrologic and water system analysis literature for instance milly et al 2008 described stationarity as the idea that natural systems fluctuate within an unchanging envelope of variability montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 referencing kolmogorov 1931 1938 and khintchine 1934 defined as stationary a process that undergoes change but its statistics are conserved other studies such as that by salas et al 2018 maintain that stationary means the marginal distribution remains invariant in time in this review we adopt the definition by salas et al 2018 in the context of design for riverine floods this definition of stationary implies that the design flood is time invariant and hence the probability of infrastructure failure remains constant for the duration of the design life there is now a significant body of literature claiming that it is no longer valid to assume the design flood is stationary this claim is based on theoretical considerations and observational evidence from some locations that flood risk is changing due to climate change and socio economic development e g dankers et al 2014 winsemius et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 berghuijs et al 2017 and references within while flood risk combines hydrological hazard and vulnerability merz et al 2010 here the focus is hydrological hazard which is the probability of occurrence of a given flood magnitude the concern is that if the design flood is indeed nonstationary then an assumption of stationarity could result in over or under design jain and lall 2001 rosner et al 2014 over design occurs when infrastructure becomes too large as peak flows decrease leading to sunk capital and operating costs conversely under design occurs when infrastructure becomes too small as peak flows increase leading to societal impacts such as human casualties and economic damages which are generally of higher concern than sunk costs rosner et al 2014 for instance the american society of civil engineers estimates that about 150 billion in flood damages resulting from hurricane katrina were due to under design of levees and other flood protection structures asce 2007 to avoid over or under design hirsch 2011 recommends that once we recognize that we have nonstationarity for a variety of reasons we really have to rethink our approach to planning this quote summarizes the increasingly common motivation to improve current and develop new design approaches that account for non stationarity in hydro meteorological processes and thus improve the robustness and resilience of flood infrastructure beven 2011 kundzewicz et al 2017 for example in 2010 a workshop in boulder colorado u s gathered hydrologists climatologists engineers and scientists around the question if stationarity is dead what do we do galloway 2011 one topic was whether the u s federal guidelines for flood frequency analysis as described in bulletin 17b iacwd 1982 should be updated to account for non stationarity eight years later the update bulletin 17c acknowledges evidence of non stationarity but provides no concrete guidance for its incorporation into analysis and design instead suggesting that in situations of sufficient evidence for climate induced non stationarity water practitioners should employ time varying parameters or other appropriate techniques england jr et al 2018 however water practitioners do not generally know the range of available methods for flood frequency analysis assuming non stationarity serinaldi and kilsby 2015 even though the use of such approaches and models have gained popularity in academia e g strupczewski et al 2001 delgado et al 2010 katz 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 yu et al 2015 spence and brown 2016 šraj et al 2016 see salas et al 2018 for a review this lack of knowledge likely stems from the proliferation of approaches and the many challenges associated with assuming non stationarity challenges include but are not limited to comprehensively diagnosing the drivers of change e g anthropogenic climate change or natural climate variability vogel et al 2011 deser et al 2012a elmer et al 2012 merz et al 2012 harrigan et al 2014 determining how change affects the flood time series e g when a trend is detected a statistically significant mean shift can also be detected or distribution moments i e mean variance skewness and kurtosis although in practice observational records are too short to detect changes in the latter two coles 2001 xiong and guo 2004 villarini et al 2009a katz 2013 and identifying appropriate mathematical models to represent change e g multiple mathematical models have been used to represent change in annual maximum flows at the little sugar creek charlotte north carolina leading to widely different estimates of the 100 year flood villarini et al 2009b salas and obeysekera 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 this paper addresses the need for guidance on design for riverine floods under non stationarity particularly as associated with climate change by providing a comprehensive review of available design methods and guidelines section 2 reviews the main drivers that can lead to changes in peak flow magnitude and frequency and then discusses methods commonly used for detection of change and attribution to specific drivers section 3 reviews the available stationary approaches to design flood estimation and provides an example application with record of flood events showing non stationarity section 4 describes current methods for estimating the design flood assuming non stationarity section 5 discusses the available options for addressing uncertainty section 6 concludes with an outlook on future flood design and further research 2 what assumption should be made the question of whether to assume a stationary or non stationary design flood is closely tied to considerations of the spatiotemporal scales associated with the natural and anthropogenic processes that drive flood events and the intended infrastructure design fig 1 clearly the processes acting on the timescale of the design event for a storm water management system e g 10 year flood are vastly different from those acting on the timescale of a pmf used for dam design in this context this section explores 1 potential non stationarity induced by processes driving flood events 2 methods for detecting change in peak flow series and 3 methods for attributing observed change to specific drivers the discussion is supported further by examples to illustrate the issues associated with the range of spatiotemporal scales that influence the magnitude and occurrence of flood events as well as their detection and attribution to particular drivers 2 1 evidence and drivers of non stationarity in riverine floods riverine floods are primarily driven by 1 precipitation which is driven by natural climate variability e g deser et al 2012a and anthropogenic climate change e g zhang and delworth 2018 and 2 land surface response which is driven by land use change river regulation and natural catastrophes each of these drivers are potential sources of non stationarity the red river of the north at fargo north dakota u s is a particularly salient example of nonstationary stream flow fig 2 mueller and foley 2014 although flagged as regulated by the u s geological survey the u s army corps of engineers usace demonstrated that changes in streamflow beginning in the early 1940 s villarini et al 2009a cannot be explained by flow regulation see discussion in serinaldi and kilsby 2015 instead tree ring analysis has shown that the river experiences high and low flood modes which extend from several decades to nearly a century george and nielsen 2003 natural climate variability sometimes called internal climate variability is variability of the climate system that occurs in the absence of external forcing and includes processes intrinsic to the atmosphere the ocean and the coupled ocean atmosphere system deser et al 2012b natural climate variability generally considered to occur on timescales of 30 years or less with exceptions is comprised of two components acting at different spatiotemporal scales 1 noise at local and regional scales and 2 low frequency oscillations at regional to sub global scales that have a global influence on hydrology deser et al 2012a hulme et al 1999 for example the el nino southern oscillation enso occurs in the tropical pacific but influences hydrology around the globe trenberth 1997 ward et al 2014 lee et al 2018 natural climate variability can affect flood magnitude e g hannaford and marsh 2008 schlef et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 frequency of occurrence e g andrews et al 2004 delgado et al 2012 hodgkins et al 2017 kiem et al 2003 mallakpour and villarini 2016a and timing e g blöschl et al 2017 for other examples of the influence of natural climate variability of floods see also petrow et al 2009 prudhomme and genevier 2011 villarini et al 2013 wilby and quinn 2013 armstrong et al 2014 li and tan 2015 bracken et al 2018 natural climate variability is generally thought to cause temporal clustering or semi cyclical patterns in floods e g jain and lall 2001 anthropogenic climate change is forcing of the atmosphere by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission leading to global scale changes in the coupled ocean atmospheric system ipcc 2014 notably in model simulations natural climate variability dominates the signal in precipitation and temperature due to anthropogenic climate change until around 2050 hawkins and sutton 2011 deser et al 2012b hingray and saïd 2014 whateley and brown 2016 schlef et al 2018b martel et al 2018 at the horizon 2050 natural climate variability may still be difficult to separate from anthropogenic climate change effects on integrated variables such as streamflow and crop yields e g hulme et al 1999 there is physically based evidence that ongoing anthropogenic climate change may lead to an intensification of and changes in the water cycle worldwide ipcc 2014 leading to changes in floods e g milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 warmer air temperatures will increase atmospheric moisture holding capacity leading to an increase in the intensity and variability of extreme precipitation lenderink and meijgaard 2008 trenberth 2011 berg and haerter 2013 fischer and knutti 2016 yin et al 2018 likely affecting flash and short rain floods for flood definitions here and subsequently see merz and blöschl 2003 warmer temperatures will also cause snowpack accumulation to shrink in mountainous regions and at high latitudes barnett et al 2005 and change the timing and rate of snowmelt e g mccabe and clark 2005 blöschl et al 2017 musselman et al 2017 in general these modifications are likely to decrease rain on snow and snowmelt floods but are dependent on local trends additionally there will be changes in storm tracks and individual storm intensities linked to changes in the underlying large scale circulation patterns bengtsson et al 2006 boé and terray 2008 knutson et al 2010 santos et al 2016 shaw et al 2016 likely affecting short and long rain floods apart from the possibility of a tipping point anthropogenic climate change is generally thought to produce slow and long term trend like changes in floods land use changes include urbanization forest management and agricultural practices which can affect floods for up to several centuries but can only be verified at spatial scales up to several tens of square kilometers blöschl et al 2007 rogger et al 2017 in particular the expansion of impervious areas due to urbanization decreases infiltration which weakens the buffering effect of the natural ecosystem causes changes hydrological extremes e g rose and peters 2001 smith et al 2002 konrad 2003 moglen and shivers 2006 saghafian et al 2008 villarini et al 2009a b vogel et al 2011 land use changes are thought to cause either change points or trend like changes in floods river regulation or training can range from construction of dams and weirs to straightening meandering or braided rivers the impacts of river regulation on floods varies for one example of the magnitude of impact see vorogushyn and merz 2013 for large rivers the effects of river regulation on floods may be as much or greater than land use changes lammersen et al 2002 bronstert et al 2007 in the case of channel modification the impact is largest when the flood remains in the riverbed hall et al 2014 river regulation is generally thought to introduce change points in floods natural catastrophes in particular volcanos cause immediate and massive impacts at local and regional scales cause global cooling and changes in hydrology in the first several years after the event and may contribute to long lasting and global climate change under certain conditions hofmann 1987 major and mark 2006 schneider et al 2009 trenberth and dai 2007 natural catastrophes are generally thought to introduce change points in floods but are not generally considered in non stationary analyses 2 2 detection of change in peak flow records tracking or anticipating change in hydrologic extremes is the typical starting point when considering the adequacy of the current flood risk management strategy at a given location there are a variety of methods available for detecting trends and shifts in hydrological time series see the reviews by kundzewicz and robson 2004 khaliq et al 2009 madsen et al 2014 bayazit 2015 the world meteorological organization wmo 2009 recommends the non parametric mann kendall test for trend analysis mk kendall 1975 it does not require an assumed probability distribution has been widely applied to hydrologic extremes e g petrow and mertz 2009 petrow et al 2009 villarini et al 2009b mediero et al 2014 archfield et al 2016 and has been adapted to account for long term persistence hamed 2008 for detecting shifts the non parametric pettitt test 1979 which is easily implementable has been widely used e g villarini et al 2009a rougé et al 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 li and tan 2015 mallakpour and villarini 2016b however it only detects one shift within a time series unlike the rodionov test 2004 these and other methods do not always correctly detect trends and shifts as illustrated by simulation experiments where the trend is stochastically generated spence and brown 2016 and is highly dependent on spatiotemporal scale fig 1 specifically the outcome of statistical tests for trend detection depends on the hydrological record length blöschl and montanari 2010 barros et al 2014 using the red river of the north at fargo as an example fig 2 we applied the mk test to three periods the first 1943 1961 shows a significant downward trend the second 1943 1988 shows no significant trend and the third 1943 2016 shows a significant upward trend although these periods were obviously chosen specifically to illustrate the point this analysis indicates that the overall trend was dominated by low frequency variability for several decades this example highlights that natural climate variability has its own structure which can easily confound trend analysis although temporal and spatial structures of certain climate patterns are relatively well characterized e g enso this emphasizes the importance of diagnosing the structure of natural variability and adapting the trend analysis for instance if temporal clustering or semi cyclical patterns are identified in peak streamflow one solution is to apply trend tests over periods that include one or more cycles ishak et al 2013 at longer timescales the hurst phenomenon hurst 1951 in which a trend may not be separable from persistence applies koutsoyiannis 2003 2006 the outcome of the statistical tests also depends on spatial scale and may vary from one catchment to another archfield et al 2016 in part due to land use change or regulation vogel et al 2011 aggregation to large spatial scales tends to reduce the noise of natural climate variability and improves trend detection fischer and knutti 2014 2 3 attribution of change in peak flow records attribution which consists of quantifying the contribution of various drivers to change in peak flows is crucial for projection hall et al 2014 and can raise awareness of the need for mitigation e g thompson and otto 2015 schwab et al 2017 attribution studies of changes in hydro climatic extremes in general and of the causes of individual events e g allen 2003 pall et al 2011 2017 easterling et al 2016 viglione et al 2016 are becoming more common for flood change attribution merz et al 2012 suggested a three part framework that uses observed peak flows and simulation results the first part evidence of consistency relates to whether the observed change in peak flows is consistent with change in the assumed driver the second part evidence of inconsistency consists of demonstrating that change in peak flow is not the outcome of a different driver from the one originally assumed the aim is to avoid wrong attribution when several drivers of changes are acting at the considered location the third part is the provision of confidence level of the causality attribution this framework is often reduced to comparing observed peak discharges with simulated discharges that are obtained with and without changes in the drivers e g wolski et al 2014 aich et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 see section 4 1 2 for a description of possible statistical approaches the drawback of this causal framework and other sensitivity type analyses are that inference is limited to the relative or qualitative weights for various drivers and is limited when several drivers are jointly responsible for changes in peak flows harrigan et al 2014 vogel et al 2011 2 4 implication for design the above sections highlight that clear physical reasoning supports non stationarity in floods however physical evidence is often inconclusive natural climate variability and land use change make detection and attribution of change difficult which could at least partly explain the lack of physical evidence thus engineers and decision makers could find a trend but not be sure if it is due to anthropogenic climate change alternatively they may find no trend but since the climate change signal is yet to be detected flood hazard may nevertheless increase or decrease in the future in either case these possibilities pose a clear design challenge the sections below discuss the limitations of current approaches given this context 3 status quo design flood assuming stationarity the stationarity assumption has been used for decades for designing flood infrastructure and has been demonstrated to be the most pertinent assumption at many locations serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 assuming stationarity there are two primary approaches to determining the design flood fig 3 the first is to perform flood frequency analysis ffa and then use pre determined return periods or risk based approaches the second is to use the concept of pmp and pmf this section briefly reviews these methods 3 1 design based on flood frequency analysis in stationary ffa observed peak flow values are represented by a probability distribution with time invariant parameters 1 y f θ 1 θ k θ k where y y 1 y 2 y n is the peak flow time series n is the number of observations means distributed as and f is a chosen distribution function the u s recommends the log pearson type 3 distribution england jr et al 2018 and the national environment research council in the united kingdom recommends the generalized extreme value distribution nrec 1975 other extreme value distributions may also be appropriate merz and theiken 2009 θ θ 1 θ k is a vector of k parameters usually k 2 o r 3 for more details on conducting ffa assuming stationarity including parameter estimation application to ungauged catchments or at regional scales and handling missing data the reader can refer to the aforementioned guidelines and the reviews by coles 2001 katz et al 2002 and khaliq et al 2006 uncertainty in ffa is introduced in streamflow measurements and in fitting extreme value distributions to limited records once ffa is complete there are two approaches to determining a design value the first approach is to use a pre determined return period the 100 year return flood in particular has become commonly used in the u s as a reasonable compromise between the need for building restrictions to minimize potential loss of life and property and the economic benefits to be derived from floodplain development fema 2011 partially due to the national flood insurance program which mandates flood insurance for structures at risk of the 100 year flood however the choice of flood protection standard may be more political than based on scientific or economic justification for example in the u s the 500 year standard mandated after hurricane sandy by the obama administration was subsequently reversed by the trump administration koerth baker 2017 the degree of conservatism varies by country in the netherlands standards for levee and dike design which range anywhere from the 300 to 10 000 year flood depending on location were developed from ffa of historic data and the analysis of costs of construction compared to damages and risk of death associated with past floods voorendt 2015 the second is a risk based approach that minimizes total expected cost national research council 2000 lund 2002 jonkman et al 2004 tung 2005 in practice the objective is to balance the costs of protection with the expected costs associated with the hydrological hazard i e flood damage costs plus the costs of any emergency actions taken during the flood event thus the assumption of stationarity applies to not only the flood probability distribution but also the socio economic estimates that determine infrastructure and damage costs which add another level of uncertainty 3 2 probable maximum precipitation and flood a significant part of the flood design literature relies on the concept of pmp and pmf pmp is the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically with no allowance made for long term climatic trends wmo 1986 the pmf is the flood that would result from the combination of the pmp and the most severe hydrologic conditions i e initial soil moisture and or snowpack considered physically possible in the region the pmf is used for designing infrastructure whose failure would cause tremendous damages to the downstream population and economy e g large dams its return period has sometimes been associated with values ranging from 104 to 107 years fernandes et al 2010 nathan et al 2016 it is primarily used in north america and australia most european countries use conventional ffa boes 2011 because such high return periods are considered beyond the credible limit of extrapolation nathan and weinmann 2001 in the u s state level regulations sometimes allow design within a range the lower bound may be set by either a return period e g the 500 year flood or a percent of the pmf while the upper bound is a percent of the pmf fema 2012 the world meteorological organization provides guidelines for estimating pmp wmo 2009 according to those guidelines there are two distinct categories of methods those based on the statistical analysis of observed extreme rainfall and those that rely on physically based storm modelling the wmo recommends the statistical analysis of extreme rainfall hershfield 1961 as an approximation for pmp for small catchments with surface area less than 1000 km2 the most common physically based approach called storm maximization and storm transposition e g rakhecha et al 1999 consists of boosting the atmospheric conditions most often the atmospheric moisture to the physical limits more specifically the pmp t value for a storm of duration t at a given location can be obtained by stratz and hossain 2014 2 pmp t pobs t w p m a x t w p o b s where pobs t is the maximum observed depth of precipitation for the duration t at the location of the observed storm w p o b s is the precipitable water in the air column of the actual storm being maximized and w p m a x t is the maximum probable precipitable water in the moisture column in the transposed location where pmp is estimated several methods exist for estimating the latter for instance the usace estimates w p m a x t based on the maximum 12 hour persisting temperature dew point schreiner and riedel 1978 another method is to define w p m a x t as the 100 yr return precipitable water estimated from numerical simulations e g a regional climate model beauchamp et al 2013 in eq 2 pmp t is defined for the same duration and for the same area as the observed storm this value can be interpolated to another spatial area and another duration by using depth area duration curves u s department of commerce 1999 the pmp is converted into the pmf using either a hydrological model or the unit hydrograph method these methods require as input the maximum probable storm pms which is the hypothetical storm for a particular drainage area and duration that results from the pmp the pms temporal structure is commonly obtained by assuming a hyetograph specific to the climatic region for the continental u s see water resources program 2009 the pms spatial pattern is usually based on a standard isohyetal pattern that has a shape and orientation corresponding to that commonly observed at the location national weather service 1982 the pmf estimate is sensitive to both initial soil conditions and to the spatial and temporal patterns of the pms leading to uncertainty bounds that may be as large as 50 jakob 2013 in locations where pmf is likely to occur during periods when snowmelt may significantly contribute to runoff it is recommended to assume a 100 year return period snowpack debs et al 1999 beauchamp et al 2013 additional uncertainty is introduced in estimating the snowpack 3 3 concerns in the use of traditional methods with non stationarity if the drivers discussed in section 2 cause non stationarity in hydrological extremes the use of a stationary ffa or pmp pmf may lead to poor design estimates e g jain and lall 2001 sarewitz et al 2003 kunkel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 poor design estimates can occur for reasons such as 1 the available historic data may only partially sample the range of peak flow variability resulting from low frequency oscillations associated with natural climate variability or 2 a trend detection test may provide a false positive or false negative to illustrate how non stationarity can affect the design flood estimate we use the example of the red river of the north at fargo we fit the generalized extreme value distribution gev jenkinson 1955 for two sub periods of the annual maximum streamflow records 1902 1942 and 1943 2016 fig 5 displays the flood frequency curves for these two periods together with their confidence intervals as obtained via bootstrap obeysekera and salas 2014 the peak flow quantiles obtained from the period 1902 1942 are significantly different from those from 1943 to 2017 let us assume that in 1942 local engineers designed a levee based on the 100 year flood according to the available data 1902 1942 the design flood equals 17 103 cfs however this value was surpassed ten times during 1943 2017 fig 4 which would have potentially caused significant societal consequences on the flood frequency curve obtained with the 1943 2016 data the 17 103 cfs corresponds approximately to an 8 year flood using data from 1942 to 2016 the 100 year flood equals 57 103 cfs and corresponds to a 1500 year return period according to the 1902 1942 data this example illustrates how the use of ffa assuming stationarity may lead to under or over design should the peak flow distribution change 4 nonstationary design flood estimation this section describes the primary approaches to flood projection and subsequent design flood estimation under non stationarity fig 5 these approaches are often referred to as predict then act approaches in the sense that predicted change in flood quantiles are used for infrastructure design lempert et al 2004 this section focuses on anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability because they are major sources of non stationarity in the peak flow distribution or the pmp pmf although the overarching concepts are also relevant for changes in land use and river regulation 4 1 design based on flood frequency analysis under non stationarity from climate assuming non stationarity the first step in design flood estimation via ffa is projection of flood risk here the focus is on projection of the flood distribution although projection of future infrastructure cost and flood damages is also necessary for risk assessment there are two primary approaches to projection of the flood distribution 1 hydrologic simulation approaches combine simulation output from general circulation models gcms with downscaling and bias correction methods and hydrological modeling green box in fig 5 and 2 informed parameter approaches create statistical models with time varying parameters blue box in fig 5 the latter include trend informed models in which time is the only covariate and climate informed models in which climate variables are used as covariates 4 1 1 flood projection via hydrologic simulation approaches climate projections from gcms are often used for assessing future changes in river flows through a chain of models gcms are physically based models that attempt to consistently simulate the behavior of the atmosphere land surface and ocean including interactions among these components at a global scale scenarios that attempt to span the range of plausible future greenhouse gas emissions cmip3 experiment nakicenovic et al 20001 or concentrations cmip5 experiment taylor et al 2012 drive gcm projections of future climate variables because gcm outputs are subject to biases e g dai 2006 kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 sillmann et al 2013 crétat et al 2014 and are simulated at spatial resolutions that are coarser than the scale required by the hydrologic models to represent the paramount processes generating runoff fowler et al 2007 the outputs are commonly bias corrected and downscaled to create realistic inputs for hydrologic models maraun et al 2010 the downscaled and bias corrected gcm projections are then used to force physical or conceptual hydrologic models to simulate extreme streamflow use of this approach is wide spread and ranges from the catchment scale e g camici et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2010 ngongondo et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2003 to national continental and global scales e g alfieri et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 dankers and feyen 2009 dankers et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2008 2013 leng et al 2016 rojas et al 2011 2012 roudier et al 2016 the major advantage of using the chain of models is that the evolution of flood inducing weather variables under future atmospheric conditions is physically modeled however this framework suffers from several shortcomings discussed below e g kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 and overall is subject to a myriad of sources of uncertainty that arise from each step of the modeling framework stainforth et al 2007a wilby and dessai 2010 the use of gcm projections for assessment of hydrological extremes is questionable because gcm estimates of precipitation are biased particularly in extremes e g mehran et al 2014 which affects simulation of hydrological processes e g leander and buishand 2007 sperna weiland et al 2010 rocheta et al 2014 in particular gcms do not simulate the physical processes that generate extreme precipitation that trigger most flood events because those processes occur at spatial scales that are finer than model resolutions e g boberg et al 2007 leander and buishand 2007 wuebbles et al 2014 crétat et al 2014 in comparison to observations historical simulations usually underestimate precipitation extremes which suggests an underestimation of projected precipitation extremes kundzewicz et al 2017 likely resulting in an underestimation of future peak flows bias correction and downscaling which sometimes involves implicit bias correction are common approaches to mitigating the bias and coarse resolution of gcm outputs with the goal of producing more hydrologically relevant projections of climate bias correction is the correction of model output towards observations in a post processing step ehret et al 2012 bias correction methods have multiple disadvantages 1 bias is corrected without consideration of the forcing or structural errors which may be causing the bias 2 bias in statistics other than the mean such as the variance is often not corrected teutschbein and seibert 2012 and 3 bias is assumed time invariant i e bias identified in the current period can be used to correct bias in future periods which can cause misleading results when assessing hydrological extremes e g ehret et al 2012 maurer et al 2013 velázquez et al 2015 thus bias correction alone is not recommended for future flood design downscaling methods can be classified into three main categories 1 delta change factor methods or perturbation methods 2 statistical methods and 3 dynamical methods ekström et al 2015 for comprehensive reviews see also fowler et al 2007 madsen et al 2014 delta change factor methods perturb observed time series of precipitation and temperature with changes identified by gcm projections e g prudhomme et al 2002 2003 lehner et al 2006 kay et al 2006 more sophisticated variations of this method can account for seasonal effects and changes in variability e g hingray et al 2007 willems and vrac 2011 statistical downscaling methods include 1 regression methods which rely on multivariate statistics representing the link between large scale climate predictors and local predictands e g bürger and chen 2005 hessami et al 2008 2 resampling methods such as weather typing and climate analogs which rely on the relationship between synoptic meteorological patterns and local predictands e g boé et al 2006 lafaysse et al 2014 pierce et al 2014 raynaud et al 2017 and 3 stochastic weather generators which simulate time series of chosen weather variables reproducing observed or pre defined statistics or patterns conditioned on large scale or synoptic circulations e g qian et al 2002 chen et al 2018 finally dynamical downscaling methods consist of using regional climate models rcms which are similar to gcms but have higher resolution and smaller modeling domains see rummukainen et al 2010 xue et al 2014 for reviews because rcms produce their own bias in addition to inheriting bias from gcm boundary conditions rcm projections are commonly further bias corrected and downscaled sunyer et al 2012 for analysis of possible future design floods delta change factors are not recommended because they do not account for local differences that exist within the same gcm grid cell and for any feedback processes ekström et al 2015 the computational cost associated with the use of rcms is still sufficiently high to limit the temporal span of projections reducing confidence in subsequent ffa also rcm projections are usually available for only a few gcm rcm realizations and thus do not span the range of gcm internal variability rather use of an ensemble of statistical methods is recommended for two reasons first no single method out performs others in intercomparison studies of statistical downscaling methods bronstert et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2018 thus it is impossible to definitively choose one method second downscaling contributes as much if not more uncertainty as the forcing scenario and gcm model bürger et al 2013 hingray and saïd 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 thus it is necessary to estimate the uncertainty through the use of an ensemble regardless of what downscaling methods are chosen it is crucial to evaluate the resulting climate scenarios for their climatic credibility and plausibility i e are current climate conditions well represented and is the realization of possible future climate physically sound as well as their relevance and quality for hydrologic impact analysis bronstert et al 2007 the bias corrected and downscaled climate projections are then used to drive hydrologic models to simulate streamflow at a given location e g hingray et al 2014 although the comparison of different hydrologic models has a long standing history in hydrology e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 the implications of hydrologic modeling choices for assessing changing environmental conditions has recently emerged as a concern e g merz et al 2011 brigode et al 2013 mendoza et al 2015 hydrologic modeling choices as discussed by mendoza et al 2016 include assuming time invariant model parameters model structure e g chen et al 2013 wi et al 2015 the spatial resolution of input data e g lobligeois et al 2014 essou et al 2016 the existence of multiple optimal parameter sets e g wi et al 2015 calibration and validation periods e g coron et al 2012 2014 and the calibration objective function studies that have examined the effect of these choices on flood projection have found that while the importance of different sources of uncertainty varies by hydrologic regime and return period kay et al 2009 the uncertainty from future climate can be as much or more than the uncertainty from the model structure booij 2005 steinschneider et al 2015a and that estimates of the 100 year can vary widely depending on the combination of modeling choices brigode et al 2015 wi et al 2015 due to the uncertainty stemming from hydrologic models an ensemble of model structures and parameter sets is recommended the latter could be inferred using various calibration and validation periods if computational constraints make an ensemble undesirable a simple sensitivity analysis could indicate the magnitude of uncertainty stemming from hydrologic models relative to gcms and downscaling methods if the hydrologic model uncertainty is of comparable or greater magnitude then the ensemble should be reconsidered 4 1 2 flood projection via informed parameter approaches informed parameter approaches use statistical models with time varying parameters to allow the flood distribution to be nonstationary e g serago and vogel 2018 in other words eq 1 becomes y t f θ 1 t θ k t and provides a peak flow distribution for each time step usually annual out to the planning horizon for the most recent and exhaustive review of nonstationary statistical methods see salas et al 2018 there are two main approaches the first termed the trend informed approach makes use of the historical trend to model non stationarity in the peak flow distribution e g el adlouni et al 2007 rootzén and katz 2013 salas and obeysekera 2014 luke et al 2017 the second termed the climate informed approach e g sankarasubramanian and lall 2003 kwon et al 2008 is to model the temporal evolution of the flood distribution parameters using large scale climate variables as covariates a common practice is to try a variety of models e g either trends or covariates for various distribution parameters or moments and retain the best model often assessed using a criterion such as the akaike or bayesian information criterion however assessment of the best model should also consider whether the modeled changes can be linked to physical processes and whether those links will remain valid under future climate conditions e g jiang et al 2016 for example a time varying location parameter could correspond to changes in moisture content of storms and their intensity stedinger and griffis 2011 while a time varying scale parameter could correspond to changes in storm features e g winter storm vs snowmelt in the trend informed approach model parameters are 3 θ k t n 0 n a k n t n where θ k t is the value of the k th parameter of the flood distribution for time t a k n are regression coefficients and n is the regression order usually n equals 1 i e linear relation or 2 i e quadratic relation the trend informed approach has been primarily used to model non stationarity in the historical period for characterizing historical changes e g strupczewski et al 2001 delgado et al 2010 vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 šraj et al 2016 hu et al 2017 the use of the trend informed approach for assessing future design values relies on the questionable assumption that historical trends will remain the same over the entire planning period jain and lall 2001 he et al 2006 sivapalan and samuel 2009 blöschl and montanari 2010 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 in an analysis of 1250 stream gauges across the u s trend informed models were rarely preferred even when a trend was detected in the first half of the record because it rarely persisted into the second half however for gauges where the physical processes underlying the trend did continue an updated stationary model which used the parameters of the trend informed model at the end of the first half of the record was generally preferred luke et al 2017 additionally trend informed models are often limited by sampling uncertainty and model structure uncertainty and robustness for example two models with comparable goodness of fit for the historical period can lead to significantly different flood quantiles for future periods serinaldi and kilsby 2015 given these limitations a high level of caution is needed when using trend informed models to assess future flood design values climate informed model parameters are 4 θ k t m 1 m k n 0 n k m a k m n x k m n t where x k m is the value of the m th climate covariates at time t for the parameter θ k t and a k m n are the regression coefficients compared to eq 3 the time variable has been replaced by covariates x k m which are usually large scale climate variables but can also be non climatic such as a reservoir index lópez and francés 2013 or carbon dioxide concentrations hirsch and ryberg 2012 the number of climate covariates will depend on the parameter and the regression order will depend on both the parameter and the number of covariates implementing climate informed models requires identifying the relevant climate patterns and or variables that drive flood occurrence and magnitude over the study region the choice of the relevant covariates usually follows from analysis of the hydro climatology scientific literature and historic reports for the considered area e g delgado et al 2012 schlef et al 2018a in the case where identification of covariates is not straightforward there are a variety of available methods time series correlation e g kwon et al 2008 correlation maps e g schlef et al 2018a composite analysis e g jain and lall 2001 weather typing e g robertson et al 2015 simulation experiments e g cook 1999 and use of a bayesian frameworks to identify spatial patterns in gridded data renard and lall 2014 projections of the covariates to drive changes in flood distribution parameters are usually obtained from gcms blue box on fig 2 this requires the covariates to be well reproduced by gcms thus favoring covariates defined over large spatial domains and at monthly to seasonal temporal scales rather than daily localized precipitation used to force hydrologic models for instance maximum annual precipitation over a region should not be used as covariate because of low gcm skill e g boberg et al 2007 leander and buishand 2007 wuebbles et al 2014 crétat et al 2014 similar to downscaling approaches e g greene et al 2011 the use of both thermodynamic and dynamic covariates is expected to increase model robustness under climate change climate informed models have been used for analyzing or reconstructing historical variability of hydrological extremes e g griffis and stedinger 2007b kwon et al 2008 li and tan 2015 bracken et al 2018 and for projecting future peak flow delgado et al 2014 tramblay et al 2014 condon et al 2015 schlef et al 2018a similar to the hydrologic simulation approach the credibility of flood projections derived from climate informed models is subject to limitations and uncertainties stemming from the use of gcms but unlike the simulation approach avoids the uncertainty stemming from downscaling methods and hydrological models although gcm performance regarding highly studied climate patterns such as enso and pdo is generally acceptable and well characterized e g taschetto et al 2014 yim et al 2015 this may not be the case for other climate variables relevant to a specific gauge location such as soil moisture yuan and quiring 2017 furthermore gcms often do not correctly reproduce correlations between climate patterns e g kim et al 2017 and calculation of some large scale climate indices from gcm outputs can be prohibitively difficult projections from climate informed models are also highly influenced by the choice of covariates which depends on the modeler s experience and knowledge of the study area and even the best combination of covariates is unlikely to fully explain peak flow variability e g delgado et al 2012 finally uncertainty stemming from sampling model structure and robustness of covariates under future climate remains poorly characterized e g merz et al 2014 despite these limitations climate informed models are a relatively new and appealing alternative to flood projection via hydrologic simulation 4 1 3 nonstationary return periods and risk assessment for design the definition of nonstationary return periods is still an area of on going research and discussion flood projections derived from trend informed models can use a revised concept of return period defined as the mean expected time from the current date to the first occurrence of a flood event that exceeds the chosen design value cooley 2013 salas and obeysekera 2014 or equivalently the time length for which the probability of exceedance is one parey et al 2007 calculation of this revised return period requires that time varying probabilities of exceedance be summed to infinity eq 4 3 in cooley 2013 and that the temporal evolution of flood events be correctly represented this revised return period cannot be applied to projections derived from either the hydrologic simulation approach or climate informed models because they do not meet those two conditions i e most of the gcms project climate for the next century only and cannot predict the temporality of events consequently return periods for flood projections derived not using a trend informed model are often calculated assuming stationarity within a chosen time window e g 1950 2000 for a historic period and 2050 2100 for a future period schlef et al 2018a which re assumes stationarity and imposes short record lengths e g 50 years from which to calculate extreme values e g the 100 or 500 year flood alternatives to either the revised return period or re assuming stationarity include the design life level which is the probability of the event occurring within the planning horizon rootzén and katz 2013 and reliability which is the probability that an exceedance event will not occur over the planning period i e expected performance rather than expected failure read and vogel 2015 once nonstationary flood probabilities have been determined from the flood projections as in the stationary case design can be based on either pre determined return periods or a risk based approach e g schlef 2018 frequently nonstationary risk based approaches are embedded into sequential decision frameworks such as a decision tree cf loucks et al 2005 to infer sequential adaptation measures e g manning et al 2009 gersonius et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 4 2 probable maximum precipitation and flood under non stationarity from climate whether the pmp and subsequent pmf are likely to change at a given location is a subject of controversy jakob 2013 for instance highlighted a subtle change in the pmp definition in the most recent wmo guidelines i e 2009 compared to 1986 the new definition states that pmp is the theoretical maximum precipitation for a given duration under modern meteorological conditions which emphasizes that the pmp may have changed in the past and could be modified in the future should the climate change to date there are no federal guidelines for dam design that account for potential changes in pmf perhaps due to the perspective that there is no compelling evidence that would support climate related changes in pmfs and that current design recommendations should be changed only when substantial research quantitatively demonstrates a link usace 2016 however recent academic research using both climate projections and historical trends although still nascent indicates there likely is a link significant increases in pmp have been shown for the whole contiguous u s kunkel et al 2013 specific locations within the u s stratz and hossain 2014 gangrade et al 2018 and specific locations in canada rousseau et al 2014 clavet gaumont et al 2017 regardless to date no method has become widely acknowledged for projection of future pmp and pmf under climate change and thus we are unable to offer guidance on specific methods 5 addressing design flood uncertainty at the most basic level uncertainty in design flood values can be broadly conceptualized as being comprised of two components aleatory uncertainty is essential unavoidable unpredictability or chance i e the residual unpredictability of events given models and parameters while epistemic uncertainty is lack of knowledge or ignorance i e roughly lack of confidence about parameters and models spiegelhalter riesch 2011 however the complexity of climate change has led to the concept of deep or severe uncertainty which results from myriad factors both scientific and social and consequently is difficult to accurately define and quantify kandlikar et al 2005 for more discussion see also lempert et al 2004 hall et al 2007 hall et al 2012 ray and brown 2015 both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty are present under the assumption of stationarity deep uncertainty is added under the assumption of non stationarity this section first describes uncertainty quantification and attribution and then describes methods for incorporating uncertainty into design 5 1 uncertainty quantification and attribution a common approach to quantifying aleatory and epistemic uncertainty is through confidence intervals e g dashed curves in fig 4 which have long been a topic of active research in hydrologic science e g iacwd 1982 stedinger 1983 ashkar et al 1987 hu 1987 schendel et al 2015 england jr et al 2018 under stationarity confidence intervals are generally obtained through the variance of the design quantiles e g lu and stedinger 1992 under non stationarity assessment of confidence intervals is less straightforward obeysekera and salas 2014 described three methods 1 a delta method which is based the large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators 2 a bootstrap method which is based on the bootstrap of standardized data which are then used to fit an ensemble of nonstationary models and 3 a profile likelihood method from coles 2001 which uses the log likelihood function the delta and bootstrap methods are more computationally efficient but less accurate compared to the profile likelihood method for lack of a better approach quantification of deep uncertainty has been generally based on the use of ensembles of forcing scenarios initial conditions and models or methods e g the ensembles of gcm projections in ipcc 2014 in this case the spread of the ensemble is considered to provide some albeit limited and usually underestimated indication of the level of associated uncertainty stainforth et al 2007b there is significant research effort aimed at reducing ensemble spread by improving models however significant reductions are only possible with hundreds if not thousands of additional years of observations leach 2007 alternatively other efforts aim to achieve a more informative ensemble spread by selecting gcms which demonstrate good performance or are independent knutti et al 2013 steinschneider et al 2015b however since non independent gcms are more likely to project changes toward the same direction and or with comparable magnitude the use of an increasing number of non independent models into an ensemble could lead to an apparent reduction of the uncertainty although this reduction is likely to be meaningless knutti 2010 the use of ensembles has led to many attribution studies e g hawkins and sutton 2009 hingray and saïd 2014 which use methods of sensitivity analysis such as anova to partition to the total uncertainty as represented by the ensemble spread into portions attributable to specific sources which may include forcing scenario initial conditions model structure model parameters etc stainforth et al 2007a 5 2 incorporating uncertainty into design under the assumption of stationarity the common engineering approach to incorporating uncertainty in design is through safety factors or freeboard in the context of levee or dam design which in some cases is even applied to the already conservative pmf e g fema 2012 shaw 2009 nyc rules 2013 notably such safety factors are usually independent of the confidence interval estimation of uncertainty which is not generally used in design as stated in bulletin 17c application of confidence intervals in reaching water resource planning decisions depends upon the needs of the user england jr et al 2018 and proposed approaches are generally limited to research applications if for example the risk of under design must be reduced to 5 a possible approach although naïve could be to use the value of the upper bound of 90 confidence interval could be used while this use is straightforward and can easily be applied in practice it overinterprets the mathematic definition of the intervals e g klemeš 2002 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 another proposed use entails a cost benefit analysis to determine a design value which accounts for epistemic uncertainty arising from parameter estimation botto et al 2014 2017 gaume 2018 under the assumption of non stationarity particularly as arises from climate change there are three primary means of incorporating uncertainty in design climate factors i e the application of an additional safety factor specifically addressing the uncertainty from climate change the prudent approach i e use of information that is known with relatively high confidence to qualitatively inform whether additional protection should be considered in design and robustness based decision methods i e finding a design which is satisficing over a wide array of plausible futures as a side note taking the weighted mean of the ensemble which is an approach commonly used to summarize the oftentimes overwhelming amount of information from future climate projections serves only to conceal the uncertainty and negatively impact characterization of extremes rather than actively incorporate that uncertainty into design 5 2 1 climate factors in the context of uncertainty associated with climate change additional safety factors are called climate allowances or climate factors through a review of existing guidelines in europe madsen et al 2014 found that the use of climate factors with the explicit purpose of protecting against climate change is rare exceptions include germany norway and the united kingdom defra 2006 hennegriff et al 2006 lawrence and hisdal 2011 environmental agency 2016 although climate factors are easy to apply such a simplistic adjustment to peak flow estimates is a result of poorly understood impacts of future climate change e g kuklicke and demeritt 2016 climate factors lack flexibility because they are generally prescribed for a single time horizon one exception is the recent united kingdom guidelines and incorrectly estimate small scale variability because they are usually defined by basin or political boundaries madsen et al 2014 calculation of climate factors is generally described in technical reports which often lack clear descriptions of calculation methods and are based on the difference between historical and projected simulations of streamflow from gcms furthermore studies that assess climate factor performance are limited but needed especially given that the resulting climate factors can be highly sensitive to the modeling choices e g the first generation of united kingdom climate factors see reynard et al 2005 defra 2006 prudhomme et al 2010 5 2 2 prudent approach even under deep uncertainty the direction of change of some key variables can be known with relatively high confidence for example temperature has and will continue to increase under climate change this information can be used to qualitatively infer the likely direction of change in hydrological extremes e g decreased snowpack would lead to smaller and earlier peak flows or intensified extreme precipitation will increase peak flows assuming sufficiently negligible feedback effects given this information decision makers might decide to opt for a prudent approach based on the precautionary principle gollier and treich 2003 in the context of climate change mitigation kirkwood 2011 noted that the prudent path lies somewhere between doing absolutely nothing about climate change and doing everything possible in the context of decision making for hydrologic design the prudent approach consists of making design decisions based on expected changes in peak flows or their drivers that are known with relatively high confidence the prudent approach is especially applicable for projects involving discrete choices such as levee height or the size of a pump station for example given a discrete set of return periods used for design if the 50 year flood was initially selected but there was high confidence that future peak flows would increase the prudent approach would choose the next discrete level such as the 100 year flood this is often justifiable when its marginal cost is small compared to the total infrastructure cost hallegate 2009 an even more precautionary approach to flood risk adapted by the scottish environment protection agency is to prohibit development of flood sensitive projects in medium to high risk areas sepa 2017 5 2 3 robustness based decision methods to deal with deep uncertainty associated with climate change lempert 2002 introduced the idea of robustness unlike a risk based approach which finds an optimal design for one assumed future state of the world a robustness based approach finds a design that will be satisficing i e perform well simon 1956 for a large range of plausible futures multiple approaches using the concept of robustness have been developed robust decision making lempert 2003 info gap analysis ben haim 2006 scenario neutral approach prudhomme et al 2010 and decision scaling brown et al 2011 2012 stakhiv 2011 provides an extended discussion on the use of robust decision making methods for water resource management under climate change both info gap analysis and decision scaling have been specifically applied to design of flood infrastructure hine and hall 2010 steinschneider et al 2015a spence and brown 2016 2018 knighton et al 2017 and the scenario neutral approach has been applied to determine system vulnerability to hydrological extremes without prescribing a design value prudhomme et al 2010 despite the value of robustness based decision methods quantitative approaches to their implementation are relatively new and require increased application and improvement for example hall et al 2012 showed that info gap and robust decision making provide similar but not identical solutions for the same case study yet note that the comparison improved understanding of the system and the proposed management options 6 discussion and conclusion this paper addresses the need for guidance on design for riverine floods under non stationarity in particular section 2 addresses evidence and drivers of non stationarity as well as methods for detection and attribution the key points are theoretical reasons historical evidence indicate that flood hazard is possibly changing at some locations due to climate change for design of short life infrastructure 30 years the natural climate variability signal dominates the anthropogenic climate change signal consequently assuming stationarity may be adequate but long historical records are recommended for inferring model parameters for design of long life infrastructure 30 years the assumption of stationarity may not be valid due to anthropogenic climate change impacting the magnitude occurrence and typology of floods the structure inherent in natural climate variability can confound trend analysis and should be diagnosed and addressed when possible methods for detecting change are imperfect however this effect can be reduced through regionalization and using long historical records section 3 addresses status quo flood design which assumes stationarity the key points are design of long life infrastructure is usually based on either 1 ffa with pre specified return periods or risk minimization or 2 the concepts of pmp and pmf if flood hazard is indeed nonstationary the status quo can lead to costly over design or dangerous under design section 4 addresses methods for nonstationary flood design under climate change the key points are for nonstationary flood design ffa must use projections from either hydrologic simulation or informed parameter approaches such projections rely on gcm projections of future climate which often have biased precipitation estimates and unknown future skill for the hydrologic simulation approach o bias correction alone and delta change downscaling methods are not recommended o use of the projections currently available from rcms are not recommended because the simulation periods are often too short to estimate flood frequency the small number of gcm rcm realizations does not allow a correct representation of the range of gcm internal variability o the use of gcm projections can be improved through statistical downscaling but use of an ensemble of downscaling methods and evaluation of method credibility is recommended because no one method outperforms others and because downscaling adds considerable uncertainty o ensembles of hydrologic models are recommended in cases where the ensuing uncertainty is comparable to or greater than that from gcms and downscaling methods a sensitivity analysis could be used to infer the relative contribution of hydrological models to the total uncertainty for informed parameter approaches o trend informed models are not recommended for projection because historical trends will not necessarily persist during the entire planning period o climate informed models are an appealing alternative to hydrologic simulation but are still a relatively new and untested methodology and should be used as a complementary approach nonstationary return periods are difficult to define and provide minimal design guidance instead the concepts of design life level and reliability which transparently communicate probability of failure are recommended for guiding design since studies of changing pmp and pmf are nascent and no clear and well established methods for assessing change exist no method is recommended despite the possibility that pmp and pmf are nonstationary under climate change section 5 addresses quantification and attribution of design flood uncertainty and approaches to incorporating uncertainty associated with climate change into design the key points are aleatory and epistemic uncertainty are present under the assumption of stationarity deep uncertainty is added in the context of non stationarity from climate change confidence intervals are recommended for communicating aleatory and epistemic uncertainty although their use for design is often unclear ensembles are recommended for characterizing deep uncertainty despite indicating only the lower bounds of the full uncertainty range for design robustness based decision methods are recommended to account for climate change uncertainty if a robustness based approach is not possible the use of either climate factors or prudent approach should be considered some very clear and relatively unsurprising avenues of needed future research arise from this review first future research should aim to cultivate non traditional sources of data that can be used to extend observed records such as historical information e g written records and paleo data e g tree rings and sediment cores and generate improved future records e g satellite data and crowd sourced streamflow measurement second given the strengths and weaknesses of methods for flood hazard projection for ffa future research should focus on improved understanding of the climate processes driving floods more applications of the climate informed approach and methods for assessing the potential credibility of projections under climate change for pmp and pmf future research should address uncertainty reduction for pmp and pmf and development of methods for projection that can be widely accepted finally more research is needed on application and evaluation of methods for incorporating deep uncertainty into design to conclude this discussion about design considerations under non stationarity specifically in the context of climate change it is worth quoting jakob 2013 design with change in mind not just climate think across disciplines whether stationarity is dead milly et al 2008 alive lins and cohn 2011 immortal montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 or undead serinaldi and kilsby 2015 is not really important provided that the chosen approach to design can sufficiently represent the physical system and its evolution the ultimate goal is robust or even resilient design that avoids both sunk capital costs and massive flood damages thus when inference from climate projections lack significant change in flood drivers over the design horizon the stationarity assumption may be preferred however in the presence of observed or theoretical evidence that flood hazard is changing or is likely to change in the future then the non stationarity assumption may be preferred while this review focused on climate change non climatic factors also can cause changes in flood hazard possibly on shorter time scales the impact of both climate and non climate factors on flood hazard signals the end of the static design paradigm brown 2010 this implies that the chosen design may fail more quickly than expected hence the growing focus on resilient design across many disciplines including flood design e g park et al 2011 sayers et al 2012 additionally this implies that design should be able to tolerate various levels of failure rather than existing solely in binary failure or non failure states meaning that non structural flood solutions should be designed conjunctively with structural solutions finally while a static infrastructure design may be optimal for the most likely future in a risk based approach or satisficing for most plausible futures in a robustness based approach the end of static design promotes adaptive flood risk management which benefits from increasing knowledge through time e g hui et al 2018 adaptive flood risk management can reduce or delay initial and often large investment costs associated with infrastructure construction which may subsequently become unnecessary under future states of the world there are two adaptive approaches which have been applied to flood risk management 1 dynamic adaptive policy pathways haasnoot et al 2013 and 2 real options analysis e g hino and hall 2017 these adaptive approaches should be combined with robustness based approaches to promote design under non stationarity from climate change

6453,conventional methods for designing infrastructure that is subject to flood risk such as dams and levees assume a stationary design flood however observed and potential non stationarity in floods can result in costly over design or dangerous under design despite substantial attention evidence from the literature makes clear there is no consensus methodology for estimating design variables under climate change practical guidance remains elusive this paper presents a review of the challenges and advances in design of infrastructure for floods under non stationarity first potential sources of non stationarity in time series of floods are described to provide context and motivation second methods for estimating design floods that rely on the stationary assumption are presented and their limitations are discussed third methods for estimating design floods that assume non stationarity resulting from climate change are summarized finally the inadequacies of current design methodologies in view of the pervasive uncertainties are assessed and strategies to manage the consequences of those uncertainties are presented keywords flood design climate change uncertainty 1 introduction infrastructure such as dams and levees are built to reduce risk from hydrological extremes such as riverine floods conventionally such infrastructure is designed to protect against flood events up to a chosen magnitude this so called design flood is commonly defined as the flow quantile with a selected frequency of occurrence or return period for example the 100 year return flood is typical for designing levees and other protection structures e g olsen 2006 more recently the design value is sometimes chosen based on maximizing net economic benefits i e avoided damages by implementing flood protection less the cost of the protection or minimizing the expected damages of flooding e g lund 2002 for infrastructure where failure would lead to tremendous damages such as very large dams some national and regional agencies use the concepts of probable maximum precipitation or flood pmp or pmf rather than statistical approaches for design wmo 2009 all of these approaches to design flood estimation make use of the assumption of stationarity notably however stationarity lacks a well established definition within the hydrologic and water system analysis literature for instance milly et al 2008 described stationarity as the idea that natural systems fluctuate within an unchanging envelope of variability montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 referencing kolmogorov 1931 1938 and khintchine 1934 defined as stationary a process that undergoes change but its statistics are conserved other studies such as that by salas et al 2018 maintain that stationary means the marginal distribution remains invariant in time in this review we adopt the definition by salas et al 2018 in the context of design for riverine floods this definition of stationary implies that the design flood is time invariant and hence the probability of infrastructure failure remains constant for the duration of the design life there is now a significant body of literature claiming that it is no longer valid to assume the design flood is stationary this claim is based on theoretical considerations and observational evidence from some locations that flood risk is changing due to climate change and socio economic development e g dankers et al 2014 winsemius et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 berghuijs et al 2017 and references within while flood risk combines hydrological hazard and vulnerability merz et al 2010 here the focus is hydrological hazard which is the probability of occurrence of a given flood magnitude the concern is that if the design flood is indeed nonstationary then an assumption of stationarity could result in over or under design jain and lall 2001 rosner et al 2014 over design occurs when infrastructure becomes too large as peak flows decrease leading to sunk capital and operating costs conversely under design occurs when infrastructure becomes too small as peak flows increase leading to societal impacts such as human casualties and economic damages which are generally of higher concern than sunk costs rosner et al 2014 for instance the american society of civil engineers estimates that about 150 billion in flood damages resulting from hurricane katrina were due to under design of levees and other flood protection structures asce 2007 to avoid over or under design hirsch 2011 recommends that once we recognize that we have nonstationarity for a variety of reasons we really have to rethink our approach to planning this quote summarizes the increasingly common motivation to improve current and develop new design approaches that account for non stationarity in hydro meteorological processes and thus improve the robustness and resilience of flood infrastructure beven 2011 kundzewicz et al 2017 for example in 2010 a workshop in boulder colorado u s gathered hydrologists climatologists engineers and scientists around the question if stationarity is dead what do we do galloway 2011 one topic was whether the u s federal guidelines for flood frequency analysis as described in bulletin 17b iacwd 1982 should be updated to account for non stationarity eight years later the update bulletin 17c acknowledges evidence of non stationarity but provides no concrete guidance for its incorporation into analysis and design instead suggesting that in situations of sufficient evidence for climate induced non stationarity water practitioners should employ time varying parameters or other appropriate techniques england jr et al 2018 however water practitioners do not generally know the range of available methods for flood frequency analysis assuming non stationarity serinaldi and kilsby 2015 even though the use of such approaches and models have gained popularity in academia e g strupczewski et al 2001 delgado et al 2010 katz 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 yu et al 2015 spence and brown 2016 šraj et al 2016 see salas et al 2018 for a review this lack of knowledge likely stems from the proliferation of approaches and the many challenges associated with assuming non stationarity challenges include but are not limited to comprehensively diagnosing the drivers of change e g anthropogenic climate change or natural climate variability vogel et al 2011 deser et al 2012a elmer et al 2012 merz et al 2012 harrigan et al 2014 determining how change affects the flood time series e g when a trend is detected a statistically significant mean shift can also be detected or distribution moments i e mean variance skewness and kurtosis although in practice observational records are too short to detect changes in the latter two coles 2001 xiong and guo 2004 villarini et al 2009a katz 2013 and identifying appropriate mathematical models to represent change e g multiple mathematical models have been used to represent change in annual maximum flows at the little sugar creek charlotte north carolina leading to widely different estimates of the 100 year flood villarini et al 2009b salas and obeysekera 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 this paper addresses the need for guidance on design for riverine floods under non stationarity particularly as associated with climate change by providing a comprehensive review of available design methods and guidelines section 2 reviews the main drivers that can lead to changes in peak flow magnitude and frequency and then discusses methods commonly used for detection of change and attribution to specific drivers section 3 reviews the available stationary approaches to design flood estimation and provides an example application with record of flood events showing non stationarity section 4 describes current methods for estimating the design flood assuming non stationarity section 5 discusses the available options for addressing uncertainty section 6 concludes with an outlook on future flood design and further research 2 what assumption should be made the question of whether to assume a stationary or non stationary design flood is closely tied to considerations of the spatiotemporal scales associated with the natural and anthropogenic processes that drive flood events and the intended infrastructure design fig 1 clearly the processes acting on the timescale of the design event for a storm water management system e g 10 year flood are vastly different from those acting on the timescale of a pmf used for dam design in this context this section explores 1 potential non stationarity induced by processes driving flood events 2 methods for detecting change in peak flow series and 3 methods for attributing observed change to specific drivers the discussion is supported further by examples to illustrate the issues associated with the range of spatiotemporal scales that influence the magnitude and occurrence of flood events as well as their detection and attribution to particular drivers 2 1 evidence and drivers of non stationarity in riverine floods riverine floods are primarily driven by 1 precipitation which is driven by natural climate variability e g deser et al 2012a and anthropogenic climate change e g zhang and delworth 2018 and 2 land surface response which is driven by land use change river regulation and natural catastrophes each of these drivers are potential sources of non stationarity the red river of the north at fargo north dakota u s is a particularly salient example of nonstationary stream flow fig 2 mueller and foley 2014 although flagged as regulated by the u s geological survey the u s army corps of engineers usace demonstrated that changes in streamflow beginning in the early 1940 s villarini et al 2009a cannot be explained by flow regulation see discussion in serinaldi and kilsby 2015 instead tree ring analysis has shown that the river experiences high and low flood modes which extend from several decades to nearly a century george and nielsen 2003 natural climate variability sometimes called internal climate variability is variability of the climate system that occurs in the absence of external forcing and includes processes intrinsic to the atmosphere the ocean and the coupled ocean atmosphere system deser et al 2012b natural climate variability generally considered to occur on timescales of 30 years or less with exceptions is comprised of two components acting at different spatiotemporal scales 1 noise at local and regional scales and 2 low frequency oscillations at regional to sub global scales that have a global influence on hydrology deser et al 2012a hulme et al 1999 for example the el nino southern oscillation enso occurs in the tropical pacific but influences hydrology around the globe trenberth 1997 ward et al 2014 lee et al 2018 natural climate variability can affect flood magnitude e g hannaford and marsh 2008 schlef et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 frequency of occurrence e g andrews et al 2004 delgado et al 2012 hodgkins et al 2017 kiem et al 2003 mallakpour and villarini 2016a and timing e g blöschl et al 2017 for other examples of the influence of natural climate variability of floods see also petrow et al 2009 prudhomme and genevier 2011 villarini et al 2013 wilby and quinn 2013 armstrong et al 2014 li and tan 2015 bracken et al 2018 natural climate variability is generally thought to cause temporal clustering or semi cyclical patterns in floods e g jain and lall 2001 anthropogenic climate change is forcing of the atmosphere by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission leading to global scale changes in the coupled ocean atmospheric system ipcc 2014 notably in model simulations natural climate variability dominates the signal in precipitation and temperature due to anthropogenic climate change until around 2050 hawkins and sutton 2011 deser et al 2012b hingray and saïd 2014 whateley and brown 2016 schlef et al 2018b martel et al 2018 at the horizon 2050 natural climate variability may still be difficult to separate from anthropogenic climate change effects on integrated variables such as streamflow and crop yields e g hulme et al 1999 there is physically based evidence that ongoing anthropogenic climate change may lead to an intensification of and changes in the water cycle worldwide ipcc 2014 leading to changes in floods e g milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 warmer air temperatures will increase atmospheric moisture holding capacity leading to an increase in the intensity and variability of extreme precipitation lenderink and meijgaard 2008 trenberth 2011 berg and haerter 2013 fischer and knutti 2016 yin et al 2018 likely affecting flash and short rain floods for flood definitions here and subsequently see merz and blöschl 2003 warmer temperatures will also cause snowpack accumulation to shrink in mountainous regions and at high latitudes barnett et al 2005 and change the timing and rate of snowmelt e g mccabe and clark 2005 blöschl et al 2017 musselman et al 2017 in general these modifications are likely to decrease rain on snow and snowmelt floods but are dependent on local trends additionally there will be changes in storm tracks and individual storm intensities linked to changes in the underlying large scale circulation patterns bengtsson et al 2006 boé and terray 2008 knutson et al 2010 santos et al 2016 shaw et al 2016 likely affecting short and long rain floods apart from the possibility of a tipping point anthropogenic climate change is generally thought to produce slow and long term trend like changes in floods land use changes include urbanization forest management and agricultural practices which can affect floods for up to several centuries but can only be verified at spatial scales up to several tens of square kilometers blöschl et al 2007 rogger et al 2017 in particular the expansion of impervious areas due to urbanization decreases infiltration which weakens the buffering effect of the natural ecosystem causes changes hydrological extremes e g rose and peters 2001 smith et al 2002 konrad 2003 moglen and shivers 2006 saghafian et al 2008 villarini et al 2009a b vogel et al 2011 land use changes are thought to cause either change points or trend like changes in floods river regulation or training can range from construction of dams and weirs to straightening meandering or braided rivers the impacts of river regulation on floods varies for one example of the magnitude of impact see vorogushyn and merz 2013 for large rivers the effects of river regulation on floods may be as much or greater than land use changes lammersen et al 2002 bronstert et al 2007 in the case of channel modification the impact is largest when the flood remains in the riverbed hall et al 2014 river regulation is generally thought to introduce change points in floods natural catastrophes in particular volcanos cause immediate and massive impacts at local and regional scales cause global cooling and changes in hydrology in the first several years after the event and may contribute to long lasting and global climate change under certain conditions hofmann 1987 major and mark 2006 schneider et al 2009 trenberth and dai 2007 natural catastrophes are generally thought to introduce change points in floods but are not generally considered in non stationary analyses 2 2 detection of change in peak flow records tracking or anticipating change in hydrologic extremes is the typical starting point when considering the adequacy of the current flood risk management strategy at a given location there are a variety of methods available for detecting trends and shifts in hydrological time series see the reviews by kundzewicz and robson 2004 khaliq et al 2009 madsen et al 2014 bayazit 2015 the world meteorological organization wmo 2009 recommends the non parametric mann kendall test for trend analysis mk kendall 1975 it does not require an assumed probability distribution has been widely applied to hydrologic extremes e g petrow and mertz 2009 petrow et al 2009 villarini et al 2009b mediero et al 2014 archfield et al 2016 and has been adapted to account for long term persistence hamed 2008 for detecting shifts the non parametric pettitt test 1979 which is easily implementable has been widely used e g villarini et al 2009a rougé et al 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 li and tan 2015 mallakpour and villarini 2016b however it only detects one shift within a time series unlike the rodionov test 2004 these and other methods do not always correctly detect trends and shifts as illustrated by simulation experiments where the trend is stochastically generated spence and brown 2016 and is highly dependent on spatiotemporal scale fig 1 specifically the outcome of statistical tests for trend detection depends on the hydrological record length blöschl and montanari 2010 barros et al 2014 using the red river of the north at fargo as an example fig 2 we applied the mk test to three periods the first 1943 1961 shows a significant downward trend the second 1943 1988 shows no significant trend and the third 1943 2016 shows a significant upward trend although these periods were obviously chosen specifically to illustrate the point this analysis indicates that the overall trend was dominated by low frequency variability for several decades this example highlights that natural climate variability has its own structure which can easily confound trend analysis although temporal and spatial structures of certain climate patterns are relatively well characterized e g enso this emphasizes the importance of diagnosing the structure of natural variability and adapting the trend analysis for instance if temporal clustering or semi cyclical patterns are identified in peak streamflow one solution is to apply trend tests over periods that include one or more cycles ishak et al 2013 at longer timescales the hurst phenomenon hurst 1951 in which a trend may not be separable from persistence applies koutsoyiannis 2003 2006 the outcome of the statistical tests also depends on spatial scale and may vary from one catchment to another archfield et al 2016 in part due to land use change or regulation vogel et al 2011 aggregation to large spatial scales tends to reduce the noise of natural climate variability and improves trend detection fischer and knutti 2014 2 3 attribution of change in peak flow records attribution which consists of quantifying the contribution of various drivers to change in peak flows is crucial for projection hall et al 2014 and can raise awareness of the need for mitigation e g thompson and otto 2015 schwab et al 2017 attribution studies of changes in hydro climatic extremes in general and of the causes of individual events e g allen 2003 pall et al 2011 2017 easterling et al 2016 viglione et al 2016 are becoming more common for flood change attribution merz et al 2012 suggested a three part framework that uses observed peak flows and simulation results the first part evidence of consistency relates to whether the observed change in peak flows is consistent with change in the assumed driver the second part evidence of inconsistency consists of demonstrating that change in peak flow is not the outcome of a different driver from the one originally assumed the aim is to avoid wrong attribution when several drivers of changes are acting at the considered location the third part is the provision of confidence level of the causality attribution this framework is often reduced to comparing observed peak discharges with simulated discharges that are obtained with and without changes in the drivers e g wolski et al 2014 aich et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 see section 4 1 2 for a description of possible statistical approaches the drawback of this causal framework and other sensitivity type analyses are that inference is limited to the relative or qualitative weights for various drivers and is limited when several drivers are jointly responsible for changes in peak flows harrigan et al 2014 vogel et al 2011 2 4 implication for design the above sections highlight that clear physical reasoning supports non stationarity in floods however physical evidence is often inconclusive natural climate variability and land use change make detection and attribution of change difficult which could at least partly explain the lack of physical evidence thus engineers and decision makers could find a trend but not be sure if it is due to anthropogenic climate change alternatively they may find no trend but since the climate change signal is yet to be detected flood hazard may nevertheless increase or decrease in the future in either case these possibilities pose a clear design challenge the sections below discuss the limitations of current approaches given this context 3 status quo design flood assuming stationarity the stationarity assumption has been used for decades for designing flood infrastructure and has been demonstrated to be the most pertinent assumption at many locations serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 assuming stationarity there are two primary approaches to determining the design flood fig 3 the first is to perform flood frequency analysis ffa and then use pre determined return periods or risk based approaches the second is to use the concept of pmp and pmf this section briefly reviews these methods 3 1 design based on flood frequency analysis in stationary ffa observed peak flow values are represented by a probability distribution with time invariant parameters 1 y f θ 1 θ k θ k where y y 1 y 2 y n is the peak flow time series n is the number of observations means distributed as and f is a chosen distribution function the u s recommends the log pearson type 3 distribution england jr et al 2018 and the national environment research council in the united kingdom recommends the generalized extreme value distribution nrec 1975 other extreme value distributions may also be appropriate merz and theiken 2009 θ θ 1 θ k is a vector of k parameters usually k 2 o r 3 for more details on conducting ffa assuming stationarity including parameter estimation application to ungauged catchments or at regional scales and handling missing data the reader can refer to the aforementioned guidelines and the reviews by coles 2001 katz et al 2002 and khaliq et al 2006 uncertainty in ffa is introduced in streamflow measurements and in fitting extreme value distributions to limited records once ffa is complete there are two approaches to determining a design value the first approach is to use a pre determined return period the 100 year return flood in particular has become commonly used in the u s as a reasonable compromise between the need for building restrictions to minimize potential loss of life and property and the economic benefits to be derived from floodplain development fema 2011 partially due to the national flood insurance program which mandates flood insurance for structures at risk of the 100 year flood however the choice of flood protection standard may be more political than based on scientific or economic justification for example in the u s the 500 year standard mandated after hurricane sandy by the obama administration was subsequently reversed by the trump administration koerth baker 2017 the degree of conservatism varies by country in the netherlands standards for levee and dike design which range anywhere from the 300 to 10 000 year flood depending on location were developed from ffa of historic data and the analysis of costs of construction compared to damages and risk of death associated with past floods voorendt 2015 the second is a risk based approach that minimizes total expected cost national research council 2000 lund 2002 jonkman et al 2004 tung 2005 in practice the objective is to balance the costs of protection with the expected costs associated with the hydrological hazard i e flood damage costs plus the costs of any emergency actions taken during the flood event thus the assumption of stationarity applies to not only the flood probability distribution but also the socio economic estimates that determine infrastructure and damage costs which add another level of uncertainty 3 2 probable maximum precipitation and flood a significant part of the flood design literature relies on the concept of pmp and pmf pmp is the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically with no allowance made for long term climatic trends wmo 1986 the pmf is the flood that would result from the combination of the pmp and the most severe hydrologic conditions i e initial soil moisture and or snowpack considered physically possible in the region the pmf is used for designing infrastructure whose failure would cause tremendous damages to the downstream population and economy e g large dams its return period has sometimes been associated with values ranging from 104 to 107 years fernandes et al 2010 nathan et al 2016 it is primarily used in north america and australia most european countries use conventional ffa boes 2011 because such high return periods are considered beyond the credible limit of extrapolation nathan and weinmann 2001 in the u s state level regulations sometimes allow design within a range the lower bound may be set by either a return period e g the 500 year flood or a percent of the pmf while the upper bound is a percent of the pmf fema 2012 the world meteorological organization provides guidelines for estimating pmp wmo 2009 according to those guidelines there are two distinct categories of methods those based on the statistical analysis of observed extreme rainfall and those that rely on physically based storm modelling the wmo recommends the statistical analysis of extreme rainfall hershfield 1961 as an approximation for pmp for small catchments with surface area less than 1000 km2 the most common physically based approach called storm maximization and storm transposition e g rakhecha et al 1999 consists of boosting the atmospheric conditions most often the atmospheric moisture to the physical limits more specifically the pmp t value for a storm of duration t at a given location can be obtained by stratz and hossain 2014 2 pmp t pobs t w p m a x t w p o b s where pobs t is the maximum observed depth of precipitation for the duration t at the location of the observed storm w p o b s is the precipitable water in the air column of the actual storm being maximized and w p m a x t is the maximum probable precipitable water in the moisture column in the transposed location where pmp is estimated several methods exist for estimating the latter for instance the usace estimates w p m a x t based on the maximum 12 hour persisting temperature dew point schreiner and riedel 1978 another method is to define w p m a x t as the 100 yr return precipitable water estimated from numerical simulations e g a regional climate model beauchamp et al 2013 in eq 2 pmp t is defined for the same duration and for the same area as the observed storm this value can be interpolated to another spatial area and another duration by using depth area duration curves u s department of commerce 1999 the pmp is converted into the pmf using either a hydrological model or the unit hydrograph method these methods require as input the maximum probable storm pms which is the hypothetical storm for a particular drainage area and duration that results from the pmp the pms temporal structure is commonly obtained by assuming a hyetograph specific to the climatic region for the continental u s see water resources program 2009 the pms spatial pattern is usually based on a standard isohyetal pattern that has a shape and orientation corresponding to that commonly observed at the location national weather service 1982 the pmf estimate is sensitive to both initial soil conditions and to the spatial and temporal patterns of the pms leading to uncertainty bounds that may be as large as 50 jakob 2013 in locations where pmf is likely to occur during periods when snowmelt may significantly contribute to runoff it is recommended to assume a 100 year return period snowpack debs et al 1999 beauchamp et al 2013 additional uncertainty is introduced in estimating the snowpack 3 3 concerns in the use of traditional methods with non stationarity if the drivers discussed in section 2 cause non stationarity in hydrological extremes the use of a stationary ffa or pmp pmf may lead to poor design estimates e g jain and lall 2001 sarewitz et al 2003 kunkel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 poor design estimates can occur for reasons such as 1 the available historic data may only partially sample the range of peak flow variability resulting from low frequency oscillations associated with natural climate variability or 2 a trend detection test may provide a false positive or false negative to illustrate how non stationarity can affect the design flood estimate we use the example of the red river of the north at fargo we fit the generalized extreme value distribution gev jenkinson 1955 for two sub periods of the annual maximum streamflow records 1902 1942 and 1943 2016 fig 5 displays the flood frequency curves for these two periods together with their confidence intervals as obtained via bootstrap obeysekera and salas 2014 the peak flow quantiles obtained from the period 1902 1942 are significantly different from those from 1943 to 2017 let us assume that in 1942 local engineers designed a levee based on the 100 year flood according to the available data 1902 1942 the design flood equals 17 103 cfs however this value was surpassed ten times during 1943 2017 fig 4 which would have potentially caused significant societal consequences on the flood frequency curve obtained with the 1943 2016 data the 17 103 cfs corresponds approximately to an 8 year flood using data from 1942 to 2016 the 100 year flood equals 57 103 cfs and corresponds to a 1500 year return period according to the 1902 1942 data this example illustrates how the use of ffa assuming stationarity may lead to under or over design should the peak flow distribution change 4 nonstationary design flood estimation this section describes the primary approaches to flood projection and subsequent design flood estimation under non stationarity fig 5 these approaches are often referred to as predict then act approaches in the sense that predicted change in flood quantiles are used for infrastructure design lempert et al 2004 this section focuses on anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability because they are major sources of non stationarity in the peak flow distribution or the pmp pmf although the overarching concepts are also relevant for changes in land use and river regulation 4 1 design based on flood frequency analysis under non stationarity from climate assuming non stationarity the first step in design flood estimation via ffa is projection of flood risk here the focus is on projection of the flood distribution although projection of future infrastructure cost and flood damages is also necessary for risk assessment there are two primary approaches to projection of the flood distribution 1 hydrologic simulation approaches combine simulation output from general circulation models gcms with downscaling and bias correction methods and hydrological modeling green box in fig 5 and 2 informed parameter approaches create statistical models with time varying parameters blue box in fig 5 the latter include trend informed models in which time is the only covariate and climate informed models in which climate variables are used as covariates 4 1 1 flood projection via hydrologic simulation approaches climate projections from gcms are often used for assessing future changes in river flows through a chain of models gcms are physically based models that attempt to consistently simulate the behavior of the atmosphere land surface and ocean including interactions among these components at a global scale scenarios that attempt to span the range of plausible future greenhouse gas emissions cmip3 experiment nakicenovic et al 20001 or concentrations cmip5 experiment taylor et al 2012 drive gcm projections of future climate variables because gcm outputs are subject to biases e g dai 2006 kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 sillmann et al 2013 crétat et al 2014 and are simulated at spatial resolutions that are coarser than the scale required by the hydrologic models to represent the paramount processes generating runoff fowler et al 2007 the outputs are commonly bias corrected and downscaled to create realistic inputs for hydrologic models maraun et al 2010 the downscaled and bias corrected gcm projections are then used to force physical or conceptual hydrologic models to simulate extreme streamflow use of this approach is wide spread and ranges from the catchment scale e g camici et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2010 ngongondo et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2003 to national continental and global scales e g alfieri et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 dankers and feyen 2009 dankers et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2008 2013 leng et al 2016 rojas et al 2011 2012 roudier et al 2016 the major advantage of using the chain of models is that the evolution of flood inducing weather variables under future atmospheric conditions is physically modeled however this framework suffers from several shortcomings discussed below e g kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 and overall is subject to a myriad of sources of uncertainty that arise from each step of the modeling framework stainforth et al 2007a wilby and dessai 2010 the use of gcm projections for assessment of hydrological extremes is questionable because gcm estimates of precipitation are biased particularly in extremes e g mehran et al 2014 which affects simulation of hydrological processes e g leander and buishand 2007 sperna weiland et al 2010 rocheta et al 2014 in particular gcms do not simulate the physical processes that generate extreme precipitation that trigger most flood events because those processes occur at spatial scales that are finer than model resolutions e g boberg et al 2007 leander and buishand 2007 wuebbles et al 2014 crétat et al 2014 in comparison to observations historical simulations usually underestimate precipitation extremes which suggests an underestimation of projected precipitation extremes kundzewicz et al 2017 likely resulting in an underestimation of future peak flows bias correction and downscaling which sometimes involves implicit bias correction are common approaches to mitigating the bias and coarse resolution of gcm outputs with the goal of producing more hydrologically relevant projections of climate bias correction is the correction of model output towards observations in a post processing step ehret et al 2012 bias correction methods have multiple disadvantages 1 bias is corrected without consideration of the forcing or structural errors which may be causing the bias 2 bias in statistics other than the mean such as the variance is often not corrected teutschbein and seibert 2012 and 3 bias is assumed time invariant i e bias identified in the current period can be used to correct bias in future periods which can cause misleading results when assessing hydrological extremes e g ehret et al 2012 maurer et al 2013 velázquez et al 2015 thus bias correction alone is not recommended for future flood design downscaling methods can be classified into three main categories 1 delta change factor methods or perturbation methods 2 statistical methods and 3 dynamical methods ekström et al 2015 for comprehensive reviews see also fowler et al 2007 madsen et al 2014 delta change factor methods perturb observed time series of precipitation and temperature with changes identified by gcm projections e g prudhomme et al 2002 2003 lehner et al 2006 kay et al 2006 more sophisticated variations of this method can account for seasonal effects and changes in variability e g hingray et al 2007 willems and vrac 2011 statistical downscaling methods include 1 regression methods which rely on multivariate statistics representing the link between large scale climate predictors and local predictands e g bürger and chen 2005 hessami et al 2008 2 resampling methods such as weather typing and climate analogs which rely on the relationship between synoptic meteorological patterns and local predictands e g boé et al 2006 lafaysse et al 2014 pierce et al 2014 raynaud et al 2017 and 3 stochastic weather generators which simulate time series of chosen weather variables reproducing observed or pre defined statistics or patterns conditioned on large scale or synoptic circulations e g qian et al 2002 chen et al 2018 finally dynamical downscaling methods consist of using regional climate models rcms which are similar to gcms but have higher resolution and smaller modeling domains see rummukainen et al 2010 xue et al 2014 for reviews because rcms produce their own bias in addition to inheriting bias from gcm boundary conditions rcm projections are commonly further bias corrected and downscaled sunyer et al 2012 for analysis of possible future design floods delta change factors are not recommended because they do not account for local differences that exist within the same gcm grid cell and for any feedback processes ekström et al 2015 the computational cost associated with the use of rcms is still sufficiently high to limit the temporal span of projections reducing confidence in subsequent ffa also rcm projections are usually available for only a few gcm rcm realizations and thus do not span the range of gcm internal variability rather use of an ensemble of statistical methods is recommended for two reasons first no single method out performs others in intercomparison studies of statistical downscaling methods bronstert et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2018 thus it is impossible to definitively choose one method second downscaling contributes as much if not more uncertainty as the forcing scenario and gcm model bürger et al 2013 hingray and saïd 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 thus it is necessary to estimate the uncertainty through the use of an ensemble regardless of what downscaling methods are chosen it is crucial to evaluate the resulting climate scenarios for their climatic credibility and plausibility i e are current climate conditions well represented and is the realization of possible future climate physically sound as well as their relevance and quality for hydrologic impact analysis bronstert et al 2007 the bias corrected and downscaled climate projections are then used to drive hydrologic models to simulate streamflow at a given location e g hingray et al 2014 although the comparison of different hydrologic models has a long standing history in hydrology e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 the implications of hydrologic modeling choices for assessing changing environmental conditions has recently emerged as a concern e g merz et al 2011 brigode et al 2013 mendoza et al 2015 hydrologic modeling choices as discussed by mendoza et al 2016 include assuming time invariant model parameters model structure e g chen et al 2013 wi et al 2015 the spatial resolution of input data e g lobligeois et al 2014 essou et al 2016 the existence of multiple optimal parameter sets e g wi et al 2015 calibration and validation periods e g coron et al 2012 2014 and the calibration objective function studies that have examined the effect of these choices on flood projection have found that while the importance of different sources of uncertainty varies by hydrologic regime and return period kay et al 2009 the uncertainty from future climate can be as much or more than the uncertainty from the model structure booij 2005 steinschneider et al 2015a and that estimates of the 100 year can vary widely depending on the combination of modeling choices brigode et al 2015 wi et al 2015 due to the uncertainty stemming from hydrologic models an ensemble of model structures and parameter sets is recommended the latter could be inferred using various calibration and validation periods if computational constraints make an ensemble undesirable a simple sensitivity analysis could indicate the magnitude of uncertainty stemming from hydrologic models relative to gcms and downscaling methods if the hydrologic model uncertainty is of comparable or greater magnitude then the ensemble should be reconsidered 4 1 2 flood projection via informed parameter approaches informed parameter approaches use statistical models with time varying parameters to allow the flood distribution to be nonstationary e g serago and vogel 2018 in other words eq 1 becomes y t f θ 1 t θ k t and provides a peak flow distribution for each time step usually annual out to the planning horizon for the most recent and exhaustive review of nonstationary statistical methods see salas et al 2018 there are two main approaches the first termed the trend informed approach makes use of the historical trend to model non stationarity in the peak flow distribution e g el adlouni et al 2007 rootzén and katz 2013 salas and obeysekera 2014 luke et al 2017 the second termed the climate informed approach e g sankarasubramanian and lall 2003 kwon et al 2008 is to model the temporal evolution of the flood distribution parameters using large scale climate variables as covariates a common practice is to try a variety of models e g either trends or covariates for various distribution parameters or moments and retain the best model often assessed using a criterion such as the akaike or bayesian information criterion however assessment of the best model should also consider whether the modeled changes can be linked to physical processes and whether those links will remain valid under future climate conditions e g jiang et al 2016 for example a time varying location parameter could correspond to changes in moisture content of storms and their intensity stedinger and griffis 2011 while a time varying scale parameter could correspond to changes in storm features e g winter storm vs snowmelt in the trend informed approach model parameters are 3 θ k t n 0 n a k n t n where θ k t is the value of the k th parameter of the flood distribution for time t a k n are regression coefficients and n is the regression order usually n equals 1 i e linear relation or 2 i e quadratic relation the trend informed approach has been primarily used to model non stationarity in the historical period for characterizing historical changes e g strupczewski et al 2001 delgado et al 2010 vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 šraj et al 2016 hu et al 2017 the use of the trend informed approach for assessing future design values relies on the questionable assumption that historical trends will remain the same over the entire planning period jain and lall 2001 he et al 2006 sivapalan and samuel 2009 blöschl and montanari 2010 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 in an analysis of 1250 stream gauges across the u s trend informed models were rarely preferred even when a trend was detected in the first half of the record because it rarely persisted into the second half however for gauges where the physical processes underlying the trend did continue an updated stationary model which used the parameters of the trend informed model at the end of the first half of the record was generally preferred luke et al 2017 additionally trend informed models are often limited by sampling uncertainty and model structure uncertainty and robustness for example two models with comparable goodness of fit for the historical period can lead to significantly different flood quantiles for future periods serinaldi and kilsby 2015 given these limitations a high level of caution is needed when using trend informed models to assess future flood design values climate informed model parameters are 4 θ k t m 1 m k n 0 n k m a k m n x k m n t where x k m is the value of the m th climate covariates at time t for the parameter θ k t and a k m n are the regression coefficients compared to eq 3 the time variable has been replaced by covariates x k m which are usually large scale climate variables but can also be non climatic such as a reservoir index lópez and francés 2013 or carbon dioxide concentrations hirsch and ryberg 2012 the number of climate covariates will depend on the parameter and the regression order will depend on both the parameter and the number of covariates implementing climate informed models requires identifying the relevant climate patterns and or variables that drive flood occurrence and magnitude over the study region the choice of the relevant covariates usually follows from analysis of the hydro climatology scientific literature and historic reports for the considered area e g delgado et al 2012 schlef et al 2018a in the case where identification of covariates is not straightforward there are a variety of available methods time series correlation e g kwon et al 2008 correlation maps e g schlef et al 2018a composite analysis e g jain and lall 2001 weather typing e g robertson et al 2015 simulation experiments e g cook 1999 and use of a bayesian frameworks to identify spatial patterns in gridded data renard and lall 2014 projections of the covariates to drive changes in flood distribution parameters are usually obtained from gcms blue box on fig 2 this requires the covariates to be well reproduced by gcms thus favoring covariates defined over large spatial domains and at monthly to seasonal temporal scales rather than daily localized precipitation used to force hydrologic models for instance maximum annual precipitation over a region should not be used as covariate because of low gcm skill e g boberg et al 2007 leander and buishand 2007 wuebbles et al 2014 crétat et al 2014 similar to downscaling approaches e g greene et al 2011 the use of both thermodynamic and dynamic covariates is expected to increase model robustness under climate change climate informed models have been used for analyzing or reconstructing historical variability of hydrological extremes e g griffis and stedinger 2007b kwon et al 2008 li and tan 2015 bracken et al 2018 and for projecting future peak flow delgado et al 2014 tramblay et al 2014 condon et al 2015 schlef et al 2018a similar to the hydrologic simulation approach the credibility of flood projections derived from climate informed models is subject to limitations and uncertainties stemming from the use of gcms but unlike the simulation approach avoids the uncertainty stemming from downscaling methods and hydrological models although gcm performance regarding highly studied climate patterns such as enso and pdo is generally acceptable and well characterized e g taschetto et al 2014 yim et al 2015 this may not be the case for other climate variables relevant to a specific gauge location such as soil moisture yuan and quiring 2017 furthermore gcms often do not correctly reproduce correlations between climate patterns e g kim et al 2017 and calculation of some large scale climate indices from gcm outputs can be prohibitively difficult projections from climate informed models are also highly influenced by the choice of covariates which depends on the modeler s experience and knowledge of the study area and even the best combination of covariates is unlikely to fully explain peak flow variability e g delgado et al 2012 finally uncertainty stemming from sampling model structure and robustness of covariates under future climate remains poorly characterized e g merz et al 2014 despite these limitations climate informed models are a relatively new and appealing alternative to flood projection via hydrologic simulation 4 1 3 nonstationary return periods and risk assessment for design the definition of nonstationary return periods is still an area of on going research and discussion flood projections derived from trend informed models can use a revised concept of return period defined as the mean expected time from the current date to the first occurrence of a flood event that exceeds the chosen design value cooley 2013 salas and obeysekera 2014 or equivalently the time length for which the probability of exceedance is one parey et al 2007 calculation of this revised return period requires that time varying probabilities of exceedance be summed to infinity eq 4 3 in cooley 2013 and that the temporal evolution of flood events be correctly represented this revised return period cannot be applied to projections derived from either the hydrologic simulation approach or climate informed models because they do not meet those two conditions i e most of the gcms project climate for the next century only and cannot predict the temporality of events consequently return periods for flood projections derived not using a trend informed model are often calculated assuming stationarity within a chosen time window e g 1950 2000 for a historic period and 2050 2100 for a future period schlef et al 2018a which re assumes stationarity and imposes short record lengths e g 50 years from which to calculate extreme values e g the 100 or 500 year flood alternatives to either the revised return period or re assuming stationarity include the design life level which is the probability of the event occurring within the planning horizon rootzén and katz 2013 and reliability which is the probability that an exceedance event will not occur over the planning period i e expected performance rather than expected failure read and vogel 2015 once nonstationary flood probabilities have been determined from the flood projections as in the stationary case design can be based on either pre determined return periods or a risk based approach e g schlef 2018 frequently nonstationary risk based approaches are embedded into sequential decision frameworks such as a decision tree cf loucks et al 2005 to infer sequential adaptation measures e g manning et al 2009 gersonius et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 4 2 probable maximum precipitation and flood under non stationarity from climate whether the pmp and subsequent pmf are likely to change at a given location is a subject of controversy jakob 2013 for instance highlighted a subtle change in the pmp definition in the most recent wmo guidelines i e 2009 compared to 1986 the new definition states that pmp is the theoretical maximum precipitation for a given duration under modern meteorological conditions which emphasizes that the pmp may have changed in the past and could be modified in the future should the climate change to date there are no federal guidelines for dam design that account for potential changes in pmf perhaps due to the perspective that there is no compelling evidence that would support climate related changes in pmfs and that current design recommendations should be changed only when substantial research quantitatively demonstrates a link usace 2016 however recent academic research using both climate projections and historical trends although still nascent indicates there likely is a link significant increases in pmp have been shown for the whole contiguous u s kunkel et al 2013 specific locations within the u s stratz and hossain 2014 gangrade et al 2018 and specific locations in canada rousseau et al 2014 clavet gaumont et al 2017 regardless to date no method has become widely acknowledged for projection of future pmp and pmf under climate change and thus we are unable to offer guidance on specific methods 5 addressing design flood uncertainty at the most basic level uncertainty in design flood values can be broadly conceptualized as being comprised of two components aleatory uncertainty is essential unavoidable unpredictability or chance i e the residual unpredictability of events given models and parameters while epistemic uncertainty is lack of knowledge or ignorance i e roughly lack of confidence about parameters and models spiegelhalter riesch 2011 however the complexity of climate change has led to the concept of deep or severe uncertainty which results from myriad factors both scientific and social and consequently is difficult to accurately define and quantify kandlikar et al 2005 for more discussion see also lempert et al 2004 hall et al 2007 hall et al 2012 ray and brown 2015 both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty are present under the assumption of stationarity deep uncertainty is added under the assumption of non stationarity this section first describes uncertainty quantification and attribution and then describes methods for incorporating uncertainty into design 5 1 uncertainty quantification and attribution a common approach to quantifying aleatory and epistemic uncertainty is through confidence intervals e g dashed curves in fig 4 which have long been a topic of active research in hydrologic science e g iacwd 1982 stedinger 1983 ashkar et al 1987 hu 1987 schendel et al 2015 england jr et al 2018 under stationarity confidence intervals are generally obtained through the variance of the design quantiles e g lu and stedinger 1992 under non stationarity assessment of confidence intervals is less straightforward obeysekera and salas 2014 described three methods 1 a delta method which is based the large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators 2 a bootstrap method which is based on the bootstrap of standardized data which are then used to fit an ensemble of nonstationary models and 3 a profile likelihood method from coles 2001 which uses the log likelihood function the delta and bootstrap methods are more computationally efficient but less accurate compared to the profile likelihood method for lack of a better approach quantification of deep uncertainty has been generally based on the use of ensembles of forcing scenarios initial conditions and models or methods e g the ensembles of gcm projections in ipcc 2014 in this case the spread of the ensemble is considered to provide some albeit limited and usually underestimated indication of the level of associated uncertainty stainforth et al 2007b there is significant research effort aimed at reducing ensemble spread by improving models however significant reductions are only possible with hundreds if not thousands of additional years of observations leach 2007 alternatively other efforts aim to achieve a more informative ensemble spread by selecting gcms which demonstrate good performance or are independent knutti et al 2013 steinschneider et al 2015b however since non independent gcms are more likely to project changes toward the same direction and or with comparable magnitude the use of an increasing number of non independent models into an ensemble could lead to an apparent reduction of the uncertainty although this reduction is likely to be meaningless knutti 2010 the use of ensembles has led to many attribution studies e g hawkins and sutton 2009 hingray and saïd 2014 which use methods of sensitivity analysis such as anova to partition to the total uncertainty as represented by the ensemble spread into portions attributable to specific sources which may include forcing scenario initial conditions model structure model parameters etc stainforth et al 2007a 5 2 incorporating uncertainty into design under the assumption of stationarity the common engineering approach to incorporating uncertainty in design is through safety factors or freeboard in the context of levee or dam design which in some cases is even applied to the already conservative pmf e g fema 2012 shaw 2009 nyc rules 2013 notably such safety factors are usually independent of the confidence interval estimation of uncertainty which is not generally used in design as stated in bulletin 17c application of confidence intervals in reaching water resource planning decisions depends upon the needs of the user england jr et al 2018 and proposed approaches are generally limited to research applications if for example the risk of under design must be reduced to 5 a possible approach although naïve could be to use the value of the upper bound of 90 confidence interval could be used while this use is straightforward and can easily be applied in practice it overinterprets the mathematic definition of the intervals e g klemeš 2002 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 another proposed use entails a cost benefit analysis to determine a design value which accounts for epistemic uncertainty arising from parameter estimation botto et al 2014 2017 gaume 2018 under the assumption of non stationarity particularly as arises from climate change there are three primary means of incorporating uncertainty in design climate factors i e the application of an additional safety factor specifically addressing the uncertainty from climate change the prudent approach i e use of information that is known with relatively high confidence to qualitatively inform whether additional protection should be considered in design and robustness based decision methods i e finding a design which is satisficing over a wide array of plausible futures as a side note taking the weighted mean of the ensemble which is an approach commonly used to summarize the oftentimes overwhelming amount of information from future climate projections serves only to conceal the uncertainty and negatively impact characterization of extremes rather than actively incorporate that uncertainty into design 5 2 1 climate factors in the context of uncertainty associated with climate change additional safety factors are called climate allowances or climate factors through a review of existing guidelines in europe madsen et al 2014 found that the use of climate factors with the explicit purpose of protecting against climate change is rare exceptions include germany norway and the united kingdom defra 2006 hennegriff et al 2006 lawrence and hisdal 2011 environmental agency 2016 although climate factors are easy to apply such a simplistic adjustment to peak flow estimates is a result of poorly understood impacts of future climate change e g kuklicke and demeritt 2016 climate factors lack flexibility because they are generally prescribed for a single time horizon one exception is the recent united kingdom guidelines and incorrectly estimate small scale variability because they are usually defined by basin or political boundaries madsen et al 2014 calculation of climate factors is generally described in technical reports which often lack clear descriptions of calculation methods and are based on the difference between historical and projected simulations of streamflow from gcms furthermore studies that assess climate factor performance are limited but needed especially given that the resulting climate factors can be highly sensitive to the modeling choices e g the first generation of united kingdom climate factors see reynard et al 2005 defra 2006 prudhomme et al 2010 5 2 2 prudent approach even under deep uncertainty the direction of change of some key variables can be known with relatively high confidence for example temperature has and will continue to increase under climate change this information can be used to qualitatively infer the likely direction of change in hydrological extremes e g decreased snowpack would lead to smaller and earlier peak flows or intensified extreme precipitation will increase peak flows assuming sufficiently negligible feedback effects given this information decision makers might decide to opt for a prudent approach based on the precautionary principle gollier and treich 2003 in the context of climate change mitigation kirkwood 2011 noted that the prudent path lies somewhere between doing absolutely nothing about climate change and doing everything possible in the context of decision making for hydrologic design the prudent approach consists of making design decisions based on expected changes in peak flows or their drivers that are known with relatively high confidence the prudent approach is especially applicable for projects involving discrete choices such as levee height or the size of a pump station for example given a discrete set of return periods used for design if the 50 year flood was initially selected but there was high confidence that future peak flows would increase the prudent approach would choose the next discrete level such as the 100 year flood this is often justifiable when its marginal cost is small compared to the total infrastructure cost hallegate 2009 an even more precautionary approach to flood risk adapted by the scottish environment protection agency is to prohibit development of flood sensitive projects in medium to high risk areas sepa 2017 5 2 3 robustness based decision methods to deal with deep uncertainty associated with climate change lempert 2002 introduced the idea of robustness unlike a risk based approach which finds an optimal design for one assumed future state of the world a robustness based approach finds a design that will be satisficing i e perform well simon 1956 for a large range of plausible futures multiple approaches using the concept of robustness have been developed robust decision making lempert 2003 info gap analysis ben haim 2006 scenario neutral approach prudhomme et al 2010 and decision scaling brown et al 2011 2012 stakhiv 2011 provides an extended discussion on the use of robust decision making methods for water resource management under climate change both info gap analysis and decision scaling have been specifically applied to design of flood infrastructure hine and hall 2010 steinschneider et al 2015a spence and brown 2016 2018 knighton et al 2017 and the scenario neutral approach has been applied to determine system vulnerability to hydrological extremes without prescribing a design value prudhomme et al 2010 despite the value of robustness based decision methods quantitative approaches to their implementation are relatively new and require increased application and improvement for example hall et al 2012 showed that info gap and robust decision making provide similar but not identical solutions for the same case study yet note that the comparison improved understanding of the system and the proposed management options 6 discussion and conclusion this paper addresses the need for guidance on design for riverine floods under non stationarity in particular section 2 addresses evidence and drivers of non stationarity as well as methods for detection and attribution the key points are theoretical reasons historical evidence indicate that flood hazard is possibly changing at some locations due to climate change for design of short life infrastructure 30 years the natural climate variability signal dominates the anthropogenic climate change signal consequently assuming stationarity may be adequate but long historical records are recommended for inferring model parameters for design of long life infrastructure 30 years the assumption of stationarity may not be valid due to anthropogenic climate change impacting the magnitude occurrence and typology of floods the structure inherent in natural climate variability can confound trend analysis and should be diagnosed and addressed when possible methods for detecting change are imperfect however this effect can be reduced through regionalization and using long historical records section 3 addresses status quo flood design which assumes stationarity the key points are design of long life infrastructure is usually based on either 1 ffa with pre specified return periods or risk minimization or 2 the concepts of pmp and pmf if flood hazard is indeed nonstationary the status quo can lead to costly over design or dangerous under design section 4 addresses methods for nonstationary flood design under climate change the key points are for nonstationary flood design ffa must use projections from either hydrologic simulation or informed parameter approaches such projections rely on gcm projections of future climate which often have biased precipitation estimates and unknown future skill for the hydrologic simulation approach o bias correction alone and delta change downscaling methods are not recommended o use of the projections currently available from rcms are not recommended because the simulation periods are often too short to estimate flood frequency the small number of gcm rcm realizations does not allow a correct representation of the range of gcm internal variability o the use of gcm projections can be improved through statistical downscaling but use of an ensemble of downscaling methods and evaluation of method credibility is recommended because no one method outperforms others and because downscaling adds considerable uncertainty o ensembles of hydrologic models are recommended in cases where the ensuing uncertainty is comparable to or greater than that from gcms and downscaling methods a sensitivity analysis could be used to infer the relative contribution of hydrological models to the total uncertainty for informed parameter approaches o trend informed models are not recommended for projection because historical trends will not necessarily persist during the entire planning period o climate informed models are an appealing alternative to hydrologic simulation but are still a relatively new and untested methodology and should be used as a complementary approach nonstationary return periods are difficult to define and provide minimal design guidance instead the concepts of design life level and reliability which transparently communicate probability of failure are recommended for guiding design since studies of changing pmp and pmf are nascent and no clear and well established methods for assessing change exist no method is recommended despite the possibility that pmp and pmf are nonstationary under climate change section 5 addresses quantification and attribution of design flood uncertainty and approaches to incorporating uncertainty associated with climate change into design the key points are aleatory and epistemic uncertainty are present under the assumption of stationarity deep uncertainty is added in the context of non stationarity from climate change confidence intervals are recommended for communicating aleatory and epistemic uncertainty although their use for design is often unclear ensembles are recommended for characterizing deep uncertainty despite indicating only the lower bounds of the full uncertainty range for design robustness based decision methods are recommended to account for climate change uncertainty if a robustness based approach is not possible the use of either climate factors or prudent approach should be considered some very clear and relatively unsurprising avenues of needed future research arise from this review first future research should aim to cultivate non traditional sources of data that can be used to extend observed records such as historical information e g written records and paleo data e g tree rings and sediment cores and generate improved future records e g satellite data and crowd sourced streamflow measurement second given the strengths and weaknesses of methods for flood hazard projection for ffa future research should focus on improved understanding of the climate processes driving floods more applications of the climate informed approach and methods for assessing the potential credibility of projections under climate change for pmp and pmf future research should address uncertainty reduction for pmp and pmf and development of methods for projection that can be widely accepted finally more research is needed on application and evaluation of methods for incorporating deep uncertainty into design to conclude this discussion about design considerations under non stationarity specifically in the context of climate change it is worth quoting jakob 2013 design with change in mind not just climate think across disciplines whether stationarity is dead milly et al 2008 alive lins and cohn 2011 immortal montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 or undead serinaldi and kilsby 2015 is not really important provided that the chosen approach to design can sufficiently represent the physical system and its evolution the ultimate goal is robust or even resilient design that avoids both sunk capital costs and massive flood damages thus when inference from climate projections lack significant change in flood drivers over the design horizon the stationarity assumption may be preferred however in the presence of observed or theoretical evidence that flood hazard is changing or is likely to change in the future then the non stationarity assumption may be preferred while this review focused on climate change non climatic factors also can cause changes in flood hazard possibly on shorter time scales the impact of both climate and non climate factors on flood hazard signals the end of the static design paradigm brown 2010 this implies that the chosen design may fail more quickly than expected hence the growing focus on resilient design across many disciplines including flood design e g park et al 2011 sayers et al 2012 additionally this implies that design should be able to tolerate various levels of failure rather than existing solely in binary failure or non failure states meaning that non structural flood solutions should be designed conjunctively with structural solutions finally while a static infrastructure design may be optimal for the most likely future in a risk based approach or satisficing for most plausible futures in a robustness based approach the end of static design promotes adaptive flood risk management which benefits from increasing knowledge through time e g hui et al 2018 adaptive flood risk management can reduce or delay initial and often large investment costs associated with infrastructure construction which may subsequently become unnecessary under future states of the world there are two adaptive approaches which have been applied to flood risk management 1 dynamic adaptive policy pathways haasnoot et al 2013 and 2 real options analysis e g hino and hall 2017 these adaptive approaches should be combined with robustness based approaches to promote design under non stationarity from climate change

6454,mathematical models with small numbers of parameters are useful for hydrological analyses and water resources planning as they are easier to prepare use and interpret compared to more complex models many simple model structures and simulation strategies have been developed but there is still substantial room for improvement in the efficiency of daily rainfall runoff modeling this study proposes daily rainfall runoff models that require only two to four parameters yet are capable of predicting peak discharge and baseflow parsimonious model structures were obtained using the hyperbolic tangent function and combining it with one subsurface layer and two parameters of a tank model the daily rainfall runoff models proposed based on the two parameter hyperbolic model tphm and tank model were applied to 41 watersheds throughout south korea model accuracy was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated watershed streamflow and compared with that of a nine parameter tank model the original tphm and its variants yielded slightly better efficiency with a smaller number of parameters than the tank model when reproducing high flows on a daily basis the accuracy of low flow and flow duration curve predictions provided by the tphm based models was higher in watersheds with relatively large baseflow temporal variability the results suggested that the tphm based structures be alternative parsimonious daily rainfall runoff simulation models this study demonstrates that daily high streamflow can be efficiently simulated using a two parameter hydrological model and daily baseflow simulation can be improved by adding two additional parameters to the model keywords daily rainfall runoff modeling parsimonious model hyperbolic tangent function two parameter hyperbolic model tank model 1 introduction parsimonious mechanistic as opposed to statistical models employ only the parameters needed to predict hydrological variables of interest at the required level of accuracy atkinson et al 2002 barrett and charbeneau 1997 basu et al 2010 jackson blake et al 2017 pande et al 2012 perrin et al 2003 valentin et al 2018 their structures and simulation strategies are often simple enough to ignore spatial variability in landscape and hydrological processes happening in a watershed clark et al 2008 fenicia et al 2010 kavetski and fenicia 2011 van esse et al 2013 vansteenkiste et al 2014 van gaelen et al 2017 thus the parameters of parsimonious models tend to be conceptual or empirical and it is not possible to estimate their spatially averaged values by either measurement or prior estimation which makes parameter calibration a necessary and critical part of simulations using a parsimonious model hrachowitz et al 2014 perrin et al 2001 such features are not appropriate for certain scientific purposes but are typically required when input data are limited rapid model preparation and routine model runs are needed and or complicated simulations are not necessary fenicia et al 2011 hrachowitz et al 2014 perrin et al 2001 santos et al 2018a valentin et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 parsimonious models are preferred as they tend to have fewer parameters and result in a lower parameter uncertainty basu et al 2010 her and chaubey 2015 in addition their structures are usually easy to understand thereby improving transparency in modeling based decision making processes and communication with stakeholders for the same reason they can also be a good educational tool parsimonious models have been successful in many applications including the design of hydrological structures and facilities such as irrigation reservoirs habets et al 2018 kim and park 1988 flood forecasting berthet et al 2009 low flow simulation staudinger et al 2011 assessing the hydrological impact of climate change block et al 2009 and helping students understand hydrology and hydrologic modeling as an educational tool aghakouchak et al 2013 they have made significant contributions to hydrological analysis and modeling by providing a basis for more sophisticated and complicated models ajami et al 2004 uhlenbrook et al 2004 many studies have attempted to identify or define a parsimonious model structure but no clear boundary has yet been defined kavetski and fenicia 2011 van esse et al 2013 in this context we define a parsimonious mechanistic model as one that employs the minimum number of parameters and predicts hydrological variables of interest at a predefined acceptable level of accuracy while representing dominant watershed processes in a physically meaningful way fenicia et al 2011 jackson blake et al 2017 valentin et al 2018 streamflow is often the only variable that has historical records in a hydrological analysis and its time series contain substantial information about hydrological processes occurring in a watershed in lumped conceptual hydrological modeling a watershed is sometimes represented with a series of storages reservoirs or tanks that can retain precipitation and release water to its outlet so that the delay and attenuation of runoff can be simulated the tank model sugawara 1979 is one form of simple daily hydrological model that has been commonly used in watershed assessment and planning chen et al 2014 fumikazu et al 2013 jang et al 2012 song et al 2016 tingsanchali and gautam 2000 yokoo et al 2001 depending on the complexity of watershed responses to storm events a tank model uses two to four vertical storage tanks connected to each other with outlets to mimic non linear runoff routing processes along flow pathways across a watershed despite its simple structure and simulation strategy the number of parameters to be calibrated can be challenging in model preparation especially when streamflow observations are limited studies have attempted to further simplify the structure of the tank model and reduce the number of calibration parameters by incorporating nonlinear functions into the model such as the curve number method usda 1956 power functions lag functions fenicia et al 2011 perrin et al 2003 logistic functions kavetski and kuczera 2007 gamma distribution press et al 1996 and hyperbolic tangent function boughton 1984 budyko 1974 chiew et al 1993 xiong and guo 1999 kim 2001 developed the two parameter hyperbolic model tphm by combining the hyperbolic tangent and power functions so that runoff can be predicted using only two parameters the tphm reproduced daily runoff from 25 watersheds located in south korea republic of korea the united kingdom and the united states of america at an accuracy level as good as or slightly better than the tank sugawara 1979 and synthetic streamflow and reservoir regulation ssarr us army corps of engineers usace 1972 models kim 2001 although tphm showed potential as a parsimonious method of predicting streamflow model performance was evaluated based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is sensitive to high flow and large outliers therefore the agreement between simulated and observed peak flow was likely overemphasized and deviations in low flow might have been neglected legates and mccabe 1999 pfannerstill et al 2014 which suggest that a re evaluation of tphm performance is required baseflow is a critical consideration in water resources management planning as it controls the ecological function of a watershed and regulates the seasonal distribution of streamwater pfannerstill et al 2014 pushpalatha et al 2011 staudinger et al 2011 previous studies have proposed performance measures that are responsive to low flow to more precisely evaluate a model s capacity to reproduce baseflow in hydrological modeling ley et al 2016 orth et al 2015 pushpalatha et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008 we reevaluated the potential of tphm as a parsimonious modeling tool to simulate daily rainfall runoff processes then explored its alternative forms for improved baseflow modeling in this study tphm was applied to reproducing the streamflow hydrographs of 41 study watersheds located in south korea and storage layers of a tank model were integrated into tphm the performance of tphm and its variants was compared with that of the tank model which has three storage tanks using accuracy statistics commonly employed in hydrological modeling we also examined the potential correspondence between hydrologic characteristics of the study watersheds and the performance statistics of tphms prepared for the watersheds to further understand the applicability of the models 2 methodology 2 1 hydrological models 2 1 1 tphm the tphm is a single layer daily rainfall runoff model kim 2001 that mathematically expresses the relationship between watershed storage and runoff using a combination of a hyperbolic tangent and power function in a conventional tank model tanks are linked to each other vertically outlets are located at the bottom and side of each tank to represent non linear runoff routing processes in the tphm on the other hand a wedge shaped opening was devised from the top of a tank to the bottom to represent a nonlinear storage discharge relationship using only one storage layer fig 1 a the hyperbolic tangent function is commonly used to represent the runoff responses to rainfall the quadratic storage discharge relationship obtained when integrated in this way results in a solution involving the hyperbolic tangent function moore and bell 2002 perrin et al 2003 moore 1999 2007 xiong and guo 1999 speculated that monthly runoff could be simulated as a hyperbolic tangent function of watershed storage then kim 2001 modified the xiong and guo 1999 model to simulate daily runoff as a function of both watershed storage and rainfall depth 1 q t t a n h s t 1 p t s max α s t 1 p t where q t is the daily runoff mm on day t s t is the daily watershed water storage mm p t is the daily rainfall s max is the storage capacity of a watershed mm and α is a parameter regarding the promptness of the watershed response to rainfall as s max decreases direct runoff increases the closer α is to 1 the higher the temporal flow variability the value ranges of tphm parameters can be inferred from the results of a sensitivity analysis and preliminary calibration table 1 once the daily runoff depth is calculated using eq 1 the watershed storage on day t is updated through the addition of daily rainfall and the subsequent removal of runoff and actual evapotranspiration based on the water mass balance 2 s t s t 1 p t q t et a t where et a t is the daily actual evapotranspiration mm 2 1 2 3 tank model the tank model with three tanks kim and park 1988 song et al 2017 sugawara 1979 was prepared to simulate streamflow of the study watersheds and compared with the tphm model in terms of simulation efficiency and performance the 3 tank model consists of three vertical tanks with outlets located at the bottom and side of each tank fig 1 b song et al 2016 water runs out of the side outlets of the tanks representing surface runoff for the first or top tank intermediate runoff for the second tank and base flow for the bottom tank kim and park 1988 song et al 2016 the model showed good performance in predicting the streamflow of watersheds that have various hydrological conditions in east asia including korea japan and taiwan chen et al 2014 fumikazu et al 2013 jang et al 2012 song et al 2016 yokoo et al 2001 the model has been used for areas where flow travel time is short and the recession limb of a streamflow hydrograph is steep song et al 2016 the tank model assumes a linear relationship between watershed discharge and storage which is often called a single linear reservoir model purcell 2006 nash 1957 3 q 1 k s where k is the watershed storage coefficient dimensionless the linear reservoir theory is applied to each of the three tanks of the 3 tank model which can then be mathematically described as follows 4 q t q 11 q 12 q 2 q 3 i

actual evapotranspiration of the i th tank at time t mm which will be limited by the amount of water stored in each tank eq 7 1 the et i t calculation starts from the top tank layer then moves down to the bottom layer thus the top layer can be more sensitive to evapotranspiration than the bottom tank eq 7 2 7 1 et i t st i t f o r et i t st i t 7 2 et i t et a t j 1 i 1 et j t f o r et i t st i t song et al 2017 determined the value ranges of the tank model parameters considering the hydrological characteristics of korean watersheds which were adopted in this study table 1 in addition the height h 3 of the third tank outlet was set to zero so that baseflow can be continuous whenever the third tank receives water from the second tank fig 1 and table 1 2 1 3 evapotranspiration in this study we used the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao approach rather than just adapting the method proposed by xiong and guo 1999 to estimate monthly actual evapotranspiration et a as their method gives unrealistic estimates i e zero et a at a daily scale when there is no rainfall the et a was estimated using the single crop coefficient k c t dimensionless and soil water stress coefficient k s t dimensionless as follows allen et al 1998 8 et a t k c t k s t et 0 t where et 0 is the potential evapotranspiration mm which was estimated using the fao penman monteith pm

averages of crop coefficient values for different land covers were then calculated to obtain a representative value for each study watershed the soil water stress coefficient k s is a function of soil water content the watershed scale coefficient was determined from the simulated total watershed storage s t and a modified power function as follows huh et al 1993 song et al 2017 10 k s 1 e x p s e c p i 1 n st i t where secp is a soil evaporation compensation parameter which is positively correlated to k s the secp parameter has been reported to vary from 0 001 to 0 5 depending on watershed soil texture huh et al 1993 kang et al 2013 but it was fixed to 0 05 in this study which is a recommended value for ungauged korean watersheds song 2017 2 2 model preparation and performance evaluation 2 2

depending on objective functions used especially when employing sampling based heuristic optimization algorithms diskin and simon 1977 green and stephenson 1986 her and chaubey 2015 oudin et al 2006 perrin et al 2001 servat and dezetter 1993 song 2017 objective functions can be selected considering the goal of modeling and the types of hydrologic variables to be simulated her and seong 2018 houghton carr 1999 oudin et al 2006 for example when high flow or peak runoff is the factor of interest modelers may employ objective functions that are relatively responsive to large values such as nse the coefficient of determination r 2 and the root mean squared error rmse or mse on the other hand when baseflow is the factor of interest a log transformed nse nse log may be appropriate for parameter calibration oudin et al 2006 showed that using the root squared nse nse sqrt could capture both high and low flows during calibration following the study of oudin et al 2006 nse sqrt was maximized for the parameter calibration of this study optnse sqrt eq 11 11 nse sqrt 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o and s represent the observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the number of time steps at time step i and the over bar represents an average of the given variable over the selected period the nse is commonly used as a statistic for evaluating hydrologic model performance however it is known that the nse and its variants do not comprehensively consider discharge variability gupta et al 2009 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and its modified version k g e kling et al 2012 were proposed to take into account the multiple aspects of model evaluation including correlation bias variance and variability simultaneously santos et al 2018b 12 kge

and σ is the standard deviation mm in this study we utilized k g e as well as nse as an objective function o p t k g e sqrt and compared the calibration results to enhance the reliability of hydrologic modeling results it is worth noting that a square root transformation or the box cox power transformation with a lambda value of 0 5 was applied to the original data allowing k g e sqrt to be calculated santos et al 2018b optimization techniques for non linear functions such as the newton type algorithms are often not well suited when used to calibrate conceptual rainfall runoff models hendrickson et al 1988 moore and clarke 1981 such techniques tend to become trapped in one of the local optima rather than locating one close to the global optimum especially when the response surface contains irregularities such as multiple local optima discontinuities elongated ridges or saddle points and flat plateaus in the hyperdimensional parameter space hendrickson et al 1988 wang 1997 which motivated a shift toward the global evolutionary algorithm in this study the parameter space of the models was explored by a sampling based heuristic search strategies namely the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce optimization algorithm duan et al 1992 the sce method initially selects a population of points randomly distributed in a feasible parameter space the populations are then partitioned into several complexes each complex is evolved independently according to the competitive complex evolution cce algorithm the populations are shuffled periodically so that information gained by the previous complexes can be shared among the current ones the evolution and shuffling steps are repeated until prescribed convergence criteria are satisfied duan et al 1994 gupta et al 1999 2 2 2 assessment criteria four statistics were employed to evaluate model performance in this study 14 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 15 nse log 1 i 1 n log o i ε log s i ε 2 i 1 n log o i ε

information fdcobs and fdcsim represent the observed and simulated streamflow mm respectively with an exceedance probability p of the flow duration curve number and h to h are indices for flows with exceedance probabilities of 0 05 to 0 95 the nse dimensionless places greater emphasis on peak values because the differences between the simulated and observed streamflow data are squared krause et al 2005 and it was used to evaluate high flow simulations in this study the nse log dimensionless shows increased sensitivity to low values compared to the original nse because of the logarithm and thus it was employed to assess low flow simulations oudin et al 2006 the percent bias pbias was used to check the overall relative discrepancy between observed and simulated streamflow gupta et al 1999 the nse f d c 90 dimensionless is the nash sutcliffe efficiency designed to evaluate the flow duration curve fdc at exceedance probabilities of 0 05 to 0 95 unlike nse fdc nse f d c 90 does not consider extremely high top 5 or low bottom 5 flow when evaluating model performance as nse fdc is overly sensitive to the extremes particularly values close to zero the nse nse log and nse f d c 90 will reach 1 when there is complete agreement between simulated and observed streamflow however they can be large negative values when the discrepancy between them is large the values of nse and its variants were normalized to range from 1 to 1 to avoid the influence of large negative values provided by unrealistic or non behavioral parameter sets when calculating the average performance statistics mathevet et al 2006 pushpalatha et al 2012 the transformation is given by 18 c c 2 c where c is the transformed value and c is the original value of the statistic 2 2 3 full split sample test and parameter consistency the original calibration periods were selected to include the driest and wettest seasons or years so that the model capability and parameter spaces could be thoroughly explored in this study a full split sample test was conducted to further evaluate model performance klemeš 1986 in the full split sample test the original calibration p1 and validation p2 periods were swapped so that the model parameters could be calibrated for each of the periods and subsequently validated for the other period then the statistical significance of differences in the parameter values identified from the two calibration experiments p1 and p2 for the individual study watersheds were investigated by a paired t test at a significance level of 0 05 to check the robustness of the calibrated parameter values 2 3 study watersheds a total of 41 watersheds throughout south korea were selected to test model applicability song 2017 fig 2 the precipitation records were spatially aggregated using the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 the pet was calculated using the fao pm method with records of temperature relative humidity mean wind velocity and solar radiation obtained from the relevant weather stations allen et al 1998 to further characterize the hydrologic features of the study watersheds topographic characteristics including ruggedness index riley et al 1999 channel slope and drainage density horton 1932 were derived from 30 m digital elevation models dems fig 2b c and d in addition the aridity index was calculated from daily pet estimates and precipitation records atkinson et al 2002 and q90 q50 from a flow duration curve analysis smakhtin 2001 fig 2e and f streamflow records were obtained from a database created and maintained by the korean ministry of land infrastructure and transport molit the length of the available flow records varied between watersheds but all study watersheds included at least five years of data from 2006 to 2014 the observations were split into two periods p1 and p2 for a full split sample test of the models the first two years of weather records were used to stabilize the hydrologic variables of the model so that the calibration results would be minimally affected by arbitrary and rough assumptions made for the initial conditions 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the tphm and 3 tank models were calibrated to streamflow measurements made at the outlets of the 41 study watersheds and their performances in terms of predicting high and low flow total runoff volume and fdc were systematically compared fig 3 optnse sqrt in general the 3 tank model yielded slightly better accuracy than the tphm table 2 however the two models provided similar performance for predicting high flow and water balance as indicated by t test at the significance level of 0 05 this finding implies that the simulation strategy and structure of the tphm is efficient especially when modeling runoff from large storm events for a comprehensive evaluation of the tphm nse log and nse f d c 90 were applied to simulated streamflow hydrographs as the statistics highlight the accuracy of reproducing low flow and flow variability respectively the nse log and nse f d c 90 values found in the model evaluation indicated that the 3 tank model provided slightly better accuracy for simulating low flow compared to the tphm p value 0 05 which was not detected when the model performance was investigated only using nse r 2 and or pbias such results highlight the usefulness of not relying only on commonly used statistics instead alternative statistics that can provide balanced view points in a model evaluation are useful especially when low flow is one of the modeling outputs of interest although low flow could be more accurately predicted by the 3 tank model by a small margin the evaluation results demonstrated the potential of the tphm as a parsimonious strategy for modeling high flow 3 2 relationship between model performance and watershed characteristics the 3 tank and tphm models did not provide satisfactory performance statistics in some study watersheds to identify the characteristics of watersheds in which the models may not be applicable we grouped the watersheds by satisfactory and unsatisfactory overall model performance based on the literature 0 50 nse and 10 pbias 15 moriasi et al 2015 and the criterion of nse log 0 5 then we investigated differences in the physical features between the two groups including area watershed slope ruggedness index channel slope drainage density aridity index and q90 q50 the two tailed wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted to test the significance of any differences at a significance level of 5 fig 4 optnse sqrt the tphm and 3 tank models provided unsatisfactory performance for 34 and 24 of the study watersheds during the validation period respectively table 2 however no statistical difference was found between the watershed characteristics of satisfactory and unsatisfactory groups fig 4 when the criteria of nse log 0 5 was applied the 3 tank model provided satisfactory accuracy in 93 of the watersheds but the tphm model was appliable to only 43 of them a significant difference between the two groups was found only in q90 q50 flashiness index the q90 q50 values of the unsatifactory nse log group were significantly higher than those of the satisfactory group p 0 05 such findings indicate that tphm is inferior to the 3 tank model when simulating low flow or baseflow which corresponds well to the model evaluation results described in the previous section 3 3 enhancement of the tphm although the tphm model provided relatively poor performance predicting small streamflow or baseflow between storm events compared to the 3 tank model the tphm showed potential for the development of parsimonious daily rainfall runoff models to improve the baseflow simulation of tphm we added the storage layer the top or bottom layer of the 3 tank model to the original tphm resulting in m1 and m2 models depending on how the layer was added fig 5 in the m1 model the top tank of the 3 tank model is overlain on the tphm layer fig 5 a precipitation gets in the top tank first and excess water located above the thresholds h 11 and h 12 is discharged in the form of direct runoff water infiltrated or passed through the bottom outlet of the top tank flows into the tphm layer which then produces subsurface flow q 20 coming out of the outlet α as follows 19 q t q 11 q 12 q 20 20 q 11 st 1 t h 11 a 11

parameters respectively table 3 and parameter value ranges identical to those of the original 3 tank model and tphm were applied to the corresponding m1 and m2 model parameters table 1 the models were evaluated under the same conditions i e identical data sets calibration procedure and testing schemes described in the previous section analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine the statistical significance of performance differences between the models prepared for the 41 study watersheds subsequently a post hoc tukey honestly significant difference hsd test was performed to facilitate a pairwise comparison of the performance statistics provided by the models clarke 2008 fig 6 optnse sqrt shows the variations of normalized nse s across the 41 study watersheds for the validation periods the three models 3 tank m1 and m2 have different numbers of parameters in their own unique structures but provided similar accuracy when predicting high flow water balance and flow duration curves of the watersheds there was no statistically significant difference between the model performance statistics measured with nse nse f d c 90 and pbias p 0 05 in terms of nse log however m1 yielded the worst performance among the three models p 0 05 while m2 provided a similar level of accuracy to that of the 3 tank model m2 showed significant accuracy gains in low flow simulation by adding a linear reservoir onto the tphm layer while maintaining the same accuracy in high flow prediction the m2 and 3 tank models have four and nine parameters respectively but no significant difference was found in the accuracy of their daily rainfall runoff simulation such a result clearly demonstrates the potential of m2 as a parsimonious daily rainfall runoff model 3 4 correlation between model performance and watershed characteristics to investigate the potential relationship between watershed characteristics and model performance we measured the strength of the correlation between the nse values obtained for the validation period and the six hydrological features of the watersheds fig 7 optnse sqrt this analysis was conducted only for the satisfactory group 0 50 nse and pbias 15 to exclude the influence of models that are not applicable to the watersheds correlation structures p 0 05 were significant in the relationship between nse ruggedness index values and drainage density in the cases of tphm fig 7 the tphm model underperformed in watersheds that exhibit low ruggedness the performance of other models that include a second storage or routing layer was not correlated to the ruggedness fig 7 in the case of m1 and m2 channel slopes and drainage density were significantly associated with nse the channel slope was positively correlated with the nse s of m1 r 0 49 p 0 05 and the drainage density was negatively correlated with the nse s of tphm and m2 p 0 05 the performance of the 3 tank model was not related to any watershed characteristics overall the tphm based models provided relatively higher accuracy when predicting watershed streamflow with high ruggedness steep channel slopes and or low drainage density which tend to produce faster flow velocities or shorter travel time and higher direct runoff peaks dingman 1978 oguchi 1997 these findings imply that the hyperbolic tangent function may perform better for mountainous watersheds however the performance of the 3 tank model was not related to any specific watershed characteristics 4 discussions in this study we explored parsimonious daily rainfall runoff model structures by reevaluating the potential of the hyperbolic tangent function and linking a storage layer to the function the model application results demonstrated that high daily streamflow could be efficiently simulated using the tphm model and the daily baseflow simulation of tphm was significantly improved with an additional storage layer attached to its bottom and two extra parameters m2 we found that there was no statistically significant difference between high flow low flow water balance and flow variability provided by the enhanced four parameter tphm m2 and the conventional nine parameter tank model the original tphm model with only two parameters exhibited improved accuracy at predicting streamflow compared to the tank and ssarr models kim 2001 in this study the tphm model performed well enough to reproduce watershed responses including high flow and water balance at an acceptable level of accuracy which demonstrated that a single layer model can be competitive with or indeed often superior to a more complicated model kavetski and fenicia 2011 however we also found that the original tphm model performed relatively poorly when predicting low flow in the study watersheds figs 3 and 4 from the correlation analysis we also found that the tphm model underperformed in watersheds with low ruggedness index values and thus relatively long flow travel times fig 7 such findings should be attributed to the structure of the tphm which is too simple to capture the delayed responses of a watershed e g groundwater recharge and discharge to rainfall events a storage layer and two parameters added to the tphm model m1 and m2 improved model prediction of the baseflow of streamflow hydrographs such a finding is consistent with those of previous studies which showed that a minimum level of complexity is required to achieve acceptable accuracy levels in low flow simulation atkinson et al 2002 ley et al 2016 parajka et al 2013 pushpalatha et al 2011 van esse et al 2013 a storage layer the top or bottom layer of the 3 tank model was added to the original tphm to improve the base flow simulation m1 and m2 fig 5 we found that m1 where baseflow is represented by the outflow of the tphm layer yielded poorer performance when reproducing low flow than m2 where direct runoff is represented by the outflow of the tphm layer the m2 model provided a similar level of accuracy to that of the 3 tank model when predicting high and low flow water balance and fdc fig 6 it is worth noting that the four parameter model m2 yielded better performance than the seven parameter model m1 such a finding suggests that model performance should be more efficiently improved by devising an appropriate model structure rather than merely increasing the number of calibration parameters her et al 2017 hrachowitz et al 2014 kavetski and fenicia 2011 the improved efficiency of the m2 model is supported by jakeman and hornberger 1993 and perrin et al 2001 who demonstrated that three to five parameters with an efficient model structure could be sufficient to produce satisfactory accuracy when simulating daily streamflow a detailed comparison of the simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs revealed how the parsimonious structure of m2 performed well in terms of reproducing the shapes of hydrographs fig 8 for comparison the recession and baseflow only parts of the streamflow hydrographs were simulated using the storage discharge relationships represented by a linear reservoir and tphm it is clear from fig 8 that the tphm structure well reproduced the nonlinear shape of the recession limb where the gradient dq dt gradually decreased after peak flow on the other hand the linear reservoir did not reproduce the variations of gradation but described the baseflow only segment well where the flow gradually or linearly decreased over time fig 8 b this comparison confirmed that the hyperbolic tangent and linear functions are well suited to simulate direct runoff and baseflow respectively explaining the relatively superior performance of m2 with both functions aligned in its upper and lower layers accordingly the threshold outlet positions h 11 and h 12 of 3 tank and m1 determine the capacity for storing or abstracting the amount of rainfall at the beginning of an event and the total surface storage capacity of the upper layer respectively thus they regulate the responses of direct runoff to rainfall sugawara 1979 tingsanchali and gautam 2000 yokoo et al 2001 specifically h 11 and h 12 control the quick runoff response and high and peak flow respectively the h 11 and h 12 values of m1 calibrated for the 41 study watersheds were significantly different from those of calibrated for 3 tank paired t test p 0 05 in addition the difference between the distributions of the calibrated threshold outlet positions h 11 and h 12 of 3 tank and m1 was significant kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 such findings demonstrate how model structure i e the difference in their lower layers could affect parameter values the sce algorithm was suitable to detect the structural differences in the models this study investigated the consistency of parameter values identified from the four different calibration experiments conducted for the study watersheds with unique combinations of objective functions optnse sqrt and o p t k g e sqrt and evaluation periods p1 and p2 in the full split sample test to confirm the robustness of the rainfall runoff modeling a paired t test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the differences in the parameter values of the models prepared for individual study watersheds calibrated to p1 and p2 at the significance level of 0 05 the results showed that a 2 of 3 tank and s max of m1 are the only parameters whose values were significantly different from each other in the p1 and p2 calibration experiments fig 9 the values of the tphm and m2 parameters calibrated to p1 and p2 were statistically consistent in the full split sample test the two parameters s max and α of tphm and m2 vary greatly in their calibrated values depending on the characteristics of watersheds fig 10 and table 1 the parameter α was introduced to represent the promptness of the daily watershed response to rainfall in tphm and it was not included in the original monthly scale model proposed by xiong and guo 1999 the parameter determines the lag time which is not usually considered in a monthly rainfall runoff model but is an important characteristic of runoff hydrographs at daily or finer temporal scales the values of the parameter or the lag time are dependent on watershed characteristics such as soils land uses and topography as demonstrated in the parameter calibration the use of different objective functions optnse sqrt and o p t k g e sqrt provided significantly different parameter values as determined by the kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 for a 11 b 1 h 2 and b 2 of 3 tank b 1 and smax of m1 and b 2 of m2 figs 10 and s1 when the parameters were calibrated using o p t k g e sqrt rather than optnse sqrt as an objective function flow variability i e nse f d c 90 was more accurately reproduced by 3 tank and m2 but the accuracy of their high flow simulations was slightly degraded fig s1 a and b this trade off was expected since o p t k g e sqrt explicitly considers flow variability but optnse sqrt does not gupta et al 2009 santos et al 2018b the use of o p t k g e sqrt did not improve the accuracy of flow variability simulated by the tphm and m1 compared to the case of using optnse sqrt fig s1 c and d this implies that the performance of models that exhibit structural limitations in reproducing flow variability or low flow may not be enhanced without structural modifications 5 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the potential applications of the tphm and proposed alternative structures as a parsimonious daily rainfall runoff modeling tool for hydrological analyses and watershed management planning the four new and existing models tphm m1 m2 and 3 tank were applied to 41 watersheds covering a diverse range of hydrological characteristics in south korea the accuracy of the models was evaluated by comparing streamflow measured and simulated at the watershed outlets in terms of peak flow baseflow water balance and flow variability results showed that there was no significant difference between the performance of tphm and 3 tank when predicting high flow and water balance thus we confirm that the strategy and structure of the tphm model should be more efficient for direct runoff simulation than those of the 3 tank model when considering the numbers of parameters employed in the models two vs nine parameters however we also found that the tphm structure was not sophisticated enough to accurately reproduce low flow and fdc especially in watersheds where the temporal variability of the baseflow is relatively small we proposed two new model structures m1 and m2 based on tphm and 3 tank models which improved model applicability especially the four parameter hyperbolic model m2 in this study provided similar simulation accuracy to that of the three layer nine parameter tank model 3 tank in addition m2 was superior to the two parameter tphm and seven parameter m1 models when predicting low flow and baseflow in the study watersheds the incorporated hyperbolic tangent function and linear reservoir made m2 efficient in reproducing the characteristics of streamflow hydrographs such evaluation results suggest that m2 can be an effective parsimonious daily rainfall runoff simulation tool that contains the minimum parameters and model structure complexity required to predict streamflow at a commonly acceptable accuracy

6454,mathematical models with small numbers of parameters are useful for hydrological analyses and water resources planning as they are easier to prepare use and interpret compared to more complex models many simple model structures and simulation strategies have been developed but there is still substantial room for improvement in the efficiency of daily rainfall runoff modeling this study proposes daily rainfall runoff models that require only two to four parameters yet are capable of predicting peak discharge and baseflow parsimonious model structures were obtained using the hyperbolic tangent function and combining it with one subsurface layer and two parameters of a tank model the daily rainfall runoff models proposed based on the two parameter hyperbolic model tphm and tank model were applied to 41 watersheds throughout south korea model accuracy was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated watershed streamflow and compared with that of a nine parameter tank model the original tphm and its variants yielded slightly better efficiency with a smaller number of parameters than the tank model when reproducing high flows on a daily basis the accuracy of low flow and flow duration curve predictions provided by the tphm based models was higher in watersheds with relatively large baseflow temporal variability the results suggested that the tphm based structures be alternative parsimonious daily rainfall runoff simulation models this study demonstrates that daily high streamflow can be efficiently simulated using a two parameter hydrological model and daily baseflow simulation can be improved by adding two additional parameters to the model keywords daily rainfall runoff modeling parsimonious model hyperbolic tangent function two parameter hyperbolic model tank model 1 introduction parsimonious mechanistic as opposed to statistical models employ only the parameters needed to predict hydrological variables of interest at the required level of accuracy atkinson et al 2002 barrett and charbeneau 1997 basu et al 2010 jackson blake et al 2017 pande et al 2012 perrin et al 2003 valentin et al 2018 their structures and simulation strategies are often simple enough to ignore spatial variability in landscape and hydrological processes happening in a watershed clark et al 2008 fenicia et al 2010 kavetski and fenicia 2011 van esse et al 2013 vansteenkiste et al 2014 van gaelen et al 2017 thus the parameters of parsimonious models tend to be conceptual or empirical and it is not possible to estimate their spatially averaged values by either measurement or prior estimation which makes parameter calibration a necessary and critical part of simulations using a parsimonious model hrachowitz et al 2014 perrin et al 2001 such features are not appropriate for certain scientific purposes but are typically required when input data are limited rapid model preparation and routine model runs are needed and or complicated simulations are not necessary fenicia et al 2011 hrachowitz et al 2014 perrin et al 2001 santos et al 2018a valentin et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 parsimonious models are preferred as they tend to have fewer parameters and result in a lower parameter uncertainty basu et al 2010 her and chaubey 2015 in addition their structures are usually easy to understand thereby improving transparency in modeling based decision making processes and communication with stakeholders for the same reason they can also be a good educational tool parsimonious models have been successful in many applications including the design of hydrological structures and facilities such as irrigation reservoirs habets et al 2018 kim and park 1988 flood forecasting berthet et al 2009 low flow simulation staudinger et al 2011 assessing the hydrological impact of climate change block et al 2009 and helping students understand hydrology and hydrologic modeling as an educational tool aghakouchak et al 2013 they have made significant contributions to hydrological analysis and modeling by providing a basis for more sophisticated and complicated models ajami et al 2004 uhlenbrook et al 2004 many studies have attempted to identify or define a parsimonious model structure but no clear boundary has yet been defined kavetski and fenicia 2011 van esse et al 2013 in this context we define a parsimonious mechanistic model as one that employs the minimum number of parameters and predicts hydrological variables of interest at a predefined acceptable level of accuracy while representing dominant watershed processes in a physically meaningful way fenicia et al 2011 jackson blake et al 2017 valentin et al 2018 streamflow is often the only variable that has historical records in a hydrological analysis and its time series contain substantial information about hydrological processes occurring in a watershed in lumped conceptual hydrological modeling a watershed is sometimes represented with a series of storages reservoirs or tanks that can retain precipitation and release water to its outlet so that the delay and attenuation of runoff can be simulated the tank model sugawara 1979 is one form of simple daily hydrological model that has been commonly used in watershed assessment and planning chen et al 2014 fumikazu et al 2013 jang et al 2012 song et al 2016 tingsanchali and gautam 2000 yokoo et al 2001 depending on the complexity of watershed responses to storm events a tank model uses two to four vertical storage tanks connected to each other with outlets to mimic non linear runoff routing processes along flow pathways across a watershed despite its simple structure and simulation strategy the number of parameters to be calibrated can be challenging in model preparation especially when streamflow observations are limited studies have attempted to further simplify the structure of the tank model and reduce the number of calibration parameters by incorporating nonlinear functions into the model such as the curve number method usda 1956 power functions lag functions fenicia et al 2011 perrin et al 2003 logistic functions kavetski and kuczera 2007 gamma distribution press et al 1996 and hyperbolic tangent function boughton 1984 budyko 1974 chiew et al 1993 xiong and guo 1999 kim 2001 developed the two parameter hyperbolic model tphm by combining the hyperbolic tangent and power functions so that runoff can be predicted using only two parameters the tphm reproduced daily runoff from 25 watersheds located in south korea republic of korea the united kingdom and the united states of america at an accuracy level as good as or slightly better than the tank sugawara 1979 and synthetic streamflow and reservoir regulation ssarr us army corps of engineers usace 1972 models kim 2001 although tphm showed potential as a parsimonious method of predicting streamflow model performance was evaluated based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is sensitive to high flow and large outliers therefore the agreement between simulated and observed peak flow was likely overemphasized and deviations in low flow might have been neglected legates and mccabe 1999 pfannerstill et al 2014 which suggest that a re evaluation of tphm performance is required baseflow is a critical consideration in water resources management planning as it controls the ecological function of a watershed and regulates the seasonal distribution of streamwater pfannerstill et al 2014 pushpalatha et al 2011 staudinger et al 2011 previous studies have proposed performance measures that are responsive to low flow to more precisely evaluate a model s capacity to reproduce baseflow in hydrological modeling ley et al 2016 orth et al 2015 pushpalatha et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008 we reevaluated the potential of tphm as a parsimonious modeling tool to simulate daily rainfall runoff processes then explored its alternative forms for improved baseflow modeling in this study tphm was applied to reproducing the streamflow hydrographs of 41 study watersheds located in south korea and storage layers of a tank model were integrated into tphm the performance of tphm and its variants was compared with that of the tank model which has three storage tanks using accuracy statistics commonly employed in hydrological modeling we also examined the potential correspondence between hydrologic characteristics of the study watersheds and the performance statistics of tphms prepared for the watersheds to further understand the applicability of the models 2 methodology 2 1 hydrological models 2 1 1 tphm the tphm is a single layer daily rainfall runoff model kim 2001 that mathematically expresses the relationship between watershed storage and runoff using a combination of a hyperbolic tangent and power function in a conventional tank model tanks are linked to each other vertically outlets are located at the bottom and side of each tank to represent non linear runoff routing processes in the tphm on the other hand a wedge shaped opening was devised from the top of a tank to the bottom to represent a nonlinear storage discharge relationship using only one storage layer fig 1 a the hyperbolic tangent function is commonly used to represent the runoff responses to rainfall the quadratic storage discharge relationship obtained when integrated in this way results in a solution involving the hyperbolic tangent function moore and bell 2002 perrin et al 2003 moore 1999 2007 xiong and guo 1999 speculated that monthly runoff could be simulated as a hyperbolic tangent function of watershed storage then kim 2001 modified the xiong and guo 1999 model to simulate daily runoff as a function of both watershed storage and rainfall depth 1 q t t a n h s t 1 p t s max α s t 1 p t where q t is the daily runoff mm on day t s t is the daily watershed water storage mm p t is the daily rainfall s max is the storage capacity of a watershed mm and α is a parameter regarding the promptness of the watershed response to rainfall as s max decreases direct runoff increases the closer α is to 1 the higher the temporal flow variability the value ranges of tphm parameters can be inferred from the results of a sensitivity analysis and preliminary calibration table 1 once the daily runoff depth is calculated using eq 1 the watershed storage on day t is updated through the addition of daily rainfall and the subsequent removal of runoff and actual evapotranspiration based on the water mass balance 2 s t s t 1 p t q t et a t where et a t is the daily actual evapotranspiration mm 2 1 2 3 tank model the tank model with three tanks kim and park 1988 song et al 2017 sugawara 1979 was prepared to simulate streamflow of the study watersheds and compared with the tphm model in terms of simulation efficiency and performance the 3 tank model consists of three vertical tanks with outlets located at the bottom and side of each tank fig 1 b song et al 2016 water runs out of the side outlets of the tanks representing surface runoff for the first or top tank intermediate runoff for the second tank and base flow for the bottom tank kim and park 1988 song et al 2016 the model showed good performance in predicting the streamflow of watersheds that have various hydrological conditions in east asia including korea japan and taiwan chen et al 2014 fumikazu et al 2013 jang et al 2012 song et al 2016 yokoo et al 2001 the model has been used for areas where flow travel time is short and the recession limb of a streamflow hydrograph is steep song et al 2016 the tank model assumes a linear relationship between watershed discharge and storage which is often called a single linear reservoir model purcell 2006 nash 1957 3 q 1 k s where k is the watershed storage coefficient dimensionless the linear reservoir theory is applied to each of the three tanks of the 3 tank model which can then be mathematically described as follows 4 q t q 11 q 12 q 2 q 3 i

actual evapotranspiration of the i th tank at time t mm which will be limited by the amount of water stored in each tank eq 7 1 the et i t calculation starts from the top tank layer then moves down to the bottom layer thus the top layer can be more sensitive to evapotranspiration than the bottom tank eq 7 2 7 1 et i t st i t f o r et i t st i t 7 2 et i t et a t j 1 i 1 et j t f o r et i t st i t song et al 2017 determined the value ranges of the tank model parameters considering the hydrological characteristics of korean watersheds which were adopted in this study table 1 in addition the height h 3 of the third tank outlet was set to zero so that baseflow can be continuous whenever the third tank receives water from the second tank fig 1 and table 1 2 1 3 evapotranspiration in this study we used the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao approach rather than just adapting the method proposed by xiong and guo 1999 to estimate monthly actual evapotranspiration et a as their method gives unrealistic estimates i e zero et a at a daily scale when there is no rainfall the et a was estimated using the single crop coefficient k c t dimensionless and soil water stress coefficient k s t dimensionless as follows allen et al 1998 8 et a t k c t k s t et 0 t where et 0 is the potential evapotranspiration mm which was estimated using the fao penman monteith pm

kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the crop coefficient of each land cover was determined based on the recommendations made by allen et al 1998 and song et al 2017 the area weighted averages of crop coefficient values for different land covers were then calculated to obtain a representative value for each study watershed the soil water stress coefficient k s is a function of soil water content the watershed scale coefficient was determined from the simulated total watershed storage s t and a modified power function as follows huh et al 1993 song et al 2017 10 k s 1 e x p s e c p i 1 n st i t where secp is a soil evaporation compensation parameter which is positively correlated to k s the secp parameter has been reported to vary from 0 001 to 0 5 depending on watershed soil texture huh et al 1993 kang et al 2013 but it was fixed to 0 05 in this study which is a recommended value for ungauged korean watersheds song 2017 2 2 model preparation and performance evaluation 2 2 1 parameter optimization a hydrologic modeler can find a set of parameter values that are significantly different to each other but providing equally good performance statistics in calibration depending on objective functions used especially when employing sampling based heuristic optimization algorithms diskin and simon 1977 green and stephenson 1986 her and chaubey 2015 oudin et al 2006 perrin et al 2001 servat and dezetter 1993 song 2017 objective functions can be selected considering the goal of modeling and the types of hydrologic variables to be simulated her and seong 2018 houghton carr 1999 oudin et al 2006 for example when high flow or peak runoff is the factor of interest modelers may employ objective functions that are relatively responsive to large values such as nse the coefficient of determination r 2 and the root mean squared error rmse or mse on the other hand when baseflow is the factor of interest a log transformed nse nse log may be appropriate for parameter calibration oudin et al 2006 showed that using the root squared nse nse sqrt could capture both high and low flows during calibration following the study of oudin et al 2006 nse sqrt was maximized for the parameter calibration of this study optnse sqrt eq 11 11 nse sqrt 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o and s represent the observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the number of time steps at time step i and the over bar represents an average of the given variable over the selected period the nse is commonly used as a statistic for evaluating hydrologic model performance however it is known that the nse and its variants do not comprehensively consider discharge variability gupta et al 2009 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and its modified version k g e kling et al 2012 were proposed to take into account the multiple aspects of model evaluation including correlation bias variance and variability simultaneously santos et al 2018b 12 kge

and σ is the standard deviation mm in this study we utilized k g e as well as nse as an objective function o p t k g e sqrt and compared the calibration results to enhance the reliability of hydrologic modeling results it is worth noting that a square root transformation or the box cox power transformation with a lambda value of 0 5 was applied to the original data allowing k g e sqrt to be calculated santos et al 2018b optimization techniques for non linear functions such as the newton type algorithms are often not well suited when used to calibrate conceptual rainfall runoff models hendrickson et al 1988 moore and clarke 1981 such techniques tend to become trapped in one of the local optima rather than locating one close to the global optimum especially when the response surface contains irregularities such as multiple local optima discontinuities elongated ridges or saddle points and flat plateaus in the hyperdimensional parameter space hendrickson et al 1988 wang 1997 which motivated a shift toward the global evolutionary algorithm in this study the parameter space of the models was explored by a sampling based heuristic search strategies namely the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce optimization algorithm duan et al 1992 the sce method initially selects a population of points randomly distributed in a feasible parameter space the populations are then partitioned into several complexes each complex is evolved independently according to the competitive complex evolution cce algorithm the populations are shuffled periodically so that information gained by the previous complexes can be shared among the current ones the evolution and shuffling steps are repeated until prescribed convergence criteria are satisfied duan et al 1994 gupta et al

information fdcobs and fdcsim represent the observed and simulated streamflow mm respectively with an exceedance probability p of the flow duration curve number and h to h are indices for flows with exceedance probabilities of 0 05 to 0 95 the nse dimensionless places greater emphasis on peak values because the differences between the simulated and observed streamflow data are squared krause et al 2005 and it was used to evaluate high flow simulations in this study the nse log dimensionless shows increased sensitivity to low values compared to the original nse because of the logarithm and thus it was employed to assess low flow simulations oudin et al 2006 the percent bias pbias was used to check the overall relative discrepancy between observed and simulated streamflow gupta et al 1999 the nse f d c 90 dimensionless is the nash sutcliffe efficiency designed to evaluate the flow duration curve fdc at exceedance probabilities of 0 05 to 0 95 unlike nse fdc nse f d c 90 does not consider extremely high top 5 or low bottom 5 flow when evaluating model performance as nse fdc is overly sensitive to the extremes particularly values close to zero the nse nse log and nse f d c 90 will reach 1 when there is complete agreement between simulated and observed streamflow however they can be large negative values when the discrepancy between them is large the values of nse and its variants were normalized to range from 1 to 1 to avoid the influence of large negative values provided by unrealistic or non behavioral parameter sets when calculating the average performance statistics mathevet et al 2006 pushpalatha et al 2012 the transformation is given by 18 c c 2 c where c is the transformed value and c is the original value of the statistic 2 2 3 full split sample test and parameter consistency the original calibration periods were selected to include the driest and wettest seasons or years so that the model capability and parameter spaces could be thoroughly explored in this study a full split sample test was conducted to further evaluate model performance klemeš 1986 in the full split sample test the original calibration p1 and validation p2 periods were swapped so that the model parameters could be calibrated for each of the periods and subsequently validated for the other period then the statistical significance of differences in the parameter values identified from the two calibration experiments p1 and p2 for the individual study watersheds were investigated by a paired t test at a significance level of 0 05 to check the robustness of the calibrated parameter values 2 3 study watersheds a total of 41 watersheds throughout south korea were selected to test model applicability song 2017 fig 2 the precipitation records were spatially aggregated using the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 the pet was calculated using the fao pm method with records of temperature relative humidity mean wind velocity and solar radiation obtained from the relevant weather stations allen et al 1998 to further characterize the hydrologic features of the study watersheds topographic characteristics including ruggedness index riley et al 1999 channel slope and drainage density horton 1932 were derived from 30 m digital elevation models dems fig 2b c and d in addition the aridity index was calculated from daily pet estimates and precipitation records atkinson et al 2002 and q90 q50 from a flow duration curve analysis smakhtin 2001 fig 2e and f streamflow records were obtained from a database created and maintained by the korean ministry of land infrastructure and transport molit the length of the available flow records varied between watersheds but all study watersheds included at least five years of data from 2006 to 2014 the observations were split into two periods p1 and p2 for a full split sample test of the models the first two years of weather records were used to stabilize the hydrologic variables of the model so that the calibration results would be minimally affected by arbitrary and rough assumptions made for the initial conditions 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the tphm and 3 tank models were calibrated to streamflow measurements made at the outlets of the 41 study watersheds and their performances in terms of predicting high and low flow total runoff volume and fdc were systematically compared fig 3 optnse sqrt in general the 3 tank model yielded slightly better accuracy than the tphm table 2 however the two models provided similar performance for predicting high flow and water balance as indicated by t test at the significance level of 0 05 this finding implies that the simulation strategy and structure of the tphm is efficient especially when modeling runoff from large storm events for a comprehensive evaluation of the tphm nse log and nse f d c 90 were applied to simulated streamflow hydrographs as the statistics highlight the accuracy of reproducing low flow and flow variability respectively the nse log and nse f d c 90 values found in the model evaluation indicated that the 3 tank model provided slightly better accuracy for simulating low flow compared to the tphm p value 0 05 which was not detected when the model performance was investigated only using nse r 2 and or pbias such results highlight the usefulness of not relying only on commonly used statistics instead alternative statistics that can provide balanced view points in a model evaluation are useful especially when low flow is one of the modeling outputs of interest although low flow could be more accurately predicted by the 3 tank model by a small margin the evaluation results demonstrated the potential of the tphm as a parsimonious strategy for modeling high flow 3 2 relationship between model performance and watershed characteristics the 3 tank and tphm models did not provide satisfactory performance statistics in some study watersheds to identify the characteristics of watersheds in which the models may not be applicable we grouped the watersheds by satisfactory and unsatisfactory overall model performance based on the literature 0 50 nse and 10 pbias 15 moriasi et al 2015 and the criterion of nse log 0 5 then we investigated differences in the physical features between the two groups including area watershed slope ruggedness index channel slope drainage density aridity index and q90 q50 the two tailed wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted to test the significance of any differences at a significance level of 5 fig 4 optnse sqrt the tphm and 3 tank models provided unsatisfactory performance for 34 and 24 of the study watersheds during the validation period respectively table 2 however no statistical difference was found between the watershed characteristics of satisfactory and unsatisfactory groups fig 4 when the criteria of nse log 0 5 was applied the 3 tank model provided satisfactory accuracy in 93 of the watersheds but the tphm model was appliable to only 43 of them a significant difference between the two groups was found only in q90 q50 flashiness index the q90 q50 values of the unsatifactory nse log group were significantly higher than those of the satisfactory group p 0 05 such findings indicate that tphm is inferior to the 3 tank model when simulating low flow or baseflow which corresponds well to the model evaluation results described in the previous section 3 3 enhancement of the tphm although the tphm model provided relatively poor performance predicting small streamflow or baseflow between storm events compared to the 3 tank model the tphm showed potential for the development of parsimonious daily rainfall runoff models to improve the baseflow simulation of tphm we added the storage layer the top or bottom layer of the 3 tank model to the original tphm resulting in m1 and m2 models depending on how the layer was added fig 5 in the m1 model the top tank of the 3 tank model is overlain on the tphm layer fig 5 a precipitation gets in the top tank first and excess water located above the thresholds h 11 and h 12 is discharged in the form of direct runoff water infiltrated or passed through the bottom outlet of the top tank flows into the tphm layer which then produces subsurface flow q 20 coming out of the outlet α as follows 19 q t q 11 q 12 q 20 20 q 11 st 1 t h 11 a 11

parameters respectively table 3 and parameter value ranges identical to those of the original 3 tank model and tphm were applied to the corresponding m1 and m2 model parameters table 1 the models were evaluated under the same conditions i e identical data sets calibration procedure and testing schemes described in the previous section analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine the statistical significance of performance differences between the models prepared for the 41 study watersheds subsequently a post hoc tukey honestly significant difference hsd test was performed to facilitate a pairwise comparison of the performance statistics provided by the models clarke 2008 fig 6 optnse sqrt shows the variations of normalized nse s across the 41 study watersheds for the validation periods the three models 3 tank m1 and m2 have different numbers of parameters in their own unique structures but provided similar accuracy when predicting high flow water balance and flow duration curves of the watersheds there was no statistically significant difference between the model performance statistics measured with nse nse f d c 90 and pbias p 0 05 in terms of nse log however m1 yielded the worst performance among the three models p 0 05 while m2 provided a similar level of accuracy to that of the 3 tank model m2 showed significant accuracy gains in low flow simulation by adding a linear reservoir onto the tphm layer while maintaining the same accuracy in high flow prediction the m2 and 3 tank models have four and nine parameters respectively but no significant difference was found in the accuracy of their daily rainfall runoff simulation such a result clearly demonstrates the potential of m2 as a parsimonious daily rainfall runoff model 3 4 correlation between model performance and watershed characteristics to investigate the potential relationship between watershed characteristics and model performance we measured the strength of the correlation between the nse values obtained for the validation period and the six hydrological features of the watersheds fig 7 optnse sqrt this analysis was conducted only for the satisfactory group 0 50 nse and pbias 15 to exclude the influence of models that are not applicable to the watersheds correlation structures p 0 05 were significant in the relationship between nse ruggedness index values and drainage density in the cases of tphm fig 7 the tphm model underperformed in watersheds that exhibit low ruggedness the performance of other models that include a second storage or routing layer was not correlated to the ruggedness fig 7 in the case of m1 and m2 channel slopes and drainage density were significantly associated with nse the channel slope was positively correlated with the nse s of m1 r 0 49 p 0 05 and the drainage density was negatively correlated with the nse s of tphm and m2 p 0 05 the performance of the 3 tank model was not related to any watershed characteristics overall the tphm based models provided relatively higher accuracy when predicting watershed streamflow with high ruggedness steep channel slopes and or low drainage density which tend to produce faster flow velocities or shorter travel time and higher direct runoff peaks dingman 1978 oguchi 1997 these findings imply that the hyperbolic tangent function may perform better for mountainous watersheds however the performance of the 3 tank model was not related to any specific watershed characteristics 4 discussions in this study we explored parsimonious daily rainfall runoff model structures by reevaluating the potential of the hyperbolic tangent function and linking a storage layer to the function the model application results demonstrated that high daily streamflow could be efficiently simulated using the tphm model and the daily baseflow simulation of tphm was significantly improved with an additional storage layer attached to its bottom and two extra parameters m2 we found that there was no statistically significant difference between high flow low flow water balance and flow variability provided by the enhanced four parameter tphm m2 and the conventional nine parameter tank model the original tphm model with only two parameters exhibited improved accuracy at predicting streamflow compared to the tank and ssarr models kim 2001 in this study the tphm model performed well enough to reproduce watershed responses including high flow and water balance at an acceptable level of accuracy which demonstrated that a single layer model can be competitive with or indeed often superior to a more complicated model kavetski and fenicia 2011 however we also found that the original tphm model performed relatively poorly when predicting low flow in the study watersheds figs 3 and 4 from the correlation analysis we also found that the tphm model underperformed in watersheds with low ruggedness index values and thus relatively long flow travel times fig 7 such findings should be attributed to the structure of the tphm which is too simple to capture the delayed responses of a watershed e g groundwater recharge and discharge to rainfall events a storage layer and two parameters added to the tphm model m1 and m2 improved model prediction of the baseflow of streamflow hydrographs such a finding is consistent with those of previous studies which showed that a minimum level of complexity is required to achieve acceptable accuracy levels in low flow simulation atkinson et al 2002 ley et al 2016 parajka et al 2013 pushpalatha et al 2011 van esse et al 2013 a storage layer the top or bottom layer of the 3 tank model was added to the original tphm to improve the base flow simulation m1 and m2 fig 5 we found that m1 where baseflow is represented by the outflow of the tphm layer yielded poorer performance when reproducing low flow than m2 where direct runoff is represented by the outflow of the tphm layer the m2 model provided a similar level of accuracy to that of the 3 tank model when predicting high and low flow water balance and fdc fig 6 it is worth noting that the four parameter model m2 yielded better performance than the seven parameter model m1 such a finding suggests that model performance should be more efficiently improved by devising an appropriate model structure rather than merely increasing the number of calibration parameters her et al 2017 hrachowitz et al 2014 kavetski and fenicia 2011 the improved efficiency of the m2 model is supported by jakeman and hornberger 1993 and perrin et al 2001 who demonstrated that three to five parameters with an efficient model structure could be sufficient to produce satisfactory accuracy when simulating daily streamflow a detailed comparison of the simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs revealed how the parsimonious structure of m2 performed well in terms of reproducing the shapes of hydrographs fig 8 for comparison the recession and baseflow only parts of the streamflow hydrographs were simulated using the storage discharge relationships represented by a linear reservoir and tphm it is clear from fig 8 that the tphm structure well reproduced the nonlinear shape of the recession limb where the gradient dq dt gradually decreased after peak flow on the other hand the linear reservoir did not reproduce the variations of gradation but described the baseflow only segment well where the flow gradually or linearly decreased over time fig 8 b this comparison confirmed that the hyperbolic tangent and linear functions are well suited to simulate direct runoff and baseflow respectively explaining the relatively superior performance of m2 with both functions aligned in its upper and lower layers accordingly the threshold outlet positions h 11 and h 12 of 3 tank and m1 determine the capacity for storing or abstracting the amount of rainfall at the beginning of an event and the total surface storage capacity of the upper layer respectively thus they regulate the responses of direct runoff to rainfall sugawara 1979 tingsanchali and gautam 2000 yokoo et al 2001 specifically h 11 and h 12 control the quick runoff response and high and peak flow respectively the h 11 and h 12 values of m1 calibrated for the 41 study watersheds were significantly different from those of calibrated for 3 tank paired t test p 0 05 in addition the difference between the distributions of the calibrated threshold outlet positions h 11 and h 12 of 3 tank and m1 was significant kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 such findings demonstrate how model structure i e the difference in their lower layers could affect parameter values the sce algorithm was suitable to detect the structural differences in the models this study investigated the consistency of parameter values identified from the four different calibration experiments conducted for the study watersheds with unique combinations of objective functions optnse sqrt and o p t k g e sqrt and evaluation periods p1 and p2 in the full split sample test to confirm the robustness of the rainfall runoff modeling a paired t test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the differences in the parameter values of the models prepared for individual study watersheds calibrated to p1 and p2 at the significance level of 0 05 the results showed that a 2 of 3 tank and s max of m1 are the only parameters whose values were significantly different from each other in the p1 and p2 calibration experiments fig 9 the values of the tphm and m2 parameters calibrated to p1 and p2 were statistically consistent in the full split sample test the two parameters s max and α of tphm and m2 vary greatly in their calibrated values depending on the characteristics of watersheds fig 10 and table 1 the parameter α was introduced to represent the promptness of the daily watershed response to rainfall in tphm and it was not included in the original monthly scale model proposed by xiong and guo 1999 the parameter determines the lag time which is not usually considered in a monthly rainfall runoff model but is an important characteristic of runoff hydrographs at daily or finer temporal scales the values of the parameter or the lag time are dependent on watershed characteristics such as soils land uses and topography as demonstrated in the parameter calibration the use of different objective functions optnse sqrt and o p t k g e sqrt provided significantly different parameter values as determined by the kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 for a 11 b 1 h 2 and b 2 of 3 tank b 1 and smax of m1 and b 2 of m2 figs 10 and s1 when the parameters were calibrated using o p t k g e sqrt rather than optnse sqrt as an objective function flow variability i e nse f d c 90 was more accurately reproduced by 3 tank and m2 but the accuracy of their high flow simulations was slightly degraded fig s1 a and b this trade off was expected since o p t k g e sqrt explicitly considers flow variability but optnse sqrt does not gupta et al 2009 santos et al 2018b the use of o p t k g e sqrt did not improve the accuracy of flow variability simulated by the tphm and m1 compared to the case of using optnse sqrt fig s1 c and d this implies that the performance of models that exhibit structural limitations in reproducing flow variability or low flow may not be enhanced without structural modifications 5 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the potential applications of the tphm and proposed alternative structures as a parsimonious daily rainfall runoff modeling tool for hydrological analyses and watershed management planning the four new and existing models tphm m1 m2 and 3 tank were applied to 41 watersheds covering a diverse range of hydrological characteristics in south korea the accuracy of the models was evaluated by comparing streamflow measured and simulated at the watershed outlets in terms of peak flow baseflow water balance and flow variability results showed that there was no significant difference between the performance of tphm and 3 tank when predicting high flow and water balance thus we confirm that the strategy and structure of the tphm model should be more efficient for direct runoff simulation than those of the 3 tank model when considering the numbers of parameters employed in the models two vs nine parameters however we also found that the tphm structure was not sophisticated enough to accurately reproduce low flow and fdc especially in watersheds where the temporal variability of the baseflow is relatively small we proposed two new model structures m1 and m2 based on tphm and 3 tank models which improved model applicability especially the four parameter hyperbolic model m2 in this study provided similar simulation accuracy to that of the three layer nine parameter tank model 3 tank in addition m2 was superior to the two parameter tphm and seven parameter m1 models when predicting low flow and baseflow in the study watersheds the incorporated hyperbolic tangent function and linear reservoir made m2 efficient in reproducing the characteristics of streamflow hydrographs such evaluation results suggest that m2 can be an effective parsimonious daily rainfall runoff simulation tool that contains the minimum parameters and model structure complexity required to predict streamflow at a commonly acceptable accuracy
