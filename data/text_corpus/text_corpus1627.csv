8135,study region southern judean desert israel study focus to extend the flood record in two basins in the judean desert for facilitating the quality and reliability of the flood frequency analysis ffa new hydrological insights for the region the hydrological data for the judean desert streams is partial to none this study applied palaeoflood hydrology method which analyzes sedimentological evidence of past large floods in two streams one basin n ze elim 250 km2 yield maximum palaeo discharge of 900 m3s 1 and the other n rahaf 55 km2 1250 m3s 1 1 3 and 2 3 times larger than the maximum measured floods respectively for records of 500 and 5000 years respectively combining these data with measured and historical data produced a palaeo hydrological data base of several hundred to thousands years long these data updated the regional envelope curves for the maximum peak discharges the improved ffa caused a decrease for the 100 year flood in the larger basin from 1750 m3s 1 for the systematic record only to 760 m3s 1 43 for the combined records and from 1260 m3s 1 to 980 m3s 1 in the other basin 77 the ffa for the systematic historic data only overestimated the frequency of the large floods due to their short and discontinuous records the extension of the record with the palaeoflood data reduced the peak discharge values for different return periods and significantly enhanced ffa reliability keywords palaeoflood hydrology judean desert israel steep ephemeral streams floods magnitude flood frequency analysis hazard assessment 1 introduction dryland environments occupy 40 of the land area supporting nearly 30 of the world s population mostly in developing countries unep 2011 one of the main characteristics of dryland rivers is their flashy ephemeral flow schick 1988 bull and kirkby 2002 unless they have a source outside the dryland area as these flows are scarce and rarely measured there are few data from which to assess the long term frequency of flood events that is crucial for flood hazard assessment a recent review by metzger et al 2020 describes the challenges in generating flood frequency analysis for sites in arid semiarid regions highlighting the large errors in conventional use of extreme value theory methods in watersheds with a limited number of floods per year and large variability of flood peak discharges regional flood frequency relations based on dimensionless frequency curves derived from all available annual peak discharge data within homogeneous regions also provide unsatisfactory results due to the weight of rare floods on the distribution tails and the spatially heterogeneous flood hydrology farquharson et al 1992 zaman et al 2012 the present study uses palaeoflood hydrology to reconstruct past undocumented floods along the judean desert streams the evidence of past floods has accumulated along the stream channels and in the tributaries for hundreds and thousands of years kochel and baker 1982 baker and kochel 1988 providing long term records for ungauged basins and or extending measured flood records the largest flood to have occurred within a basin can serve as a control on envelope curves and rainfall runoff models such as probable maximum precipitation probable maximum flood pmp pmf palaeoflood records enhance the frequency analyses of flood records by improving the fit of the probability functions and also serve as a control vis a vis other statistical estimates webb et al 1988 combining the palaeoflood information with measured and historical data provides a long hydrological database which can help to improve flood risk assessment for ungauged basins or with limited data typical of arid environments stedinger and cohn 1986 frances et al 1994 benito and thorndycraft 2005 palaeoflood studies aimed at extending flood records and improving flood frequency analyses began in the 1970s in the u s e g patton et al 1979 kochel et al 1982 ely and baker 1985 baker 1987 webb et al 1988 patton et al 1993 enzel et al 1993 o connor 1994 webb et al 2002 and were later conducted worldwide e g baker 1987 ely et al 1993 kale et al 2000 greenbaum et al 2001

are usually higher than gauged peak discharges greenbaum et al 2006 2014a and references therein in the colorado river tributaries when the historical and palaeoflood data were combined to the systematic data the peak discharge for the probability of predicted flood increased webb et al 1988 enzel et al 1993 1994 in the upper colorado river a palaeoflood record exceeding 2000 years greenbaum et al 2014a showed that 1 large floods were far more frequent than can be estimated by extrapolation from the gauged record alone and 2 the average occurrence of large rare floods is not adequately represented in the 100 year gauged record which is biased towards low flows similar results and trends were obtained for the green river the largest tributary of the colorado river liu et al 2020a 2020b in the negev desert in israel palaeoflood records were reconstructed for the larger ephemeral streams 1000 km2 greenbaum et al 2001 2006 table 1 systematic records for these streams exist since the 1950 s about 70 years the palaeoflood records include some 30 reconstructed palaeofloods which were 2 3 times greater than the measured peak discharges during the past thousands of years the combination of palaeoflood data and gauged records in the negev streams has significantly improved frequency analysis reliability greenbaum et al 2001 2006 the judean desert located along the eastern flanks of the judea mountains in israel is a distinctive hydrological region shentsis et al 1997 characterized by short steep ephemeral bedrock streams 250 km2 nir 1989 greenbaum et al 2006 these streams fig 1 are characterized by short partial or no hydrological data shentsis et al 1997 for which estimates of magnitude and frequency of floods are poor previous hydrological studies in the southern judean desert oriented to flood hazard assessment were initiated by the dead sea works dsw the potash producer for two streams n ashalim and n heimar fig 1 table 1 these streams drain directly into the southern basin of the dead sea and into the evaporation ponds and caused large damages in the past greenbaum et al 2001 greenbaum 2007 this paper presents recent advances in the use of palaeoflood data in desert environments in order to improve our understanding of flood hazards in regions with scarce hydrological monitoring the study focuses on two short steep bedrock streams in the southern judean desert for which short and partial hydrological data is available nahal ze elim n ze elim 250 km2 and nahal rahaf n rahaf 77 km2 fig 1 here we a extend the limited hydrological data for n ze elim and n rahaf by constructing palaeohydrological databases and b analyze their combined measured and palaeoflood records to reconstruct a reliable flood frequency for the low probability large and extreme floods 2 study area the judean desert the judean desert is located on the eastern flank of the judean anticline which is the north south mountainous backbone ridge of israel at the transition from the judean mountains 1000 m asl to the jordan valley and dead sea 430 m bsl a distance of 25 km fig 1 with an average slope of about 4 the exposed rocks are mainly carbonate rocks where the upper part consists of softer chalk and marls with some limestone and flint beds of the mt scopus group the lower part consists of hard upper cretaceous limestone and dolomite of the judean group incised by deep narrow bedrock canyons the infrastructure is concentrated along the elongated coastline of the dead sea fig 1 which is retreating due to the falling level of the lake at an average rate of 1 m yr 1 the retreating coast is actively cut by numerous steep west east ephemeral streams of the judean desert fig 1 2 1 climate the judean desert is an extension of the desert fringe of the sinai and negev which due to its low topography and the rain shadow effect extends northward into the dead sea valley the average annual rainfall in the judean desert declines from north to south and from west to east in the northern more humid part the mean annual rainfall decreases from 500 to 400 mm yr 1 at the top of the judean mountains to 50 mm yr 1 along the dead sea in the more arid southern judean desert the mean annual rainfall at the water divide ranges from 250 to 100 mm yr 1 fig 1 the rainfall along the dead sea decreases from 148 mm yr 1 in jericho north to 46 mm yr 1 in sedom south israel national atlas 2011 most of the annual precipitation in the judean desert and dead sea area 50 100 mm yr 1 falls in relatively short rainstorms in the autumn and spring months october november and march april the climate regime of the judean desert is affected by three distinct circulation patterns dayan and morin 2006 armon et al 2018 1 mediterranean cyclones mc the most active cold fronts of the mediterranean sea which are accompanied by heavy rainfall of hours to days in winter and may extend eastward over the northwestern judean desert dayan and morin 2006 2 active red sea trough arst the synoptic system responsible for most of the flash floods in the southern dead sea shentsis et al 2012 this trough which extends from eastern equatorial africa northward along the red sea into the southern and eastern regions of israel creates barometric conditions that encourage the development of strong but limited convective rainstorms marked by short duration but high rainfall intensity mainly during autumn and spring greenbaum et al 1998 2006 dayan and morin 2006 3 tropical plumes tp elongated bands of upper and mid level clouds stretching from the tropics pole wards and eastwards into the subtropics typically accompanied by a subtropical jet stj streak and a trough on their poleward side knippertz 2005 tp systems account for 8 of the large floods in the negev and usually produce relatively widespread and prolonged rainfall kahana et al 2002 armon et al 2018 the combination of these climatic systems in the streams of the judean desert results in rainstorms and flows that occur mainly in autumn and spring and to a lesser extent during winter but potentially the flood season can last for nine months september to may 2 2 streams of the southern judean desert 2 2 1 nahal ze elim n ze elim is an ephemeral stream 250 km2 and the second largest basin in the judean desert fig 1 the lower 8 km long reach of the stream until its outlet to the dead sea is entrenched into the resistant carbonate rocks to form a large bedrock canyon our study reach is located at the lower segment of this canyon where the stream crosses the n s escarpment of the western fault system of the dead sea rift downstream the channel opens to form a large alluvial fan amit and gerson 1986 levran 2018 mean annual rainfall decreases from 250 mm yr 1 at the headwaters to 50 mm yr 1 at the outlet hydrological data from the past 4 years only were collected from a new 2016 hydrometric station close to the outlet table 4 2 2 2 nahal rahaf n rahaf 77 km2 drains an arid region of the southern judean desert fig 1 most of the exposed bedrock within the basin composed of the resistant carbonate rocks and therefore most of the channel is in the form of a narrow bedrock canyon separated into two segments by a structural sourced short 1 km alluvial segment mean annual rainfall decreases from about 130 mm yr 1 at its headwater near the town of arad to about 50 mm yr 1 at the outlet to the dead sea at its outlet the basin drains into an artificial reservoir 3 106 m3 constructed by the dsw in order to prevent water and sediments cohen and laronne 2005 from entering the evaporation ponds hydrological data has been collected since 1991 from a hydrometric station close to the outlet operated by the israel hydrological service ihs the study site is located at the outlet of the upper canyon fig 1 where the drainage area is 50 km2 3 methods 3 1 palaeoflood hydrology palaeoflood hydrology is optimally applied in narrow bedrock canyons in which the water stage is high during large floods peak palaeo stage indicators psis are preserved for a long time baker 1987 webb et al 2002 greenbaum et al 2006 and also scour or sedimentation along the channel is limited the common psis in the negev and judean desert streams include a slack water deposits swd fine grained sediments transported as suspended sediments during floods and rapidly deposited during the high stage of the flood in sheltered sites where the flow energy is dramatically reduced b organic layers baker and kochel 1988 webb et al 2002 located at the same sites as the swds or in the form of driftwood lines along the canyon walls in this study the stratigraphic sequences of the swd s were separated into individual flood events using the well established sedimentological criteria baker 1987 benito et al 2003b 3 2 dating methods to ascertain the age of the floods and thence clarify the field relations dating was performed after determining the stratigraphy of the site and the field relations between the various swd sequences 3 2 1 radiocarbon radiocarbon dating is the standard dating method for studies of palaeofloods benito and thorndycraft 2005 dating material included fine woody debris and charcoal found within the sedimentary units or as driftwood all radiocarbon samples were analyzed at the ams laboratory of the university of arizona table 2 the radiocarbon ages were calibrated using oxcal v 4 3 2 ramsey 2017 based on intcal 20 reimer 2020 calibration dataset table 2 3 2 2 optically stimulated luminescence osl optically stimulated luminescence osl dates the last exposure of quartz grains transported by the flood to sunlight and provides an age estimate for the flood the osl samples were analyzed at the luminescence dating laboratory of the israel geological survey in jerusalem samples for osl dating were collected from swd sedimentary units 10 cm thick in order to prevent the mixing of sediments from more than one unit quartz grains in the size range of 90 125 μm were extracted using routine laboratory methods faershtein et al 2016 the detailed laboratory procedure is provided by porat et al 2015 and faershtein et al 2016 the purified quartz was mounted on a risø tl osl reader and the equivalent dose de values were measured using the osl signal and the single aliquot regenerative dose sar protocol murray and wintle 2000 preliminary measurements showed a large scatter of de values indicating partial bleaching of the quartz grains due to insufficient exposure to daylight to reset the luminescence signal during transport medialdea et al 2014 we therefore measured 1 mm aliquots with about 50 grains each to accentuate the scatter and allow the selection of the youngest component which might be more representative of the best bleached grains dose rates were calculated from the concentration of the radioactive elements measured by icp ms for u and th or icp oes for k cosmic dose rates were evaluated from current burial depths and the moisture content was estimated at 2 1 as appropriate for this hyper arid region table 3 3 3 hydraulic methods hecras palaeoflood discharge estimates follow the assumption that the height of the palaeostage evidence high water marks indicates at a close range the maximum stage reached by an identified flood o connor and webb 1988 the discharge estimate associated with the elevation of the slackwater flood deposits was calculated using the computer program hec ras hydrologic engineering center 2010 this one dimensional hydraulic model software is commonly used for reconstructing water surface profiles of floods in narrow bedrock canyons with almost no floodplain and high stages the program uses the step backwater method to generate water surface profiles for various discharges iterated along the channel profile comparison of the elevation of the documented psis to the elevation of the hec ras water surface profiles gives a good estimate of the minimum discharge value o connor and webb 1988 for sites that are located at curvatures where water surfaces are super elevated we corrected the elevations using two formulas a chow 1973 z v 2 b g r where z the difference in elevation between the low side and the super elevated side v velocity b flow width g gravity r radius of curvature b federal highway administration federal highway administration fhwa 2012 h b k b v 2 2 g where hb head losses kb loss coefficients for bends v velocity g gravity cross sections along our study reaches were surveyed at relatively short distances of between 20 and 100 m according to changes in channel geometry 3 4 flood frequency analysis ffa palaeohydrological studies provide information regarding the occurrence and magnitude of real large floods new developments in frequency analysis allow combining non standard data e g palaeoflood or isolated historical observations together with gauged flood data stedinger and baker 1987 an increase in palaeoflood studies worldwide has caused a significant improvement in the statistical models that can effectively analyze these data harden et al 2011 various ffa statistical methods are discussed by frances 2004 in the present study the palaeoflood data was combined with the limited measured data in this statistical approach palaeoflood data is included into the analysis on perception thresholds that efficiently account for censored geologic or historical information perception thresholds are stages that reflect the range of flows that would have been recorded for a given year during a specific time period england et al 2019 a perception threshold is defined by the elevation of the slackwater deposit site and the time span that each site is expected to record all floods exceeding the site s elevation the analysis therefore relies on the assumption that each flood exceeding the palaeoflood site is recorded in the stratigraphy the flood frequency analysis was carried out with the peakfq 7 2 software flynn et al 2006 veilleux et al 2014 where gauged peak flows historic floods recorded prior to establishment of the gauging station and palaeoflood data are fit to a log pearson type iii distribution the program applies a generalized method of moments estimator denoted the expected moments algorithm ema cohn et al 1997 and a generalized version of the grubbs beck test for identifying multiple potential influential low flows pilfs cohn et al 2013 these zero or very low values are common in ephemeral streams and they may have excessive influence on the estimated frequency of large floods veilleux et al 2014 identification of pilfs can greatly improve estimated frequency of large floods 4 results the slackwater flood deposits were identified in several sites along the valley margins as overbank deposits and in rock alcoves each of these sites preserves evidence of 2 6 palaeoflood units our concept was to document as many sites as possible along a defined uniform segment of the channel in order to maximize the palaeohydrological data and to compensate for the small number of palaeoflood data at each site although some of the sites are located at channel curvatures where water surfaces are super elevated these sites were also analyzed and corrected conservatively the sedimentary units are usually horizontally bedded fining upward from coarse sand to silt and occasionally coarsening upward some sedimentary units are massive sedimentary structures such as ripples and cross bedding were found in sites that are close to the channel and not fully sheltered driftwood lines composed of datable organic matter charcoal and wood were used as psis and for radiocarbon dating osl dating was applied for significant sedimentary units such as the lowest units in each section 4 1 palaeoflood chronology the flood timing of the main stratigraphic sites was obtained from a combination of radiocarbon and osl ages regarding the osl dating the scatter in the distribution of the equivalent dose de values for some samples is very high with over dispersion od in table 3 80 much higher than the 20 over dispersion observed on well bleached samples e g raf 1 table 3 this over dispersion indicates insufficient bleaching of the osl signal for the quartz grains at the time of deposition for other samples the od values are more acceptable particularly when considering that 1 mm aliquots were measured in stratigraphic sets with radiocarbon and osl dating the radiocarbon ages table 2 were consistently younger than the osl ages supporting the interpretation of partial osl bleaching to obtain a better estimate of the time of deposition of the swd for the highly scattered samples osl ages were also calculated from the youngest aliquots which would represent the best bleached grains youngest age in table 3 this provided over estimated ages but they are more consistent with the radiocarbon ages the dating results indicate relatively young palaeoflood ages in n ze elim three out of four radiocarbon ages were modern table 2 and the osl ages calculated either from the entire data or the youngest aliquots range between 400 500 years before 2018 table 3 the ages of the palaeofloods at n rahaf appear to be older their radiocarbon ages range between 2910 bc to 1949 cal ce table 2 and the osl ages range between 7 3 1 3 and 0 7 ky table 3 for example unit 1 at site raf u in n rahaf was dated by both radiocarbon and osl to 1448 1630 cal ce table 5 and 7 3 1 3ky bp respectively showing a considerable difference between the two dating methods in contrast the two methods were used to date the underlying archaeological site at the raf g see section 4 3 1 and the results provided a radiocarbon age of 30 274 to 29 135 cal bce table 2 and an osl age of 22 6 ky which was obtained for the uppermost part of the archaeological unit table 3 4 2 palaeoflood hydrology nahal ze elim the

station 246 km2 which operates since 2016 is located at cross section no 1 figs 2 4 five swd sites were documented along the reach all of which are overbank deposits each sequence consisted of 2 6 well bedded sandy silty depositional units related to flood events and driftwood lines table 4 these sites were used for further stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses fig 3 4 2 1 palaeoflood

streams preserve evidence of large palaeofloods our study sites were selected according to the preservation of swd sequences with respect to the geometry of the channel reaches figs 2 5 trying to avoid irregularities such as waterfalls and abrupt changes in channel width expansions and constrictions in order to enable best hydraulic modelling 5 1 1 nahal ze elim eighteen flood depositional units were documented along the entire study reach and additional four large observed floods since 1997 with peak discharges ranging between 100 and 680 m3s 1 table 4 four floods were found to overlap

palaeoflood record therefore comprises about 68 of the large floods 100 m3 s 1 in the combined records the systematic record includes another twenty three floods with peak discharge 100 m3 s 1 in the large ephemeral streams of the negev the preservation of palaeoflood deposits usually in tributary mouths was relatively good with an average of 10 15 flood deposits at each site greenbaum et al 2006 table 1 in contrast at the smaller and steeper southern judean desert streams such as in the present study flood deposition usually occurs on discontinuous overbank pockets and in small rock shelters preserving a limited flood sedimentary record with only 2 6 floods in each site this makes it more complicated to construct a long term and significant palaeoflood record in comparison to the palaeoflood sites in the negev therefore the data were collected from maximum potential sites along the study reach previous studies in two other streams in the southern judean desert nahal heimar 450 km2 and nahal ashalim 75 km2 fig 1 reconstructed maximum palaeo peak discharges were 1100 and 760 m3s 1 respectively greenbaum et al 2006 table 1 the extremely long palaeoflood record of nahal ashalim 7600 years was preserved in a cave a comparison of the magnitudes of the largest palaeofloods and measured floods in the negev and southern judean deserts and the fitted envelope curves is presented in fig 10 the paleohydrological data from these streams shows that our results maximum peak discharges of 900 and 1250 m3s 1 are within the same range nevertheless the maximum peak discharge in n rahaf 1250 m3s 1 is outstanding for its relatively small basin size which exceeds the regional envelope curve 5 2 flood frequency analysis ffa palaeoflood information relevant for flood frequency analysis comprises peak discharges their ages absolute or relative and perception thresholds for individual palaeoflood magnitudes england et al 2019 regarding flood timing the dated palaeoflood units provide the temporal framework of the palaeoflood record whereas for the undated units a relative flood age was assigned based on their stratigraphic position the basic assumption in the statistical models using palaeohydrological information is that all floods above a certain perception threshold are documented in the stratigraphic record over a period of known duration the perception thresholds are stages related to the palaeoflood sites assuming that each flood with magnitude exceeding the base of the site alcove or overbank surface results in an individual flood bed the flood age of the lowest flood bed within the palaeoflood stratigraphy of the site marks the temporal onset of the perception threshold as a result every year there is information about a flood discharge exceeding or not exceeding that perception threshold benito et al 2020 in this way palaeoflood data can be processed as censored data that can be efficiently analyzed by statistical methods stedinger and cohn 1986 cloete et al 2018 5 2 1 nahal ze elim fig 11 a shows the flood data organization used in the flood frequency analysis comprising thirteen floods over the period 1770 2015 and four gauged floods 2016 2019 the palaeoflood data were arranged according to four perception thresholds pts two gradually increased from 430 to 480 m3s 1 over the time interval of 1770 1959 cal years ce and two from 220 to 350 m3s 1 over the period 1960 2015 cal years ce it was assumed that unit 1 at ze 9 osl age 0 4 ky fig 3 is equivalent to the unit 3 at ze 13 1734 1807 cal ce which is reasonable based on the similarity in discharge between both palaeoflood sites and on the wide range of over dispersion of the osl age of unit 1 palaeoflood data from sites ze 9 ze 11 and ze 12 fig 3 constrained the lower bound discharge value assigned to the perception thresholds and the individual floods discharge and age used for ffa the non systematic flood record was completed with the historic floods recorded in 1981 900 m3s 1 1997 680 m3s 1 and 2004 100 m3s 1 the log pearson 3 distribution provided a good fit of the systematic palaeoflood record analysis fig 11b with the palaeoflood and historical discharges plotted near the fitted distribution where all data located within the confidence limits indicating a good fit the upper tail includes the historic floods with discharges of 900 and 680 m3s 1 followed by the largest palaeofloods of 620 m3s 1 an additional frequency analysis was completed using the gauged four years and historical floods three floods showing a lack of definition of the distribution upper tail that result in very high discharges for the higher quantiles for instance the calculated 1 annual exceedance probability flood for the palaeoflood gauged dataset is 760 m3s 1 whereas using the gauged historic record it is 1750 m3s 1 table 6 the largest peak discharge of 900 m3s 1 in n ze elim attributed a recurrence interval of 50 years based on the limited gauge record including historic floods and 150 200 years based on the combined gauge historic and palaeoflood records fig 11b table 6 the largest measured discharge 680 m3s 1 assigned annual exceedance probabilities of 3 4 and 1 2 respectively these results can be explained by the long palaeoflood record of 500 years that includes 19 relatively small and medium floods and only 3 large floods 600 m3s 1 the effect of the latter on the ffa results is therefore minor the short and discontinuous measured record 1997 2018 includes three small medium floods and one large flood that increases the effect of low probability floods nevertheless the results of 5800 and 9340 m3s 1 for the 0 2 and 0 1 annual exceedance probabilities table 6 are much too high and out of hydrological context for the region even for catchments that are 4 14 times larger in area table 1 therefore the ffa produces a more balanced result when the palaeoflood record combined to the gauged and historical floods even when the gauged record is short 5 2 2 nahal rahaf two palaeoflood sites namely raf b and raf g provided discharge thresholds incrementally increasing between 400 and 1250 m3s 1 over a time interval of the last 700 years osl age raf g section unit 2 fig 8 contains a reliable radiocarbon age dated to 1667 1835 cal ce that together with their relative high associated perception threshold 1170 m3s 1 provide robust arguments to assume that all flood exceeding such discharge were recorded in the stratigraphy the frequency analysis comprises two perception thresholds fig 12 a the first of 1170 m3s 1 associated with raf g upper set over the period 1755 1986 ce and the second of 775 m3s 1 associated with the observed october 1987 flood predating the onset of the gauge record over the period 1991 2018 the log pearson 3 distribution was found very effective to adjust to the combined palaeoflood historic and gauged datasets with their plotting positions at the upper tail next to the fitted distribution solid red line in fig 12b an additional frequency analyses was carried out using the gauged historical flood data the gauged historical flood distribution dashed red line in fig 12b resulted in higher peak flows than those of the palaeoflood gauged floods distribution particularly for high flood quantiles i e annual exceedance probabilities lower than 1 for instance peak discharges obtained for the low annual exceedance probabilities of 0 2 and 0 1 of the systematic record historical 1987 flood were extremely large 3460 and 5120 m3s 1 respectively even if we use the largest specific peak discharge on record anywhere in the negev and judean deserts for smaller basins of 10 50 km2 about 25 m3s 1 km 1 and apply it to our 55 km2 basin we obtain a peak discharge of 1400 m3s 1 we therefore believe that the ffa results for the gauged historic flood records are out of the regional hydrological context and should be regarded as unrealistic the integration of long term palaeoflood records dramatically reduced all the magnitudes for all recurrence intervals above 25 years 4 the peak discharges for the low annual exceedance probabilities 2 1 0 2 and 0 1 are 650 980 2130 and 2840 m3s 1 respectively table 6 a more reasonable range the systematic record alone dashed gray line in fig 12b provided the smallest values for all return periods table 6 in the current study in both n ze elim and n rahaf the difference between the analyses illustrates the effect of the long duration of the palaeoflood record over the short systematic historic record table 6 which is biased towards the large floods the incorporation of the palaeoflood data into the ffa provided significantly lower discharge estimates for the flood quantiles compared to the short systematic historical records this emphasizes the effect of the much longer duration of the palaeoflood records on the ffa although the maximum peak discharges in the palaeoflood records are much larger in contrast in n rahaf the systematic record includes mainly small and medium size floods whereas the palaeoflood record includes 3 large floods 1000 m3s 1 during the last 500 years which increases the effect of the low probability floods in nahal ashalim only a short part 1673 1996 ce 323 years of the extremely long palaeoflood record 7600 years was considered relevant to the present day flood hazard assessment this is because the entire record was assumed to include hydro climatological changes with different flow regimes and was therefore not included in the ffa in nahal heimar the periods 1670 1996 ce 326 years and 1810 1996 ce 186 years provided somewhat larger peak discharge values for the shorter period by about 27 8 for annual exceedance probabilities of 2 0 1 respectively greenbaum et al 2001 the results of the present study are in line with these results one of the most significant contributions of palaeoflood studies to risk assessments is the significant improvement in the reliability of the ffa when comparing the results of systematic data only to the systematic palaeoflood data for example in nahal paran 3600 km2 in the negev desert table 1 combining the 470 year palaeoflood record with the 50 year systematic record significantly reduced the discharges for the selected probabilities and increased the reliability dramatically especially for low probability floods greenbaum et al 2001 in contrast in nahal zin 1400 km2 in the negev desert combining the 2000 year palaeoflood record with the 65 year systematic and historical records almost did not affect the peak discharge estimates but the reliability of the results was dramatically improved as represented by the decrease of about 50 in the standard errors greenbaum et al 2000 similar to our results in the fish river in south africa 86 600 km2 for example the recurrence intervals showed that the systematic data alone and the systematic palaeoflood data yielded 5200 and 4415 m3s 1 respectively a decrease of 18 cloete et al 2018 5 3 comparison with conventional frequency analysis methods our frequency analyses results using palaeoflood and systematic data were compared with the results of conventional frequency analyses provided by various public agencies based on systematic records only fig 13 these models include greenbaum 2007 1 the ministry of agriculture soil erosion research station sers 2 model garti et al 1995 a local detailed version of the rational formula 2 the ihs israel hydrological service model meirovich et al 1998 a statistical regional model based on measured regional hydrological data 3 lavee natif 2004 fitting analyses of measured data from analogous basins in other parts of the judean desert onto ungauged dead sea basins for n ze elim our results were compared to all the above methods showing that the sers 2 and the lavee natif 2004 models provide higher estimates of peak discharge relative to the present study whereas the ihs model provides extremely low estimates fig 13a these differences are caused by the duration of the records the effect of large floods in short records is high and provides biased high values for the return periods in comparison to the long palaeoflood record which may include a number of such large floods in n rahaf we compared our results with the sers 2 and lavee natif 2004 models similar to our ffa for the systematic record only table 6 other ffas of the systematic record using different models provide lower values for different return periods in comparison to the paleoflood systematic records fig 13b the much higher estimates of the combined records are related to the paleoflood population which is composed of large floods including three floods 1000 m3s 1 the different results of the various models demonstrate the significant impact of using different models for the frequency estimates especially when the hydrological records are short and incomplete longer records may reduce this effect the extended palaeoflood records fill this gap which improves the results and enhances the reliability of the frequency analysis greenbaum 2007 lavee natif 2004 estimated the maximum peak discharges for the judean desert streams at 1000 m3s 1 for n ze elim which is similar to our results 900 m3s 1 and 700 m3s 1 for n rahaf compared to 1250 m3s 1 in the present study 6 conclusions the palaeohydrological approach in which a large number of sites are studied was applied in this study and enabled the reconstruction of significant flood records for two steep mountainous bedrock canyons in the southern judean desert the palaeoflood record for the n ze elim stream provided evidence of 18 floods with peak discharges of 220 900 m3s 1 for a period of about 500 years the largest flood of 900 m3s 1 radiocarbon dated to 1980 1982 ce and using log pearson 3 distribution attributed a recurrence interval of 50 years based on the systematic record only and 150 200 years based on the combined systematic and palaeoflood records for n rahaf the palaeoflood record includes 13 floods with peak discharges of 170 1250 m3s 1 and three very large floods exceeding 1100 m3s 1 the radiocarbon ages of these floods are around 1667 1941 ce these floods sediments were deposited in a rock shelter raf g 7 3 m above the channel bed which was found to overlie an upper palaeolithic archaeological site dated by radiocarbon to 30 000 years bp for the ffa only the data of the last 700 years was analyzed due to the large time gap between the older and the younger populations and in order to make it more relevant to present hazard assessment using log pearson 3 distribution the largest flood 1250 m3s 1 attributed a recurrence interval of 500 years for the combined systematic and palaeoflood records in both streams the ffa for the systematic historic data only overestimated the frequencies of the large floods most probably due to their short and discontinuous records this was also true for other conventional frequency analyses applied by other agencies based on the available systematic record alone the population of the palaeofloods in n rahaf with the three extreme floods 1000 m3s 1 finally provides higher discharges for the various low probabilities the palaeoflood data extends the record to several hundred years reducing the peak discharge values for different return periods and significantly enhancing ffa reliability author

8135,study region southern judean desert israel study focus to extend the flood record in two basins in the judean desert for facilitating the quality and reliability of the flood frequency analysis ffa new hydrological insights for the region the hydrological data for the judean desert streams is partial to none this study applied palaeoflood hydrology method which analyzes sedimentological evidence of past large floods in two streams one basin n ze elim 250 km2 yield maximum palaeo discharge of 900 m3s 1 and the other n rahaf 55 km2 1250 m3s 1 1 3 and 2 3 times larger than the maximum measured floods respectively for records of 500 and 5000 years respectively combining these data with measured and historical data produced a palaeo hydrological data base of several hundred to thousands years long these data updated the regional envelope curves for the maximum peak discharges the improved ffa caused a decrease for the 100 year flood in the larger basin from 1750 m3s 1 for the systematic record only to 760 m3s 1 43 for the combined records and from 1260 m3s 1 to 980 m3s 1 in the other basin 77 the ffa for the systematic historic data only overestimated the frequency of the large floods due to their short and discontinuous records the extension of the record with the palaeoflood data reduced the peak discharge values for different return periods and significantly

occupy 40 of the land area supporting nearly 30 of the world s population mostly in developing countries unep 2011 one of the main characteristics of dryland rivers is their flashy ephemeral flow schick 1988 bull and kirkby 2002 unless they have a source outside the dryland area as these flows are scarce and rarely measured there are few data from which to assess the long term frequency of flood events that is crucial for flood hazard assessment a recent review by metzger et al 2020 describes the challenges in generating flood frequency analysis for sites in arid semiarid regions highlighting the large errors in conventional use of extreme value theory methods in watersheds with a limited number of floods per year and large variability of flood peak discharges regional flood frequency relations based on dimensionless frequency curves derived from all available annual peak discharge data within homogeneous regions also provide unsatisfactory results due to the weight of rare floods on the distribution tails and the spatially heterogeneous flood hydrology farquharson et al 1992 zaman et al 2012 the present study uses palaeoflood hydrology to reconstruct past

are usually higher than gauged peak discharges greenbaum et al 2006 2014a and references therein in the colorado river tributaries when the historical and palaeoflood data were combined to the systematic data the peak discharge for the probability of predicted flood increased webb et al 1988 enzel et al 1993 1994 in the upper colorado river a palaeoflood record exceeding 2000 years greenbaum et al 2014a showed that 1 large floods were far more frequent than can be estimated by extrapolation from the gauged record alone and 2 the average occurrence of large rare floods is not adequately represented in the 100 year gauged record which is biased towards low flows similar results and trends were obtained for the green river the largest tributary of the colorado river liu et

in the southern judean desert oriented to flood hazard assessment were initiated by the dead sea works dsw the potash producer for two streams n ashalim and n heimar fig 1 table 1 these streams drain directly into the southern basin of the dead sea and into the evaporation ponds and caused large damages in the past greenbaum et al 2001 greenbaum 2007 this paper presents recent advances in the use of palaeoflood data in desert environments in order to improve our understanding of flood hazards in regions with scarce hydrological monitoring the study focuses on two short steep bedrock streams in

data for n ze elim and n rahaf by constructing palaeohydrological databases and b analyze their combined measured and palaeoflood records to reconstruct a reliable flood frequency for the low probability large and extreme floods 2 study area the judean desert the judean desert is located on the eastern flank of the judean anticline which is the north south mountainous backbone ridge of israel at the transition from the judean mountains 1000 m asl to the jordan valley and dead sea 430 m bsl a distance of 25 km fig 1 with an average slope of about 4 the exposed rocks are mainly carbonate rocks where the upper part consists of softer chalk and marls with some limestone and flint beds of the mt scopus group the lower part consists of hard upper cretaceous limestone and dolomite of the judean group incised by deep narrow bedrock canyons the infrastructure is concentrated along the elongated coastline of the dead sea fig 1 which is retreating due to the falling level of the lake at an average rate of 1 m yr 1 the retreating coast is actively cut by numerous steep west east ephemeral streams of the judean desert fig 1 2 1 climate the judean desert is an extension of the desert fringe of the sinai and negev which due to its low topography and the rain shadow effect extends northward into the dead sea valley the average annual rainfall in the judean desert declines from north to south and from west to east in the northern more humid part the mean annual rainfall decreases from 500 to 400 mm yr 1 at the top of the judean mountains to 50 mm yr 1 along the dead sea in the more arid southern judean desert the mean annual rainfall at the water divide ranges from 250 to 100 mm yr 1 fig 1 the rainfall along the dead sea decreases from 148 mm yr 1 in jericho north to 46 mm yr 1 in sedom south israel national atlas 2011 most of the annual precipitation in the judean desert and dead sea area 50 100 mm yr 1 falls in relatively short rainstorms in the autumn and spring months october november and march april the climate regime of the judean desert is affected by three distinct circulation patterns dayan and morin 2006 armon et al 2018 1 mediterranean cyclones mc the most active cold fronts of the mediterranean sea which are accompanied by heavy rainfall of hours to days in winter and may extend eastward over the northwestern judean desert dayan and morin 2006 2 active red sea trough arst the synoptic system responsible for most of the flash floods in the southern dead sea shentsis et al 2012 this trough which extends from eastern equatorial africa northward along the red sea into the southern and eastern regions of israel creates barometric conditions that encourage the development of strong but limited convective rainstorms marked by short duration but high rainfall intensity mainly during autumn and spring greenbaum et al 1998 2006 dayan and morin 2006 3 tropical plumes tp elongated bands of upper and mid level clouds stretching from the tropics pole wards and eastwards into the subtropics typically accompanied by a subtropical jet stj streak and a trough on their poleward side knippertz 2005 tp systems account for 8 of the large floods in the negev and usually produce relatively widespread and prolonged rainfall kahana et al 2002 armon et al 2018 the combination of these climatic systems in the streams of the judean desert results in rainstorms and flows that occur mainly in autumn and spring and to a lesser extent during winter but potentially the flood season can last for nine months september to may 2 2 streams of the southern judean desert 2 2 1 nahal ze elim n ze elim is an ephemeral stream 250 km2 and the second largest basin in the judean desert fig 1 the lower 8 km long reach of the stream until its outlet to the dead sea is entrenched into the resistant carbonate rocks to form a large bedrock canyon our study reach is located at the lower segment of this canyon where the stream crosses the n s escarpment of the western fault system of the dead sea rift downstream the channel opens to form a large alluvial fan amit and gerson 1986 levran 2018 mean annual rainfall decreases from 250 mm yr 1 at the headwaters to 50 mm yr 1 at the outlet hydrological data from the past 4 years only were collected from a new 2016 hydrometric station close to the outlet table 4 2 2 2 nahal rahaf n rahaf 77 km2 drains an arid region of the southern judean desert fig 1 most of the exposed bedrock within the basin composed of the resistant carbonate rocks and therefore most of the channel is in the form of a narrow bedrock canyon separated into two segments by a structural sourced short 1 km alluvial segment mean annual rainfall decreases from about 130 mm yr 1 at its headwater near the town of arad to about 50 mm yr 1 at the outlet to the dead sea at its outlet the basin drains into an artificial reservoir 3 106 m3 constructed by the dsw in order to prevent water and sediments cohen and laronne 2005 from entering the evaporation ponds hydrological data has been collected since 1991 from a hydrometric station close to the outlet operated by the israel hydrological service ihs the study site is located at the outlet of the upper canyon fig 1 where the drainage area is 50 km2 3 methods 3 1 palaeoflood hydrology palaeoflood hydrology is optimally applied in narrow bedrock canyons in which the water stage is high during large floods peak palaeo stage indicators psis are preserved for a long time baker 1987 webb et al 2002 greenbaum et al 2006 and also scour or sedimentation along the channel is limited the common psis in the negev and judean desert streams include a slack water deposits swd fine grained sediments transported as suspended sediments during floods and rapidly deposited during the high stage of the flood in sheltered sites where the flow energy is dramatically reduced b organic layers baker and kochel 1988 webb et al 2002 located at the same sites as the swds or in the form of driftwood lines along the canyon walls in this study the stratigraphic sequences of the swd s were separated into individual flood events using the well established sedimentological criteria baker 1987 benito et al 2003b 3 2 dating methods to ascertain the age of the floods and thence clarify the field relations dating was performed after determining the stratigraphy of the site and the field relations between the various swd sequences 3 2 1 radiocarbon radiocarbon dating is the standard dating method for studies of palaeofloods benito and thorndycraft 2005 dating material included fine woody debris and charcoal found within the sedimentary units or as driftwood all radiocarbon samples were analyzed at the ams laboratory of the university of arizona table 2 the radiocarbon ages were calibrated using oxcal v 4 3 2 ramsey 2017 based on intcal 20 reimer 2020 calibration dataset table 2 3 2 2 optically stimulated luminescence osl optically stimulated luminescence osl dates the last exposure of quartz grains transported by the flood to sunlight and provides an age estimate for the flood the osl samples were analyzed at the luminescence dating laboratory of the israel geological survey in jerusalem samples for osl dating were collected from swd sedimentary units 10 cm thick in order to prevent the mixing of sediments from more than one unit quartz grains in the size range of 90 125 μm were extracted using routine laboratory methods faershtein et al 2016 the detailed laboratory procedure is provided by porat et al 2015 and faershtein et al 2016 the purified quartz was mounted on a risø tl osl reader and the equivalent dose de values were measured using the osl signal and the single aliquot regenerative dose sar protocol murray and wintle 2000 preliminary measurements showed a large scatter of de values indicating partial bleaching of the quartz grains due to insufficient exposure to daylight to reset the luminescence signal during transport medialdea et al 2014 we therefore measured 1 mm aliquots with about 50 grains each to accentuate the scatter and allow the selection of the youngest component which might be more representative of the best bleached grains dose rates were calculated from the concentration of the radioactive elements measured by icp ms for u and th or icp oes for k cosmic dose rates were evaluated from current burial depths and the moisture content was estimated at 2 1 as appropriate for this hyper arid region table 3 3 3 hydraulic methods hecras palaeoflood discharge estimates follow the assumption that the height of the palaeostage evidence high water marks indicates at a close range the maximum stage reached by an identified flood o connor and webb 1988 the discharge estimate associated with the elevation of the slackwater flood deposits was calculated using the computer program hec ras hydrologic engineering center 2010 this one dimensional hydraulic model software is commonly used for reconstructing water surface profiles of floods in narrow bedrock canyons with almost no floodplain and high stages the program uses the step backwater method to generate water surface profiles for various discharges iterated along the channel profile comparison of the elevation of the documented psis to the elevation of the hec ras water surface profiles gives a good estimate of the minimum discharge value o connor and webb 1988 for sites that are located at curvatures where water surfaces are super elevated we corrected the elevations using two formulas a chow 1973 z v 2 b g r where z the difference in elevation between the low side and the super elevated side v velocity b flow width g gravity r radius of curvature b federal highway administration federal highway administration fhwa 2012 h b k b v 2 2 g where hb head losses kb loss coefficients for bends v velocity g gravity cross sections along our study reaches were surveyed at relatively short distances of between 20 and 100 m according to changes in channel geometry 3 4 flood frequency analysis ffa palaeohydrological studies provide information regarding the occurrence and magnitude of real large floods new developments in frequency analysis allow combining non standard data e g palaeoflood or isolated historical observations together with gauged flood data stedinger and baker 1987 an increase in palaeoflood studies worldwide has caused a significant improvement in the statistical models that can effectively analyze these data harden et al 2011 various ffa statistical methods are discussed by frances 2004 in the present study the palaeoflood data was combined with the limited measured data in this statistical approach palaeoflood data is included into the analysis on perception thresholds that efficiently account for censored geologic or historical information perception thresholds are stages that reflect the range of flows that would have been recorded for a given year during a specific time period england et al 2019 a perception threshold is defined by the elevation of the slackwater deposit site and the time span that each site is expected to record all floods exceeding the site s elevation the analysis therefore relies on the assumption that each flood exceeding the palaeoflood site is recorded in the stratigraphy the flood frequency analysis was carried out with the peakfq 7 2 software flynn et al 2006 veilleux et al 2014 where gauged peak flows historic floods recorded prior to establishment of the gauging station and palaeoflood data are fit to a log pearson type iii distribution the program applies a generalized method of moments estimator denoted the expected moments algorithm ema cohn et al 1997 and a generalized version of the grubbs beck test for identifying multiple potential influential low flows pilfs cohn et al 2013 these zero or very low values are common in ephemeral streams and they may have excessive influence on the estimated frequency of large floods veilleux et al 2014 identification of pilfs can greatly improve estimated frequency of large floods 4 results the slackwater flood deposits were identified in several sites along the valley margins as overbank deposits and in rock alcoves each of these sites preserves evidence of 2 6 palaeoflood units our concept was to document as many sites as possible along a defined uniform segment of the channel in order to maximize the palaeohydrological data and to compensate for the small number of palaeoflood data at each site although some of the sites are located at channel curvatures where water surfaces are super elevated these sites were also analyzed and corrected conservatively the sedimentary units are usually horizontally bedded fining upward from coarse sand to silt and occasionally coarsening upward some sedimentary units are massive sedimentary structures such as ripples and cross bedding were found in sites that are close to the channel and not fully sheltered driftwood lines composed of datable organic matter charcoal and wood were used as psis and for radiocarbon dating osl dating was applied for significant sedimentary units such as the lowest units in each section 4 1 palaeoflood chronology the flood timing of the main stratigraphic sites was obtained from a combination of radiocarbon and osl ages regarding the osl dating the scatter in the distribution of the equivalent dose de values for some samples is very high with over dispersion od in table 3 80 much higher than the 20 over dispersion observed on well bleached samples e g raf 1 table 3 this over dispersion indicates insufficient bleaching of the osl signal for the quartz grains at the time of deposition for other samples the od values are more acceptable particularly when considering that 1 mm aliquots were measured in stratigraphic sets with radiocarbon and osl dating the radiocarbon ages table 2 were consistently younger than the osl ages supporting the interpretation of partial osl bleaching to obtain a better estimate of the time of deposition of the swd for the highly scattered samples osl ages were also calculated from the youngest aliquots which would represent the best bleached grains youngest age in table 3 this provided over estimated ages but they are more consistent with the radiocarbon ages the dating results indicate relatively young palaeoflood ages in n ze elim three out of four radiocarbon ages were modern table 2 and the osl ages calculated either from the entire data or the youngest aliquots range between 400 500 years before 2018 table 3 the ages of the palaeofloods at n rahaf appear to be older their radiocarbon ages range between 2910 bc to 1949 cal ce table 2 and the osl ages range between 7 3 1 3 and 0 7 ky table 3 for example unit 1 at site raf u in n rahaf was dated by both radiocarbon and osl to 1448 1630 cal ce table 5 and 7 3 1 3ky bp respectively showing a considerable difference between the two dating methods in contrast the two methods were used to date the underlying archaeological site at the raf g see section 4 3 1 and the results provided a radiocarbon age of 30 274 to 29 135 cal bce table 2 and an osl age of 22 6 ky which was obtained for the uppermost part of the archaeological unit table 3 4 2 palaeoflood hydrology nahal ze elim the

water surface profiles were iterated for discharges of 200 1400 m3s 1 the elevations and peak discharges for sites raf g and raf u were corrected due to their super elevated location the range of corrections is 62 75 cm for site raf g and 20 35 cm for site raf u these differences cause a change of about 12 in peak discharges the maximum peak discharge of about 1250 m3s 1 reconstructed for the raf g rock shelter site is 2 times larger than the maximum historical flood of october 1987 525 m3s 1 polak 1988 5 discussion 5 1 palaeoflood records and magnitudes the steep mountainous judean desert streams preserve evidence of large palaeofloods our study sites were selected according to the preservation of swd sequences with respect to the geometry of the channel reaches figs 2 5 trying to avoid irregularities such as waterfalls and abrupt changes in channel width expansions and constrictions in order to enable best hydraulic modelling 5 1 1 nahal ze elim eighteen flood depositional units were documented along the entire study reach and additional four large observed floods since 1997 with peak discharges ranging between 100 and 680 m3s 1 table 4 four floods were found to overlap based on age and peak discharge leaving eighteen distinct flood events with discharges ranging between 100 and 900 m3s 1 six of them range in discharge between 400 and 500 m3s 1 four exceeded 500 m3s 1 and one palaeoflood surpassed the 1997 flood 680 m3s 1 seven palaeofloods were dated either by radiocarbon or osl all of which were younger than 500 years tables 2 3 the maximum palaeo peak discharge of 900 m3s 1 was radiocarbon dated to 1980 1982 ce the palaeoflood record is about 82 of the total hydrological record 5 1 2 nahal rahaf thirteen flood depositional units were documented along the entire reach the gauged record since 1991 includes five large floods with peak discharges between 118 and 210 m3 s 1 and one historical flood with discharges of 525 m3 s 1 775 m3 s 1 at the outlet seven floods were found to overlap based on age and peak discharge this leaves twelve distinct floods with peak discharges between 118 and 1250 m3s 1 table 5 the radiocarbon ages range between 2910 bce to 1940 ce about 5000 years and the osl ages go back to 7 3 1 3ky tables 2 3 the second largest palaeoflood with a peak discharge of 1170 m3s 1 was radiocarbon dated to 1667 1941 ce the palaeoflood record therefore comprises about 68 of the large floods 100 m3 s 1 in the combined records the systematic record includes another twenty three floods with peak discharge 100 m3 s 1 in the large ephemeral streams of the negev the preservation of palaeoflood deposits usually in tributary mouths was relatively good with an average of 10 15 flood deposits at each site greenbaum et al 2006 table 1 in contrast at the smaller and steeper southern judean desert streams such as in the present study flood deposition usually occurs on discontinuous overbank pockets and in small rock shelters preserving a limited flood sedimentary record with only 2 6 floods in each site this makes it more complicated to construct a long term and significant palaeoflood record in comparison to the palaeoflood sites in the negev therefore the data were collected from maximum potential sites along the study reach previous studies in two other streams in the southern judean desert nahal heimar 450 km2 and nahal ashalim 75 km2 fig 1 reconstructed maximum palaeo peak discharges were 1100 and 760 m3s 1 respectively greenbaum et al 2006 table 1 the extremely long palaeoflood record of nahal ashalim 7600 years was preserved in a cave a comparison of the magnitudes of the largest palaeofloods and measured floods in the negev and southern judean deserts and the fitted envelope curves is presented in fig 10 the paleohydrological data from these streams shows that our results maximum peak discharges of 900 and 1250 m3s 1 are within the same range nevertheless the maximum peak discharge in n rahaf 1250 m3s 1 is outstanding for its relatively small basin size which exceeds the regional envelope curve 5 2 flood frequency analysis ffa palaeoflood information relevant for flood frequency analysis comprises peak discharges their ages absolute or relative and perception thresholds for individual palaeoflood magnitudes england et al 2019 regarding flood timing the dated palaeoflood units provide the temporal framework of the palaeoflood record whereas for the undated units a relative flood age was assigned based on their stratigraphic position the basic assumption in the statistical models using palaeohydrological information is that all floods above a certain perception threshold are documented in the stratigraphic record over a period of known duration the perception thresholds are stages related to the palaeoflood sites assuming that each flood with magnitude exceeding the base of the site alcove or overbank surface results in an individual flood bed the flood age of the lowest flood bed within the palaeoflood stratigraphy of the site marks the temporal onset of the perception threshold as a result every year there is information about a flood discharge exceeding or not exceeding that perception threshold benito et al 2020 in this way palaeoflood data can be processed as censored data that can be efficiently analyzed by statistical methods stedinger and cohn 1986 cloete et al 2018 5 2 1 nahal ze elim fig 11 a shows the flood data organization used in the flood frequency analysis comprising thirteen floods over the period 1770 2015 and four gauged floods 2016 2019 the palaeoflood data were arranged according to four perception thresholds pts two gradually increased from 430 to 480 m3s 1 over the time interval of 1770 1959 cal years ce and two from 220 to 350 m3s 1 over the period 1960 2015 cal years ce it was assumed that unit 1 at ze 9 osl age 0 4 ky fig 3 is equivalent to the unit 3 at ze 13 1734 1807 cal ce which is reasonable based on the similarity in discharge between both palaeoflood sites and on the wide range of over dispersion of the osl age of unit 1 palaeoflood data from sites ze 9 ze 11 and ze 12 fig 3 constrained the lower bound discharge value assigned to the perception thresholds and the individual floods discharge and age used for ffa the non systematic flood record was completed with the historic floods recorded in 1981 900 m3s 1 1997 680 m3s 1 and 2004 100 m3s 1 the log pearson 3 distribution provided a good fit of the systematic palaeoflood record analysis fig 11b with the palaeoflood and historical discharges plotted near the fitted distribution where all data located within the confidence limits indicating a good fit the upper tail includes the historic floods with discharges of 900 and 680 m3s 1 followed by the largest palaeofloods of 620 m3s 1 an additional frequency analysis was completed using the gauged four years and historical floods three floods showing a lack of definition of the distribution upper tail that result in very high discharges for the higher quantiles for instance the calculated 1 annual exceedance probability flood for the palaeoflood gauged dataset is 760 m3s 1 whereas using the gauged historic record it is 1750 m3s 1 table 6 the largest peak discharge of 900 m3s 1 in n ze elim attributed a recurrence interval of 50 years based on the limited gauge record including historic floods and 150 200 years based on the combined gauge historic and palaeoflood records fig 11b table 6 the largest measured discharge 680 m3s 1 assigned annual exceedance probabilities of 3 4 and 1 2 respectively these results can be explained by the long palaeoflood record of 500 years that includes 19 relatively small and medium floods and only 3 large floods 600 m3s 1 the effect of the latter on the ffa results is therefore minor the short and discontinuous measured record 1997 2018 includes three small medium floods and one large flood that increases the effect of low probability floods nevertheless the results of 5800 and 9340 m3s 1 for the 0 2 and 0 1 annual exceedance probabilities table 6 are much too high and out of hydrological context for the region even for catchments that are 4 14 times larger in area table 1 therefore the ffa produces a more balanced result when the palaeoflood record combined to the gauged and historical floods even when the gauged record is short 5 2 2 nahal rahaf two palaeoflood sites namely raf b and raf g provided discharge thresholds incrementally increasing between 400 and 1250 m3s 1 over a time interval of the last 700 years osl age raf g section unit 2 fig 8 contains a reliable radiocarbon age dated to 1667 1835 cal ce that together with their relative high associated perception threshold 1170 m3s 1 provide robust arguments to assume that all flood exceeding such discharge were recorded in the stratigraphy the frequency analysis comprises two perception thresholds fig 12 a the first of 1170 m3s 1 associated with raf g upper set over the period 1755 1986 ce and the second of 775 m3s 1 associated with the observed october 1987 flood predating the onset of the gauge record over the period 1991 2018 the log pearson 3 distribution was found very effective to adjust to the combined palaeoflood historic and gauged datasets with their plotting positions at the upper tail next to the fitted distribution solid red line in fig 12b an additional frequency analyses was carried out using the gauged historical flood data the gauged historical flood distribution dashed red line in fig 12b resulted in higher peak flows than those of the palaeoflood gauged floods distribution particularly for high flood quantiles i e annual exceedance probabilities lower than 1 for instance peak discharges obtained for the low annual exceedance probabilities of 0 2 and 0 1 of the systematic record historical 1987 flood were extremely large 3460 and 5120 m3s 1 respectively even if we use the largest specific peak discharge on record anywhere in the negev and judean deserts for smaller basins of 10 50 km2 about 25 m3s 1 km 1 and apply it to our 55 km2 basin we obtain a peak discharge of 1400 m3s 1 we therefore believe that the ffa results for the gauged historic flood records are out of the regional hydrological context and should be regarded as unrealistic the integration of long term palaeoflood records dramatically reduced all the magnitudes for all recurrence intervals above 25 years 4 the peak discharges for the low annual exceedance probabilities 2 1 0 2 and 0 1 are 650 980 2130 and 2840 m3s 1 respectively table 6 a more reasonable range the systematic record alone dashed gray line in fig 12b provided the smallest values for all return periods table 6 in the current study in both n ze elim and n rahaf the difference between the analyses illustrates the effect of the long duration of the palaeoflood record over the short systematic historic record table 6 which is biased towards the large floods the incorporation of the palaeoflood data into the ffa provided significantly lower discharge estimates for the flood quantiles compared to the short systematic historical records this emphasizes the effect of the much longer duration of the palaeoflood records on the ffa although the maximum peak discharges in the palaeoflood records are much larger in contrast in n rahaf the systematic record includes mainly small and medium size floods whereas the palaeoflood record includes 3 large floods 1000 m3s 1 during the last 500 years which increases the effect of the low probability floods in nahal ashalim only a short part 1673 1996 ce 323 years of the extremely long palaeoflood record 7600 years was considered relevant to the present day flood hazard assessment this is because the entire record was assumed to include hydro climatological changes with different flow regimes and was therefore not included in the ffa in nahal heimar the periods 1670 1996 ce 326 years and 1810 1996 ce 186 years provided somewhat larger peak discharge values for the shorter period by about 27 8 for annual exceedance probabilities of 2 0 1 respectively greenbaum et al 2001 the results of the present study are in line with these results one of the most significant contributions of palaeoflood studies to risk assessments is the significant improvement in the reliability of the ffa when comparing the results of systematic data only to the systematic palaeoflood data for example in nahal paran 3600 km2 in the negev desert table 1 combining the 470 year palaeoflood record with the 50 year systematic record significantly reduced the discharges for the selected probabilities and increased the reliability dramatically especially for low probability floods greenbaum et al 2001 in contrast in nahal zin 1400 km2 in the negev desert combining the 2000 year palaeoflood record with the 65 year systematic and historical records almost did not affect the peak discharge estimates but the reliability of the results was dramatically improved as represented by the decrease of about 50 in the standard errors greenbaum et al 2000 similar to our results in the fish river in south africa 86 600 km2 for example the recurrence intervals showed that the systematic data alone and the systematic palaeoflood data yielded 5200 and 4415 m3s 1 respectively a decrease of 18 cloete et al 2018 5 3 comparison with conventional frequency analysis methods our frequency analyses results using palaeoflood and systematic data were compared with the results of conventional frequency analyses provided by various public agencies based on systematic records only fig 13 these models include greenbaum 2007 1 the ministry of agriculture soil erosion research station sers 2 model garti et al 1995 a local detailed version of the rational formula 2 the ihs israel hydrological service model meirovich et al 1998 a statistical regional model based on measured regional hydrological data 3 lavee natif 2004 fitting analyses of measured data from analogous basins in other parts of the judean desert onto ungauged dead sea basins for n ze elim our results were compared to all the above methods showing that the sers 2 and the lavee natif 2004 models provide higher estimates of peak discharge relative to the present study whereas the ihs model provides extremely low estimates fig 13a these differences are caused by the duration of the records the effect of large floods in short records is high and provides biased high values for the return periods in comparison to the long palaeoflood record which may include a number of such large floods in n rahaf we compared our results with the sers 2 and lavee natif 2004 models similar to our ffa for the systematic record only table 6 other ffas of the systematic record using different models provide lower values for different return periods in comparison to the paleoflood systematic records fig 13b the much higher estimates of the combined records are related to the paleoflood population which is composed of large floods including three floods 1000 m3s 1 the different results of the various models demonstrate the significant impact of using different models for the frequency estimates especially when the hydrological records are short and incomplete longer records may reduce this effect the extended palaeoflood records fill this gap which improves the results and enhances the reliability of the frequency analysis greenbaum 2007 lavee natif 2004 estimated the maximum peak discharges for the judean desert streams at 1000 m3s 1 for n ze elim which is similar to our results 900 m3s 1 and 700 m3s 1 for n rahaf compared to 1250 m3s 1 in the present study 6 conclusions the palaeohydrological approach in which a large number of sites are studied was applied in this study and enabled the reconstruction of significant flood records for two steep mountainous bedrock canyons in the southern judean desert the palaeoflood record for the n ze elim stream provided evidence of 18 floods with peak discharges of 220 900 m3s 1 for a period of about 500 years the largest flood of 900 m3s 1 radiocarbon dated to 1980 1982 ce and using log pearson 3 distribution attributed a recurrence interval of 50 years based on the systematic record only and 150 200 years based on the combined systematic and palaeoflood records for n rahaf the palaeoflood record includes 13 floods with peak discharges of 170 1250 m3s 1 and three very large floods exceeding 1100 m3s 1 the radiocarbon ages of these floods are around 1667 1941 ce these floods sediments were deposited in a rock shelter raf g 7 3 m above the channel bed which was found to overlie an upper palaeolithic archaeological site dated by radiocarbon to 30 000 years bp for the ffa only the data of the last 700 years was analyzed due to the large time gap between the older and the younger populations and in order to make it more relevant to present hazard assessment using log pearson 3 distribution the largest flood 1250 m3s 1 attributed a recurrence interval of 500 years for the combined systematic and palaeoflood records in both streams the ffa for the systematic historic data only overestimated the frequencies of the large floods most probably due to their short and discontinuous records this was also true for other conventional frequency analyses applied by other agencies based on the available systematic record alone the population of the palaeofloods in n rahaf with the three extreme floods 1000 m3s 1 finally provides higher discharges for the various low probabilities the palaeoflood data extends the record to several hundred years reducing the peak discharge values for different return periods and significantly enhancing ffa reliability author

8136,study region ireland study focus multiple studies have established that catchment geology and weathering regime strongly influence surface water chemistry and that geochemical cycling can vary due to seasonal climatic conditions however fewer studies have focused on the influence these controls in a holistic manner we relate the water chemistry of a country wide irish river survey to atmospheric input underlying geology and the influence of bogs climatic conditions were defined by an atypically wet winter and an unusually dry summer providing the opportunity to investigate river chemistry variation across hydrologic conditions sampling included 21 of ireland s 22 largest rivers ranked by discharge first order and second order streams draining bog lands a second order stream draining a limestone catchment and downstream transects along the river shannon all samples were analyzed for major elements selected trace elements and nutrients and a subset was analyzed for δ34sso4 new hydrological insights most catchments were dominated by carbonate weathering with little contribution from the weathering of aluminosilicates river water composition also varied geographically along the prevailing wind direction due to inputs from marine aerosols with additional weathering components important in some systems seasonal influences could be seen in the chemistry of the headwaters of the river shannon while the lower reaches of the river exhibited less variable behavior throughout seasonal changes likely due to the influence of lakes in the river shannon system

whether water is fit for human consumption to state just a few meybeck 2003 although initially most these studies were focused on major dissolved constituents and nutrients with the development of clean collection techniques and sensitive analytical methods analysis of trace elements and stable isotopes have been included in many of these investigations since the early 1980s dramatically increasing our overall knowledge of riverine geochemistry e g windom et al 1991 gaillardet et al 2014 however most of the research emphasis has been directed at the world s larger river systems e g stallard and edmond 1987 shiller 1997 gaillardet et al 1999 the analysis of one or only a few elements miller et al 2011 palmer and edmond 1993 or specific types of river systems such as small mountainous rivers gardner et al 2017 lyons et al 2005 there is an opportunity to focus specifically on geochemical controls on both large and small streams tied to geology seasonality atmospheric input and anthropogenic influences the bedrock and subsoil geology of any watershed exerts an important influence on the chemistry of the associated natural waters this has been demonstrated using both major cation and anion concentrations and molar ratios of river waters gaillardet et al 1999 meybeck 2003 for example waters draining limestone terrains have high total dissolved solids tds and are typically dominated by ca hco3 ions while those draining granitic and other felsic crystalline bedrock type have much lower tds and are usually na hco3 in character meybeck 2003 superimposed on the major element characteristics of rivers is the impact of anthropogenic activities on the nutrient and trace element concentrations be those from agricultural urban suburban or industrial sources gaillardet et al 2014 because there are very few pristine river systems remaining in the world today it is important to identify anthropogenic factors in addition to local geology and land use in order to understand riverine biogeochemistry berner and berner 2012 in addition climate and seasonality are important factors especially as manifested in vegetation type and fluvial hydrology a central issue that influences river chemistry in ireland is the occurrence and abundance of bog lands these are ombrotrophic peatlands fed solely by rainfall characterized by thick sequences of organic matter naturally decaying under anaerobic methanogenic conditions in general waters draining bogs are of low tds elevated dissolved organic matter dom and low ph proctor 2008 with major ion chemistry dominated by na and cl hannigan and kelly quinn 2014 in this paper we investigate the chemical composition of 21 of the 22 largest rivers by discharge on the island of ireland epa 2021 based on 109 grab samples appendix a fig 2 the rivers in this study are separated into five groups 1 first and second order streams draining lowland atlantic blanket bog lands streams draining connemara bogs n 10 2 one monolithologic second order stream draining limestone the caher river n 6 3 one catchment of mixed lithology of limestones granites metamorphic derived till and complex sequence of precambrian and lower paleozoic sediments main stem and tributaries of the river corrib n 14 4 four downstream transects along the longest river in ireland during contrasting seasons the river shannon n 38 and 5 the remaining largest rivers on the island other major irish rivers n 41 comparisons among these systems allow us to investigate the role of substrate geology and land use on stream chemistry in addition the river shannon was sampled during an unusually wet cold winter followed by an unusually hot dry spring and summer and again during a high discharge autumn event providing important insights into how the river biogeochemistry is affected by meteorological and hydrological changes within the watershed over a seasonal basis 2 study area 2 1 bedrock and quaternary geology bedrock geology was simplified into twelve categories to conduct a spatial analysis of bedrock within river catchments that includes the total bedrock area and the percent of that bedrock over the whole island elío et al 2017 fig 1 table 1 ireland is composed largely of precambrian and paleozoic sedimentary rocks that are covered in most locations by pleistocene glacial and holocene post glacial deposits holland and sanders 2009 although we do present data from watersheds containing late precambrian to early cambrian dalradian metamorphic rocks and from igneous intrusives the majority of the watersheds are dominated by the paleozoic sediments fig 1 fig 2 table 1 the detailed geology of ireland see holland and sanders 2009 will not be repeated here but instead we discuss the general importance of lithology as it relates directly to the riverine geochemistry throughout the text the quaternary geology from the southwest to the southeast of the island is a mixture of sandstone and shale derived till with a substantial area of granite derived till in the east these quaternary sediments also fall along the northern ireland ireland south border limestone derived till dominates the center of ireland with intermittent peat sandstone and shale derived tills also incorporated peatlands are most prevalent in northwest ireland fig 2 along with metamorphic derived till elío et al 2017 this simplification can be further defined by region although these are generalizations and in many areas bedrock is covered by holocene peat and the substrate is obscured detailed quaternary geology bedrock geology and groundwater aquifer maps can be viewed using the geological survey of ireland online tools gsi 2020 2 2 meteorological conditions 2018 2019 the long term annual rainfall averages 1981 2010 in ireland generally decrease from west to east with rainfall in the west averaging 1000 1400 mm rainfall in the east averaging 750 to 1000 mm and local mountainous regions in the west receiving 2000 mm met éireann 2020 december and january are generally the wettest months while the period of april through june is generally the driest ireland experienced an unusually cold and wet winter during 2017 18 total rainfall at the athenry synoptic station 53 421534 n 7 90756 w near galway for january 2018 was 173 2 mm compared to mean monthly january rainfall of 116 7 mm met éireann 2020 record wet weather continued during our march 2018 sampling campaign through april 2018 then in may the weather became warm sunny and dry and during our next sampling campaign in june rainfalls were as much as 67 below long term average across ireland met éireann 2020 drought conditions continued through august during our third sampling campaign river shannon discharge records at athlone station 26027 show the mean monthly discharge during our sampling campaigns were march 2018 108 m3 s 1 june 2018 21 m3 s 1 july august 2018 21 m3 s 1 october 2019 190 8 m3 s 1 opw 2020 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analyses we collected 109 water samples manually from ireland streams and rivers appendix a most of these samples were collected between 20 february 2018 and 6 march 2019 and an additional downstream transect of ten samples was collected from the river shannon during a particularly high discharge period on 5 6 october 2019 surface water samples were collected either by hand or with a high density polyethylene hdpe sampling device attached to a 1 m plastic staff new low density polyethylene ldpe bottles that had been pre cleaned with 18 2 mω deionized di water welch et al 2010 were rinsed 3 times with the bulk sample before collection then placed in a chilled cooler in the dark until filtration all samples were filtered within 20 h of collection and most were filtered within 11 h except those from the river bann 2 samples which were filtered within 3 days of collection samples were filtered into two aliquots through new 0 45 μm pore size whatman polypropylene membrane filters using polypropylene syringes one into a 30 ml ldpe bottle that had been rinsed with di water three times for anion and nutrient analysis and another 30 ml ldpe bottle that had been rinsed first with 10 hcl and then di water for major cation and selected trace element analyses the latter filtrate was acidified to 2 v v hno3 with optima grade hno3 and used for both major cation and trace element analyses in order to assess any possible contamination by our collection and filtration techniques blanks were created by processing di water following the same procedures as were samples within a week of collection and processing the samples were shipped back to the school of earth sciences at the ohio state university and kept in a dark refrigerator at 4 c until analyzed major cations na k ca mg were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes select trace elements ba rb sr u cu and mo were analyzed using inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry icp ms major anions f br cl so4 by ion chromatography and nutrients nh4 no2 no3 si po4 colorimetrically using a skalar nutrient auto analyzer system detailed analytical methods are described elsewhere gardner et al 2017 harmon et al 2016 olund et al 2018 welch et al 2010 the relative standard deviation rsd of replicate calibration standards analyzed every 5 10 samples and ranged 1 3 for major cations 2 4 for trace elements and 1 5 for major anions and nutrients calibrations were verified using the external standards as described in the above references and concentrations were never more than 5 different than accepted values and were usually within 2 3 with the exception of mg and ca during one day of analysis which were within 7 and 8 respectively in addition our lab has taken part in numerous u s geological survey inter laboratory calibrations and the accuracy of our so4 and cl measurements that were analyzed concurrently with the irish river waters samples were within 0 6 2 0 for so4 and 1 4 4 7 for cl of the accepted values field blanks were collected during each field campaign in which our di water was filtered and preserved in the same manner as the samples appendix a concentrations of the major cations and major anions were low to undetectable for all field blanks in two of the three blanks nh4 and no2 no3 concentrations were above the detection limit but low in concentration trace element concentrations were also below detection with the exception of cu in one blank measured at 7 5 nm this appears to be an isolated contamination issue and is lower than 85 of the measured samples alkalinity was calculated from the charge imbalance between major cations and anions and for the purpose of this study of well oxygenated river waters it was assumed to be carbonate alkalinity previous studies in our lab based on analysis of hundreds of stream water samples representing a wide range of compositions show the error associated with this method was typically within 5 of the alkalinity measured by titration welch et al 2010 however organic ions can make up a significant part of charge balances in waters draining peatlands in our samples draining the connemara bog systems n 10 9 of samples we expect this error to be larger we compared the calculated alkalinities to a compilation of alkalinity data from other studies collected over a period of decades under a variety of discharge conditions there is very good agreement between our calculated concentrations and previously published work on the same rivers fig s1 while we recognize the potential error associated with calculating carbonate alkalinity concentrations we do not examine small changes in alkalinity that would be smaller than potential errors total dissolved solids tds were calculated by summing all the dissolved species in mass units assuming bicarbonate represents all unmeasured negative charge twelve samples from a range of systems were processed for δ34s analysis by precipitating dissolved so4 2 as baso4 at ohio state university then analyzing for δ 34s at the university of tennessee knoxville using the techniques described by szynkiewicz et al 2015 the δ 34s of baso4 was measured using a costech elemental analyzer ea coupled with a delta plus xl irms with analytical precision better than 0 3 the data are reported with respect to vcdt vienna canyon diablo troilite 4 results the geochemical measurements from all 109 samples are tabulated with detailed sampling locations appendix a table 3 presents the mean concentrations of major minor and trace elements and nutrients in the sampled irish rivers data for world rivers european rivers termed unpolluted by berner and berner 2012 mace head sw irish coastal precipitation keene et al 2015 and irish bog waters gorham et al 1985 4 1 major and minor elements and ions total dissolved solids tds ranged from 34 to 631 mg l 1 with a mean of 260 148 mg l 1 three streams kylemore dawros and owenbanogue rivers and two unnamed streams draining connemara bog lands and underlain by crystalline rocks near n 10 have a median value of 52 mg l 1 reflecting the dearth of readily weatherable rocks in these catchments and the dilution by low tds bog waters the caher river to the south a second order stream draining a karstified limestone catchment in the burren region has a median tds of 279 mg l 1 while the other larger rivers throughout the country have a median value of 298 mg l 1 which is similar to other large european rivers draining mixed lithologies berner and berner 2012 the major cation concentrations of the rivers measured in this study are dominated by ca and na fig 3 large variations are observed for ca mean 1281 μm rsd 65 mg mean 188 μm rsd 64 and k mean 53 μm rsd 96 and lesser variations are observed for na mean 442 μm rsd 36 appendix a the major anions are dominated by alkalinity hco3 but some rivers primarily those influenced by bogs have higher relative concentrations of dissolved cl fig 3 the more coastal connemara samples have na ca mg k and cl hco3 so4 while all the other rivers are dominated by ca and hco3 table 3 the mean ca and hco3 concentrations excluding the ten samples collected from the connemara bogs are higher than both the european and world means the rivers are also elevated in na and cl compared to european and world means dissolved si concentrations are an order of magnitude lower than the world average of 370 μm table 3 ranging 2 148 μm with a mean of 38 μm the so4 concentrations in the rivers range widely from 16 to 385 μm with a mean and median of 86 μm and 68 μm respectively between the european and world means sulfate generally composes less than 10 of the total anion concentration of the irish river water samples the highest so4 values are measured in the northeast part of the island in the bann and boyle rivers with concentrations greater than 350 μm the mean concentration of dissolved f for the entire dataset is 3 3 μm much higher than the connemara and caher mean values and equal to the means of river shannon and other irish rivers table 3 the median br concentration for all rivers is 0 41 0 23 μm with the highest means from connemara bog streams and caher river system and the lowest in the river shannon 4 2 nutrients the no3 no2 concentrations of the full dataset range 0 1 396 μm with a mean of 54 71 μm appendix a the mean no3 no2 values for streams draining the connemara bogs the caher river the corrib tributaries and river shannon are similar 26 45 μm while the other major irish rivers are roughly two fold higher at 93 μm although all subsets of rivers have rsds of 100 these large variabilities suggest that some systems are probably affected by anthropogenic input of fixed nitrogen through pastureland agricultural activities which account for 54 of irish land cover lydon and smith 2014 table 3 ammonium concentrations are low with means less than 1 μm as are soluble reactive phosphate srp concentrations of the srp only six samples are above the detection limit of 0 1 μm similarly low srp values were measured in spring water discharge in county clare on the west coast suggesting sorption with carbonate minerals smith and cave 2012 previous work on nutrient concentrations in twelve of the major rivers that we also analyzed documented a relatively low mean srp between 0 24 and 1 87 μm and comparable no3 no2 concentrations with values as high as 324 μm and a mean of 156 μm mcgrath et al 2016 4 3 minor and trace elements minor and trace elements were measured on samples collected in 2018 only n 92 and mean concentrations are rb 16 nm sr 2870 nm ba 206 nm mo 4 nm cu 17 nm and u 2 9 nm appendix a as noted by gaillardet et al 2014 in their review of trace element concentrations in world rivers there are fewer minor and trace data available in the literature than for major elements and many of those data come from north america gaillardet et al 2014 provided mean dissolved estimates for rb 19 nm sr 684 nm ba 168 nm and cu 23 nm while estimates for u 0 78 nm and mo 8 nm are provided by palmer and edmond 1993 and miller et al 2011 respectively the irish river dataset values are slightly lower than the global mean for dissolved rb mo and cu higher in all five river groups for sr slightly higher for ba and u in the major rivers but lower in the low order coastal streams table 3 4 4 sulfur isotopes there was sufficient baso4 precipitate present to obtain precise and accurate analyses in only seven of the twelve samples the δ34sso4 of selected river water samples ranged from approximately 9 5 to 2 7 table 4 the δ34s values generally were higher for samples collected on the west side of the island and decreased with decreasing catchment peat content 5 discussion 5 1 sources of elements and chemical weathering 5 1 1 correlations of major ions as a first step to determine solute sources a pearson correlation matrix was developed to assess the relationships among dissolved constituents in all the irish rivers fig s2 the strongest positive correlations were found for tds ca tds hco3 and ca hco3 weaker positive correlations were observed for tds f tds mg hco3 f and hco3 mg there were also positive relationships between these pairs na k na cl k cl k so4 ca mg and so4 si no significant negative correlations were identified the interpretations of these relationships are straightforward in that the correlations observed among tds ca hco3 and mg represent their primary introduction to the irish waters through limestone weathering their correlations with f suggest a similar source the na cl and na k relationships are likely due to these elements primary introduction into the landscape from both wet and dry deposition of marine aerosol the strong positive relationships between so4 k and so4 si may imply the introduction of those constituents from sedimentary rock weathering particularly from pyrite oxidation as discussed in section 5 1 5 5 1 2 aerosols and atmospheric input ireland is the first major land mass encountered by prevailing westerly winds traveling over the atlantic ocean and the precipitation chemistry at mace head southwest coastal reflects that long traveled path over the ocean prior to reaching ireland table 3 this precipitation has low ph 4 9 and ca concentrations keene et al 2015 this indicates that at least in the streams on the west coast the dissolved ca is derived primarily from chemical weathering the streams draining connemara bogs on the west coast are also dominated by deposition influenced by marine aerosols but have higher ca mg and k values than the mace head precipitation indicating some water rock interaction has occurred these are common observations across the rivers in ireland where a percentage of solutes is derived from precipitation but chemical weathering is the primary source for many chemical constituents lyons et al 2020 other solutes such as so4 may have natural or anthropogenic aerosol sources aherne et al 2002 with additional influence of rocks soils and sediment sources such as the oxidative weathering of reduced sulfides burke et al 2018 and dissolution of sulfate phases in some areas west et al 1968 as in many other countries waters in ireland have been monitored for changes in so4 concentrations to assess the environmental policies enacted in the early 1980s to combat acid precipitation between 1997 and 2007 atmospheric emissions of so2 decreased 63 and non marine so4 deposition decreased 36 while lake water so4 concentrations decreased by 9 and non marine so4 decreased by 58 burton and aherne 2012 despite a decrease in the use of solid fuels such as coal and peat the atmospheric input of so2 has not been eliminated at least on a local scale goodman et al 2009 lin et al 2018 2012 short term hours to days relatively high concentration 10 15 μg s m 3 events still occur in urban areas such as dublin lin et al 2018 though dublin is probably anomalous compared to the country as a whole as it is the most urbanized region of the country wind direction plays a major role in the so4 present in precipitation onshore westerlies from the atlantic contain the highest total so4 concentrations with a weighted mean concentration near 30 μm while winds from the east carry the highest fraction of non sea salt so4 associated with source in ireland and europe bashir et al 2008 however even at the mace head sampling location on the west coast where the deposition chemistry has a strong marine component pollution from europe can contribute to the precipitation chemistry in ireland at some times of the year huang et al 2001 those easterly winds however are usually associated with high pressure systems that produce little precipitation keene et al 2015 the mean so4 concentration of 9 4 μm in rainwater at mace head has an rsd of 71 5 keene et al 2015 indicating the high variability of this constituent nonetheless there is a decrease in the cl so4 molar ratio of the precipitation from west to east across the island with a decrease in the marine aerosol component aherne et al 2002 aherne and farrell 2002 bashir et al 2008 and comparable trends are observable in the river chemistry fig 4 for reference the global mean cl so4 ratio for natural rivers as termed by berner and berner 2012 is assumed to be 2 this low global average is similar to the mean for anthropogenically affected rivers of 1 3 2 but the absolute so4 concentrations are 120 188 μm in anthropogenically affected rivers compared to a mean of 86 μm for pristine rivers berner and berner 2012 the cl so4 ratios vary substantially in the rivers shown in fig 4 with a high of 27 greater than the seawater ratio of 19 from the river caher in the west to a low of 2 in the upper reaches of the river shannon and in rivers draining the northeastern part of ireland the connemara bog streams and the caher river in the burren which drain mostly bog lands in the west have mean cl so4 molar ratios of 11 2 and 9 8 respectively they reflect the importance of marine aerosol deposition just inland from the ocean as the ratios are very similar to mace head precipitation value of 10 3 keene et al 2015 but slightly higher than previously measured bog water values novák et al 2005a 2005b the cl so4 of rivers draining other catchments along the west coast rivers foyle erne owenmore moy feale fergus laune and maigue have a slightly lower mean ratio of 8 2 however individual rivers have cl so4 that vary by as much as a factor of four with higher ratios in samples collected during the wetter march and may 2018 months compared to those samples from august 2018 east coast rivers have lower cl so4 ratios with mean values of 3 2 in both the northeast bann boyne liffey slaney and southeast barrow nore suir lee blackwater and bandon with little change in the ratios observed between spring and summer sampling the length of the river shannon was sampled four times during the study in march june and august of 2018 and in october of 2019 the cl so4 ratios in the upper reaches of the river shannon vary considerably reflecting some of the lowest values in this study with values of 1 3 1 8 measured at dowra however for most of the length of the river shannon the cl so4 ratios remain relatively constant with a mean of 6 7 fig 4 the overall decrease in cl so4 from the west to the east along the prevailing wind direction suggests that input from marine aerosols is a contributor to these solutes in river waters however the variation in this ratio and the elevated so4 concentrations in some of these rivers suggest additional in situ sources which are discussed further in section 5 1 5 precipitation and dry deposition are also major sources of br and f and these largely reflect the composition of marine aerosols neal et al 2007 tagami and uchida 2006 however weathering of f bearing minerals particularly apatite fluorite and biotite from rocks and soils can be a significant source of f in river waters berger et al 2016 fuge 2019 bromide can be incorporated into organic matter in soils especially peat hughes et al 1998 the f cl and br cl ratios from irish stream and river samples are compared to seawater ratios representing the marine aerosol source approaching ireland from the wsw all but six river samples show enrichment of f and depletion of br relative to cl when compared to seawater fig 5 if we assume that cl is conservative these data strongly suggest that dissolved f is coming not only from precipitation but also from the dissolution of f rich minerals in the soils and bedrock rock salt is sometimes applied to roads in ireland in the winter months another possible cl source the molar ratio of f to ca is approximately 1 500 fig s3 which is close to an estimated value of 1 400 500 for marine carbonates chester 2003 fuge 2019 suggesting a similar source a possible explanation for relatively low concentrations of br could be loss from the initial precipitation input due to incorporation into organic matter within the soil profile especially in bogs neal et al 2007 four samples collected from uppermost river shannon sampling locations during october 2019 exhibit roughly the same br cl ratio as seawater confirming the precipitation aerosol source during a high flow event in which water moved through the system quickly with little time for soil water interaction 5 1 3 carbonate weathering the concentrations and sources of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and bicarbonate carbonate ions to river systems can help elucidate landscape denudation processes watershed and riverine ecological dynamics and anthropogenic activities lyons et al 2020 raymond and hamilton 2018 urban runoff over impervious surfaces and agricultural processes i e liming can greatly affect the overall carbonate system in rivers kaushal et al 2017 though spatial variation in the bicarbonate distribution in river waters is thought to be controlled primarily by chemical weathering of limestone and dolomite within catchments lauerwald et al 2013 previous work on the geochemistry of estuarine systems in ireland attributed the high dic concentrations to carbonate rock weathering especially in the shannon liffey and barrow nore suir systems mcgrath et al 2016 the rivers in our study with the exception of the streams draining bogs are primarily ca hco3 waters see section 4 1 the highest calculated bicarbonate concentrations are observed in rivers associated with watersheds that are at least partially composed of limestones the catchments that have been termed non limestone by mcgrath et al 2016 such as the blackwater foyle lee and slaney all have lower hco3 values than the watersheds containing limestone fig 6 dissolved ca and hco3 show a strong relationship demonstrating a 1 2 m stoichiometry providing further evidence for limestone weathering fig 6 eq 1 1 caco3 h2co3 ca 2hco3 the points falling farthest above this 1 2 line are from rivers such as the barrow nore suir and bann the same rivers containing high mg concentrations relative to ca fig 7 although dissolved mg is strongly associated with dissolved ca from limestone weathering not all the mg can be accounted for from this source there is a positive relationship between mg and ca in most rivers of approximately 1 10 mg ca ratio fig 7 groundwaters in pure limestone lithologies i e limestones and dolomitized limestones and impure limestone lithologies i e mixed limestones sandstones shales described by tedd et al 2017 also both have a median mg ca ratio of around 1 10 some rivers plot far above the 1 10 mg ca line in fig 7 including the bann boyne suir barrow nore and maigue all of which drain the midland eastern portion of the island and have a high percentage of carbonates in their catchments while the groundwaters associated with dolomitized limestones have elevated mg ca ratios tedd et al 2017 they are still substantially lower than the rivers listed above these rivers with high mg ca ratios also drain mafic igneous intrusives and volcanics that are uncommon elsewhere on the island weathering of these more mg rich rocks may also contribute disproportionately to the tds an additional source of non limestone mg to the midland eastern rivers could be both crystalline igneous and detrital sedimentary rocks fig 8 fig 1 table 1 it has been demonstrated by others that even in catchments that are underlain by crystalline rocks which contain very low amounts of disseminated calcite 1 riverine dissolved ca is still primarily from caco3 dissolution jacobson and blum 2003 jin et al 2008 lyons et al 2005 irish soils including those in non limestone regions have concentrations of total ca reported as cao weight ranging between 0 01 and 2 1 de vos and tarvainen 2006 reimann et al 2012 these surficial materials produced from previous glacial activities and deposition could also be a source of ca and hco3 to irish waters although the abundance of readily dissolvable caco3 is the major control on the distribution of ca and hco3 in irish rivers and streams there are other lithologic sources the relationship between dissolved ca and sr suggests a mix between the dissolution of carbonate and the weathering of crystalline rocks fig 9 three of the low order caher river samples draining only viséan aged limestone fall along either side of the carbonate monolithic catchments described by meybeck 1986 suggesting these ca sr ratios can have considerable variability the connemara streams flowing through watersheds dominated by the occurrence of bogs fall along the crystalline rock end member trends though evaporitic facies are uncommon in ireland headwater samples from the river shannon at shannon pot and dowra may represent an enrichment of sr relative to ca sourced from the dissolution of gypsum from evaporitic beds alternating with shales and limestones observed by west et al 1968 these authors attribute blocks of gypsum observed on the shore of lough allen between dowra and drumshanbo as sourced from these beds fig 2 increased so4 from these same sample sites in the upper reaches of the shannon could be coming from the oxidation of reduced sulfur phases in peatland or shales the combination of higher so4 concentrations and lower ca sr ratios may be better explained by the dissolution of other ca and so4 rich sources such as the gypsum described by west et al 1968 many of the minor and trace elements measured in this study can be attributed to carbonate weathering little published data exist for trace metals in irish surface waters but previous work on the river corrib and its four tributaries o connor 2003 which we sampled shows mean dissolved ba 184 440 nm and sr 332 4780 nm concentrations that were within our reported range the irish geological survey also recently published the tellus geochemical survey with trace element data including ba 2 2 5000 nm and u bdl 60 7 nm in stream water from the border and west of ireland knights 2020 the correlation matrix of minor and trace elements fig s4 indicates that ba is positively correlated to both ca and sr but it is less strongly correlated with so4 across the entire dataset rivers draining limestone catchments are associated with both low ca ba ratios river shannon system mean 5 103 and high ca ba ratios caher river mean 100 103 karst waters in county clare have higher sr ba values than waters draining clastic rocks gill et al 2018 also suggesting that although ba may in part be associated with caco3 rich lithologies the highest ba concentrations are sourced from other minerals the highest ba concentrations in our dataset are from the central and eastern region of the country including the eastern shannon tributaries and the rivers boyne suir noir and barrow the same rivers with elevated mg concentrations all of which drain a mixed lithology of limestones and shales but also contain igneous intrusives and ordovician volcanics barite baso4 could be associated with the detrital sedimentary rocks predominately shale in some of the watersheds but no compelling correlation exists between ba and so4 in these central eastern river systems with elevated ba and mg barium is also commonly associated with clays in shales as an interlayer cation that can be readily solubilized during weathering renock et al 2016 uranium is most strongly associated with dissolved ca and these two elements exhibit a robust positive linear relationship except for three outliers fig 10 of the three high values two are from the river barrow and the third is from the slaney and may be derived from the weathering of granitic rocks in the wicklow mountains in the northeast and northern portions of the respective catchments fig 1 recent work in smaller river systems of the world has also pointed to the association of dissolved u with carbonate rich landscapes gardner et al 2017 in addition karst water in western ireland has higher concentrations of u than nearby waters draining detrital sedimentary rocks gill et al 2018 5 1 4 aluminosilicate weathering as noted above the si concentrations in irish surface waters are lower than global means and in general the chemical weathering regime on the island is dominated by carbonate rock dissolution however the presence of dissolved si indicates that aluminosilicate weathering does occur and we examine the significance of this process through using three methods 1 a comparison to end member lithologies based on work by gaillardet et al 1999 2 a thermodynamic approach and 3 an examination of non sea salt alkali metals most of the irish waters reflect a mix of carbonate dissolution and an evaporite signature fig 11 which with the previously noted rare exception of the headwaters of the shannon suggests the concentration of marine aerosols result from precipitation input not from evaporite rock dissolution the cl so4 ratios also support this hypothesis table 4 of the eight connemara bog stream samples from along the coast three fall within the evaporite marine aerosol end member as do the rivers bealnabrack and owenriff both of which flow into lough corrib within the corrib catchment these differences reflect at least in part differences in catchment lithologies and the abundance of readily weatherable material the agricultural soils of ireland are intermediately to highly weathered with chemical index of alteration cia ranging 60 92 with the soils in the eastern and southern regions of the country having higher weathering indices than soils from the north and west négrel et al 2015 these high cias suggest that at least in the agricultural areas the soils have undergone intensive weathering and the more dissolvable material has already been lost nesbitt and young 1982 this is especially important in the soils dominated by granite and sandstone derived tills even though the production of dissolved si indicates that chemical weathering of si rich rocks is taking place the relatively low concentrations measured in these streams suggest the intensity of the weathering process is low all but four samples have si concentrations less than 100 μm roughly half that of quartz solubility with the majority ranging between 10 and 60 μm and twenty seven samples have concentrations less than 20 μm fig s5 these very low values suggest that soils may be unstable with respect to secondary clay minerals while the higher values suggest waters are in the stability field of kaolinite stallard and edmond 1987 in both cases from a thermodynamic approach at least these waters are representative of an aluminosilicate domain that has been highly depleted in primary minerals and alkali cations and are replaced by more insoluble weathering products such as clay minerals faure 1998 finally the relationship between si concentrations and alkali metals is shown by correction of precipitation input by subtraction of cl from na k fig 12 in the majority of rivers the na and k can be accounted for by precipitation input as 72 samples have cl corrected alkali metal concentrations less than zero more intense weathering of primary cation rich minerals plot farther to the right stallard and edmond 1987 zhang et al 2019 including only 37 samples all three of the above approaches support the notion that although the dissolved si observed in these waters does represent input from the weathering of aluminosilicate minerals this form of weathering is minor and the majority of most readily weatherable material has been already removed 5 1 5 the influence of bogs and sulfide weathering in addition to the marine and fossil fuel derived aerosol sources of so4 discussed in section 5 1 2 there are other potential in situ sources of so4 to the rivers of ireland while fertilizer and agricultural return waters have been shown to add to the so4 loads of rivers and streams in other locations e g szynkiewicz et al 2011 2015 these sources have not been identified as significant contributors in ireland bog soils have been established as important components in s biogeochemical dynamics in catchments where extensive bog land exists novák et al 2005b 2005a 2001 1994 skrzypek et al 2010 burton and aherne 2012 noted that catchment soils in ireland have the ability to retain so4 while cl passes through the system thereby both removing so4 either by microbial reduction or by adsorption onto organic matter and changing the s isotopic value sulfur fixed in bogs is both inorganic i e iron sulfide minerals and organic associated with the latter being more abundant novák et al 1999 european bog sedimentary δ34s values range widely in the top 40 cm of depth from 15 to 4 similar to the range across our seven samples table 4 bog substrate dating strongly suggested that s is mobile in these environments novák et al 2005b and subsequent work has clearly demonstrated that fluctuations of the water table aid in s mobility daniels et al 2008 have shown that at lower water levels previously reduced s is oxidized to form dissolved so4 that is then flushed from the bogs into surface water runoff during storms and gully erosion events thus bog land can be a major contributor of so4 to rivers and streams with more depleted δ34s of so4 values the δ34s of so4 values are generally higher on the west coast and decrease eastward but also generally decrease with lower fractions of catchment peatland though neither of these is a statistically robust relationship fig 2 table 4 also summarized in table 4 are possible sources that were used as end members for our analysis the most negative δ34s values identified originate from the oxidation of biogenically reduced s that has formed pyrite burke et al 2018 karim and veizer 2000 torres et al 2014 and pyrite from black shales in western ireland in the clare basin ranged from 35 5 to 8 2 armstrong et al 2019 mean flux weighted bulk precipitation measured at connemara bog was the most positive at 17 8 close to the seawater value of 21 novák et al 2005a globally the oxidative weathering of pyrite owp is now recognized to be a much more significant source of so4 to natural waters than previously thought approximately 43 of the total riverine dissolved so4 is estimated to be from this source yielding a mean global δ34s value of 4 9 for unpolluted rivers burke et al 2018 we interpret at least some of the so4 present in the rivers with higher so4 sr ratios and more negative δ34s values to be from owp large rivers with elevated so4 sr relative to the overall dataset 100 include the rivers bann bandon laune lee and feale along with the smaller annascaul and all drain at least some clastic sedimentary terrain as such the bann has the third lowest δ34s values measured 1 2 however there is little evidence to argue that owp is the only source of this isotopically depleted s as the farther inland bog sequestered so4 could have a much more negative δ34s value novák et al 2001 in addition if the oxidation of the reduced s in the bog soils occurs through microbial processes pellerin et al 2019 the so4 that is transported from the bog sediments into rivers could have a very different isotopic signal than either what was initially deposited in the bog or what was converted via reduction processes given the dearth of s isotope data we cannot firmly state whether this so4 depleted in 34s is from the more traditional owp as described by burke et al 2018 or from similar oxidation processes occurring in the bog lands one additional piece of evidence suggesting owp occurs in some rivers is potentially increased weathering reactions the acidity generated from the owp has the potential to increase mineral weathering rates greatly and to affect the stoichiometry of the mineral weathering reaction because it can solubilize cations from rocks and minerals these reactions would result in a deficit of carbonate alkalinity in waters because the acidity is from so4 and not co2 of the 109 river samples 17 have so4 concentrations of more than 10 of their hco3 concentration fig 13 these include eight from connemara four from the upper river shannon drainage two from the river bandon one from the annascaul and one each from the river feale and the river bann many of the same rivers discussed above with elevated so4 sr ratios these 17 rivers including the five formerly mentioned have ca mg concentrations that cannot be accounted for by carbonate mineral dissolution alone based on the stoichiometry for co2 promoted dissolution of ca mg carbonates i e molar ca mg hco3 0 5 this suggests either owp or sox gases are promoting the weathering of limestone is contributing to the solute flux as previously noted gypsum occurrence is rare some trace element associations also suggest either enhanced weathering caused by owp or direct sources from sulfide minerals rubidium which is highly elevated in shales compared to carbonates and other lithologies horstman 1957 exhibits the strongest linear relationship with so4 followed by cl indicating a putative shale weathering source fig s3 in an analysis of 273 water samples from around the world miller et al 2011 found that dissolved mo concentrations are highly correlated with so4 and controlled in great part by pyrite oxidation in a similar analysis of small mountainous rivers gardner et al 2017 found a similar relationship but the mo so4 correlation observed is biased towards samples with very high mo and so4 concentrations and no relationship is apparent after hydrothermally influenced waters are removed we found a similar pattern in ireland rivers while the highest mo concentrations are associated with the highest so4 concentrations no correlation is apparent across the dataset or within our river groupings when those outliers are removed the highest dissolved mo concentrations were observed in rivers bann barrow and boyne with the bann and boyne also having very high so4 concentrations likewise there is much scatter in the cu data but the highest cu concentrations are associated with high so4 concentrations the connemara and caher low order streams and most of the corrib samples have lower cu concentrations while the shannon and its tributaries fall in an almost crescent shaped pattern the bann sample collected at portadown north ireland and the fergus sample collected at ennis ireland are very high in cu and may represent the impact of some anthropogenic influence we cannot definitively say whether so4 is sourced from owp or bog sequestered so4 but it is an important difference as many of the peatlands of northern europe especially in ireland have been drying in the second half of the 20th century swindles et al 2019 future climate scenarios for ireland suggest decreased summer precipitation and increased temperatures along with increased winter precipitation steele dunne et al 2008 greater winter precipitation could increase the percentage of seasonally deposited reduced s in the bogs in the winter and increase the flux as so4 into surface waters in the summer thus decreasing the role of landscape sequestration of s and leading to higher concentrations of so4 in surface waters 5 2 seasonality variation in river shannon geochemistry march 2018 october 2019 the river shannon is the longest river with the greatest average flow on the island of ireland with a catchment area of 18 000 km2 1 5th of ireland s land area and mean annual discharge of 6 59 109 m3 a 1 at athlone station table 2 three large lakes lough allen lough ree and lough derg interrupt the flow of the river shannon fig 2 land use in the catchment during the 2000s was 1 2 urban 9 2 arable 65 7 pasture and 10 8 wetland i e primarily bog with human population density of 34 people km 2 tockner et al 2009 it is the largest river in ireland and is used as a drinking water utility and recreational resource the length of the river was sampled twice during low flow baseflow regimes june 2018 n 9 and august 2018 n 10 and twice during high stage event flows march 2018 n 7 and october 2019 n 10 to discern differences in water chemistry in high and low flows the sampling dates encompassed the coldest and wettest winters and the warmest and driest springs and early summers experienced in ireland over the previous 70 75 years the downstream profiles of dissolved ca si no3 so4 and ca si ratios in the river shannon from the furthest upstream sample at shannon pot downstream to ballina are compared in fig 14 calcium concentrations exhibit a downstream increase after decreasing slightly from the river s origin at shannon pot to drumshanbo in march august and june ca concentrations increase downstream with little difference among the transects below carrick on shannon but during the highest discharge period in october ca concentrations were 25 lower at the downstream locations thus from lanesborough south there was no reflection of the temporal meteorology on the ca concentrations except during the highest flow event in october 2019 however the ca si ratio is higher during baseflow in august and june than in march and october during high discharge the large increases in ca along the length of the river reflect the changing lithologies within the sub catchments from a mix of carbonate and detrital sedimentary rock in the north to those dominated by carbonates after carrick on shannon the input from the ca rich rivers inny suck and brosna all of which drain the large area of midland limestones served to increase the ca values between carrick on shannon and banagher in addition there is little to no intensive peat extraction around shannon pot but through the midlands are some of the largest peat mines in western europe silica concentrations at the upstream sites exhibited the opposite behavior as ca increasing slightly at dowra during baseflow and decreasing again at drumshanbo and remaining relatively constant at higher discharge in march and october si concentrations generally increased and were roughly two fold higher in march and october than during baseflow these higher si concentrations are the primary control over the lower ca si ratios during high flow the lesser increases in si downstream in march and october below lanesborough also reflect the significance of the inny and the suck which have concentrations much higher than the shannon at lanesborough 73 and 59 vs 36 μm respectively at the most downstream point ballina the river shannon represents a mixing of water from tributaries so that the ca si ratios remain fairly constant throughout the seasons though still higher at low flows perhaps demonstrating the importance of the overall volume differences between the tributary inflow and the volume of the lakes at baseflow in august and june the so4 concentrations spiked upstream at dowra then decreased and remained relatively constant to increasing slightly downstream the higher concentrations of so4 in the headwaters likely reflect weathering input from shales the dowra site was not sampled in march but the so4 concentration was lower at carrick on shannon and was similar at the downstream stations except that the peak occurred at banagher at high discharge in october the upstream peak occurred at drumshanbo followed by a large increase in concentration to a peak downstream at banagher of 199 μm the high so4 concentrations at banagher in october were influenced by the suck and big brosna tributaries which drain subcatchments with 20 and 15 bog land respectively fig 2 fig 14 reduced sulfur is oxidized to so4 in bogs when the water table is low in summer months which is then flushed out as a result of water pulses through the system in early autumn daniels et al 2008 explaining why banagher exhibited elevated so4 concentrations in october increased so4 concentration is notable specifically at the banagher sampling location because the suck and big brosna subwatersheds account for only 11 7 of the shannon catchment but 26 4 of the total bog land at baseflow in august and june the no3 concentrations generally increased downstream reaching a value of 55 μm at ballina the march profile was similar in shape but roughly two fold higher in concentration at all sampling locations while the october no3 concentrations were roughly constant around 10 μm until a roughly 3 fold increase at banagher and portumna downstream the downstream increases in no3 are probably related to increased agricultural activities and peat extraction in the catchment and sub catchments with the higher concentrations of no3 observed during the spring indicating the importance of rainfall and runoff for no3 input given the data at these sampling locations it is difficult to assess if the lakes have any impact on the overall biogeochemistry of the river although one could invoke the decline in si between dowra and drumshanbo as due to biological input in lough allen there is no other indication of this process in loughs ree and derg nor is there any clear removal of no3 6 conclusions during 2018 2019 we collected and analyzed 109 samples of river and stream water from ireland for their major minor and selected trace elements the major conclusions of this work are 1 the influence of marine aerosols on river chemistry decreases from west to east 2 the majority of river water is ca hco3 water reflecting the overall importance of carbonate mineral weathering in most irish catchments 3 the si concentrations are low compared to the global riverine average suggesting that aluminosilicate weathering is present but much less important than carbonate weathering 4 evidence exists for both oxidative pyrite weathering and bog control over so4 concentrations in some rivers although attempts to discern these sources using δ34sso4 were inconclusive 5 trace element concentrations are in general low at or below what are considered as the global means 6 concentrations of dissolved major elements in the river shannon are more seasonably variable in the upper reaches of the river than in the lower reaches the large

8136,study region ireland study focus multiple studies have established that catchment geology and weathering regime strongly influence surface water chemistry and that geochemical cycling can vary due to seasonal climatic conditions however fewer studies have focused on the influence these controls in a holistic manner we relate the water chemistry of a country wide irish river survey to atmospheric input underlying geology and the influence of bogs climatic conditions were defined by an atypically wet winter and an unusually dry summer providing the opportunity to investigate river chemistry variation across hydrologic conditions sampling included 21 of ireland s 22 largest rivers ranked by discharge first order and second order streams draining bog lands a second order stream draining a limestone catchment and downstream transects along the river shannon all samples were analyzed for major elements selected trace elements and nutrients and a subset was analyzed for δ34sso4 new hydrological insights most catchments were dominated by carbonate weathering with little contribution from the weathering of aluminosilicates river water composition also varied geographically along the prevailing wind direction due to inputs from marine aerosols with additional weathering components important in some systems seasonal influences could be seen in the chemistry of the headwaters of the river shannon while the lower reaches of the river exhibited less variable behavior throughout seasonal changes likely due to the influence of lakes in the river shannon system keywords riverine geochemistry carbonate weathering marine aerosols irish rivers 1 introduction the study of river water chemistry has been a significant scientific undertaking since the development of geochemistry the reasons for doing such work are numerous and include to understand the sources of solutes to determine of the role that geochemical hydrological and biological processes play in controlling chemical concentrations in riverine systems to assess rates of chemical weathering and fluxes of chemicals from the land to the oceans to elucidate hydrological processes and to establish whether water is fit for human consumption to state just a few meybeck 2003 although initially most these studies were focused on major dissolved constituents and nutrients with the development of clean collection techniques and sensitive analytical methods analysis of trace elements and stable isotopes have been included in many of these investigations since the early 1980s dramatically increasing our overall knowledge of riverine geochemistry e g windom et al 1991 gaillardet et al 2014 however most of the research emphasis has been directed at the world s larger river systems e g stallard and edmond 1987 shiller 1997 gaillardet et al 1999 the analysis of one or only a few elements miller et al 2011 palmer and edmond 1993 or specific types of river systems such as small mountainous rivers gardner et al 2017 lyons et al 2005 there is an opportunity to focus specifically on geochemical controls on both large and small streams tied to geology seasonality atmospheric input and anthropogenic influences the bedrock and subsoil geology of any watershed exerts an important influence on the chemistry of the associated natural waters this has been demonstrated using both major cation and anion concentrations and molar ratios of river waters gaillardet et al 1999 meybeck 2003 for example waters draining limestone terrains have high total dissolved solids tds and are typically dominated by ca hco3 ions while those draining granitic and other felsic crystalline bedrock type have much lower tds and are usually na hco3 in character meybeck 2003 superimposed on the major element characteristics of rivers is the impact of anthropogenic activities on the nutrient and trace element concentrations be those from agricultural urban suburban or industrial sources gaillardet et al 2014 because there are very few pristine river systems remaining in the world today it is important to identify anthropogenic factors in addition to local geology and land use in order to understand riverine biogeochemistry berner and berner 2012 in addition climate and seasonality are important factors especially as manifested in vegetation type and fluvial hydrology a central issue that influences river chemistry in ireland is the occurrence and abundance of bog lands these are ombrotrophic peatlands fed solely by rainfall characterized by thick sequences of organic matter naturally decaying under anaerobic methanogenic conditions in general waters draining bogs are of low tds elevated dissolved organic matter dom and low ph proctor 2008 with major ion chemistry dominated by na and cl hannigan and kelly quinn 2014 in this paper we investigate the chemical composition of 21 of the 22 largest rivers by discharge on the island of ireland epa 2021 based on 109 grab samples appendix a fig 2 the rivers in this study are separated into five groups 1 first and second order streams draining lowland atlantic blanket bog lands streams draining connemara bogs n 10 2 one monolithologic second order stream draining limestone the caher river n 6 3 one catchment of mixed lithology of limestones granites metamorphic derived till and complex sequence of precambrian and lower paleozoic sediments main stem and tributaries of the river corrib n 14 4 four downstream transects along the longest river in ireland during contrasting seasons the river shannon n 38 and 5 the remaining largest rivers on the island other major irish rivers n 41 comparisons among these systems allow us to investigate the role of substrate geology and land use on stream chemistry in addition the river shannon was sampled during an unusually wet cold winter followed by an unusually hot dry spring and summer and again during a high discharge autumn event providing important insights into how the river biogeochemistry is affected by meteorological and hydrological changes within the watershed over a seasonal basis 2 study area 2 1 bedrock and quaternary geology bedrock geology was simplified into twelve categories to conduct a spatial analysis of bedrock within river catchments that includes the total bedrock area and the percent of that bedrock over the whole island elío et al 2017 fig 1 table 1 ireland is composed largely of precambrian and paleozoic sedimentary rocks that are covered in most locations by pleistocene glacial and holocene post glacial deposits holland and sanders 2009 although we do present data from watersheds containing late precambrian to early cambrian dalradian metamorphic rocks and from igneous intrusives the majority of the watersheds are dominated by the paleozoic sediments fig 1 fig 2 table 1 the detailed geology of ireland see holland and sanders 2009 will not be repeated here but instead we discuss the general importance of lithology as it relates directly to the riverine geochemistry throughout the text the quaternary geology from the southwest to the southeast of the island is a mixture of sandstone and shale derived till with a substantial area of granite derived till in the east these quaternary sediments also fall along the northern ireland ireland south border limestone derived till dominates the center of ireland with intermittent peat sandstone and shale derived tills also incorporated peatlands are most prevalent in northwest ireland fig 2 along with metamorphic derived till elío et al 2017 this simplification can be further defined by region although these are generalizations and in many areas bedrock is covered by holocene peat and the substrate is obscured detailed quaternary geology bedrock geology and groundwater aquifer maps can be viewed using the geological survey of ireland online tools gsi 2020 2 2 meteorological conditions 2018 2019 the long term annual rainfall averages 1981 2010 in ireland generally decrease from west to east with rainfall in the west averaging 1000 1400 mm rainfall in the east averaging 750 to 1000 mm and local mountainous regions in the west receiving 2000 mm met éireann 2020 december and january are generally the wettest months while the period of april through june is generally the driest ireland experienced an unusually cold and wet winter during 2017 18 total rainfall at the athenry synoptic station 53 421534 n 7 90756 w near galway for january 2018 was 173 2 mm compared to mean monthly january rainfall of 116 7 mm met éireann 2020 record wet weather continued during our march 2018 sampling campaign through april 2018 then in may the weather became warm sunny and dry and during our next sampling campaign in june rainfalls were as much as 67 below long term average across ireland met éireann 2020 drought conditions continued through august during our third sampling campaign river shannon discharge records at athlone station 26027 show the mean monthly discharge during our sampling campaigns were march 2018 108 m3 s 1 june 2018 21 m3 s 1 july august 2018 21 m3 s 1 october 2019 190 8 m3 s 1 opw 2020 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analyses we collected 109 water samples manually from ireland streams and rivers appendix a most of these samples were collected between 20 february 2018 and 6 march 2019 and an additional downstream transect of ten samples was collected from the river shannon during a particularly high discharge period on 5 6 october 2019 surface water samples were collected either by hand or with a high density polyethylene hdpe sampling device attached to a 1 m plastic staff new low density polyethylene ldpe bottles that had been pre cleaned with 18 2 mω deionized di water welch et al 2010 were rinsed 3 times with the bulk sample before collection then placed in a chilled cooler in the dark until filtration all samples were filtered within 20 h of collection and most were filtered within 11 h except those from the river bann 2 samples which were filtered within 3 days of collection samples were filtered into two aliquots through new 0 45 μm pore size whatman polypropylene membrane filters using polypropylene syringes one into a 30 ml ldpe bottle that had been rinsed with di water three times for anion and nutrient analysis and another 30 ml ldpe bottle that had been rinsed first with 10 hcl and then di water for major cation and selected trace element analyses the latter filtrate was acidified to 2 v v hno3 with optima grade hno3 and used for both major cation and trace element analyses in order to assess any possible contamination by our collection and filtration techniques blanks were created by processing di water following the same procedures as were samples within a week of collection and processing the samples were shipped back to the school of earth sciences at the ohio state university and kept in a dark refrigerator at 4 c until analyzed major cations na k ca mg were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes select trace elements ba rb sr u cu and mo were analyzed using inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry icp ms major anions f br cl so4 by ion chromatography and nutrients nh4 no2 no3 si po4 colorimetrically using a skalar nutrient auto analyzer system detailed analytical methods are described elsewhere gardner et al 2017 harmon et al 2016 olund et al 2018 welch et al 2010 the relative standard deviation rsd of replicate calibration standards analyzed every 5 10 samples and ranged 1 3 for major cations 2 4 for trace elements and 1 5 for major anions and nutrients calibrations were verified using the external standards as described in the above references and concentrations were never more than 5 different than accepted values and were usually within 2 3 with the exception of mg and ca during one day of analysis which were within 7 and 8 respectively in addition our lab has taken part in numerous u s geological survey inter laboratory calibrations and the accuracy of our so4 and cl measurements that were analyzed concurrently with the irish river waters samples were within 0 6 2 0 for so4 and 1 4 4 7 for cl of the accepted values field blanks were collected during each field campaign in which our di water was filtered and preserved in the same manner as the samples appendix a concentrations of the major cations and major anions were low to undetectable for all field blanks in two of the three blanks nh4 and no2 no3 concentrations were above the detection limit but low in concentration trace element concentrations were also below detection with the exception of cu in one blank measured at 7 5 nm this appears to be an isolated contamination issue and is lower than 85 of the measured samples alkalinity was calculated from the charge imbalance between major cations and anions and for the purpose of this study of well oxygenated river waters it was assumed to be carbonate alkalinity previous studies in our lab based on analysis of hundreds of stream water samples representing a wide range of compositions show the error associated with this method was typically within 5 of the alkalinity measured by titration welch et al 2010 however organic ions can make up a significant part of charge balances in waters draining peatlands in our samples draining the connemara bog systems n 10 9 of samples we expect this error to be larger we compared the calculated alkalinities to a compilation of alkalinity data from other studies collected over a period of decades under a variety of discharge conditions there is very good agreement between our calculated concentrations and previously published work on the same rivers fig s1 while we recognize the potential error associated with calculating carbonate alkalinity concentrations we do not examine small changes in alkalinity that would be smaller than potential errors total dissolved solids tds were calculated by summing all the dissolved species in mass units assuming bicarbonate represents all unmeasured negative charge twelve samples from a range of systems were processed for δ34s analysis by precipitating dissolved so4 2 as baso4 at ohio state university then analyzing for δ 34s at the university of tennessee knoxville using the techniques described by szynkiewicz et al 2015 the δ 34s of baso4 was measured using a costech elemental analyzer ea coupled with a delta plus xl irms with analytical precision better than 0 3 the data are reported with respect to vcdt vienna canyon diablo troilite 4 results the geochemical measurements from all 109 samples are tabulated with detailed sampling locations appendix a table 3 presents the mean concentrations of major minor and trace elements and nutrients in the sampled irish rivers data for world rivers european rivers termed unpolluted by berner and berner 2012 mace head sw irish coastal precipitation keene et al 2015 and irish bog waters gorham et al 1985 4 1 major and minor elements and ions total dissolved solids tds ranged from 34 to 631 mg l 1 with a mean of 260 148 mg l 1 three streams kylemore dawros and owenbanogue rivers and two unnamed streams draining connemara bog lands and underlain by crystalline rocks near n 10 have a median value of 52 mg l 1 reflecting the dearth of readily weatherable rocks in these catchments and the dilution by low tds bog waters the caher river to the south a second order stream draining a karstified limestone catchment in the burren region has a median tds of 279 mg l 1 while the other larger rivers throughout the country have a median value of 298 mg l 1 which is similar to other large european rivers draining mixed lithologies berner and berner 2012 the major cation concentrations of the rivers measured in this study are dominated by ca and na fig 3 large variations are observed for ca mean 1281 μm rsd 65 mg mean 188 μm rsd 64 and k mean 53 μm rsd 96 and lesser variations are observed for na mean 442 μm rsd 36 appendix a the major anions are dominated by alkalinity hco3 but some rivers primarily those influenced by bogs have higher relative concentrations of dissolved cl fig 3 the more coastal connemara samples have na ca mg k and cl hco3 so4 while all the other rivers are dominated by ca and hco3 table 3 the mean ca and hco3 concentrations excluding the ten samples collected from the connemara bogs are higher than both the european and world means the rivers are also elevated in na and cl compared to european and world means dissolved si concentrations are an order of magnitude lower than the world average of 370 μm table 3 ranging 2 148 μm with a mean of 38 μm the so4 concentrations in the rivers range widely from 16 to 385 μm with a mean and median of 86 μm and 68 μm respectively between the european and world means sulfate generally composes less than 10 of the total anion concentration of the irish river water samples the highest so4 values are measured in the northeast part of the island in the bann and boyle rivers with concentrations greater than 350 μm the mean concentration of dissolved f for the entire dataset is 3 3 μm much higher than the connemara and caher mean values and equal to the means of river shannon and other irish rivers table 3 the median br concentration for all rivers is 0 41 0 23 μm with the highest means from connemara bog streams and caher river system and the lowest in the river shannon 4 2 nutrients the no3 no2 concentrations of the full dataset range 0 1 396 μm with a mean of 54 71 μm appendix a the mean no3 no2 values for streams draining the connemara bogs the caher river the corrib tributaries and river shannon are similar 26 45 μm while the other major irish rivers are roughly two fold higher at 93 μm although all subsets of rivers have rsds of 100 these large variabilities suggest that some systems are probably affected by anthropogenic input of fixed nitrogen through pastureland agricultural activities which account for 54 of irish land cover lydon and smith 2014 table 3 ammonium concentrations are low with means less than 1 μm as are soluble reactive phosphate srp concentrations of the srp only six samples are above the detection limit of 0 1 μm similarly low srp values were measured in spring water discharge in county clare on the west coast suggesting sorption with carbonate minerals smith and cave 2012 previous work on nutrient concentrations in twelve of the major rivers that we also analyzed documented a relatively low mean srp between 0 24 and 1 87 μm and comparable no3 no2 concentrations with values as high as 324 μm and a mean of 156 μm mcgrath et al 2016 4 3 minor and trace elements minor and trace elements were measured on samples collected in 2018 only n 92 and mean concentrations are rb 16 nm sr 2870 nm ba 206 nm mo 4 nm cu 17 nm and u 2 9 nm appendix a as noted by gaillardet et al 2014 in their review of trace element concentrations in world rivers there are fewer minor and trace data available in the literature than for major elements and many of those data come from north america gaillardet et al 2014 provided mean dissolved estimates for rb 19 nm sr 684 nm ba 168 nm and cu 23 nm while estimates for u 0 78 nm and mo 8 nm are provided by palmer and edmond 1993 and miller et al 2011 respectively the irish river dataset values are slightly lower than the global mean for dissolved rb mo and cu higher in all five river groups for sr slightly higher for ba and u in the major rivers but lower in the low order coastal streams table 3 4 4 sulfur isotopes there was sufficient baso4 precipitate present to obtain precise and accurate analyses in only seven of the twelve samples the δ34sso4 of selected river water samples ranged from approximately 9 5 to 2 7 table 4 the δ34s values generally were higher for samples collected on the west side of the island and decreased with decreasing catchment peat content 5 discussion 5 1 sources of elements and chemical weathering 5 1 1 correlations of major ions as a first step to determine solute sources a pearson correlation matrix was developed to assess the relationships among dissolved constituents in all the irish rivers fig s2 the strongest positive correlations were found for tds ca tds hco3 and ca hco3 weaker positive correlations were observed for tds f tds mg hco3 f and hco3 mg there were also positive relationships between these pairs na k na cl k cl k so4 ca mg and so4 si no significant negative correlations were identified the interpretations of these relationships are straightforward in that the correlations observed among tds ca hco3 and mg represent their primary introduction to the irish waters through limestone weathering their correlations with f suggest a similar source the na cl and na k relationships are likely due to these elements primary introduction into the landscape from both wet and dry deposition of marine aerosol the strong positive relationships between so4 k and so4 si may imply the introduction of those constituents from sedimentary rock weathering particularly from pyrite oxidation as discussed in section 5 1 5 5 1 2 aerosols and atmospheric input ireland is the first major land mass encountered by prevailing westerly winds traveling over the atlantic ocean and the precipitation chemistry at mace head southwest coastal reflects that long traveled path over the ocean prior to reaching ireland table 3 this precipitation has low ph 4 9 and ca concentrations keene et al 2015 this indicates that at least in the streams on the west coast the dissolved ca is derived primarily from chemical weathering the streams draining connemara bogs on the west coast are also dominated by deposition influenced by marine aerosols but have higher ca mg and k values than the mace head precipitation indicating some water rock interaction has occurred these are common observations across the rivers in ireland where a percentage of solutes is derived from precipitation but chemical weathering is the primary source for many chemical constituents lyons et al 2020 other solutes such as so4 may have natural or anthropogenic aerosol sources aherne et al 2002 with additional influence of rocks soils and sediment sources such as the oxidative weathering of reduced sulfides burke et al 2018 and dissolution of sulfate phases in some areas west et al 1968 as in many other countries waters in ireland have been monitored for changes in so4 concentrations to assess the environmental policies enacted in the early 1980s to combat acid precipitation between 1997 and 2007 atmospheric emissions of so2 decreased 63 and non marine so4 deposition decreased 36 while lake water so4 concentrations decreased by 9 and non marine so4 decreased by 58 burton and aherne 2012 despite a decrease in the use of solid fuels such as coal and peat the atmospheric input of so2 has not been eliminated at least on a local scale goodman et al 2009 lin et al 2018 2012 short term hours to days relatively high concentration 10 15 μg s m 3 events still occur in urban areas such as dublin lin et al 2018 though dublin is probably anomalous compared to the country as a whole as it is the most urbanized region of the country wind direction plays a major role in the so4 present in precipitation onshore westerlies from the atlantic contain the highest total so4 concentrations with a weighted mean concentration near 30 μm while winds from the east carry the highest fraction of non sea salt so4 associated with source in ireland and europe bashir et al 2008 however even at the mace head sampling location on the west coast where the deposition chemistry has a strong marine component pollution from europe can contribute to the precipitation chemistry in ireland at some times of the year huang et al 2001 those easterly winds however are usually associated with high pressure systems that produce little precipitation keene et al 2015 the mean so4 concentration of 9 4 μm in rainwater at mace head has an rsd of 71 5 keene et al 2015 indicating the high variability of this constituent nonetheless there is a decrease in the cl so4 molar ratio of the precipitation from west to east across the island with a decrease in the marine aerosol component aherne et al 2002 aherne and farrell 2002 bashir et al 2008 and comparable trends are observable in the river chemistry fig 4 for reference the global mean cl so4 ratio for natural rivers as termed by berner and berner 2012 is assumed to be 2 this low global average is similar to the mean for anthropogenically affected rivers of 1 3 2 but the absolute so4 concentrations are 120 188 μm in anthropogenically affected rivers compared to a mean of 86 μm for pristine rivers berner and berner 2012 the cl so4 ratios vary substantially in the rivers shown in fig 4 with a high of 27 greater than the seawater ratio of 19 from the river caher in the west to a low of 2 in the upper reaches of the river shannon and in rivers draining the northeastern part of ireland the connemara bog streams and the caher river in the burren which drain mostly bog lands in the west have mean cl so4 molar ratios of 11 2 and 9 8 respectively they reflect the importance of marine aerosol deposition just inland from the ocean as the ratios are very similar to mace head precipitation value of 10 3 keene et al 2015 but slightly higher than previously measured bog water values novák et al 2005a 2005b the cl so4 of rivers draining other catchments along the west coast rivers foyle erne owenmore moy feale fergus laune and maigue have a slightly lower mean ratio of 8 2 however individual rivers have cl so4 that vary by as much as a factor of four with higher ratios in samples collected during the wetter march and may 2018 months compared to those samples from august 2018 east coast rivers have lower cl so4 ratios with mean values of 3 2 in both the northeast bann boyne liffey slaney and southeast barrow nore suir lee blackwater and bandon with little change in the ratios observed between spring and summer sampling the length of the river shannon was sampled four times during the study in march june and august of 2018 and in october of 2019 the cl so4 ratios in the upper reaches of the river shannon vary considerably reflecting some of the lowest values in this study with values of 1 3 1 8 measured at dowra however for most of the length of the river shannon the cl so4 ratios remain relatively constant with a mean of 6 7 fig 4 the overall decrease in cl so4 from the west to the east along the prevailing wind direction suggests that input from marine aerosols is a contributor to these solutes in river waters however the variation in this ratio and the elevated so4 concentrations in some of these rivers suggest additional in situ sources which are discussed further in section 5 1 5 precipitation and dry deposition are also major sources of br and f and these largely reflect the composition of marine aerosols neal et al 2007 tagami and uchida 2006 however weathering of f bearing minerals particularly apatite fluorite and biotite from rocks and soils can be a significant source of f in river waters berger et al 2016 fuge 2019 bromide can be incorporated into organic matter in soils especially peat hughes et al 1998 the f cl and br cl ratios from irish stream and river samples are compared to seawater ratios representing the marine aerosol source approaching ireland from the wsw all but six river samples show enrichment of f and depletion of br relative to cl when compared to seawater fig 5 if we assume that cl is conservative these data strongly suggest that dissolved f is coming not only from precipitation but also from the dissolution of f rich minerals in the soils and bedrock rock salt is sometimes applied to roads in ireland in the winter months another possible cl source the molar ratio of f to ca is approximately 1 500 fig s3 which is close to an estimated value of 1 400 500 for marine carbonates chester 2003 fuge 2019 suggesting a similar source a possible explanation for relatively low concentrations of br could be loss from the initial precipitation input due to incorporation into organic matter within the soil profile especially in bogs neal et al 2007 four samples collected from uppermost river shannon sampling locations during october 2019 exhibit roughly the same br cl ratio as seawater confirming the precipitation aerosol source during a high flow event in which water moved through the system quickly with little time for soil water interaction 5 1 3 carbonate weathering the concentrations and sources of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and bicarbonate carbonate ions to river systems can help elucidate landscape denudation processes watershed and riverine ecological dynamics and anthropogenic activities lyons et al 2020 raymond and hamilton 2018 urban runoff over impervious surfaces and agricultural processes i e liming can greatly affect the overall carbonate system in rivers kaushal et al 2017 though spatial variation in the bicarbonate distribution in river waters is thought to be controlled primarily by chemical weathering of limestone and dolomite within catchments lauerwald et al 2013 previous work on the geochemistry of estuarine systems in ireland attributed the high dic concentrations to carbonate rock weathering especially in the shannon liffey and barrow nore suir systems mcgrath et al 2016 the rivers in our study with the exception of the streams draining bogs are primarily ca hco3 waters see section 4 1 the highest calculated bicarbonate concentrations are observed in rivers associated with watersheds that are at least partially composed of limestones the catchments that have been termed non limestone by mcgrath et al 2016 such as the blackwater foyle lee and slaney all have lower hco3 values than the watersheds containing limestone fig 6 dissolved ca and hco3 show a strong relationship demonstrating a 1 2 m stoichiometry providing further evidence for limestone weathering fig 6 eq 1 1 caco3 h2co3 ca 2hco3 the points falling farthest above this 1 2 line are from rivers such as the barrow nore suir and bann the same rivers containing high mg concentrations relative to ca fig 7 although dissolved mg is strongly associated with dissolved ca from limestone weathering not all the mg can be accounted for from this source there is a positive relationship between mg and ca in most rivers of approximately 1 10 mg ca ratio fig 7 groundwaters in pure limestone lithologies i e limestones and dolomitized limestones and impure limestone lithologies i e mixed limestones sandstones shales described by tedd et al 2017 also both have a median mg ca ratio of around 1 10 some rivers plot far above the 1 10 mg ca line in fig 7 including the bann boyne suir barrow nore and maigue all of which drain the midland eastern portion of the island and have a high percentage of carbonates in their catchments while the groundwaters associated with dolomitized limestones have elevated mg ca ratios tedd et al 2017 they are still substantially lower than the rivers listed above these rivers with high mg ca ratios also drain mafic igneous intrusives and volcanics that are uncommon elsewhere on the island weathering of these more mg rich rocks may also contribute disproportionately to the tds an additional source of non limestone mg to the midland eastern rivers could be both crystalline igneous and detrital sedimentary rocks fig 8 fig 1 table 1 it has been demonstrated by others that even in catchments that are underlain by crystalline rocks which contain very low amounts of disseminated calcite 1 riverine dissolved ca is still primarily from caco3 dissolution jacobson and blum 2003 jin et al 2008 lyons et al 2005 irish soils including those in non limestone regions have concentrations of total ca reported as cao weight ranging between 0 01 and 2 1 de vos and tarvainen 2006 reimann et al 2012 these surficial materials produced from previous glacial activities and deposition could also be a source of ca and hco3 to irish waters although the abundance of readily dissolvable caco3 is the major control on the distribution of ca and hco3 in irish rivers and streams there are other lithologic sources the relationship between dissolved ca and sr suggests a mix between the dissolution of carbonate and the weathering of crystalline rocks fig 9 three of the low order caher river samples draining only viséan aged limestone fall along either side of the carbonate monolithic catchments described by meybeck 1986 suggesting these ca sr ratios can have considerable variability the connemara streams flowing through watersheds dominated by the occurrence of bogs fall along the crystalline rock end member trends though evaporitic facies are uncommon in ireland headwater samples from the river shannon at shannon pot and dowra may represent an enrichment of sr relative to ca sourced from the dissolution of gypsum from evaporitic beds alternating with shales and limestones observed by west et al 1968 these authors attribute blocks of gypsum observed on the shore of lough allen between dowra and drumshanbo as sourced from these beds fig 2 increased so4 from these same sample sites in the upper reaches of the shannon could be coming from the oxidation of reduced sulfur phases in peatland or shales the combination of higher so4 concentrations and lower ca sr ratios may be better explained by the dissolution of other ca and so4 rich sources such as the gypsum described by west et al 1968 many of the minor and trace elements measured in this study can be attributed to carbonate weathering little published data exist for trace metals in irish surface waters but previous work on the river corrib and its four tributaries o connor 2003 which we sampled shows mean dissolved ba 184 440 nm and sr 332 4780 nm concentrations that were within our reported range the irish geological survey also recently published the tellus geochemical survey with trace element data including ba 2 2 5000 nm and u bdl 60 7 nm in stream water from the border and west of ireland knights 2020 the correlation matrix of minor and trace elements fig s4 indicates that ba is positively correlated to both ca and sr but it is less strongly correlated with so4 across the entire dataset rivers draining limestone catchments are associated with both low ca ba ratios river shannon system mean 5 103 and high ca ba ratios caher river mean 100 103 karst waters in county clare have higher sr ba values than waters draining clastic rocks gill et al 2018 also suggesting that although ba may in part be associated with caco3 rich lithologies the highest ba concentrations are sourced from other minerals the highest ba concentrations in our dataset are from the central and eastern region of the country including the eastern shannon tributaries and the rivers boyne suir noir and barrow the same rivers with elevated mg concentrations all of which drain a mixed lithology of limestones and shales but also contain igneous intrusives and ordovician volcanics barite baso4 could be associated with the detrital sedimentary rocks predominately shale in some of the watersheds but no compelling correlation exists between ba and so4 in these central eastern river systems with elevated ba and mg barium is also commonly associated with clays in shales as an interlayer cation that can be readily solubilized during weathering renock et al 2016 uranium is most strongly associated with dissolved ca and these two elements exhibit a robust positive linear relationship except for three outliers fig 10 of the three high values two are from the river barrow and the third is from the slaney and may be derived from the weathering of granitic rocks in the wicklow mountains in the northeast and northern portions of the respective catchments fig 1 recent work in smaller river systems of the world has also pointed to the association of dissolved u with carbonate rich landscapes gardner et al 2017 in addition karst water in western ireland has higher concentrations of u than nearby waters draining detrital sedimentary rocks gill et al 2018 5 1 4 aluminosilicate weathering as noted above the si concentrations in irish surface waters are lower than global means and in general the chemical weathering regime on the island is dominated by carbonate rock dissolution however the presence of dissolved si indicates that aluminosilicate weathering does occur and we examine the significance of this process through using three methods 1 a comparison to end member lithologies based on work by gaillardet et al 1999 2 a thermodynamic approach and 3 an examination of non sea salt alkali metals most of the irish waters reflect a mix of carbonate dissolution and an evaporite signature fig 11 which with the previously noted rare exception of the headwaters of the shannon suggests the concentration of marine aerosols result from precipitation input not from evaporite rock dissolution the cl so4 ratios also support this hypothesis table 4 of the eight connemara bog stream samples from along the coast three fall within the evaporite marine aerosol end member as do the rivers bealnabrack and owenriff both of which flow into lough corrib within the corrib catchment these differences reflect at least in part differences in catchment lithologies and the abundance of readily weatherable material the agricultural soils of ireland are intermediately to highly weathered with chemical index of alteration cia ranging 60 92 with the soils in the eastern and southern regions of the country having higher weathering indices than soils from the north and west négrel et al 2015 these high cias suggest that at least in the agricultural areas the soils have undergone intensive weathering and the more dissolvable material has already been lost nesbitt and young 1982 this is especially important in the soils dominated by granite and sandstone derived tills even though the production of dissolved si indicates that chemical weathering of si rich rocks is taking place the relatively low concentrations measured in these streams suggest the intensity of the weathering process is low all but four samples have si concentrations less than 100 μm roughly half that of quartz solubility with the majority ranging between 10 and 60 μm and twenty seven samples have concentrations less than 20 μm fig s5 these very low values suggest that soils may be unstable with respect to secondary clay minerals while the higher values suggest waters are in the stability field of kaolinite stallard and edmond 1987 in both cases from a thermodynamic approach at least these waters are representative of an aluminosilicate domain that has been highly depleted in primary minerals and alkali cations and are replaced by more insoluble weathering products such as clay minerals faure 1998 finally the relationship between si concentrations and alkali metals is shown by correction of precipitation input by subtraction of cl from na k fig 12 in the majority of rivers the na and k can be accounted for by precipitation input as 72 samples have cl corrected alkali metal concentrations less than zero more intense weathering of primary cation rich minerals plot farther to the right stallard and edmond 1987 zhang et al 2019 including only 37 samples all three of the above approaches support the notion that although the dissolved si observed in these waters does represent input from the weathering of aluminosilicate minerals this form of weathering is minor and the majority of most readily weatherable material has been already removed 5 1 5 the influence of bogs and sulfide weathering in addition to the marine and fossil fuel derived aerosol sources of so4 discussed in section 5 1 2 there are other potential in situ sources of so4 to the rivers of ireland while fertilizer and agricultural return waters have been shown to add to the so4 loads of rivers and streams in other locations e g szynkiewicz et al 2011 2015 these sources have not been identified as significant contributors in ireland bog soils have been established as important components in s biogeochemical dynamics in catchments where extensive bog land exists novák et al 2005b 2005a 2001 1994 skrzypek et al 2010 burton and aherne 2012 noted that catchment soils in ireland have the ability to retain so4 while cl passes through the system thereby both removing so4 either by microbial reduction or by adsorption onto organic matter and changing the s isotopic value sulfur fixed in bogs is both inorganic i e iron sulfide minerals and organic associated with the latter being more abundant novák et al 1999 european bog sedimentary δ34s values range widely in the top 40 cm of depth from 15 to 4 similar to the range across our seven samples table 4 bog substrate dating strongly suggested that s is mobile in these environments novák et al 2005b and subsequent work has clearly demonstrated that fluctuations of the water table aid in s mobility daniels et al 2008 have shown that at lower water levels previously reduced s is oxidized to form dissolved so4 that is then flushed from the bogs into surface water runoff during storms and gully erosion events thus bog land can be a major contributor of so4 to rivers and streams with more depleted δ34s of so4 values the δ34s of so4 values are generally higher on the west coast and decrease eastward but also generally decrease with lower fractions of catchment peatland though neither of these is a statistically robust relationship fig 2 table 4 also summarized in table 4 are possible sources that were used as end members for our analysis the most negative δ34s values identified originate from the oxidation of biogenically reduced s that has formed pyrite burke et al 2018 karim and veizer 2000 torres et al 2014 and pyrite from black shales in western ireland in the clare basin ranged from 35 5 to 8 2 armstrong et al 2019 mean flux weighted bulk precipitation measured at connemara bog was the most positive at 17 8 close to the seawater value of 21 novák et al 2005a globally the oxidative weathering of pyrite owp is now recognized to be a much more significant source of so4 to natural waters than previously thought approximately 43 of the total riverine dissolved so4 is estimated to be from this source yielding a mean global δ34s value of 4 9 for unpolluted rivers burke et al 2018 we interpret at least some of the so4 present in the rivers with higher so4 sr ratios and more negative δ34s values to be from owp large rivers with elevated so4 sr relative to the overall dataset 100 include the rivers bann bandon laune lee and feale along with the smaller annascaul and all drain at least some clastic sedimentary terrain as such the bann has the third lowest δ34s values measured 1 2 however there is little evidence to argue that owp is the only source of this isotopically depleted s as the farther inland bog sequestered so4 could have a much more negative δ34s value novák et al 2001 in addition if the oxidation of the reduced s in the bog soils occurs through microbial processes pellerin et al 2019 the so4 that is transported from the bog sediments into rivers could have a very different isotopic signal than either what was initially deposited in the bog or what was converted via reduction processes given the dearth of s isotope data we cannot firmly state whether this so4 depleted in 34s is from the more traditional owp as described by burke et al 2018 or from similar oxidation processes occurring in the bog lands one additional piece of evidence suggesting owp occurs in some rivers is potentially increased weathering reactions the acidity generated from the owp has the potential to increase mineral weathering rates greatly and to affect the stoichiometry of the mineral weathering reaction because it can solubilize cations from rocks and minerals these reactions would result in a deficit of carbonate alkalinity in waters because the acidity is from so4 and not co2 of the 109 river samples 17 have so4 concentrations of more than 10 of their hco3 concentration fig 13 these include eight from connemara four from the upper river shannon drainage two from the river bandon one from the annascaul and one each from the river feale and the river bann many of the same rivers discussed above with elevated so4 sr ratios these 17 rivers including the five formerly mentioned have ca mg concentrations that cannot be accounted for by carbonate mineral dissolution alone based on the stoichiometry for co2 promoted dissolution of ca mg carbonates i e molar ca mg hco3 0 5 this suggests either owp or sox gases are promoting the weathering of limestone is contributing to the solute flux as previously noted gypsum occurrence is rare some trace element associations also suggest either enhanced weathering caused by owp or direct sources from sulfide minerals rubidium which is highly elevated in shales compared to carbonates and other lithologies horstman 1957 exhibits the strongest linear relationship with so4 followed by cl indicating a putative shale weathering source fig s3 in an analysis of 273 water samples from around the world miller et al 2011 found that dissolved mo concentrations are highly correlated with so4 and controlled in great part by pyrite oxidation in a similar analysis of small mountainous rivers gardner et al 2017 found a similar relationship but the mo so4 correlation observed is biased towards samples with very high mo and so4 concentrations and no relationship is apparent after hydrothermally influenced waters are removed we found a similar pattern in ireland rivers while the highest mo concentrations are associated with the highest so4 concentrations no correlation is apparent across the dataset or within our river groupings when those outliers are removed the highest dissolved mo concentrations were observed in rivers bann barrow and boyne with the bann and boyne also having very high so4 concentrations likewise there is much scatter in the cu data but the highest cu concentrations are associated with high so4 concentrations the connemara and caher low order streams and most of the corrib samples have lower cu concentrations while the shannon and its tributaries fall in an almost crescent shaped pattern the bann sample collected at portadown north ireland and the fergus sample collected at ennis ireland are very high in cu and may represent the impact of some anthropogenic influence we cannot definitively say whether so4 is sourced from owp or bog sequestered so4 but it is an important difference as many of the peatlands of northern europe especially in ireland have been drying in the second half of the 20th century swindles et al 2019 future climate scenarios for ireland suggest decreased summer precipitation and increased temperatures along with increased winter precipitation steele dunne et al 2008 greater winter precipitation could increase the percentage of seasonally deposited reduced s in the bogs in the winter and increase the flux as so4 into surface waters in the summer thus decreasing the role of landscape sequestration of s and leading to higher concentrations of so4 in surface waters 5 2 seasonality variation in river shannon geochemistry march 2018 october 2019 the river shannon is the longest river with the greatest average flow on the island of ireland with a catchment area of 18 000 km2 1 5th of ireland s land area and mean annual discharge of 6 59 109 m3 a 1 at athlone station table 2 three large lakes lough allen lough ree and lough derg interrupt the flow of the river shannon fig 2 land use in the catchment during the 2000s was 1 2 urban 9 2 arable 65 7 pasture and 10 8 wetland i e primarily bog with human population density of 34 people km 2 tockner et al 2009 it is the largest river in ireland and is used as a drinking water utility and recreational resource the length of the river was sampled twice during low flow baseflow regimes june 2018 n 9 and august 2018 n 10 and twice during high stage event flows march 2018 n 7 and october 2019 n 10 to discern differences in water chemistry in high and low flows the sampling dates encompassed the coldest and wettest winters and the warmest and driest springs and early summers experienced in ireland over the previous 70 75 years the downstream profiles of dissolved ca si no3 so4 and ca si ratios in the river shannon from the furthest upstream sample at shannon pot downstream to ballina are compared in fig 14 calcium concentrations exhibit a downstream increase after decreasing slightly from the river s origin at shannon pot to drumshanbo in march august and june ca concentrations increase downstream with little difference among the transects below carrick on shannon but during the highest discharge period in october ca concentrations were 25 lower at the downstream locations thus from lanesborough south there was no reflection of the temporal meteorology on the ca concentrations except during the highest flow event in october 2019 however the ca si ratio is higher during baseflow in august and june than in march and october during high discharge the large increases in ca along the length of the river reflect the changing lithologies within the sub catchments from a mix of carbonate and detrital sedimentary rock in the north to those dominated by carbonates after carrick on shannon the input from the ca rich rivers inny suck and brosna all of which drain the large area of midland limestones served to increase the ca values between carrick on shannon and banagher in addition there is little to no intensive peat extraction around shannon pot but through the midlands are some of the largest peat mines in western europe silica concentrations at the upstream sites exhibited the opposite behavior as ca increasing slightly at dowra during baseflow and decreasing again at drumshanbo and remaining relatively constant at higher discharge in march and october si concentrations generally increased and were roughly two fold higher in march and october than during baseflow these higher si concentrations are the primary control over the lower ca si ratios during high flow the lesser increases in si downstream in march and october below lanesborough also reflect the significance of the inny and the suck which have concentrations much higher than the shannon at lanesborough 73 and 59 vs 36 μm respectively at the most downstream point ballina the river shannon represents a mixing of water from tributaries so that the ca si ratios remain fairly constant throughout the seasons though still higher at low flows perhaps demonstrating the importance of the overall volume differences between the tributary inflow and the volume of the lakes at baseflow in august and june the so4 concentrations spiked upstream at dowra then decreased and remained relatively constant to increasing slightly downstream the higher concentrations of so4 in the headwaters likely reflect weathering input from shales the dowra site was not sampled in march but the so4 concentration was lower at carrick on shannon and was similar at the downstream stations except that the peak occurred at banagher at high discharge in october the upstream peak occurred at drumshanbo followed by a large increase in concentration to a peak downstream at banagher of 199 μm the high so4 concentrations at banagher in october were influenced by the suck and big brosna tributaries which drain subcatchments with 20 and 15 bog land respectively fig 2 fig 14 reduced sulfur is oxidized to so4 in bogs when the water table is low in summer months which is then flushed out as a result of water pulses through the system in early autumn daniels et al 2008 explaining why banagher exhibited elevated so4 concentrations in october increased so4 concentration is notable specifically at the banagher sampling location because the suck and big brosna subwatersheds account for only 11 7 of the shannon catchment but 26 4 of the total bog land at baseflow in august and june the no3 concentrations generally increased downstream reaching a value of 55 μm at ballina the march profile was similar in shape but roughly two fold higher in concentration at all sampling locations while the october no3 concentrations were roughly constant around 10 μm until a roughly 3 fold increase at banagher and portumna downstream the downstream increases in no3 are probably related to increased agricultural activities and peat extraction in the catchment and sub catchments with the higher concentrations of no3 observed during the spring indicating the importance of rainfall and runoff for no3 input given the data at these sampling locations it is difficult to assess if the lakes have any impact on the overall biogeochemistry of the river although one could invoke the decline in si between dowra and drumshanbo as due to biological input in lough allen there is no other indication of this process in loughs ree and derg nor is there any clear removal of no3 6 conclusions during 2018 2019 we collected and analyzed 109 samples of river and stream water from ireland for their major minor and selected trace elements the major conclusions of this work are 1 the influence of marine aerosols on river chemistry decreases from west to east 2 the majority of river water is ca hco3 water reflecting the overall importance of carbonate mineral weathering in most irish catchments 3 the si concentrations are low compared to the global riverine average suggesting that aluminosilicate weathering is present but much less important than carbonate weathering 4 evidence exists for both oxidative pyrite weathering and bog control over so4 concentrations in some rivers although attempts to discern these sources using δ34sso4 were inconclusive 5 trace element concentrations are in general low at or below what are considered as the global means 6 concentrations of dissolved major elements in the river shannon are more seasonably variable in the upper reaches of the river than in the lower reaches the large

established as δ2h 8 83 0 18 δ18o 12 77 0 86 r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 186 a total of seven moisture sub sources contributing to precipitation were identified using the hysplit model among which distinct differences in isotopic signatures were revealed the seasonal isotopic variation of precipitation in the study area was found not to respond to local meteorological factors an increase in the relative occurrence frequency and relative contribution to precipitation of the continental source was found from summer to winter which explains the seasonal variation in precipitation δ18o and d excess combining the results of back trajectory analysis and isotopic statistics for the sub source classification the seasonal evolution of precipitation isotopes is considered to be caused by variations in the contribution from various moisture sources with distinct isotopic characteristics which are further controlled by monsoon activities this study highlights the importance of regional scale moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation for the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the poyang lake wetland keywords precipitation isotopes moisture source identification seasonal variation d excess poyang lake wetland 1 introduction precipitation is a major input of the terrestrial hydrological cycle and consists of various regional and local contributions including both moisture transported over long distances and that provided by local evapotranspiration dos santos et al 2019 le duy et al 2018 tang et al 2017 a better understanding of precipitation sources and the relative contribution of each component is important in ecohydrological studies of wetlands due to the central role of precipitation in maintaining water tables and ecosystem stability stable isotopes can provide critical information to identify the precipitation source regions and have been used to investigate atmospheric circulation at various scales araguás araguás et al 1998 breitenbach et al 2010 sánchez murillo et al 2016 the response of the precipitation isotopic composition to long term fluctuations of key climatic parameters has also been discussed in paleoclimate reconstructions rozanski et al 1997 vodila et al 2011 furthermore stable isotopic signatures in precipitation can be applied to reveal hydrological processes such as soil moisture eco hydrological dynamics oerter and bowen 2017 hydrological connectivity assessment of wetlands ala aho et al 2018 and mean residence time estimation of rivers ogrinc et al 2018 numerous studies have demonstrated that the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation can reflect the moisture source seasonality determined by the difference of the initial evaporation condition and isotopic evolution of subsequent rain out processes during moisture transport alexander et al 2015 breitenbach et al 2010 sodemann et al 2008 information on precipitation isotope variability is crucial for the study of hydrological cycles especially in the identification of hydrological behavior in complex hydrogeological systems rusjan et al 2019 the seasonality of precipitation isotopes can provide insights into seasonal streamflow generation processes kumar et al 2020 leuthold et al 2021 and can be applied to explore water transfer in the soil plant atmosphere continuum dai et al 2020 understanding the seasonality of modern precipitation isotopic signatures has become an important prerequisite for systematic analyses on regional hydrological processes and investigations of environmental change sun et al 2020 moreover clarifying the relationship between precipitation isotopic composition and moisture source regions can improve understanding of the wetland hydrological cycle as the atmospheric part of the land atmosphere interactions and contributes to discussions on the response of precipitation to the current climate regime under the influence of climate change therefore investigating climatic influences on the precipitation isotopic composition and the mechanism underlying the seasonal isotope variation is of great significance over the past decades much effort has been made to understand the meteorological influence on precipitation isotopes chidambaram et al 2009 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1992 uchiyama et al 2017 and the temperature effect and amount effect have been established to explain the relationships with meteorological factors the physical mechanism of these effects is the fractionation during moisture transport condensation and the sub cloud thermodynamics of raindrops however these empirical conclusions are geographically limited as studies have indicated that precipitation isotopes in tropical climates are less dependent on local meteorological parameters breitenbach et al 2010 sánchez murillo et al 2016 in effect the factors influencing the variation of precipitation isotopes are diverse and complex involving a series of processes at various scales and differences remain among different regions in what factor mainly controls the stable isotopic composition of precipitation recent studies have demonstrated that the isotopic composition of precipitation appears to be controlled by the dynamical nature of the moisture rather than the individual precipitation events linked to monsoon intraseasonal variability chakraborty et al 2016 tang et al 2015 the influence of changes in moisture sources on precipitation isotope variability in the monsoon regions has been studied widely and results indicate that atmospheric circulation dominates at both seasonal and interannual timescales based on the identification of moisture source regions for precipitation using backward trajectory modelling le duy et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the role of regional atmospheric circulation driving the precipitation isotopic values has also been emphasized evidenced by the good correlation between the local precipitation isotopic composition and regional integrated convective activity nlend et al 2020 rahul et al 2016 wang et al 2021 many additional factors responsible for the variation of precipitation isotopes have also been extensively examined for example different types of cloud e g convective stratiform and frontal can cause precipitation isotopes to exhibit distinctive characteristics aggarwal et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2018 and changes in the moisture fractions due to the moisture recycling from evapotranspiration during advection can modify the precipitation isotopic composition peng et al 2011 poyang lake located on the middle and lower yangtze river is the largest freshwater lake in china and has a climate influenced by the east asian monsoon system it is a wetland of international importance and home to many endangered and rare animal species such as the siberian crane oriental storks and freshwater porpoise liao et al 2020 the lake is mainly replenished by five tributaries in the basin raohe xinjiang fuhe ganjiang and xiushui rivers and the precipitation affects the temporal and spatial distribution of water availability in the region wei et al 2016 due to intensive human activities and climate change in recent decades the lake appears to be shrinking causing its flood storage capacity to diminish zhang et al 2014 poyang lake has also recently suffered from prolonged droughts and wetland degradation ye et al 2013 due to the important role of poyang lake in ecological environmental and biodiversity conservation in the yangtze river basin considerable attention has been paid to the sustainable use of water resources and the safety of the entire ecosystem mao et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 many studies have reported the isotopic signatures of interactions between different water components e g precipitation surface water groundwater soil water and plant water to evaluate the impact of human induced hydrology and climate change on the regional ecohydrological regime of poyang lake hu et al 2013 liao et al 2020 zhan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation is an important reference for comparison in these studies however the main influence of the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in poyang lake is still unclear in particular the complex effects of different moisture sources and atmospheric circulation on precipitation isotopes remain largely unstudied representing the atmospheric part of land atmosphere interactions for this region moreover the wetland ecosystem of poyang lake is an area that is sensitive to climate change and the relative contributions of various moisture sources to wetland precipitation a neglected perspective of wetland conservation and restoration also need to be explored in this study a total of 186 daily precipitation samples were collected between october 2015 and september 2019 in the poyang lake national nature reserve the objectives of this study are 1 to elucidate the basic characteristics and seasonal variations of precipitation isotopes in the poyang lake wetland 2 identify the different moisture sources of precipitation and investigate the difference in isotopic signatures among them and 3 further understand how the moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation influence the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation the moisture source identification can be applied to determine the contributions of different source regions to precipitation and to provide a new perspective for contemporary water resource management and associated sustainability challenges the precipitation isotopic signatures of the long term monitoring summarized here also enable a better isotopic simulation in ecohydrological studies that depend on the periodicity of precipitation isotopes in the poyang lake wetland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake located in the center of southeast china is the major tributary of the yangtze river and covers a surface area ranging from 907 to 3752 km2 gu et al 2019 ye et al 2013 poyang lake contains two national nature reserves the poyang lake national nature reserve and the nanjishan wetland national nature reserve and the former was selected as our study area the poyang lake national nature reserve 115 52 116 08 e and 29 02 29 18 n is located in the northwest region of poyang lake fig 1 where the northern branch of ganjiang river intersects with xiushui river zhang et al 2017 the reserve has a subtropical humid monsoon climate the annual average air temperature 1965 2018 is 17 4 the annual average precipitation 1965 2018 is 1511 mm which is slightly lower than that of the whole poyang lake basin wu et al 2021 ye et al 2013 the precipitation distribution is uneven throughout the year with the rainy season april to september accounting for 68 of the annual precipitation mao et al 2021 the reserve is characterized by a typical wetland ecosystem performing significant hydrological and ecological functions for flood control maintenance of biodiversity and regulation of the regional climate zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2 2 stable isotope and meteorological data the sampling site was set at wucheng town 116 00 32 e 29 11 13 n fig 1 in the center of the poyang lake national nature reserve a total of 186 daily precipitation samples were collected using a rainwater collector set in an open area and approximately 0 9 m above the ground between october 2015 and september 2019 each precipitation sample was transferred to a 100 ml polyethylene bottle tightened with a cap and the air bubbles were removed to avoid isotopic fractionation the samples were filtered using 0 22 μm polyether sulfone filters in the laboratory and stored in 2 ml glass vials at 4 until analysis the stable isotopic composition of the precipitation samples was analyzed using a mat253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with an elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientific bremen germany at the state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science wuhan university wuhan china all the results are expressed in the delta notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water the analytical uncertainty of the isotope analyses based on a long term analysis of the internal laboratory standard was less than 2 and 0 2 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the average daily total precipitation amount p and average daily air temperature t for the whole nature reserve were obtained based on the 0 5 0 5 grid daily surface precipitation and air temperature datasets in china from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn because not all precipitation events were successfully collected during the observation period a comparison was made between the amount weighted monthly mean δ18o values of precipitation in the study area and those from nearby global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip wuhan and changsha stations to establish the representativeness of our data the results showed that the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the study area was similar to that at the two adjacent gnip stations this suggests that missing data did not cause significant biases and our data have captured the full picture of the precipitation isotopic composition and its seasonal variation in the study area the detailed description and results of the comparison are provided in the supplementary information in text s1 and fig s1 2 3 hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model to identify and distinguish the probable source regions of the air masses responsible for the precipitation air mass back trajectory analysis was carried out using the hysplit backward trajectory model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration at the air resources laboratory draxler and hess 1998 stein et al 2015 the model employs a three dimensional lagrangian air mass vertical velocity algorithm to compute the movement of the air masses soderberg et al 2013 based on the gdas1 data global data assimilation system 1 1 2005 present available at ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 an end height of 1500 m above the ground at the precipitation sampling site was set for the backward trajectory model the height at which the precipitation is most likely to originate corresponding to the barometric surface of approximately 850 hpa dos santos et al 2019 le duy et al 2018 wei et al 2018 in previous studies different backtracking durations have been used for different reasons dos santos et al 2019 kirkels et al 2020 sánchez murillo et al 2016 following testing we selected the widely used 120 h back trajectory analysis as the one able to clearly distinguish the oceanic source from the continental source for the study area due to the relative proximity to the ocean at the regional scale the 120 h backtracking duration was sufficient to clearly identify the differences in the orientation among the different air mass back trajectories the 120 h back trajectory analysis was conducted every 6 h from 1 october 2015 to 30 september 2019 and a total of 5844 backward trajectories were computed all the trajectories mentioned above were classified by season spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february and cluster analysis was performed using the hysplit model to group the trajectories with similar pathways and to further identify the change of moisture source for different seasons the cluster analysis merged trajectories that were close to each other and represented the clusters by their mean trajectory computationally the trajectories were combined to decrease the number of clusters until the total spatial variance began to increase significantly which occurred when disparate clusters were combined le duy et al 2018 the number of clusters was therefore determined as the optimal cluster number the 120 h back trajectory analysis was conducted every hour for the days with precipitation samples during the observation period followed by cluster analysis the cluster with the highest proportion was considered to be the main moisture transport pathway and 186 transport pathways were eventually obtained for the 186 daily precipitation samples a categorization of the moisture sources was then performed visually in general referring to the methods from tang et al 2017 based on the differences in the origin ocean or continent orientation pathway and distance of the air mass trajectories the amount weighted mean isotopic compositions of the precipitation samples for each category were calculated as the reflection of the precipitation isotopic signatures from corresponding moisture sources one way analysis of variance followed by duncan s multiple range test at the 0 05 level was performed to evaluate the statistical difference in mean δ18o and d excess values among different moisture source categories and lowercase letters were used to indicate statistical differences different letters denote significant differences and identical letters denote insignificant differences the procedure and basis for the division of different moisture sources are provided in detail in the supplementary information in text s2 more

precipitation ranged from 86 8 to 16 9 with an amount weighted mean of 30 8 and the δ18o values ranged from 11 4 to 0 9 with an amount weighted mean of 4 8 d excess d δ2h 8 δ18o a parameter associated with the meteorological conditions of the source region breitenbach et al 2010 dansgaard 1964 xie et al 2011 varied from 9 9 to 23 0 and the amount weighted mean was 7 8 the lmwl based on the 186 daily precipitation samples was established using least squares regression fig 2 expressing the linear correlation between δ2h and δ18o as δ2h 8 83 0 18 δ18o 12 77 0 86 r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 186 both the slope and intercept of lmwl were slightly higher than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 similar to the results reported for northeast poyang lake in a previous study wu et al 2021 the frequency distribution histograms illustrate the number of precipitation samples in each specified range of δ2h and δ18o overall the δ2h and δ18o distributions were negatively skewed indicating that relatively enriched precipitation occurs more frequently 3 2 meteorological and isotopic characteristics seasonal variations were observed in the precipitation amount air temperature δ18o and d excess fig 3 as previously reported for other regions around the world dos santos et al 2019 vodila et al 2011 wang et al 2020 during the observation period the monthly precipitation amount ranged from 12 mm august 2019 to 415 mm june 2017 and the monthly average air temperature ranged from 4 6 january 2018 to 30 6 august 2019 the total precipitation amount was high in 2016 and 2017 with june as the wettest month consistent with the multi year average pattern 1965 2018 in the study area however the precipitation amount was substantially lower in 2018 and 2019 and the wettest months were april and february respectively a kruskal wallis non parametric test was applied to test the statistical difference between the median δ18o for the four years and no significant difference p 0 33 was reported at the 0 05 level the seasonal variation of δ18o values was observed with more enriched precipitation falling mainly around april followed by a sharp decreasing trend in late may june and early july and a progressive increase from late october to february d excess clearly increases from october to january gradually decreasing from january to july and on the whole is inversely related to the temperature variation with a spearman correlation coefficient ρ 0 59 the relationships between δ18o and meteorological factors i e air temperature and precipitation amount are plotted in fig 4 a weak negative correlation between δ18o and air temperature with δ18o 0 053 t 3 270 r2 0 03 p 0 03 n 186 and a significant negative correlation between δ18o and precipitation amount with δ18o 0 035 p 3 625 r2 0 06 p 0 01 n 186 were found based on all 186 precipitation samples in the study area equations not shown in the figure the linear correlations between δ18o and the meteorological factors for the rainy april to september and dry october to march seasons are also presented fig 4 during the rainy season significant negative correlations between δ18o and both air temperature and precipitation amount were observed with linear fits of δ18o 0 300 t 2 502 r2 0 24 p 0 01 n 107 and δ18o 0 047 p 3 301 r2 0 11 p 0 01 n 107 respectively there were no correlations between δ18o and these two meteorological factors during the dry season with linear fits of δ18o 0 051 t 4 683 r2 0 01 p 0 34 n 79 and δ18o 0 002 p 4 199 r2 0 01 p 0 93 n 79 respectively 3 3 categorization of moisture sources the cluster analysis results based on all trajectories for the different seasons during the observation period are shown in fig 5 the analysis based on trajectory frequency indicates that the moisture originates generally from nearby areas 57 and remote continental regions in the northwest 43 in total in winter with cold and dry air masses in summer the low level monsoonal systems transport moisture contributed by evaporative moisture fluxes over the ocean towards china chow et al 2008 and oceanic air masses 52 in total are most common in the study area including those originating from the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western north pacific ocean chow et al 2008 wei et al 2016 spring and autumn are regarded as transitional periods when the conversion of moisture sources occurs determined by the east asian monsoon system and moisture originating from nearby areas remote continents and oceans are equally frequent the main moisture transport pathways for the 186 daily precipitation samples were first roughly divided into oceanic and continental sources to investigate the difference in isotopic signatures among the different moisture sources in more detail the oceanic source was further divided into four sub sources and the continental source was divided into three sub sources depending on the differences in the orientation pathway and distance of the air mass trajectories oceanic sources from southwest osw n 34 east oe n 10 south os n 3 and southeast ose n 34 and continental sources from north cn n 24 nearby areas cna n 63 and northwest cnw n 18 were identified fig 6 amount weighted mean δ18o values δ18ow of oceanic sub sources were significantly more depleted overall than those of continental sub sources table 1 the weighted mean δ18o value for all oceanic source categories δ18oo w and continental source categories δ18oc w was 5 6 and 3 9 respectively the amount weighted mean d excess values d excessw of the various sub sources were different as well table 1 and the weighted mean d excess value for all oceanic d excesso w and continental d excessc w source categories was 6 2 and 9 7 respectively the result of δ18ow and d excessw values for the different moisture sub source categories is illustrated in fig 7 one way analysis of variance followed by duncan s multiple range test was performed to evaluate the statistical differences among them the relationship between the δ18o values and the distances of the 120 h back trajectories was analyzed and no obvious correlation r2 0 01 p 0 13 was found for all 186 precipitation samples fig s2 for sub sources only category osw had a significant negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and the trajectory distance r2 0 26 p 0 01 n 34 4 discussion 4 1 relationship with meteorological factors previous studies have shown a positive correlation between the abundance of heavy isotopes and air temperature in temperate climates stumpp et al 2014 vodila et al 2011 wang et al 2019 wassenaar et al 2011 known as the temperature effect the temperature effect tends to be the long term link between precipitation isotopes and climate and this linear dependency between precipitation isotopic composition and air temperature has been applied to paleoclimate reconstructions rozanski et al 1997 vodila et al 2011 however some studies in subtropical regions dominated by the monsoon climate showed a negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and air temperature including central china wu et al 2015 and southern china xie et al 2011 the regression result based on all 186 precipitation samples indicates a weak negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and air temperature in the study area fig 4a which is contrary to the conventional expected temperature effect the monthly survey results of precipitation isotopic composition from the two adjacent gnip stations wuhan and changsha were analyzed and no correlation was found between precipitation isotopes and the monthly mean air temperature fig s3 the weak negative correlation based on the multi year observations suggests that the temperature effect may be obscured by other factors in the poyang lake wetland an inverse relationship between precipitation isotopes and the precipitation amount has been observed in many tropical and monsoon regions araguás araguás et al 1998 wu et al 2015 known as the amount effect an obvious amount effect was observed in the study area based on all 186 precipitation samples fig 4b theoretically the precipitation isotopic composition tends to be depleted continuously during the rain out process that is the increasing precipitation amount as the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o in the water vapor are preferentially condensed the high humidity condition caused by the heavy rain event also restricts sub cloud evaporation and reduces the possibility of isotopic exchange with ambient moisture during the fall of the raindrops towards the ground sánchez murillo et al 2016 however an increasing precipitation amount did not always coincide with depleted δ18o values of precipitation on the monthly scale for the poyang lake wetland and there were occasions when a high precipitation amount and enriched δ18o values occurred simultaneously i e april 2018 fig 3 this puzzling phenomenon suggests that the precipitation isotopic characteristics in the study area may be related to other primary driving factors rather than local precipitation amount during the rainy season a significant amount effect and an inverse temperature effect were observed in the study area fig 4 the negative correlations between precipitation isotopes and both air temperature and precipitation amount have also been reported in the mountainous areas in changsha wu et al 2015 and beijing liu et al 2018 and the inverse temperature effect was considered to be likely caused by seasonally shifting moisture sources rather than the response to local temperatures past studies in southeast asia and the western pacific region have suggested that the gradual rain out process of oceanic air masses is a powerful mechanism capable of producing large isotopic depletions in precipitation often completely overshadowing the temperature dependency of precipitation isotopes araguás araguás et al 1998 there were no correlations between δ18o and air temperature or precipitation amount in the dry season a multiple linear regression including both meteorological factors failed to explain the precipitation isotopic composition as the air temperature did not achieve statistical significance at the 0 05 level combined with the puzzling case of the high precipitation amount and enriched δ18o values occurring simultaneously the precipitation isotopic composition may not respond to local meteorological factors and instead other factors are responsible for the temporal variation of the precipitation isotopic characteristics in the study area 4 2 comparison of moisture sub sources precipitation isotopes experience an integrated effect from a series of processes at both regional and local scales vimeux et al 2005 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2015 involving for example the origin of atmospheric vapor air mass transport pathways over long distances and upstream and local precipitation processes it is increasingly thought that moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation have the most important effect on the variation of precipitation isotopic composition chakraborty et al 2016 le duy et al 2018 rahul et al 2016 the similar interannual variability of the δ18o and d excess values during the 4 year observation period suggests the possibility that they are influenced by shifting moisture sources and atmospheric circulation fig 3 therefore it is reasonable to identify the isotopic composition differences of various moisture sources and evaluate the effect of atmospheric circulation patterns on precipitation isotopes the history of the main moisture transport pathways for all 186 precipitation samples was evaluated using the hysplit model with the 120 h back trajectory analysis according to the categorization results above a total of seven sub sources were identified fig 6 by comparing the δ18ow and d excessw values of different moisture sub sources distinct differences in isotopic signatures are revealed fig 7 as expected moisture associated with oceanic sources is relatively depleted and moisture originating from the continent is more enriched fig 7a previous studies have also found that the moisture sourced from the ocean leads to more depleted δ18o values of precipitation compared to moisture sourced from the land crawford et al 2013 tang et al 2017 the d excess in precipitation is considered as a critical parameter closely related to the source regions and has been used to discuss and investigate the moisture sources liu et al 2008 xie et al 2011 the d excessc w 9 7 of all continental sources is close to the global average of 10 and due to the temperature and humidity differences in the source regions d excessw values of oceanic sub sources are generally lower with the exception of oe fig 7b in previous studies on the central tibetan plateau and indus river basin the high d excess values in winter have been ascribed to the dry continental air mass from the west and north while the humid air mass above the sea gives rise to lower d excess values in summer liu et al 2008 lone et al 2019 these conclusions are consistent with the results in this study fig 3 fig 5 indicating that moisture sources have a nonnegligible effect on the precipitation isotopic composition accordingly the results of the back trajectory analysis and isotopic statistics for sub source classification need to be combined to further explore the role of various moisture sources in the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation precipitation isotopic characteristics can be determined based on the upstream rain out process sub cloud evaporation and the relative humidity over the primary source regions tang et al 2017 vimeux et al 2005 yu et al 2016 os has the lowest δ18ow 8 5 and d excessw 1 6 values of all the sub sources reflecting the progressive rain out along air mass transport pathways over long distances and the high humidity conditions in the source region precipitation tends to have moisture contributions from osw and ose among the oceanic sub sources mainly originating from the bay of bengal and the western north pacific ocean respectively fig 6 a difference in isotopic signatures is also observed with the δ18ow and d excessw values of osw significantly lower than those of ose fig 7 table 1 which is likely caused by the rain out process and ocean surface conditions during the formation of air masses the δ18ow value 4 0 of oe is higher than that of the other oceanic sub sources indicating a less significant rain out process and the possibility that precipitation undergoes a slight sub cloud evaporation which is further supported by the lower slope 7 85 of the δ2h δ18o relationship table 1 fig s4 tan 2013 also found that moisture from the western pacific ocean produces less negative δ18o in precipitation due to the decreasing rain out caused by the short distance of air mass transport it is worth noting that oe is the only category with a slope lower than that of the gmwl i e 8 sub cloud evaporation also modifies d excess in precipitation and decreases its value however the precipitation classified as oe is marked by a high d excessw value 10 6 fig 7 table 1 precipitation that forms from the recycled moisture generated by evaporation will have a higher d excess wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 and the high d excessw value of oe may be associated with recycled moisture input along the moisture transport pathways reflecting the complexity influenced by the combination of local and upstream hydrological processes the higher δ18ow values of cn cna and cnw may result from the enhanced local moisture recycling process under the low humidity conditions due to the contributions of surface evaporation from isotopic enriched rivers lakes or soil water the high d excessw values of cn 13 5 and cnw 10 6 are signs of the low humidity in the source regions compared with cn and cnw cna was subjected to weaker non equilibrium fractionation when the moisture formed in the source region with a relatively low d excessw value 8 4 there was no significant difference in the δ18ow values among oe cn and cna but their d excessw values differ significantly from each other moreover the difference in the δ18ow values is more pronounced than that in d excessw values between oe and cnw as well as ose and cna fig 7 water vapor condenses into raindrops under isotopic equilibrium during which the d excess value remains constant as a result the d excess of the precipitation is less affected by the rain out process and is considered a more stable indicator hu et al 2018 xie et al 2011 our results suggest that the combination of δ18o and d excess may be a more efficient diagnostic method for distinguishing moisture source regions and quantifying the contribution of different moisture sources to precipitation 4 3 influences of regional scale moisture source dynamics as mentioned above different moisture sub sources for precipitation and their differences in isotopic signatures have been identified fig 7 table 1 the relative importance of various air masses is modulated by monsoon activity araguás araguás et al 1998 wu et al 2015 therefore the transition and instability of the dominant monsoons are responsible for the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the study area controlled by the east asian monsoon system during the east asian summer monsoon a large amount of moisture is brought from the low latitude ocean regions which is obviously opposite to the moisture sources in winter fig 5 previous studies in the yangtze river basin and the east asian summer monsoon region also indicated that summer water vapor is primarily derived from oceanic sources alexander et al 2015 chen et al 2012 all seven moisture sub source categories occurred in summer but the relative occurrence frequency of osw and ose was significantly higher with a total relative contribution to precipitation amount of up to 75 fig 8 during this period the continental source had the lowest relative frequency and precipitation contribution compared with other seasons with the dominance of osw and ose potentially causing the lower δ18o and d excess values of summer precipitation fig 9 tang et al 2017 indicated that the strength of the summer monsoons governs the dynamics of oceanic sub sources and assessed the occurrence of precipitation events related to the oceanic sources by the summer monsoon frequency index in autumn the summer monsoon generally begins to withdraw and the shift of moisture sources occurs the relative occurrence frequency of all the continental sub sources is observed to increase significantly fig 8a since there were fewer precipitation events collected in autumn the individual torrential rain events related to ose made it account for 36 of the autumn precipitation fig 8b previous work in changsha a city adjacent to the study area showed that the high concentrations of heavy isotopes in precipitation were associated with the remote westerly air masses inland moisture and degenerated tropical oceanic air masses wu et al 2015 in winter moisture transported from nearby and high latitude inland areas is more frequent in the study area due to the controls of the east asian winter monsoon fig 8a and the precipitation is characterized by high δ18o and d excess values fig 9 cna contributed nearly half of the winter precipitation amount 45 while precipitation related to cnw accounted for only 16 probably caused by the dry and cold air masses with less moisture a noticeable case was observed where the relative occurrence frequency and relative contribution to precipitation of the continental source increased gradually from summer 27 and 19 respectively to winter 76 and 76 respectively which was consistent with the seasonal trend of isotopic characteristics fig 8 fig 9 atmospheric circulation provides moisture from various sub sources during summer to winter and the air masses with distinct differences in isotopic signatures are responsible for the seasonal fluctuations in precipitation isotopes wu et al 2015 xie et al 2011 in other words the higher contribution of the continental source is considered to result in the higher values of precipitation δ18o and d excess at the seasonal timescale oe is regarded as a particular oceanic sub source for its discordant isotopic characteristics and mostly occurred in summer however the influence of oe on the overall seasonal isotope variation of precipitation appeared to be limited given the low frequency n 10 and only more than os and the low relative contribution to precipitation amount in spring 7 summer 4 and autumn 13 the relative occurrence frequencies of the continental source in spring and autumn were similar accounting for 63 and 64 respectively but the proportion of continental sub sources varied fig 8a the similar d excess values of precipitation in spring and autumn may be due to the fact that both seasons were in the transitional period when the conversion of dominant monsoons occurred however there are some difficulties in interpreting the higher δ18o values of spring precipitation which presented a smaller range of fluctuation fig 9a and further study is needed to explain it we hypothesize that the continental source surface waters etc during this period had more enriched δ18o values due to the winter precipitation and evaporation and the combination of δ18o enriched moisture and the sub cloud thermodynamic process caused the high δ18o values of spring precipitation during the 4 year observation period the precipitation related to cna n 63 was most frequent accounting for 34 of the total and the relative contribution of cna to the total precipitation amount was as high as 32 in this case the moisture from evaporation in the nearby areas is to some extent regarded as the dominant precipitation input in the study area although water resources near the study area are fairly abundant the regional shortage of surface water resources is still likely the primary risk to the sustainability of local ecosystems under the influence of extreme drought events and water conservancy projects the seasonality of δ18o and d excess in precipitation is caused by a complete reversal of the atmospheric circulation araguás araguás et al 1998 and the gradual evolution is the result superimposed by various sub sources these findings confirm and further partially quantify the influences of regional scale moisture source dynamics and indicate that the shifts of moisture sources controlled by monsoon activities can explain the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation nevertheless it needs to be emphasized that sub cloud thermodynamic processes have modified the results of precipitation isotopes the practice of associating the sample results with the source regions ignores the impact during the fall of the raindrops towards the ground and further studies are needed to clarify the details such as compensating for the sub cloud evaporation effect 5 conclusions this paper presents a detailed description of the precipitation isotopic characteristics in the poyang lake wetland based on four years of precipitation sampling between october 2015 and september 2019 using the hysplit backward trajectory model seven moisture sub sources osw oe os ose cn cna and cnw were identified as responsible for the precipitation in the study area and the influence of different moisture sources on the seasonal isotope variation of the precipitation was further explored the lmwl was established as δ2h 8 83 0 18 δ18o 12 77 0 86 r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 186 and seasonal variations in precipitation δ18o and d excess were observed in the study area an obvious amount effect and a weak negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and air temperature were found based on all 186 precipitation samples a case of simultaneous high precipitation amount and enriched δ18o values was observed indicating that the precipitation isotopic composition may not respond to local meteorological factors distinct differences in isotopic signatures were revealed among different moisture sub sources in general moisture associated with oceanic sources is characterized by more depleted δ18o and lower d excess than that originating from the continent the relative occurrence frequency of osw and ose was significantly higher in summer with a total relative contribution to the summer precipitation amount of up to 75 the precipitation related to cna n 63 was most frequent accounting for 34 of the total and contributed nearly half of the winter precipitation amount 45 an increase in the relative occurrence frequency and relative contribution to precipitation of the continental source was observed from summer 27 and 19 respectively to winter 76 and 76 respectively consistent with the seasonal trend of isotopic characteristics at the seasonal timescale the higher contribution of the continental source is considered to result in the higher values of precipitation δ18o and d excess our results highlight the importance of regional scale moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation for the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation these findings confirm that the seasonal evolution of precipitation isotopes is caused by variations in the contribution from various moisture sub sources with distinct isotopic characteristics in the study area which are further controlled by monsoon activities this work contributes to a better understanding of the climatic influences on precipitation isotopic seasonality and the precipitation isotopic signatures of the long term monitoring

8137,study region the wetland ecosystem of poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china study focus the focus of this study is to understand the climatic influence on precipitation isotopic composition and the mechanism underlying the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the poyang lake wetland new hydrological insights for the region the local meteoric water line was established as δ2h 8 83 0 18 δ18o 12 77 0 86 r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 186 a total of seven moisture sub sources contributing to precipitation were identified using the hysplit model among which distinct differences in isotopic signatures were revealed the seasonal isotopic variation of precipitation in the study area was found not to respond to local meteorological factors an increase in the relative occurrence frequency and relative contribution to precipitation of the continental source was found from summer to winter which explains the seasonal variation in precipitation δ18o and d excess combining the results of back trajectory analysis and isotopic statistics for the sub source classification the seasonal evolution of precipitation isotopes is considered to be caused by variations in the contribution from various moisture sources with distinct isotopic characteristics which are further controlled by monsoon activities this study highlights the importance of regional scale moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation for the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the poyang lake wetland keywords precipitation isotopes moisture source identification seasonal variation d excess poyang lake wetland 1 introduction precipitation is a major input of the terrestrial hydrological cycle and consists of various regional and local contributions including both moisture transported over long distances and that provided by local evapotranspiration dos santos et al 2019 le duy et al 2018 tang et al 2017 a better understanding of precipitation sources and the relative contribution of each component is important in ecohydrological studies of wetlands due to the central role of precipitation in maintaining water tables and ecosystem stability stable isotopes can provide critical information to identify the precipitation source regions and have been used to investigate atmospheric circulation at various scales araguás araguás et al 1998 breitenbach et al 2010 sánchez murillo et al 2016 the response of the precipitation isotopic composition to long term fluctuations of key climatic parameters has also been discussed in paleoclimate reconstructions rozanski et al 1997 vodila et al 2011 furthermore stable isotopic signatures in precipitation can be applied to reveal hydrological processes such as soil moisture eco hydrological dynamics oerter and bowen 2017 hydrological connectivity assessment of wetlands ala aho et al 2018 and mean residence time estimation of rivers ogrinc et al 2018 numerous studies have demonstrated that the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation can reflect the moisture source seasonality determined by the difference of the initial evaporation condition and isotopic evolution of subsequent rain out processes during moisture transport alexander et al 2015 breitenbach et al 2010 sodemann et al 2008 information on precipitation isotope variability is crucial for the study of hydrological cycles especially in the identification of hydrological behavior in complex hydrogeological systems rusjan et al 2019 the seasonality of precipitation isotopes can provide insights into seasonal streamflow generation processes kumar et al 2020 leuthold et al 2021 and can be applied to explore water transfer in the soil plant atmosphere continuum dai et al 2020 understanding the seasonality of modern precipitation isotopic signatures has become an important prerequisite for systematic analyses on regional hydrological processes and investigations of environmental change sun et al 2020 moreover clarifying the relationship between precipitation isotopic composition and moisture source regions can improve understanding of the wetland hydrological cycle as the atmospheric part of the land atmosphere interactions and contributes to discussions on the response of precipitation to the current climate regime under the influence of climate change therefore investigating climatic influences on the precipitation isotopic composition and the mechanism underlying the seasonal isotope variation is of great significance over the past decades much effort has been made to understand the meteorological influence on precipitation isotopes chidambaram et al 2009 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1992 uchiyama et al 2017 and the temperature effect and amount effect have been established to explain the relationships with meteorological factors the physical mechanism of these effects is the fractionation during moisture transport condensation and the sub cloud thermodynamics of raindrops however these empirical conclusions are geographically limited as studies have indicated that precipitation isotopes in tropical climates are less dependent on local meteorological parameters breitenbach et al 2010 sánchez murillo et al 2016 in effect the factors influencing the variation of precipitation isotopes are diverse and complex involving a series of processes at various scales and differences remain among different regions in what factor mainly controls the stable isotopic composition of precipitation recent studies have demonstrated that the isotopic composition of precipitation appears to be controlled by the dynamical nature of the moisture rather than the individual precipitation events linked to monsoon intraseasonal variability chakraborty et al 2016 tang et al 2015 the influence of changes in moisture sources on precipitation isotope variability in the monsoon regions has been studied widely and results indicate that atmospheric circulation dominates at both seasonal and interannual timescales based on the identification of moisture source regions for precipitation using backward trajectory modelling le duy et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the role of regional atmospheric circulation driving the precipitation isotopic values has also been emphasized evidenced by the good correlation between the local precipitation isotopic composition and regional integrated convective activity nlend et al 2020 rahul et al 2016 wang et al 2021 many additional factors responsible for the variation of precipitation isotopes have also been extensively examined for example different types of cloud e g convective stratiform and frontal can cause precipitation isotopes to exhibit distinctive characteristics aggarwal et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2018 and changes in the moisture fractions due to the moisture recycling from evapotranspiration during advection can modify the precipitation isotopic composition peng et al 2011 poyang lake located on the middle and lower yangtze river is the largest freshwater lake in china and has a climate influenced by the east asian monsoon system it is a wetland of international importance and home to many endangered and rare animal species such as the siberian crane oriental storks and freshwater porpoise liao et al 2020 the lake is mainly replenished by five tributaries in the basin raohe xinjiang fuhe ganjiang and xiushui rivers and the precipitation affects the temporal and spatial distribution of water availability in the region wei et al 2016 due to intensive human activities and climate change in recent decades the lake appears to be shrinking causing its flood storage capacity to diminish zhang et al 2014 poyang lake has also recently suffered from prolonged droughts and wetland degradation ye et al 2013 due to the important role of poyang lake in ecological environmental and biodiversity conservation in the yangtze river basin considerable attention has been paid to the sustainable use of water resources and the safety of the entire ecosystem mao et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 many studies have reported the isotopic signatures of interactions between different water components e g precipitation surface water groundwater soil water and plant water to evaluate the impact of human induced hydrology and climate change on the regional ecohydrological regime of poyang lake hu et al 2013 liao et al 2020 zhan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation is an important reference for comparison in these studies however the main influence of the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in poyang lake is still unclear in particular the complex effects of different moisture sources and atmospheric circulation on precipitation isotopes remain largely unstudied representing the atmospheric part of land atmosphere interactions for this region moreover the wetland ecosystem of poyang lake is an area that is sensitive to climate change and the relative contributions of various moisture sources to wetland precipitation a neglected perspective of wetland conservation and restoration also need to be explored in this study a total of 186 daily precipitation samples were collected between october 2015 and september 2019 in the poyang lake national nature reserve the objectives of this study are 1 to elucidate the basic characteristics and seasonal variations of precipitation isotopes in the poyang lake wetland 2 identify the different moisture sources of precipitation and investigate the difference in isotopic signatures among them and 3 further understand how the moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation influence the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation the moisture source identification can be applied to determine the contributions of different source regions to precipitation and to provide a new perspective for contemporary water resource management and associated sustainability challenges the precipitation isotopic signatures of the long term monitoring summarized here also enable a better isotopic simulation in ecohydrological studies that depend on the periodicity of precipitation isotopes in the poyang lake wetland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake located in the center of southeast china is the major tributary of the yangtze river and covers a surface area ranging from 907 to 3752 km2 gu et al 2019 ye et al 2013 poyang lake contains two national nature reserves the poyang lake national nature reserve and the nanjishan wetland national nature reserve and the former was selected as our study area the poyang lake national nature reserve 115 52 116 08 e and 29 02 29 18 n is located in the northwest region of poyang lake fig 1 where the northern branch of ganjiang river intersects with xiushui river zhang et al 2017 the reserve has a subtropical humid monsoon climate the annual average air temperature 1965 2018 is 17 4 the annual average precipitation 1965 2018 is 1511 mm which is slightly lower than that of the whole poyang lake basin wu et al 2021 ye et al 2013 the precipitation distribution is uneven throughout the year with the rainy season april to september accounting for 68 of the annual precipitation mao et al 2021 the reserve is characterized by a typical wetland ecosystem performing significant hydrological and ecological functions for flood control maintenance of biodiversity and regulation of the regional climate zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2 2 stable isotope and meteorological data the sampling site was set at wucheng town 116 00 32 e 29 11 13 n fig 1 in the center of the poyang lake national nature reserve a total of 186 daily precipitation samples were collected using a rainwater collector set in an open area and approximately 0 9 m above the ground between october 2015 and september 2019 each precipitation sample was transferred to a 100 ml polyethylene bottle tightened with a cap and the air bubbles were removed to avoid isotopic fractionation the samples were filtered using 0 22 μm polyether sulfone filters in the laboratory and stored in 2 ml glass vials at 4 until analysis the stable isotopic composition of the precipitation samples was analyzed using a mat253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with an elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientific bremen germany at the state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science wuhan university wuhan china all the results are expressed in the delta notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water the analytical uncertainty of the isotope analyses based on a long term analysis of the internal laboratory standard was less than 2 and 0 2 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the average daily total precipitation amount p and average daily air temperature t for the whole nature reserve were obtained based on the 0 5 0 5 grid daily surface precipitation and air temperature datasets in china from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn because not all precipitation events were successfully collected during the observation period a comparison was made between the amount weighted monthly mean δ18o values of precipitation in the study area and those from nearby global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip wuhan and changsha stations to establish the representativeness of our data the results showed that the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the study area was similar to that at the two adjacent gnip stations this suggests that missing data did not cause significant biases and our data have captured the full picture of the precipitation isotopic composition and its seasonal variation in the study area the detailed description and results of the comparison are provided in the supplementary information in text s1 and fig s1 2 3 hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model to identify and distinguish the probable source regions of the air masses responsible for the precipitation air mass back trajectory analysis was carried out using the hysplit backward trajectory model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration at the air resources laboratory draxler and hess 1998 stein et al 2015 the model employs a three dimensional lagrangian air mass vertical velocity algorithm to compute the movement of the air masses soderberg et al 2013 based on the gdas1 data global data assimilation system 1 1 2005 present available at ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 an end height of 1500 m above the ground at the precipitation sampling site was set for the backward trajectory model the height at which the precipitation is most likely to originate corresponding to the barometric surface of approximately 850 hpa dos santos et al 2019 le duy et al 2018 wei et al 2018 in previous studies different backtracking durations have been used for different reasons dos santos et al 2019 kirkels et al 2020 sánchez murillo et al 2016 following testing we selected the widely used 120 h back trajectory analysis as the one able to clearly distinguish the oceanic source from the continental source for the study area due to the relative proximity to the ocean at the regional scale the 120 h backtracking duration was sufficient to clearly identify the differences in the orientation among the different air mass back trajectories the 120 h back trajectory analysis was conducted every 6 h from 1 october 2015 to 30 september 2019 and a total of 5844 backward trajectories were computed all the trajectories mentioned above were classified by season spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february and cluster analysis was performed using the hysplit model to group the trajectories with similar pathways and to further identify the change of moisture source for different seasons the cluster analysis merged trajectories that were close to each other and represented the clusters by their mean trajectory computationally the trajectories were combined to decrease the number of clusters until the total spatial variance began to increase significantly which occurred when disparate clusters were combined le duy et al 2018 the number of clusters was therefore determined as the optimal cluster number the 120 h back trajectory analysis was conducted every hour for the days with precipitation samples during the observation period followed by cluster analysis the cluster with the highest proportion was considered to be the main moisture transport pathway and 186 transport pathways were eventually obtained for the 186 daily precipitation samples a categorization of the moisture sources was then performed visually in general referring to the methods from tang et al 2017 based on the differences in the origin ocean or continent orientation pathway and distance of the air mass trajectories the amount weighted mean isotopic compositions of the precipitation samples for each category were calculated as the reflection of the precipitation isotopic signatures from corresponding moisture sources one way analysis of variance followed by duncan s multiple range test at the 0 05 level was performed to evaluate the statistical difference in mean δ18o and d excess values among different moisture source categories and lowercase letters were used to indicate statistical differences different letters denote significant differences and identical letters denote insignificant differences the procedure and basis for the division of different moisture sources are provided in detail in the supplementary information in text s2 more

precipitation ranged from 86 8 to 16 9 with an amount weighted mean of 30 8 and the δ18o values ranged from 11 4 to 0 9 with an amount weighted mean of 4 8 d excess d δ2h 8 δ18o a parameter associated with the meteorological conditions of the source region breitenbach et al 2010 dansgaard 1964 xie et al 2011 varied from 9 9 to 23 0 and the amount weighted mean was 7 8 the lmwl based on the 186 daily precipitation samples was established using least squares regression fig 2 expressing the linear correlation between δ2h and δ18o as δ2h 8 83 0 18 δ18o 12 77 0 86 r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 186 both the slope and intercept of lmwl were slightly higher than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 similar to the results reported for northeast poyang lake in a previous study wu et al 2021 the frequency distribution histograms illustrate the number of precipitation samples in each specified range of δ2h and δ18o overall the δ2h and δ18o distributions were negatively skewed indicating that relatively enriched precipitation occurs more frequently 3 2 meteorological and isotopic characteristics seasonal variations were observed in the precipitation amount air temperature δ18o and d excess fig 3 as previously reported for other regions around the world dos santos et al 2019 vodila et al 2011 wang et al 2020 during the observation period the monthly precipitation amount ranged from 12 mm august 2019 to 415 mm june 2017 and the monthly average air temperature ranged from 4 6 january 2018 to 30 6 august 2019 the total precipitation amount was high in 2016 and 2017 with june as the wettest month consistent with the multi year average pattern 1965 2018 in the study area however the precipitation amount was substantially lower in 2018 and 2019 and the wettest months were april and february respectively a kruskal wallis non parametric test was applied to test the statistical difference between the median δ18o for the four years and no significant difference p 0 33 was reported at the 0 05 level the seasonal variation of δ18o values was observed with more enriched precipitation falling mainly around april followed by a sharp decreasing trend in late may june and early july and a progressive increase from late october to february d excess clearly increases from october to january gradually decreasing from january to july and on the whole is inversely related to the temperature variation with a spearman correlation coefficient ρ 0 59 the relationships between δ18o and meteorological factors i e air temperature and precipitation amount are plotted in fig 4 a weak negative correlation between δ18o and air temperature with δ18o 0 053 t 3 270 r2 0 03 p 0 03 n 186 and a significant negative correlation between δ18o and precipitation amount with δ18o 0 035 p 3 625 r2 0 06 p 0 01 n 186 were found based on all 186 precipitation samples in the study area equations not shown in the figure the linear correlations between δ18o and the meteorological factors for the rainy april to september and dry october to march seasons are also presented fig 4 during the rainy season significant negative correlations between δ18o and both air temperature and precipitation amount were observed with linear fits of δ18o 0 300 t 2 502 r2 0 24 p 0 01 n 107 and δ18o 0 047 p 3 301 r2 0 11 p 0 01 n 107 respectively there were no correlations between δ18o and these two meteorological factors during the dry season with linear fits of δ18o 0 051 t 4 683 r2 0 01 p 0 34 n 79 and δ18o 0 002 p 4 199 r2 0 01 p 0 93 n 79 respectively 3 3 categorization of moisture sources the cluster analysis results based on all trajectories for the different seasons during the observation period are shown in fig 5 the analysis based on trajectory frequency indicates that the moisture originates generally from nearby areas 57 and remote continental regions in the northwest 43 in total in winter with cold and dry air masses in summer the low level monsoonal systems transport moisture contributed by evaporative moisture fluxes over the ocean towards china chow et al 2008 and oceanic air masses 52 in total are most common in the study area including those originating from the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western north pacific ocean chow et al 2008 wei et al 2016 spring and autumn are regarded as transitional periods when the conversion of moisture sources occurs determined by the east asian monsoon system and moisture originating from nearby areas remote continents and oceans are equally frequent the main moisture transport pathways for the 186 daily precipitation samples were first roughly divided into oceanic and continental sources to investigate the difference in isotopic signatures among the different moisture sources in more detail the oceanic source was further divided into four sub sources and the continental source was divided into three sub sources depending on the differences in the orientation pathway and distance of the air mass trajectories oceanic sources from southwest osw n 34 east oe n 10 south os n 3 and southeast ose n 34 and continental sources from north cn n 24 nearby areas cna n 63 and northwest cnw n 18 were identified fig 6 amount weighted mean δ18o values δ18ow of oceanic sub sources were significantly more depleted overall than those of continental sub sources table 1 the weighted mean δ18o value for all oceanic source categories δ18oo w and continental source categories δ18oc w was 5 6 and 3 9 respectively the amount weighted mean d excess values d excessw of the various sub sources were different as well table 1 and the weighted mean d excess value for all oceanic d excesso w and continental d excessc w source categories was 6 2 and 9 7 respectively the result of δ18ow and d excessw values for the different moisture sub source categories is illustrated in fig 7 one way analysis of variance followed by duncan s multiple range test was performed to evaluate the statistical differences among them the relationship between the δ18o values and the distances of the 120 h back trajectories was analyzed and no obvious correlation r2 0 01 p 0 13 was found for all 186 precipitation samples fig s2 for sub sources only category osw had a significant negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and the trajectory distance r2 0 26 p 0 01 n 34 4 discussion 4 1 relationship with meteorological factors previous studies have shown a positive correlation between the abundance of heavy isotopes and air temperature in temperate climates stumpp et al 2014 vodila et al 2011 wang et al 2019 wassenaar et al 2011 known as the temperature effect the temperature effect tends to be the long term link between precipitation isotopes and climate and this linear dependency between precipitation isotopic composition and air temperature has been applied to paleoclimate reconstructions rozanski et al 1997 vodila et al 2011 however some studies in subtropical regions dominated by the monsoon climate showed a negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and air temperature including central china wu et al 2015 and southern china xie et al 2011 the regression result based on all 186 precipitation samples indicates a weak negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and air temperature in the study area fig 4a which is contrary to the conventional expected temperature effect the monthly survey results of precipitation isotopic composition from the two adjacent gnip stations wuhan and changsha were analyzed and no correlation was found between precipitation isotopes and the monthly mean air temperature fig s3 the weak negative correlation based on the multi year observations suggests that the temperature effect may be obscured by other factors in the poyang lake wetland an inverse relationship between precipitation isotopes and the precipitation amount has been observed in many tropical and monsoon regions araguás araguás et al 1998 wu et al 2015 known as the amount effect an obvious amount effect was observed in the study area based on all 186 precipitation samples fig 4b theoretically the precipitation isotopic composition tends to be depleted continuously during the rain out process that is the increasing precipitation amount as the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o in the water vapor are preferentially condensed the high humidity condition caused by the heavy rain event also restricts sub cloud evaporation and reduces the possibility of isotopic exchange with ambient moisture during the fall of the raindrops towards the ground sánchez murillo et al 2016 however an increasing precipitation amount did not always coincide with depleted δ18o values of precipitation on the monthly scale for the poyang lake wetland and there were occasions when a high precipitation amount and enriched δ18o values occurred simultaneously i e april 2018 fig 3 this puzzling phenomenon suggests that the precipitation isotopic characteristics in the study area may be related to other primary driving factors rather than local precipitation amount during the rainy season a significant amount effect and an inverse temperature effect were observed in the study area fig 4 the negative correlations between precipitation isotopes and both air temperature and precipitation amount have also been reported in the mountainous areas in changsha wu et al 2015 and beijing liu et al 2018 and the inverse temperature effect was considered to be likely caused by seasonally shifting moisture sources rather than the response to local temperatures past studies in southeast asia and the western pacific region have suggested that the gradual rain out process of oceanic air masses is a powerful mechanism capable of producing large isotopic depletions in precipitation often completely overshadowing the temperature dependency of precipitation isotopes araguás araguás et al 1998 there were no correlations between δ18o and air temperature or precipitation amount in the dry season a multiple linear regression including both meteorological factors failed to explain the precipitation isotopic composition as the air temperature did not achieve statistical significance at the 0 05 level combined with the puzzling case of the high precipitation amount and enriched δ18o values occurring simultaneously the precipitation isotopic composition may not respond to local meteorological factors and instead other factors are responsible for the temporal variation of the precipitation isotopic characteristics in the study area 4 2 comparison of moisture sub sources precipitation isotopes experience an integrated effect from a series of processes at both regional and local scales vimeux et al 2005 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2015 involving for example the origin of atmospheric vapor air mass transport pathways over long distances and upstream and local precipitation processes it is increasingly thought that moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation have the most important effect on the variation of precipitation isotopic composition chakraborty et al 2016 le duy et al 2018 rahul et al 2016 the similar interannual variability of the δ18o and d excess values during the 4 year observation period suggests the possibility that they are influenced by shifting moisture sources and atmospheric circulation fig 3 therefore it is reasonable to identify the isotopic composition differences of various moisture sources and evaluate the effect of atmospheric circulation patterns on precipitation isotopes the history of the main moisture transport pathways for all 186 precipitation samples was evaluated using the hysplit model with the 120 h back trajectory analysis according to the categorization results above a total of seven sub sources were identified fig 6 by comparing the δ18ow and d excessw values of different moisture sub sources distinct differences in isotopic signatures are revealed fig 7 as expected moisture associated with oceanic sources is relatively depleted and moisture originating from the continent is more enriched fig 7a previous studies have also found that the moisture sourced from the ocean leads to more depleted δ18o values of precipitation compared to moisture sourced from the land crawford et al 2013 tang et al 2017 the d excess in precipitation is considered as a critical parameter closely related to the source regions and has been used to discuss and investigate the moisture sources liu et al 2008 xie et al 2011 the d excessc w 9 7 of all continental sources is close to the global average of 10 and due to the temperature and humidity differences in the source regions d excessw values of oceanic sub sources are generally lower with the exception of oe fig 7b in previous studies on the central tibetan plateau and indus river basin the high d excess values in winter have been ascribed to the dry continental air mass from the west and north while the humid air mass above the sea gives rise to lower d excess values in summer liu et al 2008 lone et al 2019 these conclusions are consistent with the results in this study fig 3 fig 5 indicating that moisture sources have a nonnegligible effect on the precipitation isotopic composition accordingly the results of the back trajectory analysis and isotopic statistics for sub source classification need to be combined to further explore the role of various moisture sources in the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation precipitation isotopic characteristics can be determined based on the upstream rain out process sub cloud evaporation and the relative humidity over the primary source regions tang et al 2017 vimeux et al 2005 yu et al 2016 os has the lowest δ18ow 8 5 and d excessw 1 6 values of all the sub sources reflecting the progressive rain out along air mass transport pathways over long distances and the high humidity conditions in the source region precipitation tends to have moisture contributions from osw and ose among the oceanic sub sources mainly originating from the bay of bengal and the western north pacific ocean respectively fig 6 a difference in isotopic signatures is also observed with the δ18ow and d excessw values of osw significantly lower than those of ose fig 7 table 1 which is likely caused by the rain out process and ocean surface conditions during the formation of air masses the δ18ow value 4 0 of oe is higher than that of the other oceanic sub sources indicating a less significant rain out process and the possibility that precipitation undergoes a slight sub cloud evaporation which is further supported by the lower slope 7 85 of the δ2h δ18o relationship table 1 fig s4 tan 2013 also found that moisture from the western pacific ocean produces less negative δ18o in precipitation due to the decreasing rain out caused by the short distance of air mass transport it is worth noting that oe is the only category with a slope lower than that of the gmwl i e 8 sub cloud evaporation also modifies d excess in precipitation and decreases its value however the precipitation classified as oe is marked by a high d excessw value 10 6 fig 7 table 1 precipitation that forms from the recycled moisture generated by evaporation will have a higher d excess wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 and the high d excessw value of oe may be associated with recycled moisture input along the moisture transport pathways reflecting the complexity influenced by the combination of local and upstream hydrological processes the higher δ18ow values of cn cna and cnw may result from the enhanced local moisture recycling process under the low humidity conditions due to the contributions of surface evaporation from isotopic enriched rivers lakes or soil water the high d excessw values of cn 13 5 and cnw 10 6 are signs of the low humidity in the source regions compared with cn and cnw cna was subjected to weaker non equilibrium fractionation when the moisture formed in the source region with a relatively low d excessw value 8 4 there was no significant difference in the δ18ow values among oe cn and cna but their d excessw values differ significantly from each other moreover the difference in the δ18ow values is more pronounced than that in d excessw values between oe and cnw as well as ose and cna fig 7 water vapor condenses into raindrops under isotopic equilibrium during which the d excess value remains constant as a result the d excess of the precipitation is less affected by the rain out process and is considered a more stable indicator hu et al 2018 xie et al 2011 our results suggest that the combination of δ18o and d excess may be a more efficient diagnostic method for distinguishing moisture source regions and quantifying the contribution of different moisture sources to precipitation 4 3 influences of regional scale moisture source dynamics as mentioned above different moisture sub sources for precipitation and their differences in isotopic signatures have been identified fig 7 table 1 the relative importance of various air masses is modulated by monsoon activity araguás araguás et al 1998 wu et al 2015 therefore the transition and instability of the dominant monsoons are responsible for the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the study area controlled by the east asian monsoon system during the east asian summer monsoon a large amount of moisture is brought from the low latitude ocean regions which is obviously opposite to the moisture sources in winter fig 5 previous studies in the yangtze river basin and the east asian summer monsoon region also indicated that summer water vapor is primarily derived from oceanic sources alexander et al 2015 chen et al 2012 all seven moisture sub source categories occurred in summer but the relative occurrence frequency of osw and ose was significantly higher with a total relative contribution to precipitation amount of up to 75 fig 8 during this period the continental source had the lowest relative frequency and precipitation contribution compared with other seasons with the dominance of osw and ose potentially causing the lower δ18o and d excess values of summer precipitation fig 9 tang et al 2017 indicated that the strength of the summer monsoons governs the dynamics of oceanic sub sources and assessed the occurrence of precipitation events related to the oceanic sources by the summer monsoon frequency index in autumn the summer monsoon generally begins to withdraw and the shift of moisture sources occurs the relative occurrence frequency of all the continental sub sources is observed to increase significantly fig 8a since there were fewer precipitation events collected in autumn the individual torrential rain events related to ose made it account for 36 of the autumn precipitation fig 8b previous work in changsha a city adjacent to the study area showed that the high concentrations of heavy isotopes in precipitation were associated with the remote westerly air masses inland moisture and degenerated tropical oceanic air masses wu et al 2015 in winter moisture transported from nearby and high latitude inland areas is more frequent in the study area due to the controls of the east asian winter monsoon fig 8a and the precipitation is characterized by high δ18o and d excess values fig 9 cna contributed nearly half of the winter precipitation amount 45 while precipitation related to cnw accounted for only 16 probably caused by the dry and cold air masses with less moisture a noticeable case was observed where the relative occurrence frequency and relative contribution to precipitation of the continental source increased gradually from summer 27 and 19 respectively to winter 76 and 76 respectively which was consistent with the seasonal trend of isotopic characteristics fig 8 fig 9 atmospheric circulation provides moisture from various sub sources during summer to winter and the air masses with distinct differences in isotopic signatures are responsible for the seasonal fluctuations in precipitation isotopes wu et al 2015 xie et al 2011 in other words the higher contribution of the continental source is considered to result in the higher values of precipitation δ18o and d excess at the seasonal timescale oe is regarded as a particular oceanic sub source for its discordant isotopic characteristics and mostly occurred in summer however the influence of oe on the overall seasonal isotope variation of precipitation appeared to be limited given the low frequency n 10 and only more than os and the low relative contribution to precipitation amount in spring 7 summer 4 and autumn 13 the relative occurrence frequencies of the continental source in spring and autumn were similar accounting for 63 and 64 respectively but the proportion of continental sub sources varied fig 8a the similar d excess values of precipitation in spring and autumn may be due to the fact that both seasons were in the transitional period when the conversion of dominant monsoons occurred however there are some difficulties in interpreting the higher δ18o values of spring precipitation which presented a smaller range of fluctuation fig 9a and further study is needed to explain it we hypothesize that the continental source surface waters etc during this period had more enriched δ18o values due to the winter precipitation and evaporation and the combination of δ18o enriched moisture and the sub cloud thermodynamic process caused the high δ18o values of spring precipitation during the 4 year observation period the precipitation related to cna n 63 was most frequent accounting for 34 of the total and the relative contribution of cna to the total precipitation amount was as high as 32 in this case the moisture from evaporation in the nearby areas is to some extent regarded as the dominant precipitation input in the study area although water resources near the study area are fairly abundant the regional shortage of surface water resources is still likely the primary risk to the sustainability of local ecosystems under the influence of extreme drought events and water conservancy projects the seasonality of δ18o and d excess in precipitation is caused by a complete reversal of the atmospheric circulation araguás araguás et al 1998 and the gradual evolution is the result superimposed by various sub sources these findings confirm and further partially quantify the influences of regional scale moisture source dynamics and indicate that the shifts of moisture sources controlled by monsoon activities can explain the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation nevertheless it needs to be emphasized that sub cloud thermodynamic processes have modified the results of precipitation isotopes the practice of associating the sample results with the source regions ignores the impact during the fall of the raindrops towards the ground and further studies are needed to clarify the details such as compensating for the sub cloud evaporation effect 5 conclusions this paper presents a detailed description of the precipitation isotopic characteristics in the poyang lake wetland based on four years of precipitation sampling between october 2015 and september 2019 using the hysplit backward trajectory model seven moisture sub sources osw oe os ose cn cna and cnw were identified as responsible for the precipitation in the study area and the influence of different moisture sources on the seasonal isotope variation of the precipitation was further explored the lmwl was established as δ2h 8 83 0 18 δ18o 12 77 0 86 r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 186 and seasonal variations in precipitation δ18o and d excess were observed in the study area an obvious amount effect and a weak negative correlation between precipitation δ18o and air temperature were found based on all 186 precipitation samples a case of simultaneous high precipitation amount and enriched δ18o values was observed indicating that the precipitation isotopic composition may not respond to local meteorological factors distinct differences in isotopic signatures were revealed among different moisture sub sources in general moisture associated with oceanic sources is characterized by more depleted δ18o and lower d excess than that originating from the continent the relative occurrence frequency of osw and ose was significantly higher in summer with a total relative contribution to the summer precipitation amount of up to 75 the precipitation related to cna n 63 was most frequent accounting for 34 of the total and contributed nearly half of the winter precipitation amount 45 an increase in the relative occurrence frequency and relative contribution to precipitation of the continental source was observed from summer 27 and 19 respectively to winter 76 and 76 respectively consistent with the seasonal trend of isotopic characteristics at the seasonal timescale the higher contribution of the continental source is considered to result in the higher values of precipitation δ18o and d excess our results highlight the importance of regional scale moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation for the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation these findings confirm that the seasonal evolution of precipitation isotopes is caused by variations in the contribution from various moisture sub sources with distinct isotopic characteristics in the study area which are further controlled by monsoon activities this work contributes to a better understanding of the climatic influences on precipitation isotopic seasonality and the precipitation isotopic signatures of the long term monitoring

8138,study region lake bracciano has been historically used as a strategic water reservoir for the city of rome italy since ancient times however following the severe water crisis of 2017 water abstraction has been completely stopped study focus the relative impact of the various drivers of change climatological and management on fluctuations in lake water level is not yet clear to quantify this impact we applied the random forest rf machine learning approach taking advantage of a century of observations new hydrological insights for the region since the late 1990s the monthly variation in lake water levels has doubled as has variation in monthly abstraction increased variation in annual cumulated precipitation and a rise in mean air temperature have also been observed the rf machine learning approach made it possible to confirm the marginal role of temperature the increasing role of abstraction during the last two decades from 24 to 39 and the key role played by the increased precipitation variability these results highlight the notable prediction and inference capabilities of rf in a complex and partially unknown hydrological context we conclude by discussing the limits of this approach which are mainly associated with its capacity to generates scenarios compared to physical based models keywords machine learning random forest lake bracciano climate change water abstraction water management 1 introduction as a consequence of its proximity to the city of rome only 37 km lake bracciano with a surface area of 57 6 km2 has historically been used as a strategic water reservoir since roman times when it was also widely used for fishing and recreational purposes as demonstrated by numerous paintings in nearby roman villas cordiano et al 2014 the natural hydrology of bracciano lake remained unchanged until the 17th century when under pope paolo v a dam was built on the arrone river the natural lake outflow in order to extract water for human consumption and controlling the lake s water level l in case of floods the 1920s saw the start of abstraction by means of hydraulic pumps leading to greater variability of l since 1909 water abstraction from the lake has been managed by the acea water utility abstraction has varied significantly over the years ranging from 0 to more than 2 m3 s 1 after the water crises affecting central italy in 2017 which severely impacted lake bracciano rossi et al 2019 abstraction is currently interrupted and the lake is considered an emergency resource to be used only in the event of significant water scarcity acea 2015 low l was recorded in 1955 1990 2003 and 2008 but the absolute minimum was recorded in 2017 198 cm as a consequence serious management concerns have been raised in recent years currently the relative impact of the various drivers of change climate and management on the lake water level fluctuations is still not clear as presented in details in 2 1 it is known that the water budget of lake bracciano is driven by both surface and sub surface flows although the relative contribution of these components is not clear taviani and henriksen 2015 regarding the quantitative management of the resource a sound knowledge of the lake water budget as well as its temporal hydrogeological dynamics is fundamental for developing effective policies over a range of time scales on the one hand the lake bracciano is currently considered an emergency resource to be used only in the event of failure of the main resources supplying the city of rome under ordinary conditions and therefore the impact of a sudden and intense abstraction must be carefully evaluated on the other hand exploitation of the lake over longer periods years needs to take account of the normal fluctuation of the water level due to multi years or decadal oscillations in precipitation romano and preziosi 2013 which is possibly affected by climate change armenia et al 2019 considering the qualitative aspects water level fluctuations can strongly impact the lake ecosystem and consequently ecosystem services provided to the local economy galloway et al 2003 kendall et al 2010 calizza et al 2021 previous studies show in the last 20 years major alterations to lake ecosystem functioning such as the near or complete disappearance of littoral habitats and the reduction by several tens of hectares of deep water plant communities such as charophytes carpenter and lodge 1986 azzella 2014 azzella et al 2017 the direct consequence of large fluctuations in water levels was the eutrophication of the banks with consequent invasion of the riparian communities by alien species and the alteration of the fauna in terms of both vertebrate species and riparian and aquatic invertebrates azzella 2014 baccetti et al 2017 l fluctuations generally impact the riparian vegetation with a consequent damage to lake self purification processes fundamental for maintaining water quality as a resource for human consumption but also for maintaining appropriate habitats for biodiversity conservation ostroumov 2017 calizza et al 2021 as an example two recent studies from the lake costantini et al 2018 calizza et al 2021 demonstrated that the loss of riparian and submerged vegetation in the proximity of the lake shore made lake fish communities vulnerable to the invasion by a bass species micropterus salmoides leading to reduced fish diversity and altered food web structure calizza et al 2021 found that 100 linear meters of highly vegetated lake shores reduced the economic impact of the invader on the two most commercially valuable fish species by approximately 1400 per year in comparison to poorly vegetated areas this suggests that water level reduction which mainly impacts lake littoral areas has potentially detrimental effects on multiple ecosystem services provided by the lake ecosystem this study aims to describe the long term variability of the lake bracciano levels as a function of climate temperature and precipitation regime and abstraction management the most straightforward and common way to perform this analysis is to describe the processes driving the surface and subsurface flows by means of suitable physical parameter based equations basically mass and energy conservation equations however this approach needs to take into account of a large number of space and time scales which in turn implies the adoption of appropriate equations posing the consequent question of the most suitable scales for parameterization blöschl 2001 sivapalan 2003 therefore in order to adequately describe the hydrology and possibly the hydrogeology of a given catchment area it is necessary to have not only a large number of observations but also consistency of space and time data as well as the scales of the adopted physically based equations for this reasons to overcome the issues arising from a multi scale physical description in the last decade the use of statistical learning approaches has significantly increased ardabili et al 2019 generally these procedures detect and describe statistical patterns in univariate or multivariate datasets regardless of the underlying physical processes among the recent techniques developed and applied for hydrological contexts we shall cite artificial neural networks e g dawson and wilby 2001 bowden et al 2005 abrahart et al 2012 bayesian network aguilera et al 2011 phan et al 2016 support vector machine i e raghavendra and deka 2014 and random forest breiman 2001 naghibi et al 2019 tyralis et al 2019 according to james et al 2013 among these machine learning algorithms rf is considered the most interpretable non parametric approach whereas support vector machine is considered the most interpretable of the parametric techniques furthermore the random forest rf technique has been recognized to be effective at capturing the non linear dependency of predictors and dependent variables boulesteix et al 2012 in addition random forest makes it possible to assess the relative significance of predictor variables by means of variable importance metrics ziegler and könig 2014 díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 this feature is particularly attractive in the lake bracciano case study where as explained in details in section 2 there is insufficient data to determine a reliable water budget i e there is a lack of groundwater flow data thus making it impossible to distinguish between the relative impacts of distinct forcing factors on the variability of l in this study the capability of the rf machine learning approach to estimate the relative impact of climate and management on lake bracciano water levels is tested the results will be analyzed with reference to the potential of the adopted technique in hydrological contexts especially when observations are missing pointing out implications on future management of water abstraction 2 case study lake bracciano is an oligo mesotrophic rossi et al 2010 costantini et al 2018 sub circular volcanic lake located 32 km northwest of rome latium italy this last became active 0 6 ma and was characterized by explosive eruptions causing the deposition of pyroclastic flows and falls e g nicolosi et al 2019 the lake belongs to the sabatino volcanic district which is one of the roman magmatic province district developed during pleistocene times due to the extensional tectonics that led to the tyrrhenian sea opening malinverno and ryan 1986 during this extensional tectonic phase the carbonate substratum was displaced in nw se and ne sw trending horst and graben structures di filippo et al 1998 de rita et al 1996 which allowed a depression today filled by lake bracciano lake bracciano has a surface area of 57 6 km2 a total volume of 5 13 109 m3 and a circular perimeter of 31 981 km rossi et al 2019 with a maximum depth of 165 m fig 1 it has an elevation of 163 04 m a s l altitude of the river arrone emissary here considered as the hydrometric zero of the lake defined as the reference level fig 1 the lake s catchment area measures 147 483 km2 the hydrographic network consisting of several small inflows fig 1 the high percentage of the hydrological and hydrogeological basins covered by the lake itself about 30 makes lake bracciano particularly sensitive to climatic variations taviani and henriksen 2015 rossi et al 2019 2 1 hydrology the lake water balance on a monthly scale can be expressed as 1 δ v i v i v i 1 p i e i q o u t i r i q i g w i n q i g w o u t where v i and v i 1 are the lake volumes at month i and i 1 respectively p i is precipitation over the lake e i is evaporation from the lake surface q o u t i is abstraction from the lake r i is runoff to the lake q i g w i n and q i g w o u t are groundwater inflow and outflow respectively some components of the water budget can be directly measured or estimated on the basis of other observed variables while other terms are missing due to the lack of data specifically v i and v i 1 are calculated from the observed l and the lake s hypsographic curve 2 2 4 p i is recorded with an automatic weather station 2 2 1 e i is estimated by means of the penman monteith equation from automatic weather station and reanalysis data 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 q o u t i is provided by the resource manager acea ato2 2 2 4 neither q i g w i n nor q i g w o u t are not available for this case study due to the lack of continuous measurements of piezometric heads and neither is the surface runoff r i is not measured due to the distinctive hydrographic network which does not have any main tributary suitable for installing automatic hydrometers the lack of these input data prevents the use of a classic modelling approach in order to estimate the lake water budget it is important to stress that previous models taviani and henriksen 2015 aimed at simulating the lake water budget in transient conditions were calibrated with reference to a set of piezometric measurements taken on a single occasion in 2009 and thus did not provide a robust estimate of the hydrodynamics parameters of the aquifer for either its inflow or outflow component in fact the use of a single set of data to calibrate the model in transient conditions necessarily results in the non uniqueness of the calibration procedure therefore the dynamics of the groundwater and surface runoff components are unknown this lack of data does not allow for the adoption of a modelling approach that would produce a sound estimate of the lake water budget 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 precipitation the monthly cumulated precipitation for the 1955 2019 period was measured at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle weather station ws fig 1 managed by servizio meteorologico aeronautica militare www meteoam it for the 1944 1955 period data were collected at the bracciano ws by the lazio regional administration 3 8 km from the aeronautica militare vigna di valle ws fig 1 and for 1921 1944 period data were collected by ispra www isprambiente gov it at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws in order to ensure the homogeneity of the precipitation data the monthly cumulated precipitation time series from the bracciano ws was statistically downscaled to that of the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws which was used as a reference in accordance with a monthly quantile mapping procedure guyennon et al 2013 considering 812 common observations during the 1940 2018 period hereinafter the resulting monthly cumulated precipitation time series from 1921 to 2019 will be referred to as p fig 2 a 2 2 2 temperature this study use minimum and maximum daily temperature data recorded at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws during the 1955 2019 period fig 1 previous data were considered unsuitable due to their fragmentation hereinafter the monthly mean of daily mean temperature will be referred to as t fig 2b 2 2 3 other meteorological data surface evaporation from the lake was estimated using the daily minimum mean and maximum temperature wind speed relative humidity and atmospheric pressure measured at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws for the 2007 2017 period as well as the daily incoming solar radiation obtained from era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 2 2 4 abstraction monthly abstraction from the lake fig 2c has been supplied by the acea ato2 for 1975 2020 period while previous abstraction was assumed constant 1 m3 s 1 acea ato2 personal communication hereinafter the monthly mean of daily mean temperature will be referred as q o u t fig 2b 2 2 5 lake level variations the lake water levels fig 2 d were measured at three hydrometer stations bracciano anguillara and trevignano romano installed by the bracciano martignano park authority fig 1 hereinafter the monthly lake levels will be referred to as l fig 2d 3 methods the relative impacts of the potential drivers of change cliamte and management on the lake levels on short seasonal and long over the 100 years time scales were investigated as follows the precipitation regime was analyzed by means of the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 computed at various time scales coupled with analysis of the linear correlation analysis between precipitation regime and variations in l 3 1 the long term relationships between precipitation and l was further investigated by means of sen s slope method sen 1968 and the cross wavelet analysis grinsted et al 2004 3 2 the possible impact of long term variations in lake evaporation due to the temperature increase observed during the 1955 2019 period was estimated using the penman equation 3 3 finally the relative impacts of meteorological forcing and abstraction pressures were explored by means of a machine learning technique i e random forest 3 4 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 1995 recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 is widely used to represent the anomalies of cumulated precipitation over an assigned time scale usually from 1 to 24 months with respect to standard conditions i e the long term average over a given baseline the spi is computed by fitting the observed cumulative distribution function by means of a gamma distribution and inverting the fitted function on a normal distribution following the approach adopted by nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 who used an spi linear function to compute hydrological indexes multilinear regressions of spis computed over different time scales can be used to represent hydrogeological processes e g springs discharges romano et al 2013 and hydrological processes e g surface runoff guyennon et al 2016 romano et al 2017 2018 the different precipitation time scales in this work from spi1 to spi24 the number indicating the time scale in month are representative of different hydrological processes clearly short time scales reflect rapid responses of the catchment area run off whereas longer time scales up to 24 months represent slower dynamics such as the groundwater flow analysis of the relationship between the spis estimated for a range of time scales and the monthly variations in lake bracciano l makes it possible to account for the various hydrological and hydrogeological processes affecting the oscillation of the lake level 3 2 trends and long term variability we used sen s slope proposed by sen 1968 as a robust linear regression allowing the quantification of the potential linear trends in the time series the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 was used to test the alternative hypothesis that the data follow a monotonic trend e g guyennon et al 2017 thakuri et al 2019 the observed change in long term variability was estimated as the standard deviation of monthly time series of each considered variable based on 10 years moving windows the time series of the frequency content of common oscillations across the time scales were investigated by means of cross wavelet analysis the latter was performed in this study using a free matlab software package proposed by grinsted et al 2004 corrected from the bias in the wavelet power spectrum by adopting a physically consistent definition of energy for the wavelet power spectrum following liu et al 2007 following guyennon et al 2014 we defined the global cross wavelet spectrum gxws for both amplitude and phase as the time integration of the respective coefficients within the 95 confidence interval and a cone of influence this adjusted wavelet power spectrum allowed comparison of global spectral peaks across time scales 3 3 open water surface evaporation penman s combined heat balance and aerodynamic equation penman 1948 1956 romano and giudici 2007 2009 was used to estimate evaporation from the open water surface of lake bracciano for the period 2007 2017 using the modified wind function adopted by linacre 1993 short wave reflectivity and the emissivity coefficients of the water surface as well as longwave radiation coefficients for clear skies were estimated following shuttleworth 1993 to estimate possible long term variations in open water evaporation a mean variation of 2 c 1 1 in air temperature compared to the mean value of the 2007 2017 period was considered the other meteorological parameters that are required in order to compute evaporation via the penman equation i e wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and downward solar radiation were kept unchanged 3 4 random forest random forest rf among the ensemble machine learning methods is a bagging bootstrap aggregating method that generates a large numer of regression trees loh 2011 that are independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the dataset breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 a regression tree splits the predictor space into non overlapping regions in the following the points along the tree where the predictor space is split are referred to as nodes and terminal nodes are referred to as leaf an ensemble of trees is referred to as a forest random forest differs from previous bagging methods breiman 1996 because the regression tree is not only based on a different dataset but also constructed differently through a further random selection of predictors applied at each node the purpose of these two sources of randomness is to decrease the variance of the forest estimator an extensive review of the theoretical aspects of rf can be found in biau and scornet 2016 rf performs very well compared to many other classifiers including discriminant analysis support vector machines and neural networks and is robust against overfitting breiman 2001 all rf results presented below were run using scikit learn a python module integrating a wide range of state of the art machine learning tools pedregosa et al 2011 buitinck et al 2013 3 4 1 hyperparameter tuning while model parameters are learned during the training phase hyperparameters must be set before the training the rf hyperparameters include among others the number of decision trees in the forest and the number of features or variables considered by each tree when splitting a node hyperparameter tuning is obtained by means of a trial and error procedure evaluating a posteriori the performance of each model however evaluating each model on the basis of training set alone can lead to overfitting therefore the hyperparameter optimization involves 5 fold cross validation conducting an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator using gridsearchcv from scikit learn in accordance with paper 2020 the hyperparameters considered in this study are shown in table 1 3 4 2 learning and testing data set for each forest ensemble of regression trees the overall dataset was randomly split into learning and testing datasets each built with half of the overall available data moreover a stratified sampling was applied to the predictand so that each forest uses a learning data set representative of the predictand distribution 3 4 3 variable importance in rf application feature importance or variable importance is used to identify for each forest the relative weight of each variable in estimating the variation in l we calculated the drop column importance of each predictand following strobl et al 2008 and parr et al 2018 the drop column importance of a predictand is computed by comparing the error in a trained rf model to a retrained version of the model from which the feature has been omitted this offers a direct and robust although computationally expensive method for calculating the relative importance of variables it is worth stressing that the method does not normalize the importance values i e the weight of each variable in the prediction the latter can be achieved by dividing the raw importance by its standard error however raw importance has better statistical properties strobl and zeileis 2008 díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 as we are interested in the relative predictive importance of the variable we consider the unscaled values 4 results fig 3 a presents the seasonal annual and bi annual precipitation anomalies as estimated by the spi calculated for precipitation cumulated over 6 12 and 24 months together with l fig 3a right axis most of the variability of l is driven by the long term precipitation anomalies indeed the maximum pearson s correlation coefficient between l and spi over the past century 0 71 is seen at spi24 fig 3b in contrast the correlation reached its lowest value for short term variation spis of a few months the behaviour of the correlation coefficients suggests that the short term hydrological components such as direct precipitation on the lake and runoff impact l only slightly while a greater role is played by slow hydrological dynamics most probably the groundwater flows concerning long term trends sen s slope applied to the l time series indicates a statistically significant downward trend for the 1921 2019 period 0 43 cm y 1 p 0 01 fig 3a suggests that this decrease can be mainly attributed to the long term decrease in precipitation 1 7 mm y 1 p 0 05 over the same period possibly resulting in a decrease in groundwater recharge to better explore the relationship between the slow oscillations in precipitation and the related oscillations in the lake water level a cross wavelet analysis between l and spi24 was conducted this analysis presented in fig 3c shows a continuous common oscillation at the annual scale and a strong in phase intermittent common oscillation at a pluri annual scale ranging from 3 to 5 years centered on 4 5 year fig 3d these large long term common oscillations clearly increase during the last two decades although they can also be observed from mid 1940s to the early 1960s and during the early 1970s but for shorter periods and at lower intensity these results suggest that the recent collapse of l may be driven by an increased in the amplitude of long term precipitation oscillations rather than by a simple linear decrease in precipitation variation not attributable to spi24 may be due to i the response to variation in precipitation on shorter time scales represented by spi1 spi3 spi6 and spi12 consisting of multiscale runoff shallow infiltration and evapotranspiration processes ii variation in open water evaporation on the lake surface iii variation in abstraction fig 4 highlights a sharp increase during the last decade in the long term variation of l fig 4a spi24 fig 4b and q o u t fig 4c in contrast to an earlier period roughly from 1950 to 1965 in which only spi24 and l were affected by increased variability during the last decade increased of l variability roughly from 0 3 to 0 6 m a s l was accompanied by an increase in both spi24 from 0 7 to 1 2 and q o u t from 0 3 to 0 5 m3 s 1 variability the long term variability of air temperature and open water evaporation from the lake are unfortunately not available the impact of increasing mean temperature 0 022 c y 1 over the 1955 2019 period fig 4f on variation in l was considered in terms of the open water evaporation rate fig 4e and q o u t fig 4f the available dataset did not allow for investigation of the impact of increased temperature on vegetation or evapotranspiration and infiltration processes the direct importance of monthly air temperature variability is assessed below in accordance with a machine learning approach 5 1 as presented in 3 3 the possible impact of long term temperature changes on evaporation from the lake was evaluated by means of the penman equation considering a mean variations of 1 c and 1 c with respect to the mean value of the 2007 2017 period roughly representative of pristine and future conditions respectively leaving the other meteorological parameters used to compute evaporation unchanged as shown in fig 4f the considered range of air temperatures did not affect the variability of open water surface evaporation as much as seasonal and inter annual variability much of which is driven by the wind speed not shown similar results were also been reported in rossi et al 2019 the highest sensitivity to mean air temperature is observed in summer jja during which the median difference between median daily evaporation rate under the two scenarios is 0 28 mm day 1 i e less than 0 25 cm over 90 days finally no correlation is observed between mean air temperature and the abstraction time series fig 4f at either the monthly or the annual scale r 0 12 and r 0 03 respectively for the 1980 2019 period indicating that the variability of q o u t observed since the early 1980s was not a response to air temperature 5 discussion 5 1 relative impact of long term precipitation and abstraction patterns on lake water level assessment of the relative contribution of the observed long term precipitation and abstraction to the recent increase in l variations fig 4a is challenging considering the lack of long term groundwater data 2 1 a mass balance approach is not suitable when important terms are not available a multi regression approach based on the assumption of a linear response to spis and abstraction variability gives poor results and suffers from difficulties in both the normalization of abstraction time series data and high sensitivity to the baseline considered for calibration not shown in this section we test the capacity of the rf machine learning approach for estimating the relative contribution of variation in precipitation and abstraction fig 4b and c to l variations fig 4a in order to adequately represent the hydrological processes influencing l variations across different time scales we considered spi1 spi3 spi6 spi12 and spi24 anomalies and at as representative of the variability in the meteorological forcing affecting hydrological processes ranging from superficial runoff and evapotranspiration to groundwater dynamics the time series of q o u t is considered for abstraction in order to take account of systematic seasonality the month indicated by an integer is also considered indeed as shown in romano et al 2017 and romano et al 2019 the impact of the precipitation anomalies represented by spis on the discharge also depends on the months of the year finally a random signal was added in order to monitor the permutation based estimation of the variable s importance estimation the list of hyperparameters showing the best performance is given in table 2 this parameter has been set to obtain the results presented below moreover to monitor the influence of random selection of training and testing dataset on the overall results each forest has been repeated 100 times with a new random seed such solution despite redundant to the rf approach gives a further confidence on the performance and weighting results as it monitors the uncertainty introduced by the random selection of learning training dataset the results of the rf simulations are presented in fig 5 a as the mean value of the 100 runs and associated standard deviation the overall influence of monthly mean air temperature variability on monthly l variability over the period 1955 2019 is shown in fig 5b each boxplot sorted by its own median value shows the drop column importance values over the forests for each considered variable spi24 q o u t and month month number are the variables with greatest importance followed by the spi12 spi3 spi6 and t which show very little importance the importance of month number needs to be analyzed in combination with the associated time scale of the precipitation anomaly indeed the precipitation anomaly at a given time scale can represent a very broad range of values in terms of the amount of water thus having a different impact on l variation due to seasonality e g high precipitation in the summer months has a negligible impact on the lake water budget due to the strong evapotranspiration in other words the month number enables the model to interpret the spis with reference to the month finally no significant difference p 0 98 is observed between the spi1 and the random signal we also compared the performance of the learning and testing process with and without temperature data this is somewhat similar to the drop column importance but even more straightforward whereas a slight but significant p 0 01 improvement in r2 from 0 936 to 0 939 is observed for the learning performance when considering air temperature fig 5c no significant difference is observed in the testing performance fig 5d p 0 15 these results indicate that the variability in monthly mean air temperature has a very small influence on monthly l variations the systematic contribution of seasonality to evaporation rate is sufficiently described by the month number confirming the preliminary results presented in fig 4 in the following we remove spi1 as it makes the same contribution as the random signal and t as it is of very low importance and has no significant impact on overall testing performances from the simulations this makes it possible to considering the whole 1921 2019 period the overall results obtained considering the whole period are shown in fig 6 a black line the training and testing median r2 are 0 94 and 0 74 respectively with a standard deviation associated with learning training random selections of 0 0045 and 0 0020 respectively the associated mean absolute errors are 0 08 and 0 15 m a s l respectively we are interested in the role of the abstraction variability introduced after 1985 figs 2c and 3 c a straightforward way to measure the change in relative importance is to consider different learning periods before and after 1985 the l time series obtained by means of pre and post 1985 learning periods are shwon in fig 6a they present similar performances for both learning and testing r2 0 90 and 0 63 respectively for the 1921 1984 baseline and 0 93 and 0 72 respectively for the 1985 2019 baseline but contrasting results can be observed for their forecast period i e l reconstructed out from the learning testing baseline when learning based on the 1921 1984 the resulting reconstruction underestimates the sharp decrease in l during the second half of the 2000s and second half of the 2010s this is due to the fact that the minimum level observed during the last decade had never been observed before i e during the learning testing baseline and thus the model cannot reproduce them similarly the model does not learn the impact of either the maximum abstraction or minimum spi24 observed during the last decade and therefore may underestimate its relative importance in contrast when learning is based on 1985 2019 although the resulting reconstruction is able to reproduce the l variability fig 4 it introduces a negative bias before 1985 fig 6b and c show the variables importance estimated for the 1920 1984 and 1985 2019 periods respectively before 1985 the relative importance of abstraction is about 24 of that of the long term precipitation anomaly spi24 after 1985 it rises to 39 5 2 contribution of random forest generally the performance of any modeling approach is evaluated with reference to its capacity for predicting and inferring data in order to test hypotheses predicting values beyond the range in the training data and developing possible scenarios james et al 2013 the main contribution of rf in this case study derives from its ability to compensate for the lack of groundwater flow data indeed it was able to predict the observed monthly l based on precipitation anomalies and abstraction time series alone with a training and testing r2 of 0 94 and 0 74 respectively fig 6 this high predictive performance in a context where the processes connecting predictors and predictands occurs over various time scales and overlaps each other illustrates both ability of rf to overcome the multi collinearity that can limit a multi regressive approach over multi scale spis not shown and to capture potential non linear dependencies de andres 2006 boulesteix et al 2012 moreover it is important to stress that being non parametric rf can handle skewed and multi modal data as q o u t not shown in this regards according to james et al 2013 rf can be considered as the most flexible machine learning methods with a wide range of applications in diverse areas tyralis et al 2019 although predictive capacity is obviously a primary requirement unlike the general class of data driven models rf also presents an interesting capacity for inference based on the variable importance metrics e g biau and scornet 2016 in this regards in the present work the main contribution of rf derives from its ability to infer the relative role of direct management and climate forcing i e abstraction and temperature precipitation respectively in determining monthly l variations fig 5 specifically the rf made it possible to highlight a the negligible role of temperature in the local lake dynamics b the major role played by the long term precipitation variability in lake fluctuation over the last century of data c the increasing role of abstraction compared to long term precipitation variability over the last two decades from 24 to 39 fig 6 by comparing the variable s inferred importance over different baselines according to james et al 2013 rf is considered the second least interpretable of the machine learning algorithms following the support vector machines however the use of rf as a generic framework for predictive modelling seems to be its main research function hengl et al 2018 in relation to rf s ability to predict values beyond the range of the training period we observed that the model failed to forecast the minimum l observed during the last two decades when the model was trained with reference to the 1921 1984 period fig 6 this can be considered the main limitation of rf in non stationarity contexts i e that the algorithm cannot extrapolate beyond the training range because the model cannot predict an event that has never been observed before hengl et al 2018 moreover rf cannot adequately model datasets with imbalanced data i e datasets in which the number of observations of a response variable belonging to one class differs significantly compared to other classes schubach et al 2017 in other words less can be learned from rare events than frequent ones this underlying issue is partially addressed in the present study by testing the robustness of variable importance estimation to the random selection of learning training datasets section 5 1 nevertheless the limitation remains if rf is used to provide scenarios especially if the uniqueness of a given situation e g the minimum l observed in 2017 does not allow the model to learn from similar conditions thus preventing the use of rf for unusual management scenarios 6 conclusions in this paper we presented new hydrological insights into lake bracciano a strategic water reservoir for the city of rome specifically this work clarified the relative impact of the two main drivers of change climate and management on water level fluctuations we confirmed the marginal role of temperature the increasing role of abstraction over the last two decades and the major role played by increased variability of precipitation from a methodological point of view the drivers relative impact of drivers was estimated with the random forest machine learning approach the results highlight the potential of the adopted technique in hydrological contexts especially when data are incomplete and present implications for the future management of abstraction we found that random forest is able to assess in the absence of information on the connected groundwater dynamics the relative importance of monthly abstraction multi scale precipitation anomalies and air temperature for the lake level variations specifically in this case study our results indicate that i air temperature and short term precipitation anomalies can safely be ignored ii long term precipitation is the main driver of the lake level variability iii the impact of abstraction on lake level oscillations has growin in the last two decades we concluded by presenting the main limitations of the random forest approach in this context specifically we pointed out that the model failed to predict beyond the range of the training period and thus was not able to predict an event that has never been observed before in contrast the random forest model s main contribution lies in inferring the role of management in a

8138,study region lake bracciano has been historically used as a strategic water reservoir for the city of rome italy since ancient times however following the severe water crisis of 2017 water abstraction has been completely stopped study focus the relative impact of the various drivers of change climatological and management on fluctuations in lake water level is not yet clear to quantify this impact we applied the random forest rf machine learning approach taking advantage of a century of observations new hydrological insights for the region since the late 1990s the monthly variation in lake water levels has doubled as has variation in monthly abstraction increased variation in annual cumulated precipitation and a rise in mean air temperature have also been observed the rf machine learning approach made it possible to confirm the marginal role of temperature the increasing role of abstraction during the last two decades from 24 to 39 and the key role played by the increased precipitation variability these results highlight the notable prediction and inference capabilities of rf in a complex and partially unknown hydrological context we conclude by discussing the limits of this approach which are mainly associated with its capacity to generates scenarios compared to physical based models keywords machine learning random forest lake bracciano climate change water abstraction water management 1 introduction as a consequence of its proximity to the city of rome only 37 km lake bracciano with a surface area of 57 6 km2 has historically been used as a strategic water reservoir since roman times when it was also widely used for fishing and recreational purposes as demonstrated by numerous paintings in nearby roman villas cordiano et al 2014 the natural hydrology of bracciano lake remained unchanged until the 17th century when under pope paolo v a dam was built on the arrone river the natural lake outflow in order to extract water for human consumption and controlling the lake s water level l in case of floods the 1920s saw the start of abstraction by means of hydraulic pumps leading to greater variability of l since 1909 water abstraction from the lake has been managed by the acea water utility abstraction has varied significantly over the years ranging from 0 to more than 2 m3 s 1 after the water crises affecting central italy in 2017 which severely impacted lake bracciano rossi et al 2019 abstraction is currently interrupted and the lake is considered an emergency resource to be used only in the event of significant water scarcity acea 2015 low l was recorded in 1955 1990 2003 and 2008 but the absolute minimum was recorded in 2017 198 cm as a consequence serious management concerns have been raised in recent years currently the relative impact of the various drivers of change climate and management on the lake water level fluctuations is still not clear as presented in details in 2 1 it is known that the water budget of lake bracciano is driven by both surface and sub surface flows although the relative contribution of these components is not clear taviani and henriksen 2015 regarding the quantitative management of the resource a sound knowledge of the lake water budget as well as its temporal hydrogeological dynamics is fundamental for developing effective policies over a range of time scales on the one hand the lake bracciano is currently considered an emergency resource to be used only in the event of failure of the main resources supplying the city of rome under ordinary conditions and therefore the impact of a sudden and intense abstraction must be carefully evaluated on the other hand exploitation of the lake over longer periods years needs to take account of the normal fluctuation of the water level due to multi years or decadal oscillations in precipitation romano and preziosi 2013 which is possibly affected by climate change armenia et al 2019 considering the qualitative aspects water level fluctuations can strongly impact the lake ecosystem and consequently ecosystem services provided to the local economy galloway et al 2003 kendall et al 2010 calizza et al 2021 previous studies show in the last 20 years major alterations to lake ecosystem functioning such as the near or complete disappearance of littoral habitats and the reduction by several tens of hectares of deep water plant communities such as charophytes carpenter and lodge 1986 azzella 2014 azzella et al 2017 the direct consequence of large fluctuations in water levels was the eutrophication of the banks with consequent invasion of the riparian communities by alien species and the alteration of the fauna in terms of both vertebrate species and riparian and aquatic invertebrates azzella 2014 baccetti et al 2017 l fluctuations generally impact the riparian vegetation with a consequent damage to lake self purification processes fundamental for maintaining water quality as a resource for human consumption but also for maintaining appropriate habitats for biodiversity conservation ostroumov 2017 calizza et al 2021 as an example two recent studies from the lake costantini et al 2018 calizza et al 2021 demonstrated that the loss of riparian and submerged vegetation in the proximity of the lake shore made lake fish communities vulnerable to the invasion by a bass species micropterus salmoides leading to reduced fish diversity and altered food web structure calizza et al 2021 found that 100 linear meters of highly vegetated lake shores reduced the economic impact of the invader on the two most commercially valuable fish species by approximately 1400 per year in comparison to poorly vegetated areas this suggests that water level reduction which mainly impacts lake littoral areas has potentially detrimental effects on multiple ecosystem services provided by the lake ecosystem this study aims to describe the long term variability of the lake bracciano levels as a function of climate temperature and precipitation regime and abstraction management the most straightforward and common way to perform this analysis is to describe the processes driving the surface and subsurface flows by means of suitable physical parameter based equations basically mass and energy conservation equations however this approach needs to take into account of a large number of space and time scales which in turn implies the adoption of appropriate equations posing the consequent question of the most suitable scales for parameterization blöschl 2001 sivapalan 2003 therefore in order to adequately describe the hydrology and possibly the hydrogeology of a given catchment area it is necessary to have not only a large number of observations but also consistency of space and time data as well as the scales of the adopted physically based equations for this reasons to overcome the issues arising from a multi scale physical description in the last decade the use of statistical learning approaches has significantly increased ardabili et al 2019 generally these procedures detect and describe statistical patterns in univariate or multivariate datasets regardless of the underlying physical processes among the recent techniques developed and applied for hydrological contexts we shall cite artificial neural networks e g dawson and wilby 2001 bowden et al 2005 abrahart et al 2012 bayesian network aguilera et al 2011 phan et al 2016 support vector machine i e raghavendra and deka 2014 and random forest breiman 2001 naghibi et al 2019 tyralis et al 2019 according to james et al 2013 among these machine learning algorithms rf is considered the most interpretable non parametric approach whereas support vector machine is considered the most interpretable of the parametric techniques furthermore the random forest rf technique has been recognized to be effective at capturing the non linear dependency of predictors and dependent variables boulesteix et al 2012 in addition random forest makes it possible to assess the relative significance of predictor variables by means of variable importance metrics ziegler and könig 2014 díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 this feature is particularly attractive in the lake bracciano case study where as explained in details in section 2 there is insufficient data to determine a reliable water budget i e there is a lack of groundwater flow data thus making it impossible to distinguish between the relative impacts of distinct forcing factors on the variability of l in this study the capability of the rf machine learning approach to estimate the relative impact of climate and management on lake bracciano water levels is tested the results will be analyzed with reference to the potential of the adopted technique in hydrological contexts especially when observations are missing pointing out implications on future management of water abstraction 2 case study lake bracciano is an oligo mesotrophic rossi et al 2010 costantini et al 2018 sub circular volcanic lake located 32 km northwest of rome latium italy this last became active 0 6 ma and was characterized by explosive eruptions causing the deposition of pyroclastic flows and falls e g nicolosi et al 2019 the lake belongs to the sabatino volcanic district which is one of the roman magmatic province district developed during pleistocene times due to the extensional tectonics that led to the tyrrhenian sea opening malinverno and ryan 1986 during this extensional tectonic phase the carbonate substratum was displaced in nw se and ne sw trending horst and graben structures di filippo et al 1998 de rita et al 1996 which allowed a depression today filled by lake bracciano lake bracciano has a surface area of 57 6 km2 a total volume of 5 13 109 m3 and a circular perimeter of 31 981 km rossi et al 2019 with a maximum depth of 165 m fig 1 it has an elevation of 163 04 m a s l altitude of the river arrone emissary here considered as the hydrometric zero of the lake defined as the reference level fig 1 the lake s catchment area measures 147 483 km2 the hydrographic network consisting of several small inflows fig 1 the high percentage of the hydrological and hydrogeological basins covered by the lake itself about 30 makes lake bracciano particularly sensitive to climatic variations taviani and henriksen 2015 rossi et al 2019 2 1 hydrology the lake water balance on a monthly scale can be expressed as 1 δ v i v i v i 1 p i e i q o u t i r i q i g w i n q i g w o u t where v i and v i 1 are the lake volumes at month i and i 1 respectively p i is precipitation over the lake e i is evaporation from the lake surface q o u t i is abstraction from the lake r i is runoff to the lake q i g w i n and q i g w o u t are groundwater inflow and outflow respectively some components of the water budget can be directly measured or estimated on the basis of other observed variables while other terms are missing due to the lack of data specifically v i and v i 1 are calculated from the observed l and the lake s hypsographic curve 2 2 4 p i is recorded with an automatic weather station 2 2 1 e i is estimated by means of the penman monteith equation from automatic weather station and reanalysis data 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 q o u t i is provided by the resource manager acea ato2 2 2 4 neither q i g w i n nor q i g w o u t are not available for this case study due to the lack of continuous measurements of piezometric heads and neither is the surface runoff r i is not measured due to the distinctive hydrographic network which does not have any main tributary suitable for installing automatic hydrometers the lack of these input data prevents the use of a classic modelling approach in order to estimate the lake water budget it is important to stress that previous models taviani and henriksen 2015 aimed at simulating the lake water budget in transient conditions were calibrated with reference to a set of piezometric measurements taken on a single occasion in 2009 and thus did not provide a robust estimate of the hydrodynamics parameters of the aquifer for either its inflow or outflow component in fact the use of a single set of data to calibrate the model in transient conditions necessarily results in the non uniqueness of the calibration procedure therefore the dynamics of the groundwater and surface runoff components are unknown this lack of data does not allow for the adoption of a modelling approach that would produce a sound estimate of the lake water budget 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 precipitation the monthly cumulated precipitation for the 1955 2019 period was measured at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle weather station ws fig 1 managed by servizio meteorologico aeronautica militare www meteoam it for the 1944 1955 period data were collected at the bracciano ws by the lazio regional administration 3 8 km from the aeronautica militare vigna di valle ws fig 1 and for 1921 1944 period data were collected by ispra www isprambiente gov it at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws in order to ensure the homogeneity of the precipitation data the monthly cumulated precipitation time series from the bracciano ws was statistically downscaled to that of the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws which was used as a reference in accordance with a monthly quantile mapping procedure guyennon et al 2013 considering 812 common observations during the 1940 2018 period hereinafter the resulting monthly cumulated precipitation time series from 1921 to 2019 will be referred to as p fig 2 a 2 2 2 temperature this study use minimum and maximum daily temperature data recorded at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws during the 1955 2019 period fig 1 previous data were considered unsuitable due to their fragmentation hereinafter the monthly mean of daily mean temperature will be referred to as t fig 2b 2 2 3 other meteorological data surface evaporation from the lake was estimated using the daily minimum mean and maximum temperature wind speed relative humidity and atmospheric pressure measured at the aeronautica militare di vigna di valle ws for the 2007 2017 period as well as the daily incoming solar radiation obtained from era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 2 2 4 abstraction monthly abstraction from the lake fig 2c has been supplied by the acea ato2 for 1975 2020 period while previous abstraction was assumed constant 1 m3 s 1 acea ato2 personal communication hereinafter the monthly mean of daily mean temperature will be referred as q o u t fig 2b 2 2 5 lake level variations the lake water levels fig 2 d were measured at three hydrometer stations bracciano anguillara and trevignano romano installed by the bracciano martignano park authority fig 1 hereinafter the monthly lake levels will be referred to as l fig 2d 3 methods the relative impacts of the potential drivers of change cliamte and management on the lake levels on short seasonal and long over the 100 years time scales were investigated as follows the precipitation regime was analyzed by means of the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 computed at various time scales coupled with analysis of the linear correlation analysis between precipitation regime and variations in l 3 1 the long term relationships between precipitation and l was further investigated by means of sen s slope method sen 1968 and the cross wavelet analysis grinsted et al 2004 3 2 the possible impact of long term variations in lake evaporation due to the temperature increase observed during the 1955 2019 period was estimated using the penman equation 3 3 finally the relative impacts of meteorological forcing and abstraction pressures were explored by means of a machine learning technique i e random forest 3 4 3 1 standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 1995 recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 is widely used to represent the anomalies of cumulated precipitation over an assigned time scale usually from 1 to 24 months with respect to standard conditions i e the long term average over a given baseline the spi is computed by fitting the observed cumulative distribution function by means of a gamma distribution and inverting the fitted function on a normal distribution following the approach adopted by nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 who used an spi linear function to compute hydrological indexes multilinear regressions of spis computed over different time scales can be used to represent hydrogeological processes e g springs discharges romano et al 2013 and hydrological processes e g surface runoff guyennon et al 2016 romano et al 2017 2018 the different precipitation time scales in this work from spi1 to spi24 the number indicating the time scale in month are representative of different hydrological processes clearly short time scales reflect rapid responses of the catchment area run off whereas longer time scales up to 24 months represent slower dynamics such as the groundwater flow analysis of the relationship between the spis estimated for a range of time scales and the monthly variations in lake bracciano l makes it possible to account for the various hydrological and hydrogeological processes affecting the oscillation of the lake level 3 2 trends and long term variability we used sen s slope proposed by sen 1968 as a robust linear regression allowing the quantification of the potential linear trends in the time series the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 was used to test the alternative hypothesis that the data follow a monotonic trend e g guyennon et al 2017 thakuri et al 2019 the observed change in long term variability was estimated as the standard deviation of monthly time series of each considered variable based on 10 years moving windows the time series of the frequency content of common oscillations across the time scales were investigated by means of cross wavelet analysis the latter was performed in this study using a free matlab software package proposed by grinsted et al 2004 corrected from the bias in the wavelet power spectrum by adopting a physically consistent definition of energy for the wavelet power spectrum following liu et al 2007 following guyennon et al 2014 we defined the global cross wavelet spectrum gxws for both amplitude and phase as the time integration of the respective coefficients within the 95 confidence interval and a cone of influence this adjusted wavelet power spectrum allowed comparison of global spectral peaks across time scales 3 3 open water surface evaporation penman s combined heat balance and aerodynamic equation penman 1948 1956 romano and giudici 2007 2009 was used to estimate evaporation from the open water surface of lake bracciano for the period 2007 2017 using the modified wind function adopted by linacre 1993 short wave reflectivity and the emissivity coefficients of the water surface as well as longwave radiation coefficients for clear skies were estimated following shuttleworth 1993 to estimate possible long term variations in open water evaporation a mean variation of 2 c 1 1 in air temperature compared to the mean value of the 2007 2017 period was considered the other meteorological parameters that are required in order to compute evaporation via the penman equation i e wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and downward solar radiation were kept unchanged 3 4 random forest random forest rf among the ensemble machine learning methods is a bagging bootstrap aggregating method that generates a large numer of regression trees loh 2011 that are independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the dataset breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 a regression tree splits the predictor space into non overlapping regions in the following the points along the tree where the predictor space is split are referred to as nodes and terminal nodes are referred to as leaf an ensemble of trees is referred to as a forest random forest differs from previous bagging methods breiman 1996 because the regression tree is not only based on a different dataset but also constructed differently through a further random selection of predictors applied at each node the purpose of these two sources of randomness is to decrease the variance of the forest estimator an extensive review of the theoretical aspects of rf can be found in biau and scornet 2016 rf performs very well compared to many other classifiers including discriminant analysis support vector machines and neural networks and is robust against overfitting breiman 2001 all rf results presented below were run using scikit learn a python module integrating a wide range of state of the art machine learning tools pedregosa et al 2011 buitinck et al 2013 3 4 1 hyperparameter tuning while model parameters are learned during the training phase hyperparameters must be set before the training the rf hyperparameters include among others the number of decision trees in the forest and the number of features or variables considered by each tree when splitting a node hyperparameter tuning is obtained by means of a trial and error procedure evaluating a posteriori the performance of each model however evaluating each model on the basis of training set alone can lead to overfitting therefore the hyperparameter optimization involves 5 fold cross validation conducting an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator using gridsearchcv from scikit learn in accordance with paper 2020 the hyperparameters considered in this study are shown in table 1 3 4 2 learning and testing data set for each forest ensemble of regression trees the overall dataset was randomly split into learning and testing datasets each built with half of the overall available data moreover a stratified sampling was applied to the predictand so that each forest uses a learning data set representative of the predictand distribution 3 4 3 variable importance in rf application feature importance or variable importance is used to identify for each forest the relative weight of each variable in estimating the variation in l we calculated the drop column importance of each predictand following strobl et al 2008 and parr et al 2018 the drop column importance of a predictand is computed by comparing the error in a trained rf model to a retrained version of the model from which the feature has been omitted this offers a direct and robust although computationally expensive method for calculating the relative importance of variables it is worth stressing that the method does not normalize the importance values i e the weight of each variable in the prediction the latter can be achieved by dividing the raw importance by its standard error however raw importance has better statistical properties strobl and zeileis 2008 díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 as we are interested in the relative predictive importance of the variable we consider the unscaled values 4 results fig 3 a presents the seasonal annual and bi annual precipitation anomalies as estimated by the spi calculated for precipitation cumulated over 6 12 and 24 months together with l fig 3a right axis most of the variability of l is driven by the long term precipitation anomalies indeed the maximum pearson s correlation coefficient between l and spi over the past century 0 71 is seen at spi24 fig 3b in contrast the correlation reached its lowest value for short term variation spis of a few months the behaviour of the correlation coefficients suggests that the short term hydrological components such as direct precipitation on the lake and runoff impact l only slightly while a greater role is played by slow hydrological dynamics most probably the groundwater flows concerning long term trends sen s slope applied to the l time series indicates a statistically significant downward trend for the 1921 2019 period 0 43 cm y 1 p 0 01 fig 3a suggests that this decrease can be mainly attributed to the long term decrease in precipitation 1 7 mm y 1 p 0 05 over the same period possibly resulting in a decrease in groundwater recharge to better explore the relationship between the slow oscillations in precipitation and the related oscillations in the lake water level a cross wavelet analysis between l and spi24 was conducted this analysis presented in fig 3c shows a continuous common oscillation at the annual scale and a strong in phase intermittent common oscillation at a pluri annual scale ranging from 3 to 5 years centered on 4 5 year fig 3d these large long term common oscillations clearly increase during the last two decades although they can also be observed from mid 1940s to the early 1960s and during the early 1970s but for shorter periods and at lower intensity these results suggest that the recent collapse of l may be driven by an increased in the amplitude of long term precipitation oscillations rather than by a simple linear decrease in precipitation variation not attributable to spi24 may be due to i the response to variation in precipitation on shorter time scales represented by spi1 spi3 spi6 and spi12 consisting of multiscale runoff shallow infiltration and evapotranspiration processes ii variation in open water evaporation on the lake surface iii variation in abstraction fig 4 highlights a sharp increase during the last decade in the long term variation of l fig 4a spi24 fig 4b and q o u t fig 4c in contrast to an earlier period roughly from 1950 to 1965 in which only spi24 and l were affected by increased variability during the last decade increased of l variability roughly from 0 3 to 0 6 m a s l was accompanied by an increase in both spi24 from 0 7 to 1 2 and q o u t from 0 3 to 0 5 m3 s 1 variability the long term variability of air temperature and open water evaporation from the lake are unfortunately not available the impact of increasing mean temperature 0 022 c y 1 over the 1955 2019 period fig 4f on variation in l was considered in terms of the open water evaporation rate fig 4e and q o u t fig 4f the available dataset did not allow for investigation of the impact of increased temperature on vegetation or evapotranspiration and infiltration processes the direct importance of monthly air temperature variability is assessed below in accordance with a machine learning approach 5 1 as presented in 3 3 the possible impact of long term temperature changes on evaporation from the lake was evaluated by means of the penman equation considering a mean variations of 1 c and 1 c with respect to the mean value of the 2007 2017 period roughly representative of pristine and future conditions respectively leaving the other meteorological parameters used to compute evaporation unchanged as shown in fig 4f the considered range of air temperatures did not affect the variability of open water surface evaporation as much as seasonal and inter annual variability much of which is driven by the wind speed not shown similar results were also been reported in rossi et al 2019 the highest sensitivity to mean air temperature is observed in summer jja during which the median difference between median daily evaporation rate under the two scenarios is 0 28 mm day 1 i e less than 0 25 cm over 90 days finally no correlation is observed between mean air temperature and the abstraction time series fig 4f at either the monthly or the annual scale r 0 12 and r 0 03 respectively for the 1980 2019 period indicating that the variability of q o u t observed since the early 1980s was not a response to air temperature 5 discussion 5 1 relative impact of long term precipitation and abstraction patterns on lake water level assessment of the relative contribution of the observed long term precipitation and abstraction to the recent increase in l variations fig 4a is challenging considering the lack of long term groundwater data 2 1 a mass balance approach is not suitable when important terms are not available a multi regression approach based on the assumption of a linear response to spis and abstraction variability gives poor results and suffers from difficulties in both the normalization of abstraction time series data and high sensitivity to the baseline considered for calibration not shown in this section we test the capacity of the rf machine learning approach for estimating the relative contribution of variation in precipitation and abstraction fig 4b and c to l variations fig 4a in order to adequately represent the hydrological processes influencing l variations across different time scales we considered spi1 spi3 spi6 spi12 and spi24 anomalies and at as representative of the variability in the meteorological forcing affecting hydrological processes ranging from superficial runoff and evapotranspiration to groundwater dynamics the time series of q o u t is considered for abstraction in order to take account of systematic seasonality the month indicated by an integer is also considered indeed as shown in romano et al 2017 and romano et al 2019 the impact of the precipitation anomalies represented by spis on the discharge also depends on the months of the year finally a random signal was added in order to monitor the permutation based estimation of the variable s importance estimation the list of hyperparameters showing the best performance is given in table 2 this parameter has been set to obtain the results presented below moreover to monitor the influence of random selection of training and testing dataset on the overall results each forest has been repeated 100 times with a new random seed such solution despite redundant to the rf approach gives a further confidence on the performance and weighting results as it monitors the uncertainty introduced by the random selection of learning training dataset the results of the rf simulations are presented in fig 5 a as the mean value of the 100 runs and associated standard deviation the overall influence of monthly mean air temperature variability on monthly l variability over the period 1955 2019 is shown in fig 5b each boxplot sorted by its own median value shows the drop column importance values over the forests for each considered variable spi24 q o u t and month month number are the variables with greatest importance followed by the spi12 spi3 spi6 and t which show very little importance the importance of month number needs to be analyzed in combination with the associated time scale of the precipitation anomaly indeed the precipitation anomaly at a given time scale can represent a very broad range of values in terms of the amount of water thus having a different impact on l variation due to seasonality e g high precipitation in the summer months has a negligible impact on the lake water budget due to the strong evapotranspiration in other words the month number enables the model to interpret the spis with reference to the month finally no significant difference p 0 98 is observed between the spi1 and the random signal we also compared the performance of the learning and testing process with and without temperature data this is somewhat similar to the drop column importance but even more straightforward whereas a slight but significant p 0 01 improvement in r2 from 0 936 to 0 939 is observed for the learning performance when considering air temperature fig 5c no significant difference is observed in the testing performance fig 5d p 0 15 these results indicate that the variability in monthly mean air temperature has a very small influence on monthly l variations the systematic contribution of seasonality to evaporation rate is sufficiently described by the month number confirming the preliminary results presented in fig 4 in the following we remove spi1 as it makes the same contribution as the random signal and t as it is of very low importance and has no significant impact on overall testing performances from the simulations this makes it possible to considering the whole 1921 2019 period the overall results obtained considering the whole period are shown in fig 6 a black line the training and testing median r2 are 0 94 and 0 74 respectively with a standard deviation associated with learning training random selections of 0 0045 and 0 0020 respectively the associated mean absolute errors are 0 08 and 0 15 m a s l respectively we are interested in the role of the abstraction variability introduced after 1985 figs 2c and 3 c a straightforward way to measure the change in relative importance is to consider different learning periods before and after 1985 the l time series obtained by means of pre and post 1985 learning periods are shwon in fig 6a they present similar performances for both learning and testing r2 0 90 and 0 63 respectively for the 1921 1984 baseline and 0 93 and 0 72 respectively for the 1985 2019 baseline but contrasting results can be observed for their forecast period i e l reconstructed out from the learning testing baseline when learning based on the 1921 1984 the resulting reconstruction underestimates the sharp decrease in l during the second half of the 2000s and second half of the 2010s this is due to the fact that the minimum level observed during the last decade had never been observed before i e during the learning testing baseline and thus the model cannot reproduce them similarly the model does not learn the impact of either the maximum abstraction or minimum spi24 observed during the last decade and therefore may underestimate its relative importance in contrast when learning is based on 1985 2019 although the resulting reconstruction is able to reproduce the l variability fig 4 it introduces a negative bias before 1985 fig 6b and c show the variables importance estimated for the 1920 1984 and 1985 2019 periods respectively before 1985 the relative importance of abstraction is about 24 of that of the long term precipitation anomaly spi24 after 1985 it rises to 39 5 2 contribution of random forest generally the performance of any modeling approach is evaluated with reference to its capacity for predicting and inferring data in order to test hypotheses predicting values beyond the range in the training data and developing possible scenarios james et al 2013 the main contribution of rf in this case study derives from its ability to compensate for the lack of groundwater flow data indeed it was able to predict the observed monthly l based on precipitation anomalies and abstraction time series alone with a training and testing r2 of 0 94 and 0 74 respectively fig 6 this high predictive performance in a context where the processes connecting predictors and predictands occurs over various time scales and overlaps each other illustrates both ability of rf to overcome the multi collinearity that can limit a multi regressive approach over multi scale spis not shown and to capture potential non linear dependencies de andres 2006 boulesteix et al 2012 moreover it is important to stress that being non parametric rf can handle skewed and multi modal data as q o u t not shown in this regards according to james et al 2013 rf can be considered as the most flexible machine learning methods with a wide range of applications in diverse areas tyralis et al 2019 although predictive capacity is obviously a primary requirement unlike the general class of data driven models rf also presents an interesting capacity for inference based on the variable importance metrics e g biau and scornet 2016 in this regards in the present work the main contribution of rf derives from its ability to infer the relative role of direct management and climate forcing i e abstraction and temperature precipitation respectively in determining monthly l variations fig 5 specifically the rf made it possible to highlight a the negligible role of temperature in the local lake dynamics b the major role played by the long term precipitation variability in lake fluctuation over the last century of data c the increasing role of abstraction compared to long term precipitation variability over the last two decades from 24 to 39 fig 6 by comparing the variable s inferred importance over different baselines according to james et al 2013 rf is considered the second least interpretable of the machine learning algorithms following the support vector machines however the use of rf as a generic framework for predictive modelling seems to be its main research function hengl et al 2018 in relation to rf s ability to predict values beyond the range of the training period we observed that the model failed to forecast the minimum l observed during the last two decades when the model was trained with reference to the 1921 1984 period fig 6 this can be considered the main limitation of rf in non stationarity contexts i e that the algorithm cannot extrapolate beyond the training range because the model cannot predict an event that has never been observed before hengl et al 2018 moreover rf cannot adequately model datasets with imbalanced data i e datasets in which the number of observations of a response variable belonging to one class differs significantly compared to other classes schubach et al 2017 in other words less can be learned from rare events than frequent ones this underlying issue is partially addressed in the present study by testing the robustness of variable importance estimation to the random selection of learning training datasets section 5 1 nevertheless the limitation remains if rf is used to provide scenarios especially if the uniqueness of a given situation e g the minimum l observed in 2017 does not allow the model to learn from similar conditions thus preventing the use of rf for unusual management scenarios 6 conclusions in this paper we presented new hydrological insights into lake bracciano a strategic water reservoir for the city of rome specifically this work clarified the relative impact of the two main drivers of change climate and management on water level fluctuations we confirmed the marginal role of temperature the increasing role of abstraction over the last two decades and the major role played by increased variability of precipitation from a methodological point of view the drivers relative impact of drivers was estimated with the random forest machine learning approach the results highlight the potential of the adopted technique in hydrological contexts especially when data are incomplete and present implications for the future management of abstraction we found that random forest is able to assess in the absence of information on the connected groundwater dynamics the relative importance of monthly abstraction multi scale precipitation anomalies and air temperature for the lake level variations specifically in this case study our results indicate that i air temperature and short term precipitation anomalies can safely be ignored ii long term precipitation is the main driver of the lake level variability iii the impact of abstraction on lake level oscillations has growin in the last two decades we concluded by presenting the main limitations of the random forest approach in this context specifically we pointed out that the model failed to predict beyond the range of the training period and thus was not able to predict an event that has never been observed before in contrast the random forest model s main contribution lies in inferring the role of management in a

8139,study region panxi mining area 15061 km2 located in sichuan china study focus this study aims to delineate groundwater potential zones in mining areas using a new method based on the cusp catastrophe model ccm and principal component analysis pca first 13 indicators were selected from natural and anthropogenic dimensions and a comprehensive analysis of the indicators was performed using pca second the results of the pca were considered as control variables and the ccm was used for groundwater potential evaluation modeling finally the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was used to validate the new method and compare it with catastrophe fuzzy membership functions cfmfs new hydrological insights for the region the results suggest that the area under the roc curve of the success and prediction rate accounted for approximately 0 85 and 0 76 respectively in the new method which were higher than those in the cfmfs the largest area 39 with groundwater potential in the study area has a moderate groundwater potential status followed by an area 28 with a good status an area 20 with a poor status and areas 12 and 1 with very good and very poor statuses respectively the groundwater potential in the study area was unevenly distributed and changed drastically topography drainage density and land use land cover had the highest contribution in the modeling process keywords groundwater potential mapping groundwater management spatial modeling multicriteria decision making evaluation indicators 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most extensive freshwater resources worldwide and is closely related to daily life and material infrastructure for human survival and development aeschbach hertig et al 2012 jha 2013 because of its constant temperature extensive and continuous cycle regeneration good water quality and stability it has become an essential and reliable source of water supply for countries and regions with different climatic zones and economic development levels todd and mays 2005 with the rapid development of the social economy china s demand for mineral resources has increased wen et al 2019 and long term and large scale mining has caused severe damage to the environment in particular drainage pits cause the groundwater level to decrease which consequently affects the groundwater flow system zhu et al 2014 this condition in turn poses severe threats to the lives of residents and the safety of irrigation water post et al 2020 therefore the construction of a suitable model is urgently needed for the evaluation of groundwater potential in mining areas for the protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in such areas in traditional groundwater exploration methods the various factors that control the occurrence and movement of groundwater are not always considered the associated cost is extremely high and the timeliness is poor oh et al 2011 razandi et al 2015 in recent years remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technologies have provided systematic rapid and excellent configurations for processing large and complex spatial data affording opportunities for understanding the complex issues related to groundwater exploration murmu et al 2019 numerous studies have also been performed to evaluate groundwater potential using machine learning models based on gis and rs technologies for example kumar and krishna 2018 used geospatial techniques and an analytic hierarchy process ahp which have strong applicability in determining indicator weights to delineate groundwater potential areas in the indian rhargarh and hazaribagh regions however the results obtained are highly subjective and vary according to the opinions of experts dai et al 2009 manap et al 2014 applied the frequency ratio model frm to create a groundwater level map of malaysia s langat basin and verified the evaluation results with an accuracy of 84 78 although the calculation and output processes of the frm are straightforward and easy to understand the evaluation results are directly related to the number of samples used in the evaluation yilmaz 2009 ozdemir 2011 used the logistic regression method lrm in the gis environment and selected 17 factors to construct the groundwater spring potential map of the sudan mountain in central turkey the lrm offers the advantages of simplicity fast training speed and reasonable probability interpretation of the output variables however it can only be applied in the case of large sample sizes which often leads to the multicollinearity problem asar 2017 naghibi et al 2017a stated that the random forest rf and genetic algorithm optimized random forest methods are more effective than the support vector machine svm for groundwater potential evaluation although the rf has high accuracy and efficiency and can directly process high dimensional data it is complex and requires more training time than other similar algorithms cheng et al 2014 lee et al 2019 applied an artificial neural network ann to predict the groundwater level in yangpyeong county of south korea and suggested that the river water level is the main factor affecting groundwater level fluctuations anns can automatically adjust the weight of an evaluation indicator and feature strong adaptability however they often suffer from the overfitting problem when the training samples are insufficient or over trained krizhevsky et al 2012 some scholars have also used various combination of models to evaluate the groundwater potential examples include the fuzzy ahp azimi et al 2018 weighted index overlays and two dimensional electrical resistivity tomography gyeltshen et al 2020 evidence belief function and boosted regression tree kordestani et al 2019 evidential belief function and tree based models naghibi et al 2019 ann and real adaboost nguyen et al 2020 and gray clustering method and ahp sahoo et al 2017 although the abovementioned methods can quantitatively or qualitatively reflect the groundwater potential they tend to seek for a superior model through an inter comparison of multiple models without adequate attention to maximizing the learning from these models karimi et al 2020 in addition most of the existing multiobjective decision making methods are uncertain in terms of solving the nonlinear and discontinuity problems between evaluation indicators and their calculation process is complicated singh et al 2009 catastrophe theory ct is a system theory proposed by rene thom this theory is based on topology the singularity theory and the system structural stability theory it is used to study the mutations caused by gradual changes zeeman 1979 compared with other methods ct shows acceptable performance and is an objective approach to solve the catastrophic problem of discontinuous changes in natural systems and social fields liu et al 2015 it has also been widely used in studies on groundwater potential ahmed et al 2015 al abadi et al 2015 sadeghfam et al 2016 in addition sadeghfam et al 2020a b 2021 applied ct to groundwater over abstraction groundwater vulnerability and groundwater pollution and achieved good results these aforementioned studies prove that an integrated model based on ct can effectively improve the objectivity of research results such an approach typically involves the use of catastrophe fuzzy membership functions cfmfs however uncertainties in the cfmfs arise when determining the priority sequence of control variables in catastrophe subordinate systems to solve the uncertainties in existing studies using ct to evaluate groundwater potential the coordinate transformation technology was employed for applying the cusp catastrophe model ccm in ct and principal component analysis pca in groundwater potential evaluation modeling thus the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 to consider the panxi mining area china as an example collect spatiotemporal data related to groundwater potential in the study area and establish an evaluation indicator system 2 to use pca for natural and anthropogenic indicators and perform a statistical analysis of the pca results and 3 to develop a method suitable for the groundwater potential evaluation in mining areas based on the pca results and ccm and verify the effectiveness of this method 2 study area the panxi mining area is located in the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau fig 1 southwestern warm and wet monsoons originating from the indian ocean are obstructed by the hengduan mountains resulting in the foehn effect in the study area huan cheng and mcconchie 2001 the wet and dry seasons in the study area are clearly distinguishable the annual average temperature is 16 c 17 c the precipitation is 800 1200 mm and the annual evaporation in the valley area is three to six times the precipitation wang et al 2018 the study area is characterized by alpine valleys as dominant landforms at an altitude of 645 4167 m this area constitutes china s substantial ferrous and non ferrous metal mining base wu and zhang 2019 mining in the study area has led to a decline in the groundwater level which has increased the competition between residents living and irrigation water especially during winter when the rainfall declines resulting in a decrease in the groundwater level therefore it is necessary to accurately evaluate the groundwater potential of the study area and understand its change process given the significance of the groundwater potential in the management and protection of groundwater resources in a particular area according to the characteristics of the aquifer group and the occurrence conditions of groundwater the study area can be divided into four types of aquifers dai 2016 1 quaternary loose rock weak aquifer it is mainly composed of gravel sand and sandy clay it features loose lithology large porosity and low water content 2 clastic rock weak water bearing group this group is distributed over most regions in the study area and is dominated by sandstone siltstone and mudstone hence it is a relatively water resistant layer the rock formation has developed fissures and exposed many springs and the spring flow rate is 0 1 1 2 l s 3 basalt water bearing rock group it is composed of basalt purple tuffaceous sandstone and tuff surface weathering cracks have been developed with a weathering thickness of 0 5 1 2 m the overall water content is low and the spring flow is less than 0 1 l s 4 carbonate water bearing rock group it is composed of dolomite shale and limestone its water content is high and the spring flow rate is 8 7 l s 3 methodology the proposed method involves three steps fig 2 1 an indicator system based on natural and anthropogenic factors was constructed and the pca was used for a comprehensive analysis of these factors 2 the pca results were considered as control variables coordinate transformation technology was used for applying the ccm to the groundwater potential evaluation modeling and the feasibility of the model was verified 3 the new integrated method was applied for the groundwater potential evaluation of the study area in 2000 2010 and 2020 and characteristics of the groundwater potential distribution and change process within the study area were analyzed 3 1 evaluation indicator system and data collection 3 1 1 evaluation indicator system the factors that influence groundwater potential are geology topography meteorology hydrology vegetation and human activities jenifer and jha 2017 accordingly based on previous studies chen et al 2018 rizeei et al 2019 an evaluation indicator system for the study area was constructed considering both natural and anthropogenic aspects in this indicator system 10 natural factors and three anthropogenic factors were included the reasons governing the selection of these indicators are listed in table 1 3 1 2 data collection and processing the data types and sources adopted in this study with regard to the evaluation indicator system are listed in table 2 the collected data were processed according to an evaluation indicator system this processing method is detailed below 1 the digital elevation model dem for the study area was obtained from the geospatial data cloud china using the spatial analysis tools in arcgis most of the natural factors were derived from dem data including the twi spi slope elevation and water system 1 t w i ln e t a n f 2 s p i e t a n f where e is the specific catchment area and f is the local slope gradient 2 lulc type information was obtained through a classification of landsat images the svm based supervised classification method was applied to the study area images using envi 5 3 and 120 points were randomly selected for assessing the classification precision the validation accuracy for this classification was 85 3 the mining scope was extracted from high spatial resolution images google and gaofen 1 images and landsat images the information extraction method employed involved a visual interpretation an accuracy of 93 was realized which was validated by randomly selecting 60 points 4 the mining modes were obtained through the mining concession of the study area and converted into raster data using arcgis 5 the density analysis tool in arcgis was used to convert the drainage faults mines and residential areas into raster data the lithology and soil type are spatial data and only require projection conversion and rasterization 6 according to the data from eight monitoring stations located in and around the study area the precipitation data were interpolated in arcgis in order to convert statistical data into spatial data the interpolation method employed was kriging which is widely used for meteorological data bargaoui and chebbi 2009 7 the gauss kruger projection was used in this study the dimensions of the evaluation unit were 250 m 250 m 3 1 3 standardization of indicators to ensure that the influences of different indicators on the groundwater potential were comparable the indicator values were standardized to the range of 1 to 1 fig 3 as the twi spi drainage density plane curvature slope elevation fault density precipitation and mining density are continuous spatial data they can be standardized directly however the lithology lulc soil types and mining modes are categorical spatial data which must be quantified prior to the standardization the quantitative methods for the lithology lulc soil type and mining mode are listed in table 3 3 2 modeling process 3 2 1 pca the principal component function in arcgis was used to conduct the pca transformation of the natural and anthropogenic factors based on the calculation results the first n principal components cumulative contribution rate exceeding 90 and their contribution rates were selected for the weighted calculation poon et al 2011 and the natural composite index n and anthropogenic composite index s of the study area in 2000 2010 and 2020 were obtained for complete details regarding the comprehensive pca please refer to the work of shao et al 2014 3 2 2 ccm in ct when two control variables exist the catastrophe model is a cusp type model therefore the natural and anthropogenic composite indices were considered as the control variables and the ccm was used to construct the groundwater potential evaluation model 1 equilibrium surface the equilibrium surface determined using the three dimensional coordinates m 1 n 1 n 2 of the ccm is expressed in eq 3 to accurately simulate the mapping relationship among the control variables natural composite index n anthropogenic composite index s and state variable of the groundwater potential g p all the coefficients in eq 3 were considered as non zero constants 3 n 2 a m 1 3 b n 1 m 1 in eq 3 m 1 m 0 is set that is m 1 is set to a fixed value n 1 and n 2 form a linear relationship thus the equilibrium surface is composed of straight lines parallel to the plane n 1 o n 2 fig 4 as shown in fig 4 when n 1 0 m 1 slowly increases with an increase in n 2 when n 1 0 m 1 continues to increase with n 2 however when m 1 reaches a specific range a small increase in n 2 can lead to a sharp and discontinuous increase in m 1 thus establishing the conversion relationship between m 1 n 1 n 2 and g p n s is a key aspect of applying the ccm to evaluate groundwater potential 2 coordinate conversion the original coordinate system m 1 n 1 n 2 is converted into a new coordinate system g p n s when the translation is set to m 11 n 11 n 22 and the rotation angle around the m 1 axis is β the conversion equation is as follows 4 m 1 g p m 11 n 1 n c o s β s s i n β n 11 n 2 n s i n β s c o s β n 22 in fig 4 the coordinate origin m 11 n 11 n 22 of the new coordinates g p n s also lies on the original coordinate system therefore n 2 a m 11 3 b n 1 m 11 is set as the n axis of the natural composite index thus the straight line is the intersection of the plane passing through the origin of the new coordinate system and the equilibrium surface the new coordinate system is derived by translating the original coordinate system and rotation β around the g p axis accordingly 5 s i n β b m 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 c o s β 1 1 b 2 m 11 2 3 new coordinates based on the pca results the mutation points n 1 s 1 n 2 and s 2 were obtained through a statistical analysis of the natural composite index n and the anthropogenic composite index s fig 5 a plane perpendicular to the n axis through point g p 1 n 1 s 1 is created in the new coordinate system g p n s as g p 1 n 1 s 1 is the mutation point in the groundwater potential and the origin of the original coordinate system is also a mutation point the created plane passes through the origin of the original coordinate system thus point g p 1 n 1 s 1 in the original coordinate system is g p 1 m 11 n 1 c o s β s 1 s i n β n 11 n 1 s i n β s 1 c o s β n 22 and the direction vector of the m 1 axis is 0 c o s β s i n β the equation of this plane can be expressed as follows 6 n 1 c o s β n 2 s i n β 0 substituting the insertion point g p 1 m 11 n 1 c o s β s 1 s i n β n 11 n 1 s i n β s 1 c o s β n 22 into eq 6 and combining the solutions of eq 5 yield 7 n 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 b n 22 m 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 n 1 0 similarly when the new coordinates g p n s undergo mutation again at point g p 2 n 2 s 2 the coordinate point k g p 2 m 11 n 2 c o s β s 2 s i n β n 11 n 2 s i n β s 2 c o s β n 22 serves as the intersection point mutation point of the n axis and singularity set of the equilibrium surface there are three roots of m 1 at k point i e m 11 m 12 and m 13 thus n 2 s i n β s 2 c o s β n 22 a m 1 3 b m 1 n 2 c o s β s 2 s i n β n 11 has three roots that satisfy the equation m 1 m 11 m 1 m 12 m 1 m 13 0 the three roots of this equation have two equal roots m 11 m 13 thus the following equation is obtained 8 m 1 3 2 m 11 m 12 m 1 2 m 11 2 2 m 11 m 12 m 1 m 11 2 m 12 0 let eq 8 be equal to the coefficients of the equation n 2 s i n β s 2 c o s β n 22 a m 1 3 b m 1 n 2 c o s β s 2 s i n β n 11 combining the solutions of eq 5 yields 9 0 2 m 11 m 12 b a n 2 1 b 2 m 11 2 s 2 b m 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 n 11 m 11 2 2 m 11 m 12 s 2 1 b 2 m 11 2 b n 2 m 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 n 22 a m 11 2 m 12 in fig 4 point k is the mutation point of the groundwater potential thus the groundwater potential undergoes transition from m 11 to m 12 at point k referring to previous results zhu 2014 the transition amount can be represented as follows 10 m 11 1 m 12 4 construction of evaluation model on substituting eqs 4 and 5 into eq 3 the equilibrium surface g p n s after a coordinate transformation can be

groundwater potential evaluation to further strengthen the understanding of the groundwater potential distribution and the changing rules in the study area the following criteria were designed the ccm is a cubic equation eq 3 hence it consists of three unreal roots when w 0 eq 12 yields three unequal real roots which implies that the groundwater potential corresponds to the very poor status when w 0 the natural breaks classification method liu et al 2018 is applied to classify the results into statuses of poor moderate good and very good 5 model solution using eqs 7 9 and 10 the values of the

value more than 90 of the sample data were located away from the bifurcation curve indicating that the value b meets the necessary requirements otherwise the value for b needs to be reassigned fig 6

important steps in modeling without verification the constructed evaluation model will have no scientific significance the receiver operating characteristic roc curve is a scientific approach for describing the efficiency of probabilistic and deterministic detection and forecasting systems it is widely used in various fields such as for groundwater potential evaluation pradhan 2013 the area under the roc curve auc is also useful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while accounting for detection biases associated with the estimation zipkin et al 2012 in this study 262 springs 70 of the total number of springs were selected as the sample dataset and 112 springs 30 of the total number of springs were selected as the validation dataset in order to assess the proposed model the sample dataset was used to calculate the success rate of the evaluation results and the verification dataset was used to calculate the prediction rate based on the evaluation indicator the cfmfs were used to evaluate the groundwater potential and a comparative analysis with the new integrated method was performed in addition the average groundwater level data from 18 wells were selected as a reference to further verify the accuracy of the evaluation results 4 results 4 1 evaluation results according to eq 12 and the coefficients presented in table 4 n and s for the years 2000 2010 and 2020 were employed to obtain the evaluation results for the study area fig 7 as shown in table 5 the areas under the moderate and good statuses were the largest followed by those under the poor and very good statuses the areas under the very good status were the smallest the evaluation results for 2020 were considered as an example where the area under the very good status is 1801 08 km2 accounting for 11 96 of the total area and that under the good status is 4230 35 km2 accounting for 28 09 the abovementioned status is mainly distributed in the valley which is located in the middle of the study area the area under the moderate status is 5821 46 km2 accounting for 38 65 and this area is distributed primarily toward the east and northwest regions of the study area the area under the poor status is 3021 13 km2 accounting for 20 06 furthermore the area under the very poor status is 186 75 km2 accounting for 1 24 this area is mainly distributed in the mining and urban areas e g taiping east district hongge area baima and lixi lvshui overall the groundwater potential evaluation results are consistent with those presented in a previous study jiang 2005 with regard to the changes in the groundwater potential that occurred from 2000 2020 the areas under the very poor poor and good statuses continue to increase those under the very good status continue to decrease and those under the moderate status initially increase and then decrease 4 2 verification results through a verification the auc values for the success rates of the evaluation results for 2000 2010 and 2020 were obtained these values were 0 847 0 851 and 0 860 respectively fig 8 a for the prediction rate curve the results exhibited a trend similar to that of the success rate curve and the auc values were 0 755 0 762 and 0 773 for 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively fig 8b the success rate and the prediction rate of the new integrated method were higher than those of the cfmfs compared with the auc classification performed by yesilnacar and topal 2005 the new integrated method exhibited reasonably good accuracy in terms of the spatial prediction of groundwater potential moreover the groundwater data observed in the field were in good agreement with the evaluation results for 2020 with a correlation coefficient of 0 87 which is also higher than that for the cfmfs fig 8c the abovementioned verification results therefore demonstrate that the evaluation model developed in this study using the ccm and pca achieves good performance in evaluating the groundwater potential 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 analysis of groundwater potential changes 5 1 1 very poor status the mineral resource development areas and the urban construction areas fall under the very poor status typical mines in these areas include the zhujiabaobao lanjian iron mine lala copper mine baima iron mine huashan coal mine and hongge iron mine the very poor status of the groundwater potential in these areas can be attributed to two possible reasons 1 long term and large scale mining leads to increased land occupation in these areas during mining the pit drainage causes the groundwater level to decrease zhu et al 2020 2 urban construction also leads to the conversion of arable land forestland grassland wetland and other types of coverage into residential transportation commercial and industrial lands thus increasing the impervious surface area and reducing the groundwater supply tsegaye et al 2006 okadera et al 2019 from the perspective of the change process the area under the very poor status increased from 2000 to 2020 in addition the area under the very poor status showed an increase of 72 74 km2 from 2000 2010 which represents an increase rate of 92 51 fig 9 a b this is likely because the continuous increase in the intensity and scale of the development of mineral resources led to increased extraction of groundwater and mine drainage around the mining areas resulting in a decline in the groundwater level zheng 2012 pigato and tang 2015 from 2010 2020 the area under the very poor status showed an increase of 35 39 km2 representing an increase rate of 23 38 accordingly the rapid expansion of urban construction is considered as the main reason for the increase in the area under the very poor status during this period fig 9c compared with the contribution of mining toward the increase in the area under the very poor status for the period from 2000 2010 the contribution toward the increase in the area under the very poor status from 2010 to 2020 is lower this is likely because in 2009 the chinese government increased the supervision and management of mine geo environment management projects which helped restore the groundwater level in the mining areas to a certain extent grigg 2017 5 1 2 poor status the area under the poor status is mainly distributed around the area under the very poor status hence it has good spatial correlation with the distribution of the area under the very poor status from 2000 2020 the area under the poor status showed an increase of 180 44 km2 representing an increase rate of 6 35 the surrounding environmental pressure caused by mining and urban construction is considered as the main factor that causes the groundwater potential in this area to become poor furthermore the area under the poor status is primarily located in the hillside where the degree of evaporation exceeds that of precipitation resulting in a further decrease in the groundwater potential zhong 2000 5 1 3 moderate status the areas under the moderate status are considered as important agricultural production areas the main soil type in these areas is purple soil this type of soil undergoes severe erosion and has a shallow layer and poor water retention capacity which are the main factors limiting groundwater potential zhou et al 2019 during the study period the area under the moderate status initially increased and then decreased from 2000 2010 the area under the moderate status showed an increase of 53 24 km2 representing an increase rate of 0 89 this was mainly caused by mining and urban expansion the area under the moderate status showed a decrease of 183 17 km2 from 2010 2020 representing a decrease rate of 3 05 this is likely due to the policies of returning farmlands to the forest grass areas and the agricultural structure adjustment implemented in the study area which led to an increase in the vegetation coverage fig 9d areas with high vegetation coverage can prolong the soil infiltration time and increase surface runoff thereby effectively increasing the groundwater potential chen 2014 5 1 4 good status low altitude areas are those under the good status in these areas the drainage density and vegetation coverage are relatively high the area under the good status showed an increase of 51 73 km2 from 2000 2020 representing an increase rate of 1 24 this is likely due to the conversion of the areas under the moderate status to those under the good status owing to the large scale implementation of the project aimed at converting farmlands to forest grass areas 5 1 5 very good status the areas under the very good status are distributed in the valleys of the jinsha yalong and anning rivers in these areas the drainage and fault density are large and human activities are limited these areas showed a decrease of 210 36 km2 from 2000 2020 representing a decrease rate of 10 46 this was mainly caused by human activities 5 2 performance analysis of the evaluation model the verification results prove that the new integrated method constructed using the ccm and pca outperformed the cfmfs previous research demonstrates that an integrated model based on ct including the ccm is an objective method and can effectively deal with the nonlinear problem in evaluation indicators ghorbani et al 2010 zhan et al 2013 pca simplifies datasets by transforming multiple indicators into a few comprehensive indexes and it can eliminate the mutual influence between indicators which helps explain the spatial heterogeneity between indicators moshat et al 2010 kardanpour et al 2014 therefore this study was conducted considering the natural and anthropogenic aspects and a new groundwater potential evaluation method was constructed by combining the pca and ccm this new method mainly offers the following functions 1 by utilizing the advantages of the ccm and pca the proposed evaluation method can fit complex nonlinear and discontinuity relationships between the groundwater potential and evaluation indicators and effectively solve the stratified spatial heterogeneity of the indicators and the uncertainty in the evaluation process and 2 using the evaluation equation eq 12 this method eliminates the weight restrictions on indicators avoids human interference and increases the objectivity of the results 5 3 limitations of the work although the obtained evaluation results are reliable and accurate this study still involves a few limitations the accuracy of the model depends not only on the learning algorithm but also on the parameters sun et al 2020 however the transition from m 11 to m 12 to 1 eq 10 was set directly based on existing research while neglecting the spatial characteristics of the transition amount control variables are spatial data furthermore evaluation indicators form the basis of groundwater potential evaluations when certain indicators are not used the evaluation results may be biased for instance this study used the spatial interpolation method to convert the precipitation data obtained from meteorological stations into raster data this method is based on the assumption that the closer the spatial position the more likely similar features the known point data were used to estimate the unknown point data which will affect the accuracy of results chen and wang 2020 furthermore the indicators that were difficult to quantify were neglected for instance the impact of implementing relevant policy management measures for the groundwater potential in mining areas was not considered however despite these limitations the evaluation results obtained in this study still provide useful information for the protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in mining areas 5 4 wide applicability of the model groundwater potential depends on the combined action of several contributing factors and the effect of these factors on the groundwater potential may vary from one region to another nasir et al 2018 a previously proposed method for groundwater potential evaluation uses fixed weights for different locations of the study area thus neglecting the spatial difference of the indicators influences on the groundwater potential this condition to a certain extent affects the accuracy of the evaluation results especially when evaluating the groundwater potential at a regional scale the primary feature of the model developed in this study is that it does not require the weight of the indicators and it considers the high flexibility and spatial difference of the indicators owing to this feature the proposed model has wide applicability for groundwater potential evaluations lastly publicly available datasets were used in this study to evaluate groundwater potential in other areas appropriate indicators representing the type of human activity and the hydrogeological environment of the target area should be considered when developing the indicator system 6 conclusions the accurate evaluation of the groundwater potential at the regional level is of great significance for the protection of groundwater resources sustainable management and land use planning using the rs and gis technologies an evaluation indicator system considering natural and anthropogenic factors was established in order to evaluate the groundwater potential in mining areas based on the ccm and pca a new model for the evaluation of the groundwater potential in mining areas was developed and typical regions were selected for the evaluation and verification the model developed in this study achieved satisfactory results and can be widely used in other areas with similar hydrological conditions the evaluation results can also serve as data for local governments and related organizations to formulate water resource management

8139,study region panxi mining area 15061 km2 located in sichuan china study focus this study aims to delineate groundwater potential zones in mining areas using a new method based on the cusp catastrophe model ccm and principal component analysis pca first 13 indicators were selected from natural and anthropogenic dimensions and a comprehensive analysis of the indicators was performed using pca second the results of the pca were considered as control variables and the ccm was used for groundwater potential evaluation modeling finally the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was used to validate the new method and compare it with catastrophe fuzzy membership functions cfmfs new hydrological insights for the region the results suggest that the area under the roc curve of the success and prediction rate accounted for approximately 0 85 and 0 76 respectively in the new method which were higher than those in the cfmfs the largest area 39 with groundwater potential in the study area has a moderate groundwater potential status followed by an area 28 with a good status an area 20 with a poor status and areas 12 and 1 with very good and very poor statuses respectively the groundwater potential in the study area was unevenly distributed and changed drastically topography drainage density and land use land cover had the highest contribution in the modeling process keywords groundwater potential mapping groundwater management spatial modeling multicriteria decision making evaluation indicators 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most extensive freshwater resources worldwide and is closely related to daily life and material infrastructure for human survival and development aeschbach hertig et al 2012 jha 2013 because of its constant temperature extensive and continuous cycle regeneration good water quality and stability it has become an essential and reliable source of water supply for countries and regions with different climatic zones and economic development levels todd and mays 2005 with the rapid development of the social economy china s demand for mineral resources has increased wen et al 2019 and long term and large scale mining has caused severe damage to the environment in particular drainage pits cause the groundwater level to decrease which consequently affects the groundwater flow system zhu et al 2014 this condition in turn poses severe threats to the lives of residents and the safety of irrigation water post et al 2020 therefore the construction of a suitable model is urgently needed for the evaluation of groundwater potential in mining areas for the protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in such areas in traditional groundwater exploration methods the various factors that control the occurrence and movement of groundwater are not always considered the associated cost is extremely high and the timeliness is poor oh et al 2011 razandi et al 2015 in recent years remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technologies have provided systematic rapid and excellent configurations for processing large and complex spatial data affording opportunities for understanding the complex issues related to groundwater exploration murmu et al 2019 numerous studies have also been performed to evaluate groundwater potential using machine learning models based on gis and rs technologies for example kumar and krishna 2018 used geospatial techniques and an analytic hierarchy process ahp which have strong applicability in determining indicator weights to delineate groundwater potential areas in the indian rhargarh and hazaribagh regions however the results obtained are highly subjective and vary according to the opinions of experts dai et al 2009 manap et al 2014 applied the frequency ratio model frm to create a groundwater level map of malaysia s langat basin and verified the evaluation results with an accuracy of 84 78 although the calculation and output processes of the frm are straightforward and easy to understand the evaluation results are directly related to the number of samples used in the evaluation yilmaz 2009 ozdemir 2011 used the logistic regression method lrm in the gis environment and selected 17 factors to construct the groundwater spring potential map of the sudan mountain in central turkey the lrm offers the advantages of simplicity fast training speed and reasonable probability interpretation of the output variables however it can only be applied in the case of large sample sizes which often leads to the multicollinearity problem asar 2017 naghibi et al 2017a stated that the random forest rf and genetic algorithm optimized random forest methods are more effective than the support vector machine svm for groundwater potential evaluation although the rf has high accuracy and efficiency and can directly process high dimensional data it is complex and requires more training time than other similar algorithms cheng et al 2014 lee et al 2019 applied an artificial neural network ann to predict the groundwater level in yangpyeong county of south korea and suggested that the river water level is the main factor affecting groundwater level fluctuations anns can automatically adjust the weight of an evaluation indicator and feature strong adaptability however they often suffer from the overfitting problem when the training samples are insufficient or over trained krizhevsky et al 2012 some scholars have also used various combination of models to evaluate the groundwater potential examples include the fuzzy ahp azimi et al 2018 weighted index overlays and two dimensional electrical resistivity tomography gyeltshen et al 2020 evidence belief function and boosted regression tree kordestani et al 2019 evidential belief function and tree based models naghibi et al 2019 ann and real adaboost nguyen et al 2020 and gray clustering method and ahp sahoo et al 2017 although the abovementioned methods can quantitatively or qualitatively reflect the groundwater potential they tend to seek for a superior model through an inter comparison of multiple models without adequate attention to maximizing the learning from these models karimi et al 2020 in addition most of the existing multiobjective decision making methods are uncertain in terms of solving the nonlinear and discontinuity problems between evaluation indicators and their calculation process is complicated singh et al 2009 catastrophe theory ct is a system theory proposed by rene thom this theory is based on topology the singularity theory and the system structural stability theory it is used to study the mutations caused by gradual changes zeeman 1979 compared with other methods ct shows acceptable performance and is an objective approach to solve the catastrophic problem of discontinuous changes in natural systems and social fields liu et al 2015 it has also been widely used in studies on groundwater potential ahmed et al 2015 al abadi et al 2015 sadeghfam et al 2016 in addition sadeghfam et al 2020a b 2021 applied ct to groundwater over abstraction groundwater vulnerability and groundwater pollution and achieved good results these aforementioned studies prove that an integrated model based on ct can effectively improve the objectivity of research results such an approach typically involves the use of catastrophe fuzzy membership functions cfmfs however uncertainties in the cfmfs arise when determining the priority sequence of control variables in catastrophe subordinate systems to solve the uncertainties in existing studies using ct to evaluate groundwater potential the coordinate transformation technology was employed for applying the cusp catastrophe model ccm in ct and principal component analysis pca in groundwater potential evaluation modeling thus the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 to consider the panxi mining area china as an example collect spatiotemporal data related to groundwater potential in the study area and establish an evaluation indicator system 2 to use pca for natural and anthropogenic indicators and perform a statistical analysis of the pca results and 3 to develop a method suitable for the groundwater potential evaluation in mining areas based on the pca results and ccm and verify the effectiveness of this method 2 study area the panxi mining area is located in the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau fig 1 southwestern warm and wet monsoons originating from the indian ocean are obstructed by the hengduan mountains resulting in the foehn effect in the study area huan cheng and mcconchie 2001 the wet and dry seasons in the study area are clearly distinguishable the annual average temperature is 16 c 17 c the precipitation is 800 1200 mm and the annual evaporation in the valley area is three to six times the precipitation wang et al 2018 the study area is characterized by alpine valleys as dominant landforms at an altitude of 645 4167 m this area constitutes china s substantial ferrous and non ferrous metal mining base wu and zhang 2019 mining in the study area has led to a decline in the groundwater level which has increased the competition between residents living and irrigation water especially during winter when the rainfall declines resulting in a decrease in the groundwater level therefore it is necessary to accurately evaluate the groundwater potential of the study area and understand its change process given the significance of the groundwater potential in the management and protection of groundwater resources in a particular area according to the characteristics of the aquifer group and the occurrence conditions of groundwater the study area can be divided into four types of aquifers dai 2016 1 quaternary loose rock weak aquifer it is mainly composed of gravel sand and sandy clay it features loose lithology large porosity and low water content 2 clastic rock weak water bearing group this group is distributed over most regions in the study area and is dominated by sandstone siltstone and mudstone hence it is a relatively water resistant layer the rock formation has developed fissures and exposed many springs and the spring flow rate is 0 1 1 2 l s 3 basalt water bearing rock group it is composed of basalt purple tuffaceous sandstone and tuff surface weathering cracks have been developed with a weathering thickness of 0 5 1 2 m the overall water content is low and the spring flow is less than 0 1 l s 4 carbonate water bearing rock group it is composed of dolomite shale and limestone its water content is high and the spring flow rate is 8 7 l s 3 methodology the proposed method involves three steps fig 2 1 an indicator system based on natural and anthropogenic factors was constructed and the pca was used for a comprehensive analysis of these factors 2 the pca results were considered as control variables coordinate transformation technology was used for applying the ccm to the groundwater potential evaluation modeling and the feasibility of the model was verified 3 the new integrated method was applied for the groundwater potential evaluation of the study area in 2000 2010 and 2020 and characteristics of the groundwater potential distribution and change process within the study area were analyzed 3 1 evaluation indicator system and data collection 3 1 1 evaluation indicator system the factors that influence groundwater potential are geology topography meteorology hydrology vegetation and human activities jenifer and jha 2017 accordingly based on previous studies chen et al 2018 rizeei et al 2019 an evaluation indicator system for the study area was constructed considering both natural and anthropogenic aspects in this indicator system 10 natural factors and three anthropogenic factors were included the reasons governing the selection of these indicators are listed in table 1 3 1 2 data collection and processing the data types and sources adopted in this study with regard to the evaluation indicator system are listed in table 2 the collected data were processed according to an evaluation indicator system this processing method is detailed below 1 the digital elevation model dem for the study area was obtained from the geospatial data cloud china using the spatial analysis tools in arcgis most of the natural factors were derived from dem data including the twi spi slope elevation and water system 1 t w i ln e t a n f 2 s p i e t a n f where e is the specific catchment area and f is the local slope gradient 2 lulc type information was obtained through a classification of landsat images the svm based supervised classification method was applied to the study area images using envi 5 3 and 120 points were randomly selected for assessing the classification precision the validation accuracy for this classification was 85 3 the mining scope was extracted from high spatial resolution images google and gaofen 1 images and landsat images the information extraction method employed involved a visual interpretation an accuracy of 93 was realized which was validated by randomly selecting 60 points 4 the mining modes were obtained through the mining concession of the study area and converted into raster data using arcgis 5 the density analysis tool in arcgis was used to convert the drainage faults mines and residential areas into raster data the lithology and soil type are spatial data and only require projection conversion and rasterization 6 according to the data from eight monitoring stations located in and around the study area the precipitation data were interpolated in arcgis in order to convert statistical data into spatial data the interpolation method employed was kriging which is widely used for meteorological data bargaoui and chebbi 2009 7 the gauss kruger projection was used in this study the dimensions of the evaluation unit were 250 m 250 m 3 1 3 standardization of indicators to ensure that the influences of different indicators on the groundwater potential were comparable the indicator values were standardized to the range of 1 to 1 fig 3 as the twi spi drainage density plane curvature slope elevation fault density precipitation and mining density are continuous spatial data they can be standardized directly however the lithology lulc soil types and mining modes are categorical spatial data which must be quantified prior to the standardization the quantitative methods for the lithology lulc soil type and mining mode are listed in table 3 3 2 modeling process 3 2 1 pca the principal component function in arcgis was used to conduct the pca transformation of the natural and anthropogenic factors based on the calculation results the first n principal components cumulative contribution rate exceeding 90 and their contribution rates were selected for the weighted calculation poon et al 2011 and the natural composite index n and anthropogenic composite index s of the study area in 2000 2010 and 2020 were obtained for complete details regarding the comprehensive pca please refer to the work of shao et al 2014 3 2 2 ccm in ct when two control variables exist the catastrophe model is a cusp type model therefore the natural and anthropogenic composite indices were considered as the control variables and the ccm was used to construct the groundwater potential evaluation model 1 equilibrium surface the equilibrium surface determined using the three dimensional coordinates m 1 n 1 n 2 of the ccm is expressed in eq 3 to accurately simulate the mapping relationship among the control variables natural composite index n anthropogenic composite index s and state variable of the groundwater potential g p all the coefficients in eq 3 were considered as non zero constants 3 n 2 a m 1 3 b n 1 m 1 in eq 3 m 1 m 0 is set that is m 1 is set to a fixed value n 1 and n 2 form a linear relationship thus the equilibrium surface is composed of straight lines parallel to the plane n 1 o n 2 fig 4 as shown in fig 4 when n 1 0 m 1 slowly increases with an increase in n 2 when n 1 0 m 1 continues to increase with n 2 however when m 1 reaches a specific range a small increase in n 2 can lead to a sharp and discontinuous increase in m 1 thus establishing the conversion relationship between m 1 n 1 n 2 and g p n s is a key aspect of applying the ccm to evaluate groundwater potential 2 coordinate conversion the original coordinate system m 1 n 1 n 2 is converted into a new coordinate system g p n s when the translation is set to m 11 n 11 n 22 and the rotation angle around the m 1 axis is β the conversion equation is as follows 4 m 1 g p m 11 n 1 n c o s β s s i n β n 11 n 2 n s i n β s c o s β n 22 in fig 4 the coordinate origin m 11 n 11 n 22 of the new coordinates g p n s also lies on the original coordinate system therefore n 2 a m 11 3 b n 1 m 11 is set as the n axis of the natural composite index thus the straight line is the intersection of the plane passing through the origin of the new coordinate system and the equilibrium surface the new coordinate system is derived by translating the original coordinate system and rotation β around the g p axis accordingly 5 s i n β b m 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 c o s β 1 1 b 2 m 11 2 3 new coordinates based on the pca results the mutation points n 1 s 1 n 2 and s 2 were obtained through a statistical analysis of the natural composite index n and the anthropogenic composite index s fig 5 a plane perpendicular to the n axis through point g p 1 n 1 s 1 is created in the new coordinate system g p n s as g p 1 n 1 s 1 is the mutation point in the groundwater potential and the origin of the original coordinate system is also a mutation point the created plane passes through the origin of the original coordinate system thus point g p 1 n 1 s 1 in the original coordinate system is g p 1 m 11 n 1 c o s β s 1 s i n β n 11 n 1 s i n β s 1 c o s β n 22 and the direction vector of the m 1 axis is 0 c o s β s i n β the equation of this plane can be expressed as follows 6 n 1 c o s β n 2 s i n β 0 substituting the insertion point g p 1 m 11 n 1 c o s β s 1 s i n β n 11 n 1 s i n β s 1 c o s β n 22 into eq 6 and combining the solutions of eq 5 yield 7 n 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 b n 22 m 11 1 b 2 m 11 2 n 1 0 similarly when the new coordinates g p n s undergo mutation again at point g p 2 n 2 s 2 the coordinate point k g p 2 m 11 n 2 c o s β s 2 s i n β n 11 n 2 s i n β s 2 c o s β n 22 serves as the intersection point mutation point of the n axis and singularity set of the equilibrium surface there are three roots of m 1 at k point i e m 11 m 12 and m 13 thus n 2 s i n β s 2 c o s β n 22 a m 1 3 b m 1 n 2 c o s β s 2 s i n β n 11 has three roots that satisfy the equation m 1 m 11 m 1 m 12 m 1 m 13 0 the three roots of this equation have two equal roots m 11 m 13 thus the following

groundwater potential evaluation to further strengthen the understanding of the groundwater potential distribution and the changing rules in the study area the following criteria were designed the ccm is a cubic equation eq 3 hence it consists of three unreal roots when w 0 eq 12 yields three unequal real roots which implies that the groundwater potential corresponds to the very poor status when w

important steps in modeling without verification the constructed evaluation model will have no scientific significance the receiver operating characteristic roc curve is a scientific approach for describing the efficiency of probabilistic and deterministic detection and forecasting systems it is widely used in various fields such as for groundwater potential evaluation pradhan 2013 the area under the roc curve auc is also useful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while accounting for detection biases associated with the estimation zipkin et al 2012 in this study 262 springs 70 of the total number of springs were selected as the sample dataset and 112 springs 30 of the total number of springs were selected as the validation dataset in order to assess the proposed model the sample dataset was used to calculate the success rate of the evaluation results and the verification dataset was used to calculate the prediction rate based on the evaluation indicator the cfmfs were used to evaluate the groundwater potential and a comparative analysis with the new integrated method was performed in addition the average groundwater level data from 18 wells were selected as a reference to further verify the accuracy of the evaluation results 4 results 4 1 evaluation results according to eq 12 and the coefficients presented in table 4 n and s for the years 2000 2010 and 2020 were employed to obtain the evaluation results for the study area fig 7 as shown in table 5 the areas under the moderate and good statuses were the largest followed by those under the poor and very good statuses the areas under the very good status were the smallest the evaluation results for 2020 were considered as an example where the area under the very good status is 1801 08 km2 accounting for 11 96 of the total area and that under the good status is 4230 35 km2 accounting for 28 09 the abovementioned status is mainly distributed in the valley which is located in the middle of the study area the area under the moderate status is 5821 46 km2 accounting for 38 65 and this area is distributed primarily toward the east and northwest regions of the study area the area under the poor status is 3021 13 km2 accounting for 20 06 furthermore the area under the very poor status is 186 75 km2 accounting for 1 24 this area is mainly distributed in the mining and urban areas e g taiping east district hongge area baima and lixi lvshui overall the groundwater potential evaluation results are consistent with those presented in a previous study jiang 2005 with regard to the changes in the groundwater potential that occurred from 2000 2020 the areas under the very poor poor and good statuses continue to increase those under the very good status continue to decrease and those under the moderate status initially increase and then decrease 4 2 verification results through a verification the auc values for the success rates of the evaluation results for 2000 2010 and 2020 were obtained these values were 0 847 0 851 and 0 860 respectively fig 8 a for the prediction rate curve the results exhibited a trend similar to that of the success rate curve and the auc values were 0 755 0 762 and 0 773 for 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively fig 8b the success rate and the prediction rate of the new integrated method were higher than those of the cfmfs compared with the auc classification performed by yesilnacar and topal 2005 the new integrated method exhibited reasonably good accuracy in terms of the spatial prediction of groundwater potential moreover the groundwater data observed in the field were in good agreement with the evaluation results for 2020 with a correlation coefficient of 0 87 which is also higher than that for the cfmfs fig 8c the abovementioned verification results therefore demonstrate that the evaluation model developed in this study using the ccm and pca achieves good performance in evaluating the groundwater potential 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 analysis of groundwater potential changes 5 1 1 very poor status the mineral resource development areas and the urban construction areas fall under the very poor status typical mines in these areas include the zhujiabaobao lanjian iron mine lala copper mine baima iron mine huashan coal mine and hongge iron mine the very poor status of the groundwater potential in these areas can be attributed to two possible reasons 1 long term and large scale mining leads to increased land occupation in these areas during mining the pit drainage causes the groundwater level to decrease zhu et al 2020 2 urban construction also leads to the conversion of arable land forestland grassland wetland and other types of coverage into residential transportation commercial and industrial lands thus increasing the impervious surface area and reducing the groundwater supply tsegaye et al 2006 okadera et al 2019 from the perspective of the change process the area under the very poor status increased from 2000 to 2020 in addition the area under the very poor status showed an increase of 72 74 km2 from 2000 2010 which represents an increase rate of 92 51 fig 9 a b this is likely because the continuous increase in the intensity and scale of the development of mineral resources led to increased extraction of groundwater and mine drainage around the mining areas resulting in a decline in the groundwater level zheng 2012 pigato and tang 2015 from 2010 2020 the area under the very poor status showed an increase of 35 39 km2 representing an increase rate of 23 38 accordingly the rapid expansion of urban construction is considered as the main reason for the increase in the area under the very poor status during this period fig 9c compared with the contribution of mining toward the increase in the area under the very poor status for the period from 2000 2010 the contribution toward the increase in the area under the very poor status from 2010 to 2020 is lower this is likely because in 2009 the chinese government increased the supervision and management of mine geo environment management projects which helped restore the groundwater level in the mining areas to a certain extent grigg 2017 5 1 2 poor status the area under the poor status is mainly distributed around the area under the very poor status hence it has good spatial correlation with the distribution of the area under the very poor status from 2000 2020 the area under the poor status showed an increase of 180 44 km2 representing an increase rate of 6 35 the surrounding environmental pressure caused by mining and urban construction is considered as the main factor that causes the groundwater potential in this area to become poor furthermore the area under the poor status is primarily located in the hillside where the degree of evaporation exceeds that of precipitation resulting in a further decrease in the groundwater potential zhong 2000 5 1 3 moderate status the areas under the moderate status are considered as important agricultural production areas the main soil type in these areas is purple soil this type of soil undergoes severe erosion and has a shallow layer and poor water retention capacity which are the main factors limiting groundwater potential zhou et al 2019 during the study period the area under the moderate status initially increased and then decreased from 2000 2010 the area under the moderate status showed an increase of 53 24 km2 representing an increase rate of 0 89 this was mainly caused by mining and urban expansion the area under the moderate status showed a decrease of 183 17 km2 from 2010 2020 representing a decrease rate of 3 05 this is likely due to the policies of returning farmlands to the forest grass areas and the agricultural structure adjustment implemented in the study area which led to an increase in the vegetation coverage fig 9d areas with high vegetation coverage can prolong the soil infiltration time and increase surface runoff thereby effectively increasing the groundwater potential chen 2014 5 1 4 good status low altitude areas are those under the good status in these areas the drainage density and vegetation coverage are relatively high the area under the good status showed an increase of 51 73 km2 from 2000 2020 representing an increase rate of 1 24 this is likely due to the conversion of the areas under the moderate status to those under the good status owing to the large scale implementation of the project aimed at converting farmlands to forest grass areas 5 1 5 very good status the areas under the very good status are distributed in the valleys of the jinsha yalong and anning rivers in these areas the drainage and fault density are large and human activities are limited these areas showed a decrease of 210 36 km2 from 2000 2020 representing a decrease rate of 10 46 this was mainly caused by human activities 5 2 performance analysis of the evaluation model the verification results prove that the new integrated method constructed using the ccm and pca outperformed the cfmfs previous research demonstrates that an integrated model based on ct including the ccm is an objective method and can effectively deal with the nonlinear problem in evaluation indicators ghorbani et al 2010 zhan et al 2013 pca simplifies datasets by transforming multiple indicators into a few comprehensive indexes and it can eliminate the mutual influence between indicators which helps explain the spatial heterogeneity between indicators moshat et al 2010 kardanpour et al 2014 therefore this study was conducted considering the natural and anthropogenic aspects and a new groundwater potential evaluation method was constructed by combining the pca and ccm this new method mainly offers the following functions 1 by utilizing the advantages of the ccm and pca the proposed evaluation method can fit complex nonlinear and discontinuity relationships between the groundwater potential and evaluation indicators and effectively solve the stratified spatial heterogeneity of the indicators and the uncertainty in the evaluation process and 2 using the evaluation equation eq 12 this method eliminates the weight restrictions on indicators avoids human interference and increases the objectivity of the results 5 3 limitations of the work although the obtained evaluation results are reliable and accurate this study still involves a few limitations the accuracy of the model depends not only on the learning algorithm but also on the parameters sun et al 2020 however the transition from m 11 to m 12 to 1 eq 10 was set directly based on existing research while neglecting the spatial characteristics of the transition amount control variables are spatial data furthermore evaluation indicators form the basis of groundwater potential evaluations when certain indicators are not used the evaluation results may be biased for instance this study used the spatial interpolation method to convert the precipitation data obtained from meteorological stations into raster data this method is based on the assumption that the closer the spatial position the more likely similar features the known point data were used to estimate the unknown point data which will affect the accuracy of results chen and wang 2020 furthermore the indicators that were difficult to quantify were neglected for instance the impact of implementing relevant policy management measures for the groundwater potential in mining areas was not considered however despite these limitations the evaluation results obtained in this study still provide useful information for the protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in mining areas 5 4 wide applicability of the model groundwater potential depends on the combined action of several contributing factors and the effect of these factors on the groundwater potential may vary from one region to another nasir et al 2018 a previously proposed method for groundwater potential evaluation uses fixed weights for different locations of the study area thus neglecting the spatial difference of the indicators influences on the groundwater potential this condition to a certain extent affects the accuracy of the evaluation results especially when evaluating the groundwater potential at a regional scale the primary feature of the model developed in this study is that it does not require the weight of the indicators and it considers the high flexibility and spatial difference of the indicators owing to this feature the proposed model has wide applicability for groundwater potential evaluations lastly publicly available datasets were used in this study to evaluate groundwater potential in other areas appropriate indicators representing the type of human activity and the hydrogeological environment of the target area should be considered when developing the indicator system 6 conclusions the accurate evaluation of the groundwater potential at the regional level is of great significance for the protection of groundwater resources sustainable management and land use planning using the rs and gis technologies an evaluation indicator system considering natural and anthropogenic factors was established in order to evaluate the groundwater potential in mining areas based on the ccm and pca a new model for the evaluation of the groundwater potential in mining areas was developed and typical regions were selected for the evaluation and verification the model developed in this study achieved satisfactory results and can be widely used in other areas with similar hydrological conditions the evaluation results can also serve as data for local governments and related organizations to formulate water resource management plans and implement environmental governance and protection measures author statement xiaofei sun yingzhi zhou and xixi lu conceptualization methodology linguo yuan data collection and processing
