scale models advancements in imaging and experiment methods have enabled significant progress in measurement and understanding of heterogeneity in porosity fluid saturations akin and kovscek 2003 ferno et al 2015 mitchell et al 2013 perrin and benson 2010 zahasky and benson 2016 permeability krause et al 2013 and capillary pressure at the laboratory scale pini and benson 2013 pini et al 2012 trevisan et al 2015 the most common imaging modality used in earth sciences is clinical or more recently micro scale x ray computed tomography however magnetic resonance imaging mri and positron emission tomography pet are emerging as valuable imaging platforms computed tomography relies on the generation and transmission of x rays during discrete time intervals in order to image a 3d material and it is widely established as an essential tool for quantification of saturation behavior and structural properties of geologic materials e g akin and kovscek 2003 perrin and benson 2010 magnetic resonance imaging or more generally nuclear magnetic resonance imaging uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves in order to image and quantify the contrast between different materials positron emission tomography and other emission tomography techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography spect rely on the detection of photon emissions produced during radioactive decay of radiotracers injected into a 3d system using robust reconstruction techniques it is possible to produce quantitative four dimensional images of the radiotracer transport in the material a growing number of studies are employing positron emission tomography for solute transport quantification boutchko et al 2012 brattekas et al 2016 ferno et al 2015 goethals et al 2009 hu et al 2017 kulenkampff et al 2015 lippmann pipke et al 2017 pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2017 as it is ideally suited for measuring solute advection dispersion and diffusion in geologic porous media one of the advantages of pet over many ct and mri systems is the temporal resolution over the duration of a pet scan coincident photon events are collected continuously by a cylindrical array of photon detectors located in the pet scanner coincident events are collected everywhere along the axis of the scanner which is therefore able to image cores less than 12 cm long the length of the bore of the micro pet scanner used in this study without physically moving the core during the reconstruction of a pet scan these events can be binned temporally to create time lapse images of the scan depending on the intensity of the radiotracer and scanner properties these time frames can be as short as 10 20 seconds this capability provides the necessary temporal resolution to quantify solute spreading at many time steps between tracer injection initiation and tracer breakthrough even with fairly rapid flow rates fig 1 highlights this capability by illustrating the distribution of a radiotracer pulse injected at 5 ml min along the length of a relatively heterogeneous berea sandstone core at four different times prior to tracer breakthrough this data will be examined in greater detail in the following sections a second major advantage of using pet imaging for tracer transport quantification is the high sensitivity to small changes in tracer concentration x ray ct imaging relies on the electron density contrast between fluids i e water and water with a high density tracer to produce different levels of attenuation which is then converted into concentration measurements at lower concentrations small changes in signal relative to imaging noise can make accurate concentration profiles difficult to acquire the contrast between no radioisotope and full pore saturation is much larger during a pet scan than the contrast created by the electron density of the fluids thus allowing pet to measure small changes in solute concentration with a greater sensitivity than ct the final advantage of pet is that due to the high energy of the 511 kev gamma rays produced during positron annihilation it is possible for the photons to travel through nearly all geologic materials without major losses in resolution particularly with high quality attenuation correction the presence of paramagnetic minerals in many geologic materials can sometimes limit mri imaging to quantification of solute transport in artificial porous media nestle et al 2003 reeves and chudek 2001 werth et al 2010 the biggest disadvantage of using pet for imaging studies has been the limited spatial resolution the resolution of reconstructed pet scans is a function of the physical imaging system optimization of radioactivity levels and the quality and method of image reconstruction and attenuation correction using clinical pet scanners the fundamental resolution limits are around 3 mm depending on the radioisotope being imaged and radiotracer concentration optimization however as the system size is decreased the fundamental limit drops to less than 1 mm due to reductions in errors from photon non collinearity and smaller detector element widths levin and hoffman 1999 these smaller systems are known as pre clinical micro pet scanners which are commonly used in small animal imaging studies and have only recently been employed for earth science applications brattekas et al 2016 hu et al 2017 kulenkampff et al 2015 zahasky and benson 2016 2017 while the image resolution can be significantly better with smaller system size pet scans also experience losses in resolution during the image reconstruction process in order to reduce errors during the reconstruction process it is usually necessary to obtain an attenuation correction map of the object being scanned an attenuation correction map is generally obtained with a ct scanner or other x ray transmission source and provides information about how positron sourced photons may attenuate as they travel between the source i e radiotracer and the scanner detectors finally optimal radiotracer activity dosing is essential to obtain high quality images the optimal activity level will maximize detection events without saturating the scanner photon detectors understanding small scale i e sub core scale variations in permeability porosity and relative permeability can provide new insights into transport phenomena across scales several methods exist for quantifying sub core porosity with the most common method employing x ray ct akin and kovscek 2003 however measurements of sub core permeability and relative permeability are more challenging methods for permeability quantification include multiphase scaling experimental techniques krause et al 2013 pini and benson 2013 numerical and inverse methods krause et al 2013 lee et al 2016 and correlation with other rock properties such as porosity or grain size e g chilingar 1964 tiab and donaldson 2016 with the advancement in higher resolution micro ct scanners methods of permeability quantification from pore structure have also been developed e g blunt 1997 jerauld and salter 1990 spanne et al 1994 while each of these methods can be very effective each one has weaknesses for example multiphase scaling experimental techniques require multiphase experiments and rely on the assumption that some scaling relationship such as leverett j exists inverse methods can be very computationally expensive and are usually non unique lee et al 2016 correlation methods work well in some cases but breakdown quickly in other cases micro ct techniques may have limited sample size can be computationally expensive and difficult to verify in this study a new mathematical approach for sub core scale characterization is proposed using positron emission tomography to image pulse injections of a conservative radiotracer the tracer experiments are first completed during single phase flow and later during multiphase steady state drainage conditions in two different heterogeneous berea sandstone cores with these experiments we demonstrate the application of micro pet in order to 1 use spatial moment analysis to quantify sub core tracer flux and pore water velocity 2 characterize sub core scale permeability distributions and 3 calculate wetting phase relative permeability saturation and dispersivity the spatial moment analysis described here relies on reducing the three dimensional system to a two dimensional bundle of streamtubes numerical simulations are performed to highlight cases where this dimension reduction is and is not possible these simulations justify that the experiments performed in this study enable streamtube analysis despite sub core heterogeneity a new application of the reactor ratio referred to as the streamtube reactor ratio is presented to reliably determine when it is possible to apply this dimension reduction technique 2 experimental methods 2 1 sample characterization two different cores were utilized in this study in order to explore the optimal size core for micro pet experiments the two core samples used in this experiment are a 3 5 inch diameter hereon referred to as bss3 and a 2 inch diameter hereon referred to as bss2 berea sandstone acquired from cleveland quarries the porosity of the cores was measured using both a clinical ct scanner as described in akin and kovscek 2003 as well as small plug analysis with a micromeritics accupyc ii helium pycnometer variation in sample porosity was similiar to the magnitude of the measurement noise of the ct scanner and therefore considered constant single phase steady state water injection at multiple flow rates was performed in order to measure the core average permeability table 1 permeability standard deviation was determined using two phase coreflooding methods described in krause et al 2013 and zahasky and benson 2016 table 1 this permeability heterogeneity in the cores is a result of visible axial parallel bedding layers due to slight variations in sandstone grain size and composition a summary of core properties and dimensions is given in table 1 2 2 experimental setup to perform micro pet imaging of multiphase injection in the sandstone core a standard core flooding apparatus perrin and benson 2010 requires several additional components in order to enable injection quantification and disposal of radioactive tracers a detailed description of the experimental setup and summary schematic can be found in appendix a prior to starting the experiments the cores were saturated with tap water using the method described by perrin and benson 2010 prior to starting the micro pet scan the radiotracer fludeoxyglucose 18f fdg was mixed into the isco pump initially containing tap water using the method described in zahasky and benson 2016 in order to ensure proper mixing in the pump fludeoxyglucose is a widely available conservative tracer as confirmed by radioactivity mass balance from tracer curve analysis and has a half life of 109 7 minutes these characteristics make fdg an ideal choice for multi hour tracer injection studies the pet scans were performed using a siemens pre clinical inveon dpet scanner at the stanford center for innovation in in vivo imaging 2 3 pet experiment summary large berea core bss3 three pulse injections were performed two single phase water tracer injections at different flow rates and one water nitrogen co injection experiment during these experiments water or water and gas were injected until the differential pressure across the core stabilized once the pressure was stable a pet scan was started and water injection switched to water with diluted fdg i e radiotracer the total volume of radiotracer injected was approximately 15 5 ml for each experiment following the end of radiotracer injection water injection immediately commenced at the same flow rate the confining pressure applied in all experiments was 15 5 bar with 1 4 bar of backpressure the time frames of the reconstructed pet scans all had equal volumes of fluid injected therefor the 10 ml min water injection experiments had 1 min time frame lengths and the 5 ml min water injection experiments had 2 min time frame lengths this time discretization of the pet scans enables direct comparison between experiments with different flow rates additional injection and scanner conditions of the experiments are summarized in table 2 péclet numbers pe v d p d m were approximated assuming diffusivity in the bulk liquid dm equal to 1 10 5 cm 2 s 1 and a typical berea sandstone grain diameter dp of 150 µm dullien 1992 pini et al 2016 small berea core bss2 five single phase pulse injections at different flow rates and five multiphase co injections at different water nitrogen fractional flow rates were performed for the drainage experiment injection and scanner conditions of the experiments are summarized in table 3 the total volume of radiotracer injected was 4 ml for each experiment the confining pressure applied in all experiments was 38 bar with 17 2 bar of backpressure the time frames of the pet reconstructions again all had equal volumes of fluid injected 2 ml per frame or approximately 0 05 pv all of the pet scans described were reconstructed with 3d ordered subset expectation maximization using maximum a priori osem op map hudson and larkin 1994 the time step lengths were chosen to limit the reconstructed scan to 60 frames thus reducing the size of the data files however shorter time steps are possible which provide similar image quality the reconstructions were also corrected for dead time between the start of the pet scan and the start of tracer injection the images were reconstructed with voxels 0 77 mm 0 77 mm 0 79 mm however the images were coarsened to 2 33 mm 2 33 mm 2 39 mm by taking the average of nine voxels the images were coarsened to this resolution in order to reduce data noise see appendix b for detailed error and noise analysis 3 analysis methods for the quantitative analysis of the experimental pet imaging data the core is conceptualized as a bundle of tubes parallel to the direction of flow similar to streamtube conceptualizations of russo and dagan 1993 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 ginn 2001 and pini et al 2016 in this analysis each streamtube is equivalent to a row of voxels along the axis of the core and thus each streamtube has the same cross sectional area with this spatial discretization it is possible to directly calculate spatial and temporal moments for each streamtube this analytical streamtube ensemble approximation assumes that flow in each streamtube is one dimensional has constant velocity has no inter streamtube mixing or transverse dispersion and that all of the streamtubes share the same inlet and outlet pressure boundary conditions these approximations are justified by zero moment analysis of each streamtube showing negligible transverse tracer transport and numerical simulations and analysis described in the following sections 3 1 streamtube reactor ratio to validate streamtube assumptions in order to assess when this streamtube dimension reduction method may be used to accurately characterize sub core permeability relative permeability saturation and dispersion a new form of the traditional reactor ratio is derived the reactor ratio ms derived from entropy concepts is a measure of the uniformity of tracer distribution throughout a bounded system when the tracer is perfectly evenly distributed throughout a system the reactor ratio is equal to one kitanidis 1994 1 m s 1 n exp k 1 n p k ln p k in a system discretized into n 3d cells pk is the ratio of radiotracer in cell k divided by the total amount of radiotracer in the core in order to apply this concept to the streamtube model pk is instead the ratio of radiotracer in a streamtube k divided by the total amount of radiotracer in the core under this variation the streamtube reactor ratio ignores longitudinal dispersion and mixing and only varies in time if there is transverse advection or dispersion based on this formulation the streamtube reactor ratio should stay constant and be equal to one in a homogeneous system between the time when all of the radiotracer is in the core and when the tracer breaks through the outlet during the time prior to tracer breakthrough this formulation requires some amount of radiotracer to exist in each streamtube in order to calculate the natural logarithm of pk in a heterogeneous system the reactor ratio will exhibit different trends depending on the degree and distribution of heterogeneous features if the heterogeneity does not drive significant transverse advection then the streamtube reactor ratio will be slightly less than one indicating more tracer in some streamtubes than others but will remain constant with time if the heterogeneity of the system induces flow focusing or splitting due to strong transverse advection the reactor ratio will increase or decrease with time depending on the spatial distribution of high and low conductivity zones in the sample if there is significant transverse dispersion the streamtube reactor ratio will increase with time as the dilution in the system increases therefore if the streamtube reactor ratio stays nearly constant as the tracer pulse travels through the core then the streamtube assumption of one dimensional flow in each row of voxels along the axis of the core is valid 3 2 numerical simulation to illustrate reactor ratio to further illustrate the streamtube reactor ratio and the applicability of these sub core single and multiphase characterization techniques a 3d simulation model was built using the computer modeling group cmg stars simulator computer modelling group 2013 cmg stars was chosen for its ease of use and flexibility in modeling conservative and non conservative tracer transport in single and multiphase systems with user defined fluid properties the water tracer nitrogen system of conservation equations was discretized with finite difference methods and solved using newton s method and cmg s non parallel iterative solver computer modelling group 1993 the results 3d application was used to quickly visualize simulation results and export data for reactor ratio calculations in matlab five different permeability models were tested which all had the same average porosity 20 69 dimensions 5 cm diameter 10 cm in length and constant injection boundary conditions as the single phase 2 ml min experiment in sample bss2 the pore pressure was set to 3 4 bar the simulation grid was constructed so that it was identical in size to the reconstructed pet images 2 33 mm 2 33 mm 2 39 mm the five models were a homogeneous core 40 md everywhere a streamtube like permeability model where the permeability does not vary along the axis of the core a streamtube permeability model with the streamtubes in the bottom half of the core having a factor of five times higher permeability a low permeability 1 md wedge near the core outlet and a low permeability flow barrier 5 md oblique to the direction of flow termed the tilted model fig 2 illustrates the permeability along the center slice of the heterogeneous permeability models nine single phase injection simulations were performed to illustrate the evolution of the streamtube reactor ratio under different permeability and dispersion conditions as the tracer pulse traversed the simulated core due to truncation errors arising from the finite difference discretization technique employed in cmg the total longitudinal dispersion is a combination of numerical dispersion and dispersion prescribed by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the source of the longitudinal dispersion does not impact the efficacy of the simulations to illustrate the reactor ratio this was validated by comparing the results of the homogeneous cmg model to the one dimensional analytical solution of the advection dispersion equation for a pulse injection for all simulations the molecular diffusion was set to zero and the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients were zero unless explicitly noted fig 3 shows a snapshot of the radiotracer concentration profile in six of the simulations fig 4 provides the calculated streamtube reactor ratio for each of the simulations as a function of pore volumes injected the first reactor ratio measurements for each of the models provides a good indication of the role of heterogeneity during the initial tracer injection following tracer injection the flow focusing behavior of tracer through the wedge model leads to a decrease in the reactor ratio while increasing transverse dispersion acts to increase the reactor ratio by more evenly distributing tracer through the streamtubes as a function of time the homogeneous model has a constant reactor ratio of one as would be expected when the tracer experiences no transverse advection or dispersion the reactor ratio of the streamtube model streamtube model with exaggerated longitudinal dispersion and tilted model closely follow the behavior of the homogeneous model the reactor ratio in these cases is slightly less than one because some streamtubes have slightly more radiotracer than other streamtubes due to the described heterogeneity the simulation with an exaggerated longitudinal dispersion coefficient relative to the other models d l 0 02 cm2min 1 highlights that the streamtube reactor ratio is independent of the extent and location of solute within a given streamtube this is emphasized by the visual difference in solute distribution between the two upper left models in fig 3 but nearly identical reactor ratio values in fig 4 3 3 streamtube reactor ratio analysis of experimental data like the simulation models of tracer transport through heterogeneous cores the streamtube reactor ratio can also be calculated for the single and multiphase tracer pulse experiments fig 5 the multiphase experiments have lower streamtube reactor ratios than the single phase experiments because the presence of the gas in the pore space tends to enhance the variation in tracer distribution between different streamtubes it is important to emphasize that to apply the streamtube dimension reduction the reactor ratio can be and in heterogeneous cores is expected to be less than one however the reactor ratio must be nearly constant as the pulse of tracer traverses the core increasing or decreasing reactor ratios indicate transverse advection or dispersion thus violating the assumptions of the streamtube model the streamtube reactor ratios calculated for the pulse injection experiments in both cores indicate that reactor ratios are nearly constant as the tracer travels through the core thereby justifying the use of streamtube dimension reduction for moment analysis 3 4 moment analysis of experimental micro pet data moment analysis is a statistical method for describing solute flow in porous media and enables the characterization of solute mass location and distribution in a system aris 1956 the zero spatial moment gives the total mass of solute or in this case total radioactivity r in mci of solute in the system the first spatial moment describes the location of the center of mass of the solute pulse and the second spatial moment describes the amount of spreading of the solute as the pulse travels through the rock the general form of the one dimensional nth spatial moment is given by eq 2 2 m x n x n r x t d x from this general form the center of mass x can be calculated by taking the normalized first moment from the inlet x 0 to the outlet x l of each streamtube in the core as shown in eq 3 3 x m x 1 m x 0 0 l x r x d x 0 l r x d x an illustration of a radioactivity profile and center of mass calculation in one of the streamtubes at three different time steps is shown in fig 6 quantifying the rate of center of mass movement in time enables the calculation of the average pore water velocity v of the solute pulse in each streamtube 4 v d x d t d d t m x 1 m x 0 the streamtube water flux qw can be calculated using the change in the zero moment i e total radioactivity in a given streamtube during the tracer injection scaled by the known concentration of activity injected c 0 as shown in eq 5 this can be performed by either calculating the slope of the zero moment during injection dashed line in fig 7 or by taking the radiotracer zero moment during steady advection and dividing by known length of injection the concentration of activity injected is measured using radioactivity sensors attached to the inlet and outlet tubing lines and confirmed with dose calibration chamber measurements which accurately measure the radioactivity of fluid samples 5 q w 1 c 0 d d t m x 0 a plot illustrating the change in zero moment during tracer injection advection through the core and flow through the outlet is shown in fig 7 this analysis was performed for all of the streamtubes in order to independently measure pore water velocity and water flux in each streamtube during single and multiphase flow experiments 3 5 permeability and porosity calculation using the streamtube tracer velocity and streamtube flux the streamtube porosity ϕ may be calculated by volumetric flux balance 6 ϕ q w a v where a is the streamtube cross sectional area with information about streamtube velocity and porosity it possible to calculate the permeability of each streamtube k by either using darcy s law to solve for the permeability in each streamtube as shown in eq 7 or by scaling the core average permeability k as described in eq 8 see appendix c for derivation 7 k v μ w ϕ l δ p 8 k v ϕ a k q w where qw is the total water injection rate and a is the cross sectional area of the core both methods yield very similar results fig 8 confirming that average streamtube permeability is equal to core average permeability both permeability maps in fig 8 highlight the heterogeneity in permeability ranging from roughly 40 md to 65 md between the different bedding layers in the bss3 core fig 9 illustrates calculated streamtube permeability maps for sample bss3 from four single phase pulse injection experiments this highlights the consistency and repeatability of this method of permeability quantification at different flow rates 3 6 saturation calculation phase saturations during multiphase flow are typically measured using imaging methods e g akin and kovscek 2003 zahasky and benson 2016 or mass balance geophysical methods e g bennion and bachu 2005 however analytical moment methods also enable the calculation of phase saturations at the core and streamtube scale first the core average saturation sw can be calculated using a multiphase volumetric flux balance eq 9 9 s w q w a v φ where v is the core average pore velocity calculated as in eq 4 and φ is the core average porosity water saturation in each streamtube sw can be calculated using a similar volumetric flux balance as given by eq 10 10 s w q w a v ϕ 3 7 streamtube relative permeability calculation similar to the single phase expression the steady state multiphase darcy s law written as a function of individual streamtube flux is given by eq 11 11 q w a k r w k δ p μ w l where krw is the relative permeability of each streamtube and δp is the pressure drop across the core after subtracting the capillary pressure drop as determined by the core average saturation calculation and the scaled micp data rearranging eq 11 to solve for the relative permeability and substituting in eq 5 gives an expression for calculating relative permeability using only the pet derived moment data and pressure transducer data 12 k r w 1 c 0 d m x 0 d t μ w l a k δ p with the results from eqs 10 and 12 it is possible to calculate individual relative permeability for each streamtube in the core in fig 10 streamtube relative permeability values are plotted versus the respective streamtube saturations for both core samples while there is uncertainty in individual streamtubes due to the propagation of measurement noise grey crosses in fig 10 details of error calculations provided in appendix b some of the scattering in streamtube relative permeability is likely due to sub core heterogeneity in relative permeability future improvements in experimental design pet reconstruction methods designed for earth materials and attenuation correction from a combined pet ct scanner will help reduce this uncertainty in order to more accurately quantify this sub core relative permeability heterogeneity 3 8 longitudinal dispersion characterization dispersion results from mixing due to velocity variations within and between pores and molecular diffusion dm a process described by fick s law where solute flux is driven by concentration gradients at rates proportional to those gradients the longitudinal dispersion dl is often described by eq 13 bear 1972 13 d l α v d m where α is the dispersivity or sometimes referred to as the mechanical dispersion coefficient at péclet numbers greater than approximately three the dispersion becomes more dominated by mechanical dispersion blunt et al 2013 and molecular diffusion can be neglected as is the case in the experiments described in this study see tables 2 and 3 the second spatial moment describes the variance σ 2 of the solute along the streamtube the normalized central second moment can be calculated with the following equation 14 σ 2 m x 2 m x 0 m x 1 m x 0 2 m x 2 m x 0 x 2 scheidegger 1955 and aris 1956 showed that this variance of the solute distribution in a one dimensional tube can be related explicitly to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient dl by eq 15 like the general statistical moment analysis this formulation assumes the radiotracer is an ideal tracer that the velocity is steady and homogeneous within each streamtube and the ergodic hypothesis holds such that the center of mass of the radiotracer pulse travels at the speed of the mean pore velocity and that the effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient tends to a fixed value 15 d l 1 2 d σ 2 d t neglecting molecular diffusion eqs 15 and 13 can be combined to give 16 d l α v 1 2 d σ 2 d t assuming steady velocity in each streamtube eq 4 can be substituted into eq 16 and rearranged to solve for the dispersivity as shown in eq 17 17 α 1 2 d σ 2 d x using eqs 14 and 17 it is possible to calculate the dispersivity of the tracer in each streamtube for both the single and multiphase experiments to measure dispersivity from the micro pet data the normalized central second moments eq 14 of each streamtube were calculated at each time step a line was then fit to the second moments plotted as a function of the center of mass determined by eq 3 the slope of this line gives d σ 2 d x so that the streamtube dispersivity can then be calculated using eq 17 fitting a line to the second moment as a function of center of mass for each streamtube significantly reduced the propagation of small measurement errors at each time step the dispersivity maps as well as the respective dispersivity frequency distributions are shown in figs 11 and 12 and for a single phase and multiphase experiment in samples bss3 and bss2 respectively fig 13 shows the longitudinal streamtube dispersion coefficient divided by the estimated molecular diffusion as a function of péclet number for every streamtube in every single phase experiment performed in this study this figure highlights that the streamtube dispersion values are consistent with previously published measurements in berea sandstone cores across a range of péclet numbers 4 discussion and conclusion this study utilizes positron emission tomography to acquire high quality data sets of solute transport in real geologic porous media at the continuum scale a micro pet scanner was used to image pulses of a conservative radiotracer injected first during single phase experiments at different flow rates and then during water gas co injection experiments in two different sized heterogeneous berea sandstone cores the cores were then approximated as a bundle of tubes parallel to the direction of flow in order to reduce the spatial dimensions of the problem from 3d to 2d with this simplification spatial moment analysis of the micro pet data can be used to measure the pore water velocity and flux of a pulse of radioactive tracer in the aqueous phase these measurements enable local calculations of porosity permeability water saturation relative permeability and dispersivity an adaption of the reactor ratio termed the streamtube reactor ratio was introduced in order to assess whether the streamtube dimension reduction technique described in this study is valid for a given pulse injection experiment in a heterogeneous system the advantage of using the reactor ratio over the closely related dilution index is that it enables comparison of systems i e cores and columns of different sizes this allows us to compare dilution behavior in experiments and simulations for cores of different diameters and lengths the reactor ratio of the tracer pulse varies as it traverses the core if there is significant transverse advection or transverse dispersion as illustrated by the simulation examples provided in section 3 this analysis verifies that while the core samples used in the study exhibit sub core heterogeneity the heterogeneity is not strong enough to violate the linear streamtube assumption of near zero inter streamtube mixing or transverse dispersion it should be possible to use these spatial moment methods of parameter characterization in non axial parallel streamtubes however this would require spatial interpolation of the discrete 3d pet data spatial moment techniques provide a new way to quantify sub core permeability and relative permeability calculated streamtube relative permeability values were plotted as a function of streamtube saturations the data indicate several trends first the individual streamtubes exhibit a slightly more linear relative permeability behavior than the core average second while measurement uncertainty introduces scatter in individual streamtube water relative permeability calculations water saturation variation driven by capillary heterogeneity is expected to produce inter streamtube and intra streamtube tracer velocity variations these velocity variations reflect sub core relative permeability heterogeneity and thus contribute to the scatter of individual streamtube relative permeability values future improvements in experimental design pet reconstruction methods designed for earth materials saturations measured with computed tomography and attenuation correction from a combined pet ct scanner will significantly reduce uncertainty and enable more detailed measurements of sub core relative permeability behavior spatial moment analysis of micro pet data enables in situ sub core dispersion measurement of solute transport under single and multiphase flow conditions measurements of longitudinal dispersion as a function of péclet number have been shown to agree well with previous core average measurements in berea samples fig 13 dispersion measurements at higher péclet numbers are possible for future studies however flow rates will be limited by the minimum temporal resolution of the pet scanner which is around 10 20 s depending on radioactivity dosing previous experimental studies exploring the relationship between water saturation and solute dispersion required painstaking processes in order to obtain homogeneous water saturations and then maintain these saturations during the introduction and displacement of a solute in order to calculate core average dispersion as a result there are significant differences in trends of dispersion as a function of water saturation pore water velocity and grain size across literature the range of streamtube average water saturations measured in this study limits analysis of whether the relationship between saturation and dispersivity is monotonic or hyperbolic which has been a source of disagreement in previous studies e g bunsri et al 2007 toride et al 2003 it is clear from the comparison of single phase and multiphase dispersivity histograms figs 11 and 12 that the presence of gas acts to skew the distributions to higher streamtube dispersivity values future studies utilizing this method of sub core dispersion measurement are needed in order to better quantify the relationship between water saturation and dispersivity over a wide range of grain sizes flow rates and saturations this work describes new methods to characterize rock and solute transport properties at the millimeter scale using micro pet this is close to the base of the continuum scale where volume averaged properties such as permeability relative permeability and dispersivity can be defined bear 1972 due to the high energy level of the photons detected during the pet scans future studies could employ similar methods and techniques to measure these transport properties in samples as large as tens of centimeters using clinical pet scanners data from this work and future experiments could then be used to inform multi scale simulation studies to better understand how to properly incorporate transport properties measured at the laboratory scale into reservoir scale simulation models analysis of variation of sub core properties such as dispersion and permeability may also be used to develop better stochastic simulation models for quantifying uncertainty arising from geologic heterogeneity finally this study highlights the use of the relatively novel but powerful imaging system positron emission tomography for solute transport quantification in geologic porous media pet and in particular small bore micro pet is ideally suited for quantification of radiotracer advection dispersion and diffusion in geologic porous media there is significant potential for future studies to develop and test additional inversion methods using pet data under many experimental conditions the advantages of pet over traditional imaging methods include enhanced temporal resolution a better signal to noise ratio and capability to image in situ conservative tracers pet imaging particularly when paired with other imaging and geophysical techniques has the potential to be an invaluable tool

careful review of the manuscript and their suggestions for improvements appendix a experimental setup description a schematic of the experimental setup used for these experiments is shown in fig 14 the setup enables both single and multiphase fluid injection radiotracer removal and shielding and continuous collection of inlet and outlet pressure and radiotracer concentration data continuous water injection is achieved with a pair of teledyne isco model 500d syringe pumps and core outlet backpressure is maintained with an isco model 1000d syringe pump gas is injected using a sierra c100l gas mass flow controller rated to 500 psi confining pressure is applied with an isco 500d pump and is set to 400 450 psi for all experiments tracer is injected into the core from an additional isco 500d pump and is loaded using an ne 1000 programmable single syringe pump injected fluid passes through an inlet radioactivity detector prior to entering the sample holder the effluent fluid then passes through an outlet radioactivity detector prior to being discharged into a waste container both differential omegadyne 150 diff w w usbh and absolute omegadyne 100 usbh fluid pressure are measured at the inlet and outlet of the sample holder lead bricks and machined lead shielding is placed around several of the experiment components including the radioactivity detectors injection syringe tracer injection pump backpressure pump and the radioactivity waste reservoir shielding is used to reduce the radiation dose received by the experimenter and to reduce the background radiation that can increase noise during the micro pet scans the aluminum coreholder used in this study was custom built to fit in the micro pet scanner there are two confining pressure ports on the inlet of the coreholder to enable temperature control via continuous fluid circulation between the coreholder and the confining pressure pump which contained a temperature control sleeve the confining pressure water was circulated with an eldex recipro series 2000 reciprocating piston pump appendix b noise and error propagation analysis reconstructed positron emission tomography data is subject to measurement noise in the form of random fluctuations in repeated radiotracer concentration measurements at a given point this fluctuation is due to random variability arising from the physics of positron emission annihilation and photon detection and or photon attenuation this noise can be quantified by analyzing repeated temporal measurements of radiotracer concentration in a fixed homogeneous source of fdg the fluctuation in radiotracer concentration can be quantified by the standard error or the relative standard error the standard error is calculated by first taking the standard deviation σc of n voxel concentration c measurements as shown in eq 18 where c is the mean of the repeated measurements 18 σ c σ c 2 c c 2 n 1 the standard error of each set of measurements is calculated by eq 19 19 σ c σ c n the relative standard error rse is then calculated by dividing the standard error by the mean concentration of the stationary source 20 rse c σ c c since the concentration of a source is continuously changing due to radioactive decay the relative standard error provides a way to normalize the error measurements to account for this change in concentration the rse can be calculated for different voxel sizes by averaging radiotracer values of neighboring voxels fig 15 shows the trend of the rse c for increasing voxel size from this it is clear that there is a significant drop in uncertainty by averaging 33 voxels leading to a coarsened grid with voxel sizes of 2 33 mm 2 33 mm 2 39 mm however further coarsening only marginally reduces the measurement uncertainty calculated values of streamtube permeability porosity saturation and relative permeability are also subject to uncertainty arising from statistical errors such as random variations of repeated pressure transducer measurements and spatial and temporal variability of the velocity and flux measurements this uncertainty can be quantified spatially for each streamtube and temporally by measuring pore water velocity at multiple times in order to measure the propagation of the standard error σ z the accumulation of these two sources of uncertainty can be determined using the standard expression for error propagation of products and ratios eq 21 21 σ z z σ x x 2 σ y y 2 where the standard deviation σx and standard error σ x of n individual x measurements e g pressure or velocity in a given streamtube are calculated as in eqs 18 and 19 as an example to calculate the uncertainty in relative permeability eq 7 expression 22 is used eq 22 incorporates the error from both the streamtube porosity calculation eq 6 and the streamtube permeability 22 σ k r w k r w 2 σ v v 2 2 σ q q 2 2 σ δ p δ p 2 the relative permeability and water saturation standard errors used for the calculation of the grey bars in fig 10 were 0 105 and 0 0921 respectively the calculated velocity standard error σ v v was 0 0261 flux standard error σ q q was 0 0128 and pressure standard error σ δ p δ p was 0 0352 appendix c streamtube permeability derivation darcy s law describing flow for the entire core is given by eq 23 23 q w a k μ w δ p l where qw is the injection rate a is the cross sectional area of the core l is the length of the core k is the average core permeability as described in section 2 1 and δp is the pressure drop measured across the core the pore water velocity of each streamtube can also be described by darcy s law as shown in eq 24 24 v k μ w ϕ δ p l where ϕ is the average streamtube porosity measured during the ct porosity characterization the term k is the streamtube permeability rearranging eq 23 and 24 and setting like terms equal gives eq 25 25 q w a k δ p μ w l v ϕ k solving for streamtube permeability gives eq 8

scale models advancements in imaging and experiment methods have enabled significant progress in measurement and understanding of heterogeneity in porosity fluid saturations akin and kovscek 2003 ferno et al 2015 mitchell et al 2013 perrin and benson 2010 zahasky and benson 2016 permeability krause et al 2013 and capillary pressure at the laboratory scale pini and benson 2013 pini et al 2012 trevisan et al 2015 the most common imaging modality used in earth sciences is clinical or more recently micro scale x ray computed tomography however magnetic resonance imaging mri and positron emission tomography pet are emerging as valuable imaging platforms computed tomography relies on the generation and transmission of x rays during discrete time intervals in order to image a 3d material and it is widely established as an essential tool for quantification of saturation behavior and structural properties of geologic materials e g akin and kovscek 2003 perrin and benson 2010 magnetic resonance imaging or more generally nuclear magnetic resonance imaging uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves in order to image and quantify the contrast between different materials positron emission tomography and other emission tomography techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography spect rely on the detection of photon emissions produced during radioactive decay of radiotracers injected into a 3d system using robust reconstruction techniques it is possible to produce quantitative four dimensional images of the radiotracer transport in the material a growing number of studies are employing positron emission tomography for solute transport quantification boutchko et al 2012 brattekas et al 2016 ferno et al 2015 goethals et al 2009 hu et al 2017 kulenkampff et al 2015 lippmann pipke et al 2017 pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2017 as it is ideally suited for measuring solute advection dispersion and diffusion in geologic porous media one of the advantages of pet over many ct and mri systems is the temporal resolution over the duration of a pet scan coincident photon events are collected continuously by a cylindrical array of photon detectors located in the pet scanner coincident events are collected everywhere along the axis of the scanner which is therefore able to image cores less than 12 cm long the length of the bore of the micro pet scanner used in this study without physically moving the core during the reconstruction of a pet scan these events can be binned temporally to create time lapse images of the scan depending on the intensity of the radiotracer and scanner properties these time frames can be as short as 10 20 seconds this capability provides the necessary temporal resolution to quantify solute spreading at many time steps between tracer injection initiation and tracer breakthrough even with fairly rapid flow rates fig 1 highlights this capability by illustrating the distribution of a radiotracer pulse injected at 5 ml min along the length of a relatively heterogeneous berea sandstone core at four different times prior to tracer breakthrough this data will be examined in greater detail in the following sections a second major advantage of using pet imaging for tracer transport quantification is the high sensitivity to small changes in tracer concentration x ray ct imaging relies on the electron density contrast between fluids i e water and water with a high density tracer to produce different levels of attenuation which is then converted into concentration measurements at lower concentrations small changes in signal relative to imaging noise can make accurate concentration profiles difficult to acquire the contrast between no radioisotope and full pore saturation is much larger during a pet scan than the contrast created by the electron density of the fluids thus allowing pet to measure small changes in solute concentration with a greater sensitivity than ct the final advantage of pet is that due to the high energy of the 511 kev gamma rays produced during positron annihilation it is possible for the photons to travel through nearly all geologic materials without major losses in resolution particularly with high quality attenuation correction the presence of paramagnetic minerals in many geologic materials can sometimes limit mri imaging to quantification of solute transport in artificial porous media nestle et al 2003 reeves and chudek 2001 werth et al 2010 the biggest disadvantage of using pet for imaging studies has been the limited spatial resolution the resolution of reconstructed pet scans is a function of the physical imaging system optimization of radioactivity levels and the quality and method of image reconstruction and attenuation correction using clinical pet scanners the fundamental resolution limits are around 3 mm depending on the radioisotope being imaged and radiotracer concentration optimization however as the system size is decreased the fundamental limit drops to less than 1 mm due to reductions in errors from photon non collinearity and smaller detector element widths levin and hoffman 1999 these smaller systems are known as pre clinical micro pet scanners which are commonly used in small animal imaging studies and have only recently been employed for earth science applications brattekas et al 2016 hu et al 2017 kulenkampff et al 2015 zahasky and benson 2016 2017 while the image resolution can be significantly better with smaller system size pet scans also experience losses in resolution during the image reconstruction process in order to reduce errors during the reconstruction process it is usually necessary to obtain an attenuation correction map of the object being scanned an attenuation correction map is generally obtained with a ct scanner or other x ray transmission source and provides information about how positron sourced photons may attenuate as they travel between the source i e radiotracer and the scanner detectors finally optimal radiotracer activity dosing is essential to obtain high quality images the optimal activity level will maximize detection events without saturating the scanner photon detectors understanding small scale i e sub core scale variations in permeability porosity and relative permeability can provide new insights into transport phenomena across scales several methods exist for quantifying sub core porosity with the most common method employing x ray ct akin and kovscek 2003 however measurements of sub core permeability and relative permeability are more challenging methods for permeability quantification include multiphase scaling experimental techniques krause et al 2013 pini and benson 2013 numerical and inverse methods krause et al 2013 lee et al 2016 and correlation with other rock properties such as porosity or grain size e g chilingar 1964 tiab and donaldson 2016 with the advancement in higher resolution micro ct scanners methods of permeability quantification from pore structure have also been developed e g blunt 1997 jerauld and salter 1990 spanne et al 1994 while each of these methods can be very effective each one has weaknesses for example multiphase scaling experimental techniques require multiphase experiments and rely on the assumption that some scaling relationship such as leverett j exists inverse methods can be very computationally expensive and are usually non unique lee et al 2016 correlation methods work well in some cases but breakdown quickly in other cases micro ct techniques may have limited sample size can be computationally expensive and difficult to verify in this study a new mathematical approach for sub core scale characterization is proposed using positron emission tomography to image pulse injections of a conservative radiotracer the tracer experiments are first completed during single phase flow and later during multiphase steady state drainage conditions in two different heterogeneous berea sandstone cores with these experiments we demonstrate the application of micro pet in order to 1 use spatial moment analysis to quantify sub core tracer flux and pore water velocity 2 characterize sub core scale permeability distributions and 3 calculate wetting phase relative permeability saturation and dispersivity the spatial moment analysis described here relies on reducing the three dimensional system to a two dimensional bundle of streamtubes numerical simulations are performed to highlight cases where this dimension reduction is and is not possible these simulations justify that the experiments performed in this study enable streamtube analysis despite sub core heterogeneity a new application of the reactor ratio referred to as the streamtube reactor ratio is presented to reliably determine when it is possible to apply this dimension reduction technique 2 experimental methods 2 1 sample characterization two different cores were utilized in this study in order to explore the optimal size core for micro pet experiments the two core samples used in this experiment are a 3 5 inch diameter hereon referred to as bss3 and a 2 inch diameter hereon referred to as bss2 berea sandstone acquired from cleveland quarries the porosity of the cores was measured using both a clinical ct scanner as described in akin and kovscek 2003 as well as small plug analysis with a micromeritics accupyc ii helium pycnometer variation in sample porosity was similiar to the magnitude of the measurement noise of the ct scanner and therefore considered constant single phase steady state water injection at multiple flow rates was performed in order to measure the core average permeability table 1 permeability standard deviation was determined using two phase coreflooding methods described in krause et al 2013 and zahasky and benson 2016 table 1 this permeability heterogeneity in the cores is a result of visible axial parallel bedding layers due to slight variations in sandstone grain size and composition a summary of core properties and dimensions is given in table 1 2 2 experimental setup to perform micro pet imaging of multiphase injection in the sandstone core a standard core flooding apparatus perrin and benson 2010 requires several additional components in order to enable injection quantification and disposal of radioactive tracers a detailed description of the experimental setup and summary schematic can be found in appendix a prior to starting the experiments the cores were saturated with tap water using the method described by perrin and benson 2010 prior to starting the micro pet scan the radiotracer fludeoxyglucose 18f fdg was mixed into the isco pump initially containing tap water using the method described in zahasky and benson 2016 in order to ensure proper mixing in the pump fludeoxyglucose is a widely available conservative tracer as confirmed by radioactivity mass balance from tracer curve analysis and has a half life of 109 7 minutes these characteristics make fdg an ideal choice for multi hour tracer injection studies the pet scans were performed using a siemens pre clinical inveon dpet scanner at the stanford center for innovation in in vivo imaging 2 3 pet experiment summary large berea core bss3 three pulse injections were performed two single phase water tracer injections at different flow rates and one water nitrogen co injection experiment during these experiments water or water and gas were injected until the differential pressure across the core stabilized once the pressure was stable a pet scan was started and water injection switched to water with diluted fdg i e radiotracer the total volume of radiotracer injected was approximately 15 5 ml for each experiment following the end of radiotracer injection water injection immediately commenced at the same flow rate the confining pressure applied in all experiments was 15 5 bar with 1 4 bar of backpressure the time frames of the reconstructed pet scans all had equal volumes of fluid injected therefor the 10 ml min water injection experiments had 1 min time frame lengths and the 5 ml min water injection experiments had 2 min time frame lengths this time discretization of the pet scans enables direct comparison between experiments with different flow rates additional injection and scanner conditions of the experiments are summarized in table 2 péclet numbers pe v d p d m were approximated assuming diffusivity in the bulk liquid dm equal to 1 10 5 cm 2 s 1 and a typical berea sandstone grain diameter dp of 150 µm dullien 1992 pini et al 2016 small berea core bss2 five single phase pulse injections at different flow rates and five multiphase co injections at different water nitrogen fractional flow rates were performed for the drainage experiment injection and scanner conditions of the experiments are summarized in table 3 the total volume of radiotracer injected was 4 ml for each experiment the confining pressure applied in all experiments was 38 bar with 17 2 bar of backpressure the time frames of the pet reconstructions again all had equal volumes of fluid injected 2 ml per frame or approximately 0 05 pv all of the pet scans described were reconstructed with 3d ordered subset expectation maximization using maximum a priori osem op map hudson and larkin 1994 the time step lengths were chosen to limit the reconstructed scan to 60 frames thus reducing the size of the data files however shorter time steps are possible which provide similar image quality the reconstructions were also corrected for dead time between the start of the pet scan and the start of tracer injection the images were reconstructed with voxels 0 77 mm 0 77 mm 0 79 mm however the images were coarsened to 2 33 mm 2 33 mm 2 39 mm by taking the average of nine voxels the images were coarsened to this resolution in order to reduce data noise see appendix b for detailed error and noise analysis 3 analysis methods for the quantitative analysis of the experimental pet imaging data the core is conceptualized as a bundle of tubes parallel to the direction of flow similar to streamtube conceptualizations of russo and dagan 1993 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 ginn 2001 and pini et al 2016 in this analysis each streamtube is equivalent to a row of voxels along the axis of the core and thus each streamtube has the same cross sectional area with this spatial discretization it is possible to directly calculate spatial and temporal moments for each streamtube this analytical streamtube ensemble approximation assumes that flow in each streamtube is one dimensional has constant velocity has no inter streamtube mixing or transverse dispersion and that all of the streamtubes share the same inlet and outlet pressure boundary conditions these approximations are justified by zero moment analysis of each streamtube showing negligible transverse tracer transport and numerical simulations and analysis described in the following sections 3 1 streamtube reactor ratio to validate streamtube assumptions in order to assess when this streamtube dimension reduction method may be used to accurately characterize sub core permeability relative permeability saturation and dispersion a new form of the traditional reactor ratio is derived the reactor ratio ms derived from entropy concepts is a measure of the uniformity of tracer distribution throughout a bounded system when the tracer is perfectly evenly distributed throughout a system the reactor ratio is equal to one kitanidis 1994 1 m s 1 n exp k 1 n p k ln p k in a system discretized into n 3d cells pk is the ratio of radiotracer in cell k divided by the total amount of radiotracer in the core in order to apply this concept to the streamtube model pk is instead the ratio of radiotracer in a streamtube k divided by the total amount of radiotracer in the core under this variation the streamtube reactor ratio ignores longitudinal dispersion and mixing and only varies in time if there is transverse advection or dispersion based on this formulation the streamtube reactor ratio should stay constant and be equal to one in a homogeneous system between the time when all of the radiotracer is in the core and when the tracer breaks through the outlet during the time prior to tracer breakthrough this formulation requires some amount of radiotracer to exist in each streamtube in order to calculate the natural logarithm of pk in a heterogeneous system the reactor ratio will exhibit different trends depending on the degree and distribution of heterogeneous features if the heterogeneity does not drive significant transverse advection then the streamtube reactor ratio will be slightly less than one indicating more tracer in some streamtubes than others but will remain constant with time if the heterogeneity of the system induces flow focusing or splitting due to strong transverse advection the reactor ratio will increase or decrease with time depending on the spatial distribution of high and low conductivity zones in the sample if there is significant transverse dispersion the streamtube reactor ratio will increase with time as the dilution in the system increases therefore if the streamtube reactor ratio stays nearly constant as the tracer pulse travels through the core then the streamtube assumption of one dimensional flow in each row of voxels along the axis of the core is valid 3 2 numerical simulation to illustrate reactor ratio to further illustrate the streamtube reactor ratio and the applicability of these sub core single and multiphase characterization techniques a 3d simulation model was built using the computer modeling group cmg stars simulator computer modelling group 2013 cmg stars was chosen for its ease of use and flexibility in modeling conservative and non conservative tracer transport in single and multiphase systems with user defined fluid properties the water tracer nitrogen system of conservation equations was discretized with finite difference methods and solved using newton s method and cmg s non parallel iterative solver computer modelling group 1993 the results 3d application was used to quickly visualize simulation results and export data for reactor ratio calculations in matlab five different permeability models were tested which all had the same average porosity 20 69 dimensions 5 cm diameter 10 cm in length and constant injection boundary conditions as the single phase 2 ml min experiment in sample bss2 the pore pressure was set to 3 4 bar the simulation grid was constructed so that it was identical in size to the reconstructed pet images 2 33 mm 2 33 mm 2 39 mm the five models were a homogeneous core 40 md everywhere a streamtube like permeability model where the permeability does not vary along the axis of the core a streamtube permeability model with the streamtubes in the bottom half of the core having a factor of five times higher permeability a low permeability 1 md wedge near the core outlet and a low permeability flow barrier 5 md oblique to the direction of flow termed the tilted model fig 2 illustrates the permeability along the center slice of the heterogeneous permeability models nine single phase injection simulations were performed to illustrate the evolution of the streamtube reactor ratio under different permeability and dispersion conditions as the tracer pulse traversed the simulated core due to truncation errors arising from the finite difference discretization technique employed in cmg the total longitudinal dispersion is a combination of numerical dispersion and dispersion prescribed by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the source of the longitudinal dispersion does not impact the efficacy of the simulations to illustrate the reactor ratio this was validated by comparing the results of the homogeneous cmg model to the one dimensional analytical solution of the advection dispersion equation for a pulse injection for all simulations the molecular diffusion was set to zero and the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients were zero unless explicitly noted fig 3 shows a snapshot of the radiotracer concentration profile in six of the simulations fig 4 provides the calculated streamtube reactor ratio for each of the simulations as a function of pore volumes injected the first reactor ratio measurements for each of the models provides a good indication of the role of heterogeneity during the initial tracer injection following tracer injection the flow focusing behavior of tracer through the wedge model leads to a decrease in the reactor ratio while increasing transverse dispersion acts to increase the reactor ratio by more evenly distributing tracer through the streamtubes as a function of time the homogeneous model has a constant reactor ratio of one as would be expected when the tracer experiences no transverse advection or dispersion the reactor ratio of the streamtube model streamtube model with exaggerated longitudinal dispersion and tilted model closely follow the behavior of the homogeneous model the reactor ratio in these cases is slightly less than one because some streamtubes have slightly more radiotracer than other streamtubes due to the described heterogeneity the simulation with an exaggerated longitudinal dispersion coefficient relative to the other models d l 0 02 cm2min 1 highlights that the streamtube reactor ratio is independent of the extent and location of solute within a given streamtube this is emphasized by the visual difference in solute distribution between the two upper left models in fig 3 but nearly identical reactor ratio values in fig 4 3 3 streamtube reactor ratio analysis of experimental data like the simulation models of tracer transport through heterogeneous cores the streamtube reactor ratio can also be calculated for the single and multiphase tracer pulse experiments fig 5 the multiphase experiments have lower streamtube reactor ratios than the single phase experiments because the presence of the gas in the pore space tends to enhance the variation in tracer distribution between different streamtubes it is important to emphasize that to apply the streamtube dimension reduction the reactor ratio can be and in heterogeneous cores is expected to be less than one however the reactor ratio must be nearly constant as the pulse of tracer traverses the core increasing or decreasing reactor ratios indicate transverse advection or dispersion thus violating the assumptions of the streamtube model the streamtube reactor ratios calculated for the pulse injection experiments in both cores indicate that reactor ratios are nearly constant as the tracer travels through the core thereby justifying the use of streamtube dimension reduction for moment analysis 3 4 moment analysis of experimental micro pet data moment analysis is a statistical method for describing solute flow in porous media and enables the characterization of solute mass location and distribution in a system aris 1956 the zero spatial moment gives the total mass of solute or in this case total radioactivity r in mci of solute in the system the first spatial moment describes the location of the center of mass of the solute pulse and the second spatial moment describes the amount of spreading of the solute as the pulse travels through the rock the general form of the one dimensional nth spatial moment is given by eq 2 2 m x n x n r x t d x from this general form the center of mass x can be calculated by taking the normalized first moment from the inlet x 0 to the outlet x l of each streamtube in the core as shown in eq 3 3 x m x 1 m x 0 0 l x r x d x 0 l r x d x an illustration of a radioactivity profile and center of mass calculation in one of the streamtubes at three different time steps is shown in fig 6 quantifying the rate of center of mass movement in time enables the calculation of the average pore water velocity v of the solute pulse in each streamtube 4 v d x d t d d t m x 1 m x 0 the streamtube water flux qw can be calculated using the change in the zero moment i e total radioactivity in a given streamtube during the tracer injection scaled by the known concentration of activity injected c 0 as shown in eq 5 this can be performed by either calculating the slope of the zero moment during injection dashed line in fig 7 or by taking the radiotracer zero moment during steady advection and dividing by known length of injection the concentration of activity injected is measured using radioactivity sensors attached to the inlet and outlet tubing lines and confirmed with dose calibration chamber measurements which accurately measure the radioactivity of fluid samples 5 q w 1 c 0 d d t m x 0 a plot illustrating the change in zero moment during tracer injection advection through the core and flow through the outlet is shown in fig 7 this analysis was performed for all of the streamtubes in order to independently measure pore water velocity and water flux in each streamtube during single and multiphase flow experiments 3 5 permeability and porosity calculation using the streamtube tracer velocity and streamtube flux the streamtube porosity ϕ may be calculated by volumetric flux balance 6 ϕ q w a v where a is the streamtube cross sectional area with information about streamtube velocity and porosity it possible to calculate the permeability of each streamtube k by either using darcy s law to solve for the permeability in each streamtube as shown in eq 7 or by scaling the core average permeability k as described in eq 8 see appendix c for derivation 7 k v μ w ϕ l δ p 8 k v ϕ a k q w where qw is the total water injection rate and a is the cross sectional area of the core both methods yield very similar results fig 8 confirming that average streamtube permeability is equal to core average permeability both permeability maps in fig 8 highlight the heterogeneity in permeability ranging from roughly 40 md to 65 md between the different bedding layers in the bss3 core fig 9 illustrates calculated streamtube permeability maps for sample bss3 from four single phase pulse injection experiments this highlights the consistency and repeatability of this method of permeability quantification at different flow rates 3 6 saturation calculation phase saturations during multiphase flow are typically measured using imaging methods e g akin and kovscek 2003 zahasky and benson 2016 or mass balance geophysical methods e g bennion and bachu 2005 however analytical moment methods also enable the calculation of phase saturations at the core and streamtube scale first the core average saturation sw can be calculated using a multiphase volumetric flux balance eq 9 9 s w q w a v φ where v is the core average pore velocity calculated as in eq 4 and φ is the core average porosity water saturation in each streamtube sw can be calculated using a similar volumetric flux balance as given by eq 10 10 s w q w a v ϕ 3 7 streamtube relative permeability calculation similar to the single phase expression the steady state multiphase darcy s law written as a function of individual streamtube flux is given by eq 11 11 q w a k r w k δ p μ w l where krw is the relative permeability of each streamtube and δp is the pressure drop across the core after subtracting the capillary pressure drop as determined by the core average saturation calculation and the scaled micp data rearranging eq 11 to solve for the relative permeability and substituting in eq 5 gives an expression for calculating relative permeability using only the pet derived moment data and pressure transducer data 12 k r w 1 c 0 d m x 0 d t μ w l a k δ p with the results from eqs 10 and 12 it is possible to calculate individual relative permeability for each streamtube in the core in fig 10 streamtube relative permeability values are plotted versus the respective streamtube saturations for both core samples while there is uncertainty in individual streamtubes due to the propagation of measurement noise grey crosses in fig 10 details of error calculations provided in appendix b some of the scattering in streamtube relative permeability is likely due to sub core heterogeneity in relative permeability future improvements in experimental design pet reconstruction methods designed for earth materials and attenuation correction from a combined pet ct scanner will help reduce this uncertainty in order to more accurately quantify this sub core relative permeability heterogeneity 3 8 longitudinal dispersion characterization dispersion results from mixing due to velocity variations within and between pores and molecular diffusion dm a process described by fick s law where solute flux is driven by concentration gradients at rates proportional to those gradients the longitudinal dispersion dl is often described by eq 13 bear 1972 13 d l α v d m where α is the dispersivity or sometimes referred to as the mechanical dispersion coefficient at péclet numbers greater than approximately three the dispersion becomes more dominated by mechanical dispersion blunt et al 2013 and molecular diffusion can be neglected as is the case in the experiments described in this study see tables 2 and 3 the second spatial moment describes the variance σ 2 of the solute along the streamtube the normalized central second moment can be calculated with the following equation 14 σ 2 m x 2 m x 0 m x 1 m x 0 2 m x 2 m x 0 x 2 scheidegger 1955 and aris 1956 showed that this variance of the solute distribution in a one dimensional tube can be related explicitly to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient dl by eq 15 like the general statistical moment analysis this formulation assumes the radiotracer is an ideal tracer that the velocity is steady and homogeneous within each streamtube and the ergodic hypothesis holds such that the center of mass of the radiotracer pulse travels at the speed of the mean pore velocity and that the effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient tends to a fixed value 15 d l 1 2 d σ 2 d t neglecting molecular diffusion eqs 15 and 13 can be combined to give 16 d l α v 1 2 d σ 2 d t assuming steady velocity in each streamtube eq 4 can be substituted into eq 16 and rearranged to solve for the dispersivity as shown in eq 17 17 α 1 2 d σ 2 d x using eqs 14 and 17 it is possible to calculate the dispersivity of the tracer in each streamtube for both the single and multiphase experiments to measure dispersivity from the micro pet data the normalized central second moments eq 14 of each streamtube were calculated at each time step a line was then fit to the second moments plotted as a function of the center of mass determined by eq 3 the slope of this line gives d σ 2 d x so that the streamtube dispersivity can then be calculated using eq 17 fitting a line to the second moment as a function of center of mass for each streamtube significantly reduced the propagation of small measurement errors at each time step the dispersivity maps as well as the respective dispersivity frequency distributions are shown in figs 11 and 12 and for a single phase and multiphase experiment in samples bss3 and bss2 respectively fig 13 shows the longitudinal streamtube dispersion coefficient divided by the estimated molecular diffusion as a function of péclet number for every streamtube in every single phase experiment performed in this study this figure highlights that the streamtube dispersion values are consistent with previously published measurements in berea sandstone cores across a range of péclet numbers 4 discussion and conclusion this study utilizes positron emission tomography to acquire high quality data sets of solute transport in real geologic porous media at the continuum scale a micro pet scanner was used to image pulses of a conservative radiotracer injected first during single phase experiments at different flow rates and then during water gas co injection experiments in two different sized heterogeneous berea sandstone cores the cores were then approximated as a bundle of tubes parallel to the direction of flow in order to reduce the spatial dimensions of the problem from 3d to 2d with this simplification spatial moment analysis of the micro pet data can be used to measure the pore water velocity and flux of a pulse of radioactive tracer in the aqueous phase these measurements enable local calculations of porosity permeability water saturation relative permeability and dispersivity an adaption of the reactor ratio termed the streamtube reactor ratio was introduced in order to assess whether the streamtube dimension reduction technique described in this study is valid for a given pulse injection experiment in a heterogeneous system the advantage of using the reactor ratio over the closely related dilution index is that it enables comparison of systems i e cores and columns of different sizes this allows us to compare dilution behavior in experiments and simulations for cores of different diameters and lengths the reactor ratio of the tracer pulse varies as it traverses the core if there is significant transverse advection or transverse dispersion as illustrated by the simulation examples provided in section 3 this analysis verifies that while the core samples used in the study exhibit sub core heterogeneity the heterogeneity is not strong enough to violate the linear streamtube assumption of near zero inter streamtube mixing or transverse dispersion it should be possible to use these spatial moment methods of parameter characterization in non axial parallel streamtubes however this would require spatial interpolation of the discrete 3d pet data spatial moment techniques provide a new way to quantify sub core permeability and relative permeability calculated streamtube relative permeability values were plotted as a function of streamtube saturations the data indicate several trends first the individual streamtubes exhibit a slightly more linear relative permeability behavior than the core average second while measurement uncertainty introduces scatter in individual streamtube water relative permeability calculations water saturation variation driven by capillary heterogeneity is expected to produce inter streamtube and intra streamtube tracer velocity variations these velocity variations reflect sub core relative permeability heterogeneity and thus contribute to the scatter of individual streamtube relative permeability values future improvements in experimental design pet reconstruction methods designed for earth materials saturations measured with computed tomography and attenuation correction from a combined pet ct scanner will significantly reduce uncertainty and enable more detailed measurements of sub core relative permeability behavior spatial moment analysis of micro pet data enables in situ sub core dispersion measurement of solute transport under single and multiphase flow conditions measurements of longitudinal dispersion as a function of péclet number have been shown to agree well with previous core average measurements in berea samples fig 13 dispersion measurements at higher péclet numbers are possible for future studies however flow rates will be limited by the minimum temporal resolution of the pet scanner which is around 10 20 s depending on radioactivity dosing previous experimental studies exploring the relationship between water saturation and solute dispersion required painstaking processes in order to obtain homogeneous water saturations and then maintain these saturations during the introduction and displacement of a solute in order to calculate core average dispersion as a result there are significant differences in trends of dispersion as a function of water saturation pore water velocity and grain size across literature the range of streamtube average water saturations measured in this study limits analysis of whether the relationship between saturation and dispersivity is monotonic or hyperbolic which has been a source of disagreement in previous studies e g bunsri et al 2007 toride et al 2003 it is clear from the comparison of single phase and multiphase dispersivity histograms figs 11 and 12 that the presence of gas acts to skew the distributions to higher streamtube dispersivity values future studies utilizing this method of sub core dispersion measurement are needed in order to better quantify the relationship between water saturation and dispersivity over a wide range of grain sizes flow rates and saturations this work describes new methods to characterize rock and solute transport properties at the millimeter scale using micro pet this is close to the base of the continuum scale where volume averaged properties such as permeability relative permeability and dispersivity can be defined bear 1972 due to the high energy level of the photons detected during the pet scans future studies could employ similar methods and techniques to measure these transport properties in samples as large as tens of centimeters using clinical pet scanners data from this work and future experiments could then be used to inform multi scale simulation studies to better understand how to properly incorporate transport properties measured at the laboratory scale into reservoir scale simulation models analysis of variation of sub core properties such as dispersion and permeability may also be used to develop better stochastic simulation models for quantifying uncertainty arising from geologic heterogeneity finally this study highlights the use of the relatively novel but powerful imaging system positron emission tomography for solute transport quantification in geologic porous media pet and in particular small bore micro pet is ideally suited for quantification of radiotracer advection dispersion and diffusion in geologic porous media there is significant potential for future studies to develop and test additional inversion methods using pet data under many experimental conditions the advantages of pet over traditional imaging methods include enhanced temporal resolution a better signal to noise ratio and capability to image in situ conservative tracers pet imaging particularly when paired with other imaging and geophysical techniques has the potential to be an invaluable tool

careful review of the manuscript and their suggestions for improvements appendix a experimental setup description a schematic of the experimental setup used for these experiments is shown in fig 14 the setup enables both single and multiphase fluid injection radiotracer removal and shielding and continuous collection of inlet and outlet pressure and radiotracer concentration data continuous water injection is achieved with a pair of teledyne isco model 500d syringe pumps and core outlet backpressure is maintained with an isco model 1000d syringe pump gas is injected using a sierra c100l gas mass flow controller rated to 500 psi confining pressure is applied with an isco 500d pump and is set to 400 450 psi for all experiments tracer is injected into the core from an additional isco 500d pump and is loaded using an ne 1000 programmable single syringe pump injected fluid passes through an inlet radioactivity detector prior to entering the sample holder the effluent fluid then passes through an outlet radioactivity detector prior to being discharged into a waste container both differential omegadyne 150 diff w w usbh and absolute omegadyne 100 usbh fluid pressure are measured at the inlet and outlet of the sample holder lead bricks and machined lead shielding is placed around several of the experiment components including the radioactivity detectors injection syringe tracer injection pump backpressure pump and the radioactivity waste reservoir shielding is used to reduce the radiation dose received by the experimenter and to reduce the background radiation that can increase noise during the micro pet scans the aluminum coreholder used in this study was custom built to fit in the micro pet scanner there are two confining pressure ports on the inlet of the coreholder to enable temperature control via continuous fluid circulation between the coreholder and the confining pressure pump which contained a temperature control sleeve the confining pressure water was circulated with an eldex recipro series 2000 reciprocating piston pump appendix b noise and error propagation analysis reconstructed positron emission tomography data is subject to measurement noise in the form of random fluctuations in repeated radiotracer concentration measurements at a given point this fluctuation is due to random variability arising from the physics of positron emission annihilation and photon detection and or photon attenuation this noise can be quantified by analyzing repeated temporal measurements of radiotracer concentration in a fixed homogeneous source of fdg the fluctuation in radiotracer concentration can be quantified by the standard error or the relative standard error the standard error is calculated by first taking the standard deviation σc of n voxel concentration c measurements as shown in eq 18 where c is the mean of the repeated measurements 18 σ c σ c 2 c c 2 n 1 the standard error of each set of measurements is calculated by eq 19 19 σ c σ c n the relative standard error rse is then calculated by dividing the standard error by the mean concentration of the stationary source 20 rse c σ c c since the concentration of a source is continuously changing due to radioactive decay the relative standard error provides a way to normalize the error measurements to account for this change in concentration the rse can be calculated for different voxel sizes by averaging radiotracer values of neighboring voxels fig 15 shows the trend of the rse c for increasing voxel size from this it is clear that there is a significant drop in uncertainty by averaging 33 voxels leading to a coarsened grid with voxel sizes of 2 33 mm 2 33 mm 2 39 mm however further coarsening only marginally reduces the measurement uncertainty calculated values of streamtube permeability porosity saturation and relative permeability are also subject to uncertainty arising from statistical errors such as random variations of repeated pressure transducer measurements and spatial and temporal variability of the velocity and flux measurements this uncertainty can be quantified spatially for each streamtube and temporally by measuring pore water velocity at multiple times in order to measure the propagation of the standard error σ z the accumulation of these two sources of uncertainty can be determined using the standard expression for error propagation of products and ratios eq 21 21 σ z z σ x x 2 σ y y 2 where the standard deviation σx and standard error σ x of n individual x measurements e g pressure or velocity in a given streamtube are calculated as in eqs 18 and 19 as an example to calculate the uncertainty in relative permeability eq 7 expression 22 is used eq 22 incorporates the error from both the streamtube porosity calculation eq 6 and the streamtube permeability 22 σ k r w k r w 2 σ v v 2 2 σ q q 2 2 σ δ p δ p 2 the relative permeability and water saturation standard errors used for the calculation of the grey bars in fig 10 were 0 105 and 0 0921 respectively the calculated velocity standard error σ v v was 0 0261 flux standard error σ q q was 0 0128 and pressure standard error σ δ p δ p was 0 0352 appendix c streamtube permeability derivation darcy s law describing flow for the entire core is given by eq 23 23 q w a k μ w δ p l where qw is the injection rate a is the cross sectional area of the core l is the length of the core k is the average core permeability as described in section 2 1 and δp is the pressure drop measured across the core the pore water velocity of each streamtube can also be described by darcy s law as shown in eq 24 24 v k μ w ϕ δ p l where ϕ is the average streamtube porosity measured during the ct porosity characterization the term k is the streamtube permeability rearranging eq 23 and 24 and setting like terms equal gives eq 25 25 q w a k δ p μ w l v ϕ k solving for streamtube permeability gives eq 8 
821,few studies have addressed simultaneously the feedback between the hydrodynamics of a gravity current and the geomorphological changes of a mobile bed hydrodynamic quantities such as turbulent and mean velocities bed shear stress and turbulent stresses undoubtedly govern the processes of entrainment transport and deposition on the other hand the incorporation of entrained sediment in the current may change its momentum by introducing extra internal stresses introducing thus a feedback process these two main questions are here investigated laboratory experiments of saline gravity currents produced by lock exchange flowing over a mobile bed channel reach are here reported different initial buoyancies of the current in the lock are tested together with three different grain sizes of the non coherent sediment that form the erodible bed results from velocity measurements are combined with the visualization of the sediment movement in the mobile reach and with post test topographic and photo surveys of the geomorphology modifications of the channel bed mean and turbulent velocities are measured and bed shear stress and reynolds stresses are estimated we show that the mean vertical component of the velocity and bed shear stress are highly correlated with the first instants of sediment entrainment vertical turbulent velocity is similarly related to entrainment although with lower correlation values contributing as well to the sediment movement bed shear stress and reynolds shear stress measured near the bed are correlated with sediment entrainment for longer periods indicating that these quantities are associated to distal transport as well geomorphological changes in the mobile bed are strongly related to the impulse caused by the bed shear stress on the sediment on the other hand we show that the nature of the grain of the mobile bed reach influences the hydrodynamics of the current which means that a feedback mechanisms between both occurs during the passage of the unsteady gravity current the signature of this geomorphological changes which is visible in the form of longitudinal steaks of accumulated sediment downstream the mobile bed is related to the flow initial buoyancy and to the size of the mobile bed sediment it is argued that the bed material and near bed turbulent coherent motion interact and mutually influence each other the geometry of the front of the gravity currents changes with the incorporation of the sediment indicating that with the presence of sediment extra energy losses occur in the front of the current keywords gravity currents sediment entrainment bed shear stress sediment deposition instantaneous velocity erosion capacity 1 introduction gravity or density currents are buoyancy driven flows that occur naturally or as a consequence of human activities simpson 1997 the density difference which causes the formation of a gravity current can be due to a property of the fluid e g temperature or salinity originating a compositional gravity current lombardi et al 2017 ooi et al 2009 ottolenghi et al 2017a ottolenghi et al 2017b ottolenghi et al 2018 or by the presence of particles in suspension as in the case of turbidity currents meiburg and kneller 2010 parker et al 1986 the occurrence of density driven flows in nature is well documented in literature and in few cases in situ measurements of these events were possible paull et al 2002 xu et al 2004 among others gravity currents are mainly a geophysical flow but they are also of importance in engineering application such as industrial flows lyn et al 1992 zhou et al 1994 and for environmental security al majed et al 2012 fernández torquemada et al 2009 huppert and woods 1995 natural gravity currents develop over a wide range of topography and they are frequently major and often catastrophic agents of sediment transport both on land and within the ocean kneller et al 1999 the importance of studying the dynamics of gravity currents and associated sediment transport mechanisms is a matter of natural hazard protection great topography changes and seafloor irregularities caused by the passage of gravity currents can be an obstacle for the installation of submarine facilities clare et al 2013 density flows are considered a reliable and high risk geohazard especially in case of direct impact causing the rupture of cables or dislocation of pipelines and flowlines clare et al 2013 major concerns are related to the potential impact on offshore installations and infrastructures located in the ocean and sea floors and to the ability of density flows to erode sediments from the bed over which they propagate leading to scour undermining underwater structures saline and turbidity currents occurring in submarine environment have been found at the origin of the formation of underwater canyons bharatdwaj 2006 referred that turbidity currents generated through earthquakes and volcano eruptions extremely rapid and powerful are capable of eroding hard rock forming trenches on the continental shelves along these excavated submarine canyons the sediment transfer mechanism is facilitated and large amount of sediment are transported for long distances by gravitational mass flows and by a variety of channeled currents that oscillate up and down canyon influenced by tidal flows kostic and parker 2006 puig et al 2004 during floods the fraction of sediments smaller than sand which is typically transported in suspension can originate turbidity currents that are considered the main responsible of reservoir sedimentation oehy and schleiss 2007 schleiss et al 2016 sediment particularly at the bed of large rivers and reservoirs act as a sink for anthropogenic contaminants pourabadehei and mulligan 2016 the mobilization of contaminated sediments which are settled in the bed of lakes and reservoirs by gravity currents may promote the reintroduction of pollutants in the environment consequently the importance of understanding the development transport and deposition of contaminated sediment is important as well due to its ecological significance the equilibrium of bed sediment depends on gravitational forces and interlocking between the bed particles as resisting actions and of forces which destabilize such as i bed shear ii impact momentum transfer and iii lift buoyancy vertical velocity gradient pressure and upward turbulence hickin 1995 bed shear is accepted as the most important of the impelling forces and since it is correlated with all the others involved forces provides a surrogate measure of them hickin 1995 in a highly turbulent flow as in the case of gravity currents the mean flow is often associated with velocity fluctuations that may play a critical role in dislodging grains from the bed the literature on gravity currents is rich however the hydrodynamics of density driven flows namely the internal flow structure are still not completely understood the coupling of hydrodynamics mechanisms and processed of erosion transport and deposition of sediment have been so far little investigated peng and zhixian 2009 formulated a fully coupled model for the description of turbidity currents in presence of an erodible bed claiming that a major source of uncertainty is still the enhanced understanding of the mechanism and quantification of bed sediment entrainment conley et al 2008 examine how the inclusion of two way feedback between suspended sediment and the fluid flow which leads to its suspension affects the results of simulations of sediment suspension and discuss the effects of sediment stratification on the turbulent properties of the flow most of the gravity currents happen on complex topographies and over varied bed compositions and the erosion transport and depositional processes depend on the particle characteristics and on the flow hydrodynamics it is hypothesized based on previous knowledge that the processes of sediment erosion transport and deposition are governed by such hydrodynamics variable as bed shear stress reynolds shear stresses and the vertical component of the flow velocity mean and fluctuating field to which extent are these hydrodynamic quantities of gravity currents correlated with the sediment dynamics is however unknown and the main objective of this paper furthermore the current hydrodynamics is determined by the triggering initial buoyancy of the current and the resistance of the sediment is determined by its weight i e density and size feedback given by the incorporation of sediment from the bed in the hydrodynamics of a gravity current is expected and another objective of the present paper 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up and procedure gravity currents are performed in a set up specifically designed to reproduce lock exchange flows the rectangular flume is 7 5 m long and 0 275 m wide and it is divided into two sections of comparable volumes by a vertically sliding gate fig 1 the bed is horizontal and smooth it presented a 1 cm depth depression with a flat bed where the erodible material is placed 2 5 m downstream the gate this erodible reach has the same width of the channel and a longitudinal extent of 0 6 m an upstream reach of the channel the lock serves as head tank for the dense mixture and it is filled with salty water the downstream reach is filled with fresh water reaching the same height as the previous one and it is here where the current propagated and where the main measurements are made when the gate is suddenly removed through a system of pulleys reproducing a full depth release differences in the hydrostatic pressure cause the denser fluid to flow downstream near the bed of the channel while the lighter fluid flows in the opposite direction at the top shin et al 2004 it travels downstream passing above the erodible bed the current erodes and the sediments entrained are then deposit downstream a schematic representation of the installation is in fig 1 the current is finally dissipated flowing down into a final large tank that is conceived to avoid the reflexion of the current at the final section the final tank is 4 m long 1 8 m wide 1 5 m height and the channel where the current is performed is connected to it 1 m above the floor in order to let the current plunging into the reservoir polyurethane artificial fine sediments are used in all the experiments and three characteristic grain sizes are tested see section 2 2 several instruments are used an acoustic doppler velocity profiler advp video analysis laser collecting topography and pictures of deposition patterns three initial densities obtained by adding sodium chloride in the lock are tested combined with three sizes of sediment composing the erodible bed the two parts of the channel separated by the gate have the same water depth h 0 0 2 m and they are initially at rest the parameters of the performed tests are summarized in table 1 the main parameters are presented in the non dimensional form by adopting the following dimensionally independent scales a reference velocity scale defined as 1 u b g h b where hb is the vertical length scale here considered as one third of the total water depth h 0 of 0 2 m h b h 0 3 and a time scale defined as 2 t h b u b the length scale h b h 0 3 is chosen since preliminary tests have revealed that the height of the body of the current is on average one third of the total water column 2 2 sediments the material composing the erodible bed is chosen to fulfil the following requisites 1 non cohesiveness 2 settling velocity corresponding to particle hydrodynamics find in natural systems field scale gravity currents generally have velocities in the range of 1 10 m s kneller and buckee 2000 whereas laboratory flows have velocities which are two order of magnitude smaller than in the field the settling velocity thus should be reduced in the model by a factor of 10 100 for instance to model a sand with a settling velocity of 5 cm s a silt should be used middleton 1993 however such fine sediments may exhibit cohesion due to the grain size to overcome this problem many authors used sediment of reduced density and greater size to keep the scale between the settling velocity of prototype and model in fact as the gravity effects are important in these type of flows dynamic similarity is maintained by preserving the froude number imran et al 2017 reynolds number often results relaxed but the effects of viscosity are still negligible if we keep a fully turbulent flow therefore considering the water viscosity is the same the ratio between model and prototype reynolds number rep rem is of the order of o 3 the field scale fall velocity v s p can be computed using for instance stokes s free fall velocity of the particles as in hallworth and huppert 1998 and thus the velocity scale ratio λv is given as imran et al 2017 3 λ v s v s p v s m ρ s p ρ d p 2 18 ν ρ s m ρ d m 2 18 ν ρ s p ρ d p 2 ρ s m ρ d m 2 by knowing the particles diameter and density of both prototype and model in order to maintain a velocity scale ratio of about 10 between prototype and model and to avoid too fine sediment a reduced density for sediments used in the model is required therefore the material chosen is a high performance thermoplastic polyurethane tpu with a density of 1160 kg m3 same material as described in chamoun et al 2016 three different grain sizes are used and the d 50 and d 90 are shown in table 1 the distribution width of the three granulometric curves d 90 d 10 d 50 is checked and it is for all the grain sizes used 1 4 indicating a narrow particle size distribution 2 3 instrumentation the 3d acoustic doppler velocity profiler advp franca and lemmin 2006 hurther and lemmin 2001 lemmin and rolland 1997 is a non intrusive sonar instrument that measures the instantaneous velocity profiles using the doppler effect without the need of calibration the instrument consists of a central emitter surrounded by four receivers the geometric configuration is the result of an optimization of the instrument that allows noise reduction by creating redundancy information for the velocity components by using four receivers blanckaert and lemmin 2006 additionally the signal despiking procedure proposed by goring and nikora 2002 also results in a considerable reduction of the noise level it is placed 2 5 m downstream from the gate fig 1 and it measures in time along a vertical profile that is divided in 44 volumes called gates that are consecutively scattered by the sound waves hurther and lemmin 2000 the passage of the density current over the erodible bed is recorded laterally by a smx 160 camera the acquisition frequency is 25 hz and the area of interest with dimensions of 0 245 x 0 18 m2 as indicated in fig 2 has a spatial resolution of 0 5 mm px this resolution is bigger than the size of the sediments but accurate enough for distinguishing the interfaces suspended sediments gravity current and gravity current ambient water the captured frames are converted into gray scale matrices 256 gray levels for their subsequent data treatment two halogen spots of 1000 w are placed at the opposite side of the camera between the spots and the transparent wall of the channel a filter screen is inserted for achieving an homogeneous illuminated area this system provided back lighting which allows to distinguish easily the movement of the current and decreased the required exposure time preventing blurred images caused by vibrations of the system in the collection of images taken during the experiments four characteristic flow regions are identified by fixing a threshold in the value of the pixels i a layer of clear water ii a density current layer with the brine iii a mixture layer with brine and few sediments and iv a dense layer of sediments as shown in fig 2 where the original and the post processed images are shown a baumer oadm13 laser is used to measure the topography of the mobile bed reach and of the downstream channel bed before and after the passage of the current it is a photoelectric distance measuring compact sensor composed of a laser emitter that produces a light source and a photodiode line working as receiver the measuring range of this pulsed red laser diode is of 50 350 mm and it has an accuracy of 0 01 0 4 mm chamoun et al 2016 eight equidistant longitudinal sections are surveyed on the mobile bed reach whereas the downstream area of deposition is surveyed with eight equidistant cross sections as shown in fig 3 for the downstream traced area as reference point the end edge of the mobile bed has been considered and the covered surface goes from 100 mm after the mobile bed for a length of 400 mm the deposition patterns are captured through pictures taken with a reflex camera nikon d60 from the top of the channel at the end of the test covering a surface of 0 4 m of length starting at 0 1 m downstream the mobile bed the interrogation area recorded by the camera is coincident with the area surveyed by the pulsed red laser see fig 3 2 4 post processing of velocity data by means of the analysis of the power spectra of the raw data collected with the advp noisy frequencies are mainly detected below 8 hz the instantaneous measurements are thus low pass filtered with 8 hz as cut off frequency the time series of the mean velocities u w respectively for streamwise and vertical directions for the unsteady gravity current are derived after a filtering procedure that consisted in the application of a moving average over a time window which is chosen by an analysis of the power spectra distribution as in baas et al 2005 this analysis shows that for a time window of 0 32 s the harmonics of all the meaningful frequencies are still recognisable while increasing the time window the harmonics of progressively smaller frequency gradually lose power and they become impossible to distinguish from the white noise baas et al 2005 this is the window length that is chosen for the moving average defining u and w the turbulent fluctuations u w are then calculated using the reynolds decomposition 4 u u u w w w where u and w are the instantaneous velocity streamwise and vertical the scales of turbulence velocity are defined as the root mean square rms of the streamwise and of the vertical fluctuating components second order moment of the velocity distribution as defined by kneller et al 1997 5 u r m s 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 0 5 1 n i 1 n u i 2 0 5 6 w r

consequently different roles in sediment entrainment and transport in order to distinguish their contributions in sediment mobilization the head is identified through the definition of a kinematic function q given by the product between the instantaneous depth averaged streamwise velocity ud t which is averaged over the current thickness and the current height h t the downstream limit of the head is identified by the first meaningful local minimum of the function q starting from the front in nogueira et al 2014 a similar procedure is adopted and the head is identified considering the product of the depth by the depth averaged density of the current q is thus defined as 7 q t u d t h t with the depth averaged streamwise velocity ud computed as 8 u d t 1 h 0 h u z t d z and h identified with the contour of the current which correspond to the position where the streamwise velocity is equal to zero the function q corresponds to a flow rate per unit width it is possible to observe that the quantity q shows in average higher values for tests performed with increasing initial density the algorithm used herein to detect the limit of the head evaluates how much the trough of q detaches from the others maxima values this method is coherent for all the nine experiments performed and the value of the q function is shown in fig 4 the square symbols identify the first meaningful local minimum of q and the vertical lines show the mean extent of the head amplitude in time lh considering the tests grouped by same initial density in the lock 3 1 2 mean flow the advp instrumentation is here used to record instantaneous velocities of gravity currents time series of mean streamwise velocity profiles are shown in fig 5 where the contour of the currents is marked with the black line the maximum velocity in the head region is observed at one third of the current height as it was also observed in literature for smooth bed kneller and buckee 2000 in fig 5 we observe that the head is a well defined region and it is characterized by a core of high streamwise velocity the extent of the head is bounded by a minimum of the current contour a billow extends on the upper part of the head at the interface with the ambient water in a zone of high mixing the extent of the body is limited and it fades into a final zone the tail of the current in which a weak streamwise velocity persists near the lower boundary as expected increasing the initial gravity current density results in larger streamwise velocities the normalized time series of streamwise and vertical depth averaged velocity wd computed in the same way as ud eq 8 are shown in fig 6 a normalization is made by dividing wd by the reference velocity scale ub in the figure the grey lines are the instantaneous depth averaged velocities per each test performed for fine medium and coarse material in orange the instantaneous depth averaged velocities averaged among tests grouped by same initial density are shown tests r1 and r2 generally group well and they show a similar evolution the results from tests r3 with the highest density show a higher variability that may be the consequence of the higher reynolds which characterizes these flows depth averaged streamwise velocities show a peak in the head region whose extent lh has been previously determined and shown in fig 4 in fig 6 lh is again displayed by the dashed vertical black line also a first local minimum of depth averaged velocity is visible indicating a zone behind the head where the streamwise velocity is particularly low the body is characterized by a plateau observed immediately after the head followed by the tail with a decrease in the streamwise depth averaged velocity tests r3 are more disperse higher initial density causes a higher acceleration of the fluid composing the body which tends to accumulate toward the front and therefore the extent of the quasi steady body is reduced a quasi steady behavior of the body region is verified by analysis of the cumulative sum of ud not shown here the data follow a linear trend followed by a non linear phase at approximately t t 40 when the velocity decays the arrival of the head causes an upward surge of the ambient fluid which is visible in the vertical velocity signal thereafter smaller amplitude oscillations are observed the temporal series of normalized mean streamwise and vertical velocities corresponding to test r2 medium are shown in fig 7 in order to give evidence of the vertical velocity structure five vertical positions are here considered between z 4 and 106 mm at z 106 mm streamwise velocity is negative given that at this position the counter current is dominant vertical velocity is higher at the front fluid in this region moves mainly upward as observed before in fig 6 at z 72 mm streamwise and vertical velocities oscillated between negative to positive values this is roughly the interface between the gravity current and the ambient fluid where most of the mixing processes take place and the exchange between current and ambient fluid is maximum the highest streamwise velocities are found near the channel bed at z 20 and 4 mm streamwise velocity is at these levels positive corresponding to the advancement of the gravity current records at z 4 mm are the closest to the bottom velocity measurements that the advp measures which are most probably at the limit of the bottom boundary layer during the first instants of the experiments at z 20 mm and z 44 mm it is observed how the ambient fluid flows backward over the head of the current the current while travelling displaces ambient fluid upward at the front and so in fig 7 the first instants show a peak in positive vertical velocity then vertical velocity becomes negative and further in the body coherent peaks along the whole vertical of the current are presented these vertical oscillations are linked to flow coherent mean motion along the vertical of the flow which may enhance vertical mixing the presence of negative vertical velocities is also observed but alternatively the two movements up and downwards result in a well defined periodic sequence of events which are consistent along the whole vertical of the current 3 1 3 turbulent quantities and bed shear stress turbulent velocity scales have been calculated as the root mean square of the fluctuating component of the velocities with respect to the mean velocity as explained in section 2 4 in fig 8 the temporal evolution of u u r m s and w r m s are shown for test r1 fine at z 16 mm in the vicinity of the bed shaded areas highlight the troughs of mean stremwise velocity which correspond to peaks in rms quantities periods of high turbulence which correspond to events with clear enhancement of both streamwise and vertical fluctuations correlate with relative slow downstream velocities that is a typical feature of the ejections one of the phases in the so called burst cycle baas et al 2005 bed shear stress can be calculated from instantaneous profiles of velocity through numerous techniques bagherimiyab and lemmin 2013 here bed shear stress have been computed following two methods 1 applying the logarithmic law to the mean streamwise velocity distribution and 2 using the reynolds shear stress measured close to the bed the passage of the density current does not correspond to a steady process however it is possible to identify time intervals where the flow properties remain quasi invariant and consider a zone averaged flow franca and brocchini 2015 for a smooth boundary the flow column can be considered as composed by two overlapping regions the inner and the outer layers dey 2014 among many others under the assumptions of flow gradually varied in the longitudinal direction essentially two dimensional in the vertical plane and with high relative submersion the streamwise velocity in the overlapping layer can be fitted to the logarithmic law of the wall ferreira et al 2012 a friction velocity can so be calculated and from this the bed shear stress by mean of the von kármán prandtl law of the wall 9 u z u 1 k ln z z 0 where u z is generally averaged over a sufficiently long time scale u is the friction velocity which is the velocity scale corresponding to the bed shear stress chassaing 2010 k is the von kármán constant z is the vertical coordinate and z 0 is the zero velocity level here the flow boundary is assumed to be smooth and the classic value of the von kármán constant of k 0 405 is adopted discussions on the estimation of k can be found in ferreira 2015 the assumptions of smooth conditions have been verified after the estimation of the friction velocity the shear reynolds number or skin roughness ks normalized by the viscous layer is checked to be lesser than 5 ksu ν 5 as more extensively discussed in zordan et al 2016 the total bed shear stress related with the friction velocity u is written as 10 τ b ρ c u 2 being ρc the density of the current at a point close to the bed here taken as the initial density of the gravity currents ρ 0 the friction velocity u is calculated from the logarithmic law of the wall with the following procedure i the equation of the law of the wall is rewritten as 11 u z a ln z b where the two coefficients a and b are 12 a u k b u k ln z 0 ii the coefficients a and b are determined through a fitting procedure to obtain an estimation of u the identification and fitting procedure for the logarithmic layer is determined stepwise extending a linear least square fitting range in a semi logarithmic scale from the lowest measured point until the vertical position corresponding to the maximum velocity the layer providing the best regression coefficient is chosen and considered for the estimation of u corresponding to the extent of the logarithmic layer thus an estimation of the bed shear stress is made for each measuring instant in a fully turbulent flow the total bed shear stress can also be obtained through the measured reynolds shear stresses as 13 τ b μ u z w x ρ u w z z 0 where the term w x can be neglected cossu and wells 2012 and u z and reynolds stresses ρ u w are estimated using the velocity measurements at the recorded gate the closest to the bed in fig 9 the time evolution of bed shear stresses calculated by fit of the log law τlog and from the definition τdef as computed in eq 13 are shown test r1 fine the two signals are related and of the same order of magnitude in particular the peaks of bed shear stress are well depicted by both methods subsequently a new quantity that counts for the geomorphological changes induced by bed shear stress is computed with the values estimated through the log law method which has a less noisy signal 3 2 sediment dynamics 3 2 1 sediment entrainment video analysis allows to track the cloud of entrained sediment from the mobile bed fig 2 in each video frame acquired the number of pixels occupied by the sediment where counted surface under the green line in fig 2 and converted into a surface by knowing that the spatial resolution is of 0 5 mm px the same is done to compute the area occupied by the current surface under the red line in fig 2 and so the temporal evolution of the areas are determined in fig 10 the temporal evolution of the area of the image occupied by the current orange and the area occupied by the sediments black for the first ten seconds where the main sediment mobilization is observed are shown as expected it is observed that for the currents with lower density flowing over coarser grains the particles tend to settle down faster which means that the area of sediments drops to zero in a shorter time frame on the other hand the tests with a larger initial density and with finer material correspond to larger areas occupied by the sediments where the sediment is kept in suspension longer reaching higher levels within the current body finer sediment and larger initial densities in the lock imply that particles are faster brought into suspension and taken up far away from the bed as it is shown by the faster increment of the area of sediments curve fig 10 that is growing from r1 to r3 and decreases from fine to coarse 3 2 2 morphology changes the average among the eight profiles collected minimum and maximum longitudinal bed elevations in the mobile bed reach measured after the passage of the gravity current as described in section 2 3 are shown in fig 11 test r3 fine shows the greatest erosion and this is coherent since it is the test with the finest grain and the largest excess of density this tendency is also confirmed by the measurements of the are of the cloud of sediment made with the video analysis section 3 2 1 the 1 cm deep erodible reach was never completely uncovered since the maximum measured erosion was of 0 8 cm the eroded volume of sediment is calculated by integrating the difference among the topography recorded before and after the erosion process caused by the passage of the current each difference in height z b e d b e f o r e x z b e d a f t e r x is integrated along the mobile bed which total length is l 0 6 m and then multiplied by the respective area of influence a i a t o t n 1 with atot 0 275 x 0 6 m2 as the total surface of the mobile bed and n 8 the number of longitudinal sections surveyed 14 v e r o d e d i 1 n a i 0 l z b e d b e f o r e x z b e d a f t e r x d x in table 2 the values of the calculated eroded volumes are reported grouped by the sediment size and by the initial density in the lock a visual representation id also given in fig 12 where it is possible to observe that with fine sediment the initial density is the main forcing of the erosion process while for coarser material results indicate a lesser influence of the initial density hence that the size seems to govern the overall erosion process as expected the eroded volumes of sediment decrease with the sediment size and increase with the initial density of fluid in the lock similarly to fig 11 the average minimum and maximum longitudinal bed elevation are shown in fig 13 for the surveyed downstream area of deposition it can be noticed the higher deposition that occur in the vicinity of the erodible reach further downstream the thickness of the deposited sediments layer decreases tests with lower initial density show the maximum height of deposition but no clear tendencies with respect to the grain size is detectable gravity currents with higher buoyancy have higher velocities and turbulence production which can keep in suspension material for longer distances in these cases the deposition rate is lower and the sediments are transported further downstream outside the present area of investigation in fig 3 left side an example of processed image of the deposition area taken with the camera is shown the material deposited follows a typical pattern longitudinal streaks are observed as already pointed out by some previous studies colombini and parker 1995 grass 1971 these authors explained the presence of longitudinal streaks as the consequence of turbulent movements of the fluid light ambient fluid trapped at the bed by the overrun front of the current moves upward into the gravity current this processes was also confirmed by eames et al 2001 who studied gravity currents experimentally and ooi et al 2009 numerically the movement of fluid creates streamwise oriented vortices aligned with the primary flow that may be responsible for the imprinting of elongated streaks of deposited sediment cantero et al 2008 weill et al 1985 the development of a these so called horseshoe vortex showing the lifts stretches ejection and sweep associated with velocity profiles is well depicted in a schematic representation of the typical sequence of turbulent bursting phenomena by allen 1985 recently modified by salim et al 2017 the same surface covered by the pictures has also been surveyed with the laser collecting eight cross sections as shown in fig 3 a representative cross section c4 0 27 m downstream the mobile bed have been analysed and reported for all the tests in fig 14 for this cross section the maximum amplitude of deposition δzmax and the average thickness of the streaks δyave at the point marked with the horizontal orange strokes are measured the information in fig 14 suggests that generally the number of streaks decreases with increasing initial density and with coarser material and that the thickness of the streaks δyave is greater for higher initial density and it increases with coarser material instead no clear tendencies are detected for the maximum amplitudes of deposition δzmax since gravity currents of higher initial densities are characterized by a stronger near bed vorticity as it was observed in zordan et al 2018 then we can hypothesize that the presence of more energetic recirculation cells of the sweep phase see section 3 1 3 has an influence on the geometry of the patterns here greater initial excess density produces less streaks which are thicker 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms governing sediment entrainment and distal transport the relationship between sediment entrainment and bed shear stress is widely acknowledge in literature garcía and parker 1993 hirano et al 1985 parker et al 1986 sequeiros et al 2010a when bed shear stress caused by the gravity current passing over the mobile bed reach exceeds a critical threshold of particles motion erosion may occur but bed shear stress is not the only force acting at the bed boundary of a gravity current and being this flow highly turbulent other forces play a role on sediments entrainment in particular vertical velocity is expected to enhance vertical mixing and its contribution in the incipient motion of sediments is here addressed the normalised bed shear stress τ b calculated from log law as in section 3 1 3 1 the depth averaged over the gravity currents depth vertical mean velocity w d 2 the corresponding depth averaged fluctuation w d 3 and the depth averaged reynolds stresses u w d 4 are subsequently compared to the area of sediments entrained all these quantities are plotted together in fig 15 with the same time reference here the normalized bed shear stress shields 1936b parameter is used 15 τ b τ b ρ s ρ 0 g d 50 the tests performed in this work fall in the suspended load transport area of the shields diagram for density and turbidity currents provided in sequeiros et al 2010b before sediment entrainment begins a peak in mean vertical depth averaged velocity is observed alternatively positive and negative oscillations follow w d has the same evolution and contributes in intensifying the fluctuating behaviour of vertical flow movements inside the current a drop in vertical velocity is detected corresponding to the initiation of sediment entrainment normalised bed shear stress has also a minimum during the period in which sediments entrainment is important that is during the passage of the head of the current delimited with the vertical dashed line in fig 15 when the area of sediment entrained drops i e in the body of the current where there are almost no sediments in suspension important values of normalized bed shear stress τ b are detected to understand and to quantify how related are the four time varying hydrodynamic quantities in fig 15 with entrainment and transport of suspended sediment the cross correlation between the time varying area of entrainment displayed in fig 10 and these is calculated and presented in fig 16 together with the 95 confidence interval fig 16 shows that the mean and fluctuating components of the depth averaged vertical velocity are highly correlated with the entrained area in the first instants of the passage of the current conversely the normalised bed shear stress and depth averaged reynolds shear stresses correlate with the entrainment area for a longer period mean and fluctuating component of depth averaged vertical velocity are then indicated as major factors for sediments lifting being their correlation with the area of sediment at the maximum at the moment when sediment entrainment initiates the high correlation of the cloud of suspended sediments and bed shear stress in particular to the quantity u w d indicates the importance of the latter in the distal transport of sediment once the sediment becomes mobile because it is dislocated from the bed bed shear stress excess causes its downstream movement 4 2 dynamics of sediment transport and deposition gravity currents are turbulent flows which experience the presence of near wall turbulent coherent structures grass 1971 kneller et al 1999 as those are common features of boundary layer turbulence defina 1996 turbulent bursting events characterize these type of flows which consist in the movement of low speed fluid ejected away from the wall salim et al 2017 streamwise oriented vortexes called horseshoe vortexes salim et al 2017 aligned with the primary flow are formed and they are responsible for the imprinting of elongated streaks of deposited sediment many studies have been conducted on the streaky structure in the wall region of many types of turbulent boundary layer flows defina 1996 grass 1971 and allen 1985 among others the signature of these patterns in the deposition have been observed in the present tests see section 3 2 2 fig 3 left side shows the formation of elongated accumulation of sediments bands on the streamwise direction for test r1 fine since the only forces acting on the sediment originate in the flowing fluid the fact that they are arranged in streamwise oriented bands can only be due to a transverse component of fluid force allen 1985 the fluid motion of the gravity current has been thoroughly analysed and fig 8 provides evidence of the simultaneous presence of mean streamwise velocity troughs with peaks of rms velocities periods of high turbulence that correlate with slow mean streamwise velocity are typical for coherent flow turbulent structures such as ejections baas et al 2005 in the ejection phase low speed fluid is ejected upward and simultaneously a local and adjacent convection streamwise recirculation cell will quickly form the formation of longitudinal streaks in the bed is the result of the convergence of downwelling flow associated with these flow streamwise cells the size and shape of streaks are flow dependent and the average streak spanwise spacing is confirmed to be influenced by the initial density fig 14 kaftori et al 1995 shows that with an increment in the bottom shear stress for a given fluid particle combination more particles are entrained and the streaks begin to shrink in size this tendency is continuing until a point in which there are no enough particles at the wall and the streaks disappear here we found that gravity currents generate by higher excess densities produce more spaced streaks this can therefore be linked to the presence of more energetic counter rotating streamwise vortices ninto and garcia 1996 for what concern the influence of the grain size previous literature reports that particle sorting along low speed streaks occurs only if the particles are of sizes about equal or smaller than the thickness of the viscous sublayer kaftori et al 1995 moreover larger particles have more inertia than smaller ones and therefore they are less responsive to flow velocity fluctuations as it was already pointed out by ninto and garcia 1996 here the influence of the grain size of sediments composing the erodible reach is translated in a tendency to have an increment in the spacing between streaks and thicker streaks in presence of coarser grain size coarser particles settle more easily than fine particles due to its larger weight and they form sedimentary streaks of larger thickness this indicates that a feedback exists between the turbulence caused coherent motion which is at the origin of the flow streaks and the mobile bed which conditions the spacing scale of these 4 3 quantitative analysis of sediment erosion in order to characterize the relation between sediment entrainment and bed shear stress caused by the passage of a gravity current new quantities are defined the non dimensional time integral of the bed shear stress which by dimensional analysis is an impulse per unit surface is given by 16 φ 0 t τ b t d t t where the limit t defines the end of sediment entrainment obtained from the analysis of the area of sediment entrained in figs 10 and 15 a specific dimensionless eroded volume is defined as 17 v e r o d e d v e r o d e d d 50 a t o t being veroded the volume of eroded sediment and atot the total surface of the mobile bed as in section 3 2 2 in fig 17 a the quantities calculated per test are represented one against the other and they show a coherent tendency an increase in φ is related to an increase in the erosion in particular fig 17a shows an that the dimensionless eroded volume increases exponentially with the time integral of the normalised bed shear stress the relationship between the eroded volume and a variable which takes into considerations the initial density of the gravity current surrogate of the erosion force and the grain size surrogate of the resistance to erosion is shown in fig 17b eroded volumes decrease with increasing d 50 ρ a δ ρ 1 h b 1 adimensional parameter which counts for the grain size and excess buoyancy confirming that in case of low initial density and with coarser sediments the material on the erodible reach is less mobile and consequently the erosion is weaker particle reynolds number which takes into account both the sediment representative diameter and the density by mean of the reduced gravity have been computed as garcía and parker 1993 18 r e p g d 50 d 50 ν fig 18 a shows the linear relationship between the quantity φ and rep as particle reynolds number decreases the impulse per unit surface produced by the gravity current on the sediment composing the mobile bed is larger this is the same behaviour as indicated by the well known shields diagram shields 1936a shields curve for low particle reynolds numbers left hand side of the plot is the threshold of motion which becomes higher in presence of finer material in fig 18b the dependence of the dimensionless specific eroded volume veroded to the particle reynolds number rep is shown there is a clear decreasing tendency similar to a hyperbola of the volume eroded with the rep particles characterized by a lower rep exhibit an easiness to be entrained and consequently the measured eroded volume is greater 4 4 effect of sediment entrainment on the gravity current as hypothesized earlier the hydrodynamics of the current is influenced by the incorporation of the sediment present at the bed and this interaction is conditioned with the sediment diameter changes on the geometry of the front which are related with the flow resistence are observed in the time evolution of the area of the current as reported in fig 10 from fig 10 two quantities have been calculated θ the angle formed by the line representing the evolution of the current in gray with the horizontal by means of merely geometrical considerations using the lines as presented in fig 10 and hc calculated as the average area of the portion of the image occupied by the current divided by the horizontal dimension of the frame captured with the high speed camera these two have been compared to d 50 ρ a δ ρ 1 h b 1 fig 19 fig 19 shows that the current height hc increases at a higher rate θ in presence of finer sediments this is an evidence of how the incorporation of sediment changes the hydrodynamics of the current the tests where larger quantity of sediment is incorporated cf fig 10 are the ones where the angle theta is higher the results suggest that the incorporation of sediment within the current induces internal energy losses which induce the higher velocity of increase of hc however the influence of the incorporation of sediment in the current geometry is not so evident when regarding the current depth in fact only for the case of the lower initial densities in the lock the incorporation seems to produce an effect 5 conclusions erosion transport and deposition of fine sediment caused by the passage of a saline gravity current have been experimentally investigated for this purpose the cross analysis of data from several measuring techniques is performed instantaneous velocity profiles measured with an acoustic doppler velocity profiler video analysis laser based topography and pictures of deposition patterns compose the available data set the tests carried out with a lock exchange channel with high volume of release flowing over a mobile bed reach included three initial densities of the fluid on the lock and three different sediment sizes composing the mobile bed reach mean flow and fluctuating quantities are estimated and discussed taking into account the different triggering densities in the lock different size classes of suspended sediment react differently to the changes in flow dynamics determined by the initial density in the lock among the computed hydrodynamic quantities such as turbulent and mean upward velocity bed shear stress and turbulent stresses we show that bed shear stress and reynolds stresses are correlated with sediment entrainment for longer periods such that it can be inferred that they are associated to the distal transport of sediment the main responsible for sediment dislodging is found to be the vertical component of the fluid movement which presents a high peak of vertical mean velocity at the front of the currents upward motion characterized by the mean vertical velocity and aided by the vertical component of turbulence promotes vertical mixing of the sediment from the channel bed whereas in the periods between these flow structures the particles have sufficient settling velocities to deposit with the coarser particles depositing sooner than finer ones our combined analysis of the hydrodynamics and the geomorphological imprint of the passage of the gravity current on the mobile bed show a clear relationship between erosion and current shape furthermore our results indicate that the deposition downstream the mobile bed presents the signature of counter rotating vortices aligned with the primary flow in the streamwise direction therefore the presence of feedback mechanisms is assumed with the hydrodynamics of the current imprinting the streaks and entrainment of sediment modifying the current hydrodynamics thus resulting in different streaks geometries acknowledgments this

declare 
821,few studies have addressed simultaneously the feedback between the hydrodynamics of a gravity current and the geomorphological changes of a mobile bed hydrodynamic quantities such as turbulent and mean velocities bed shear stress and turbulent stresses undoubtedly govern the processes of entrainment transport and deposition on the other hand the incorporation of entrained sediment in the current may change its momentum by introducing extra internal stresses introducing thus a feedback process these two main questions are here investigated laboratory experiments of saline gravity currents produced by lock exchange flowing over a mobile bed channel reach are here reported different initial buoyancies of the current in the lock are tested together with three different grain sizes of the non coherent sediment that form the erodible bed results from velocity measurements are combined with the visualization of the sediment movement in the mobile reach and with post test topographic and photo surveys of the geomorphology modifications of the channel bed mean and turbulent velocities are measured and bed shear stress and reynolds stresses are estimated we show that the mean vertical component of the velocity and bed shear stress are highly correlated with the first instants of sediment entrainment vertical turbulent velocity is similarly related to entrainment although with lower correlation values contributing as well to the sediment movement bed shear stress and reynolds shear stress measured near the bed are correlated with sediment entrainment for longer periods indicating that these quantities are associated to distal transport as well geomorphological changes in the mobile bed are strongly related to the impulse caused by the bed shear stress on the sediment on the other hand we show that the nature of the grain of the mobile bed reach influences the hydrodynamics of the current which means that a feedback mechanisms between both occurs during the passage of the unsteady gravity current the signature of this geomorphological changes which is visible in the form of longitudinal steaks of accumulated sediment downstream the mobile bed is related to the flow initial buoyancy and to the size of the mobile bed sediment it is argued that the bed material and near bed turbulent coherent motion interact and mutually influence each other the geometry of the front of the gravity currents changes with the incorporation of the sediment indicating that with the presence of sediment extra energy losses occur in the front of the current keywords gravity currents sediment entrainment bed shear stress sediment deposition instantaneous velocity erosion capacity 1 introduction gravity or density currents are buoyancy driven flows that occur naturally or as a consequence of human activities simpson 1997 the density difference which causes the formation of a gravity current can be due to a property of the fluid e g temperature or salinity originating a compositional gravity current lombardi et al 2017 ooi et al 2009 ottolenghi et al 2017a ottolenghi et al 2017b ottolenghi et al 2018 or by the presence of particles in suspension as in the case of turbidity currents meiburg and kneller 2010 parker et al 1986 the occurrence of density driven flows in nature is well documented in literature and in few cases in situ measurements of these events were possible paull et al 2002 xu et al 2004 among others gravity currents are mainly a geophysical flow but they are also of importance in engineering application such as industrial flows lyn et al 1992 zhou et al 1994 and for environmental security al majed et al 2012 fernández torquemada et al 2009 huppert and woods 1995 natural gravity currents develop over a wide range of topography and they are frequently major and often catastrophic agents of sediment transport both on land and within the ocean kneller et al 1999 the importance of studying the dynamics of gravity currents and associated sediment transport mechanisms is a matter of natural hazard protection great topography changes and seafloor irregularities caused by the passage of gravity currents can be an obstacle for the installation of submarine facilities clare et al 2013 density flows are considered a reliable and high risk geohazard especially in case of direct impact causing the rupture of cables or dislocation of pipelines and flowlines clare et al 2013 major concerns are related to the potential impact on offshore installations and infrastructures located in the ocean and sea floors and to the ability of density flows to erode sediments from the bed over which they propagate leading to scour undermining underwater structures saline and turbidity currents occurring in submarine environment have been found at the origin of the formation of underwater canyons bharatdwaj 2006 referred that turbidity currents generated through earthquakes and volcano eruptions extremely rapid and powerful are capable of eroding hard rock forming trenches on the continental shelves along these excavated submarine canyons the sediment transfer mechanism is facilitated and large amount of sediment are transported for long distances by gravitational mass flows and by a variety of channeled currents that oscillate up and down canyon influenced by tidal flows kostic and parker 2006 puig et al 2004 during floods the fraction of sediments smaller than sand which is typically transported in suspension can originate turbidity currents that are considered the main responsible of reservoir sedimentation oehy and schleiss 2007 schleiss et al 2016 sediment particularly at the bed of large rivers and reservoirs act as a sink for anthropogenic contaminants pourabadehei and mulligan 2016 the mobilization of contaminated sediments which are settled in the bed of lakes and reservoirs by gravity currents may promote the reintroduction of pollutants in the environment consequently the importance of understanding the development transport and deposition of contaminated sediment is important as well due to its ecological significance the equilibrium of bed sediment depends on gravitational forces and interlocking between the bed particles as resisting actions and of forces which destabilize such as i bed shear ii impact momentum transfer and iii lift buoyancy vertical velocity gradient pressure and upward turbulence hickin 1995 bed shear is accepted as the most important of the impelling forces and since it is correlated with all the others involved forces provides a surrogate measure of them hickin 1995 in a highly turbulent flow as in the case of gravity currents the mean flow is often associated with velocity fluctuations that may play a critical role in dislodging grains from the bed the literature on gravity currents is rich however the hydrodynamics of density driven flows namely the internal flow structure are still not completely understood the coupling of hydrodynamics mechanisms and processed of erosion transport and deposition of sediment have been so far little investigated peng and zhixian 2009 formulated a fully coupled model for the description of turbidity currents in presence of an erodible bed claiming that a major source of uncertainty is still the enhanced understanding of the mechanism and quantification of bed sediment entrainment conley et al 2008 examine how the inclusion of two way feedback between suspended sediment and the fluid flow which leads to its suspension affects the results of simulations of sediment suspension and discuss the effects of sediment stratification on the turbulent properties of the flow most of the gravity currents happen on complex topographies and over varied bed compositions and the erosion transport and depositional processes depend on the particle characteristics and on the flow hydrodynamics it is hypothesized based on previous knowledge that the processes of sediment erosion transport and deposition are governed by such hydrodynamics variable as bed shear stress reynolds shear stresses and the vertical component of the flow velocity mean and fluctuating field to which extent are these hydrodynamic quantities of gravity currents correlated with the sediment dynamics is however unknown and the main objective of this paper furthermore the current hydrodynamics is determined by the triggering initial buoyancy of the current and the resistance of the sediment is determined by its weight i e density and size feedback given by the incorporation of sediment from the bed in the hydrodynamics of a gravity current is expected and another objective of the present paper 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up and procedure gravity currents are performed in a set up specifically designed to reproduce lock exchange flows the rectangular flume is 7 5 m long and 0 275 m wide and it is divided into two sections of comparable volumes by a vertically sliding gate fig 1 the bed is horizontal and smooth it presented a 1 cm depth depression with a flat bed where the erodible material is placed 2 5 m downstream the gate this erodible reach has the same width of the channel and a longitudinal extent of 0 6 m an upstream reach of the channel the lock serves as head tank for the dense mixture and it is filled with salty water the downstream reach is filled with fresh water reaching the same height as the previous one and it is here where the current propagated and where the main measurements are made when the gate is suddenly removed through a system of pulleys reproducing a full depth release differences in the hydrostatic pressure cause the denser fluid to flow downstream near the bed of the channel while the lighter fluid flows in the opposite direction at the top shin et al 2004 it travels downstream passing above the erodible bed the current erodes and the sediments entrained are then deposit downstream a schematic representation of the installation is in fig 1 the current is finally dissipated flowing down into a final large tank that is conceived to avoid the reflexion of the current at the final section the final tank is 4 m long 1 8 m wide 1 5 m height and the channel where the current is performed is connected to it 1 m above the floor in order to let the current plunging into the reservoir polyurethane artificial fine sediments are used in all the experiments and three characteristic grain sizes are tested see section 2 2 several instruments are used an acoustic doppler velocity profiler advp video analysis laser collecting topography and pictures of deposition patterns three initial densities obtained by adding sodium chloride in the lock are tested combined with three sizes of sediment composing the erodible bed the two parts of the channel separated by the gate have the same water depth h 0 0 2 m and they are initially at rest the parameters of the performed tests are summarized in table 1 the main parameters are presented in the non dimensional form by adopting the following dimensionally independent scales a reference velocity scale defined as 1 u b g h b where hb is the vertical length scale here considered as one third of the total water depth h 0 of 0 2 m h b h 0 3 and a time scale defined as 2 t h b u b the length scale h b h 0 3 is chosen since preliminary tests have revealed that the height of the body of the current is on average one third of the total water column 2 2 sediments the material composing the erodible bed is chosen to fulfil the following requisites 1 non cohesiveness 2 settling velocity corresponding to particle hydrodynamics find in natural systems field scale gravity currents generally have velocities in the range of 1 10 m s kneller and buckee 2000 whereas laboratory flows have velocities which are two order of magnitude smaller than in the field the settling velocity thus should be reduced in the model by a factor of 10 100 for instance to model a sand with a settling velocity of 5 cm s a silt should be used middleton 1993 however such fine sediments may exhibit cohesion due to the grain size to overcome this problem many authors used sediment of reduced density and greater size to keep the scale between the settling velocity of prototype and model in fact as the gravity effects are important in these type of flows dynamic similarity is maintained by preserving the froude number imran et al 2017 reynolds number often results relaxed but the effects of viscosity are still negligible if we keep a fully turbulent flow therefore considering the water viscosity is the same the ratio between model and prototype reynolds number rep rem is of the order of o 3 the field scale fall velocity v s p can be computed using for instance stokes s free fall velocity of the particles as in hallworth and huppert 1998 and thus the velocity scale ratio λv is given as imran et al 2017 3 λ v s v s p v s m ρ s p ρ d p 2 18 ν ρ s m ρ d m 2 18 ν ρ s p ρ d p 2 ρ s m ρ d m 2 by knowing the particles diameter and density of both prototype and model in order to maintain a velocity scale ratio of about 10 between prototype and model and to avoid too fine sediment a reduced density for sediments used in the model is required therefore the material chosen is a high performance thermoplastic polyurethane tpu with a density of 1160 kg m3 same material as described in chamoun et al 2016 three different grain sizes are used and the d 50 and d 90 are shown in table 1 the distribution width of the three granulometric curves d 90 d 10 d 50 is checked and it is for all the grain sizes used 1 4 indicating a narrow particle size distribution 2 3 instrumentation the 3d acoustic doppler velocity profiler advp franca and lemmin 2006 hurther and lemmin 2001 lemmin and rolland 1997 is a non intrusive sonar instrument that measures the instantaneous velocity profiles using the doppler effect without the need of calibration the instrument consists of a central emitter surrounded by four receivers the geometric configuration is the result of an optimization of the instrument that allows noise reduction by creating redundancy information for the velocity components by using four receivers blanckaert and lemmin 2006 additionally the signal despiking procedure proposed by goring and nikora 2002 also results in a considerable reduction of the noise level it is placed 2 5 m downstream from the gate fig 1 and it measures in time along a vertical profile that is divided in 44 volumes called gates that are consecutively scattered by the sound waves hurther and lemmin 2000 the passage of the density current over the erodible bed is recorded laterally by a smx 160 camera the acquisition frequency is 25 hz and the area of interest with dimensions of 0 245 x 0 18 m2 as indicated in fig 2 has a spatial resolution of 0 5 mm px this resolution is bigger than the size of the sediments but accurate enough for distinguishing the interfaces suspended sediments gravity current and gravity current ambient water the captured frames are converted into gray scale matrices 256 gray levels for their subsequent data treatment two halogen spots of 1000 w are placed at the opposite side of the camera between the spots and the transparent wall of the channel a filter screen is inserted for achieving an homogeneous illuminated area this system provided back lighting which allows to distinguish easily the movement of the current and decreased the required exposure time preventing blurred images caused by vibrations of the system in the collection of images taken during the experiments four characteristic flow regions are identified by fixing a threshold in the value of the pixels i a layer of clear water ii a density current layer with the brine iii a mixture layer with brine and few sediments and iv a dense layer of sediments as shown in fig 2 where the original and the post processed images are shown a baumer oadm13 laser is used to measure the topography of the mobile bed reach and of the downstream channel bed before and after the passage of the current it is a photoelectric distance measuring compact sensor composed of a laser emitter that produces a light source and a photodiode line working as receiver the measuring range of this pulsed red laser diode is of 50 350 mm and it has an accuracy of 0 01 0 4 mm chamoun et al 2016 eight equidistant longitudinal sections are surveyed on the mobile bed reach whereas the downstream area of deposition is surveyed with eight equidistant cross sections as shown in fig 3 for the downstream traced area as reference point the end edge of the mobile bed has been considered and the covered surface goes from 100 mm after the mobile bed for a length of 400 mm the deposition patterns are captured through pictures taken with a reflex camera nikon d60 from the top of the channel at the end of the test covering a surface of 0 4 m of length starting at 0 1 m downstream the mobile bed the interrogation area recorded by the camera is coincident with the area surveyed by the pulsed red laser see fig 3 2 4 post processing of velocity data by means of the analysis of the power spectra of the raw data collected with the advp noisy frequencies are mainly detected below 8 hz the instantaneous measurements are thus low pass filtered with 8 hz as cut off frequency the time series of the mean velocities u w respectively for streamwise and vertical directions for the unsteady gravity current are derived after a filtering procedure that consisted in the application of a moving average over a time window which is chosen by an analysis of the power spectra distribution as in baas et al 2005 this analysis shows that for a time window of 0 32 s the harmonics of all the meaningful frequencies are still recognisable while increasing the time window the harmonics of progressively smaller frequency gradually lose power and they become impossible to distinguish from the white noise baas et al 2005 this is the window length that is chosen for the moving average defining u and w the turbulent fluctuations u w are then calculated using the reynolds decomposition 4 u u u w w w where u and w are the instantaneous velocity streamwise and vertical the scales of turbulence velocity are defined as the root mean square rms of the streamwise and of the vertical fluctuating components second order moment of the velocity distribution as defined by kneller et al 1997 5 u r m s 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 0 5 1 n i 1 n u i 2 0 5 6 w r

consequently different roles in sediment entrainment and transport in order to distinguish their contributions in sediment mobilization the head is identified through the definition of a kinematic function q given by the product between the instantaneous depth averaged streamwise velocity ud t which is averaged over the current thickness and the current height h t the downstream limit of the head is identified by the first meaningful local minimum of the function q starting from the front in nogueira et al 2014 a similar procedure is adopted and the head is identified considering the product of the depth by the depth averaged density of the current q is thus defined as 7 q t u d t h t with the depth averaged streamwise velocity ud computed as 8 u d t 1 h 0 h u z t d z and h identified with the contour of the current which correspond to the position where the streamwise velocity is equal to zero the function q corresponds to a flow rate per unit width it is possible to observe that the quantity q shows in average higher values for tests performed with increasing initial density the algorithm used herein to detect the limit of the head evaluates how much the trough of q detaches from the others maxima values this method is coherent for all the nine experiments performed and the value of the q function is shown in fig 4 the square symbols identify the first meaningful local minimum of q and the vertical lines show the mean extent of the head amplitude in time lh considering the tests grouped by same initial density in the lock 3 1 2 mean flow the advp instrumentation is here used to record instantaneous velocities of gravity currents time series of mean streamwise velocity profiles are shown in fig 5 where the contour of the currents is marked with the black line the maximum velocity in the head region is observed at one third of the current height as it was also observed in literature for smooth bed kneller and buckee 2000 in fig 5 we observe that the head is a well defined region and it is characterized by a core of high streamwise velocity the extent of the head is bounded by a minimum of the current contour a billow extends on the upper part of the head at the interface with the ambient water in a zone of high mixing the extent of the body is limited and it fades into a final zone the tail of the current in which a weak streamwise velocity persists near the lower boundary as expected increasing the initial gravity current density results in larger streamwise velocities the normalized time series of streamwise and vertical depth averaged velocity wd computed in the same way as ud eq 8 are shown in fig 6 a normalization is made by dividing wd by the reference velocity scale ub in the figure the grey lines are the instantaneous depth averaged velocities per each test performed for fine medium and coarse material in orange the instantaneous depth averaged velocities averaged among tests grouped by same initial density are shown tests r1 and r2 generally group well and they show a similar evolution the results from tests r3 with the highest density show a higher variability that may be the consequence of the higher reynolds which characterizes these flows depth averaged streamwise velocities show a peak in the head region whose extent lh has been previously determined and shown in fig 4 in fig 6 lh is again displayed by the dashed vertical black line also a first local minimum of depth averaged velocity is visible indicating a zone behind the head where the streamwise velocity is particularly low the body is characterized by a plateau observed immediately after the head followed by the tail with a decrease in the streamwise depth averaged velocity tests r3 are more disperse higher initial density causes a higher acceleration of the fluid composing the body which tends to accumulate toward the front and therefore the extent of the quasi steady body is reduced a quasi steady behavior of the body region is verified by analysis of the cumulative sum of ud not shown here the data follow a linear trend followed by a non linear phase at approximately t t 40 when the velocity decays the arrival of the head causes an upward surge of the ambient fluid which is visible in the vertical velocity signal thereafter smaller amplitude oscillations are observed the temporal series of normalized mean streamwise and vertical velocities corresponding to test r2 medium are shown in fig 7 in order to give evidence of the vertical velocity structure five vertical positions are here considered between z 4 and 106 mm at z 106 mm streamwise velocity is negative given that at this position the counter current is dominant vertical velocity is higher at the front fluid in this region moves mainly upward as observed before in fig 6 at z 72 mm streamwise and vertical velocities oscillated between negative to positive values this is roughly the interface between the gravity current and the ambient fluid where most of the mixing processes take place and the exchange between current and ambient fluid is maximum the highest streamwise velocities are found near the channel bed at z 20 and 4 mm streamwise velocity is at these levels positive corresponding to the advancement of the gravity current records at z 4 mm are the closest to the bottom velocity measurements that the advp measures which are most probably at the limit of the bottom boundary layer during the first instants of the experiments at z 20 mm and z 44 mm it is observed how the ambient fluid flows backward over the head of the current the current while travelling displaces ambient fluid upward at the front and so in fig 7 the first instants show a peak in positive vertical velocity then vertical velocity becomes negative and further in the body coherent peaks along the whole vertical of the current are presented these vertical oscillations are linked to flow coherent mean motion along the vertical of the flow which may enhance vertical mixing the presence of negative vertical velocities is also observed but alternatively the two movements up and downwards result in a well defined periodic sequence of events which are consistent along the whole vertical of the current 3 1 3 turbulent quantities and bed shear stress turbulent velocity scales have been calculated as the root mean square of the fluctuating component of the velocities with respect to the mean velocity as explained in section 2 4 in fig 8 the temporal evolution of u u r m s and w r m s are shown for test r1 fine at z 16 mm in the vicinity of the bed shaded areas highlight the troughs of mean stremwise velocity which correspond to peaks in rms quantities periods of high turbulence which correspond to events with clear enhancement of both streamwise and vertical fluctuations correlate with relative slow downstream velocities that is a typical feature of the ejections one of the phases in the so called burst cycle baas et al 2005 bed shear stress can be calculated from instantaneous profiles of velocity through numerous techniques bagherimiyab and lemmin 2013 here bed shear stress have been computed following two methods 1 applying the logarithmic law to the mean streamwise velocity distribution and 2 using the reynolds shear stress measured close to the bed the passage of the density current does not correspond to a steady process however it is possible to identify time intervals where the flow properties remain quasi invariant and consider a zone averaged flow franca and brocchini 2015 for a smooth boundary the flow column can be considered as composed by two overlapping regions the inner and the outer layers dey 2014 among many others under the assumptions of flow gradually varied in the longitudinal direction essentially two dimensional in the vertical plane and with high relative submersion the streamwise velocity in the overlapping layer can be fitted to the logarithmic law of the wall ferreira et al 2012 a friction velocity can so be calculated and from this the bed shear stress by mean of the von kármán prandtl law of the wall 9 u z u 1 k ln z z 0 where u z is generally averaged over a sufficiently long time scale u is the friction velocity which is the velocity scale corresponding to the bed shear stress chassaing 2010 k is the von kármán constant z is the vertical coordinate and z 0 is the zero velocity level here the flow boundary is assumed to be smooth and the classic value of the von kármán constant of k 0 405 is adopted discussions on the estimation of k can be found in ferreira 2015 the assumptions of smooth conditions have been verified after the estimation of the friction velocity the shear reynolds number or skin roughness ks normalized by the viscous layer is checked to be lesser than 5 ksu ν 5 as more extensively discussed in zordan et al 2016 the total bed shear stress related with the friction velocity u is written as 10 τ b ρ c u 2 being ρc the density of the current at a point close to the bed here taken as the initial density of the gravity currents ρ 0 the friction velocity u is calculated from the logarithmic law of the wall with the following procedure i the equation of the law of the wall is rewritten as 11 u z a ln z b where the two coefficients a and b are 12 a u k b u k ln z 0 ii the coefficients a and b are determined through a fitting procedure to obtain an estimation of u the identification and fitting procedure for the logarithmic layer is determined stepwise extending a linear least square fitting range in a semi logarithmic scale from the lowest measured point until the vertical position corresponding to the maximum velocity the layer providing the best regression coefficient is chosen and considered for the estimation of u corresponding to the extent of the logarithmic layer thus an estimation of the bed shear stress is made for each measuring instant in a fully turbulent flow the total bed shear stress can also be obtained through the measured reynolds shear stresses as 13 τ b μ u z w x ρ u w z z 0 where the term w x can be neglected cossu and wells 2012 and u z and reynolds stresses ρ u w are estimated using the velocity measurements at the recorded gate the closest to the bed in fig 9 the time evolution of bed shear stresses calculated by fit of the log law τlog and from the definition τdef as computed in eq 13 are shown test r1 fine the two signals are related and of the same order of magnitude in particular the peaks of bed shear stress are well depicted by both methods subsequently a new quantity that counts for the geomorphological changes induced by bed shear stress is computed with the values estimated through the log law method which has a less noisy signal 3 2 sediment dynamics 3 2 1 sediment entrainment video analysis allows to track the cloud of entrained sediment from the mobile bed fig 2 in each video frame acquired the number of pixels occupied by the sediment where counted surface under the green line in fig 2 and converted into a surface by knowing that the spatial resolution is of 0 5 mm px the same is done to compute the area occupied by the current surface under the red line in fig 2 and so the temporal evolution of the areas are determined in fig 10 the temporal evolution of the area of the image occupied by the current orange and the area occupied by the sediments black for the first ten seconds where the main sediment mobilization is observed are shown as expected it is observed that for the currents with lower density flowing over coarser grains the particles tend to settle down faster which means that the area of sediments drops to zero in a shorter time frame on the other hand the tests with a larger initial density and with finer material correspond to larger areas occupied by the sediments where the sediment is kept in suspension longer reaching higher levels within the current body finer sediment and larger initial densities in the lock imply that particles are faster brought into suspension and taken up far away from the bed as it is shown by the faster increment of the area of sediments curve fig 10 that is growing from r1 to r3 and decreases from fine to coarse 3 2 2 morphology changes the average among the eight profiles collected minimum and maximum longitudinal bed elevations in the mobile bed reach measured after the passage of the gravity current as described in section 2 3 are shown in fig 11 test r3 fine shows the greatest erosion and this is coherent since it is the test with the finest grain and the largest excess of density this tendency is also confirmed by the measurements of the are of the cloud of sediment made with the video analysis section 3 2 1 the 1 cm deep erodible reach was never completely uncovered since the maximum measured erosion was of 0 8 cm the eroded volume of sediment is calculated by integrating the difference among the topography recorded before and after the erosion process caused by the passage of the current each difference in height z b e d b e f o r e x z b e d a f t e r x is integrated along the mobile bed which total length is l 0 6 m and then multiplied by the respective area of influence a i a t o t n 1 with atot 0 275 x 0 6 m2 as the total surface of the mobile bed and n 8 the number of longitudinal sections surveyed 14 v e r o d e d i 1 n a i 0 l z b e d b e f o r e x z b e d a f t e r x d x in table 2 the values of the calculated eroded volumes are reported grouped by the sediment size and by the initial density in the lock a visual representation id also given in fig 12 where it is possible to observe that with fine sediment the initial density is the main forcing of the erosion process while for coarser material results indicate a lesser influence of the initial density hence that the size seems to govern the overall erosion process as expected the eroded volumes of sediment decrease with the sediment size and increase with the initial density of fluid in the lock similarly to fig 11 the average minimum and maximum longitudinal bed elevation are shown in fig 13 for the surveyed downstream area of deposition it can be noticed the higher deposition that occur in the vicinity of the erodible reach further downstream the thickness of the deposited sediments layer decreases tests with lower initial density show the maximum height of deposition but no clear tendencies with respect to the grain size is detectable gravity currents with higher buoyancy have higher velocities and turbulence production which can keep in suspension material for longer distances in these cases the deposition rate is lower and the sediments are transported further downstream outside the present area of investigation in fig 3 left side an example of processed image of the deposition area taken with the camera is shown the material deposited follows a typical pattern longitudinal streaks are observed as already pointed out by some previous studies colombini and parker 1995 grass 1971 these authors explained the presence of longitudinal streaks as the consequence of turbulent movements of the fluid light ambient fluid trapped at the bed by the overrun front of the current moves upward into the gravity current this processes was also confirmed by eames et al 2001 who studied gravity currents experimentally and ooi et al 2009 numerically the movement of fluid creates streamwise oriented vortices aligned with the primary flow that may be responsible for the imprinting of elongated streaks of deposited sediment cantero et al 2008 weill et al 1985 the development of a these so called horseshoe vortex showing the lifts stretches ejection and sweep associated with velocity profiles is well depicted in a schematic representation of the typical sequence of turbulent bursting phenomena by allen 1985 recently modified by salim et al 2017 the same surface covered by the pictures has also been surveyed with the laser collecting eight cross sections as shown in fig 3 a representative cross section c4 0 27 m downstream the mobile bed have been analysed and reported for all the tests in fig 14 for this cross section the maximum amplitude of deposition δzmax and the average thickness of the streaks δyave at the point marked with the horizontal orange strokes are measured the information in fig 14 suggests that generally the number of streaks decreases with increasing initial density and with coarser material and that the thickness of the streaks δyave is greater for higher initial density and it increases with coarser material instead no clear tendencies are detected for the maximum amplitudes of deposition δzmax since gravity currents of higher initial densities are characterized by a stronger near bed vorticity as it was observed in zordan et al 2018 then we can hypothesize that the presence of more energetic recirculation cells of the sweep phase see section 3 1 3 has an influence on the geometry of the patterns here greater initial excess density produces less streaks which are thicker 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms governing sediment entrainment and distal transport the relationship between sediment entrainment and bed shear stress is widely acknowledge in literature garcía and parker 1993 hirano et al 1985 parker et al 1986 sequeiros et al 2010a when bed shear stress caused by the gravity current passing over the mobile bed reach exceeds a critical threshold of particles motion erosion may occur but bed shear stress is not the only force acting at the bed boundary of a gravity current and being this flow highly turbulent other forces play a role on sediments entrainment in particular vertical velocity is expected to enhance vertical mixing and its contribution in the incipient motion of sediments is here addressed the normalised bed shear stress τ b calculated from log law as in section 3 1 3 1 the depth averaged over the gravity currents depth vertical mean velocity w d 2 the corresponding depth averaged fluctuation w d 3 and the depth averaged reynolds stresses u w d 4 are subsequently compared to the area of sediments entrained all these quantities are plotted together in fig 15 with the same time reference here the normalized bed shear stress shields 1936b parameter is used 15 τ b τ b ρ s ρ 0 g d 50 the tests performed in this work fall in the suspended load transport area of the shields diagram for density and turbidity currents provided in sequeiros et al 2010b before sediment entrainment begins a peak in mean vertical depth averaged velocity is observed alternatively positive and negative oscillations follow w d has the same evolution and contributes in intensifying the fluctuating behaviour of vertical flow movements inside the current a drop in vertical velocity is detected corresponding to the initiation of sediment entrainment normalised bed shear stress has also a minimum during the period in which sediments entrainment is important that is during the passage of the head of the current delimited with the vertical dashed line in fig 15 when the area of sediment entrained drops i e in the body of the current where there are almost no sediments in suspension important values of normalized bed shear stress τ b are detected to understand and to quantify how related are the four time varying hydrodynamic quantities in fig 15 with entrainment and transport of suspended sediment the cross correlation between the time varying area of entrainment displayed in fig 10 and these is calculated and presented in fig 16 together with the 95 confidence interval fig 16 shows that the mean and fluctuating components of the depth averaged vertical velocity are highly correlated with the entrained area in the first instants of the passage of the current conversely the normalised bed shear stress and depth averaged reynolds shear stresses correlate with the entrainment area for a longer period mean and fluctuating component of depth averaged vertical velocity are then indicated as major factors for sediments lifting being their correlation with the area of sediment at the maximum at the moment when sediment entrainment initiates the high correlation of the cloud of suspended sediments and bed shear stress in particular to the quantity u w d indicates the importance of the latter in the distal transport of sediment once the sediment becomes mobile because it is dislocated from the bed bed shear stress excess causes its downstream movement 4 2 dynamics of sediment transport and deposition gravity currents are turbulent flows which experience the presence of near wall turbulent coherent structures grass 1971 kneller et al 1999 as those are common features of boundary layer turbulence defina 1996 turbulent bursting events characterize these type of flows which consist in the movement of low speed fluid ejected away from the wall salim et al 2017 streamwise oriented vortexes called horseshoe vortexes salim et al 2017 aligned with the primary flow are formed and they are responsible for the imprinting of elongated streaks of deposited sediment many studies have been conducted on the streaky structure in the wall region of many types of turbulent boundary layer flows defina 1996 grass 1971 and allen 1985 among others the signature of these patterns in the deposition have been observed in the present tests see section 3 2 2 fig 3 left side shows the formation of elongated accumulation of sediments bands on the streamwise direction for test r1 fine since the only forces acting on the sediment originate in the flowing fluid the fact that they are arranged in streamwise oriented bands can only be due to a transverse component of fluid force allen 1985 the fluid motion of the gravity current has been thoroughly analysed and fig 8 provides evidence of the simultaneous presence of mean streamwise velocity troughs with peaks of rms velocities periods of high turbulence that correlate with slow mean streamwise velocity are typical for coherent flow turbulent structures such as ejections baas et al 2005 in the ejection phase low speed fluid is ejected upward and simultaneously a local and adjacent convection streamwise recirculation cell will quickly form the formation of longitudinal streaks in the bed is the result of the convergence of downwelling flow associated with these flow streamwise cells the size and shape of streaks are flow dependent and the average streak spanwise spacing is confirmed to be influenced by the initial density fig 14 kaftori et al 1995 shows that with an increment in the bottom shear stress for a given fluid particle combination more particles are entrained and the streaks begin to shrink in size this tendency is continuing until a point in which there are no enough particles at the wall and the streaks disappear here we found that gravity currents generate by higher excess densities produce more spaced streaks this can therefore be linked to the presence of more energetic counter rotating streamwise vortices ninto and garcia 1996 for what concern the influence of the grain size previous literature reports that particle sorting along low speed streaks occurs only if the particles are of sizes about equal or smaller than the thickness of the viscous sublayer kaftori et al 1995 moreover larger particles have more inertia than smaller ones and therefore they are less responsive to flow velocity fluctuations as it was already pointed out by ninto and garcia 1996 here the influence of the grain size of sediments composing the erodible reach is translated in a tendency to have an increment in the spacing between streaks and thicker streaks in presence of coarser grain size coarser particles settle more easily than fine particles due to its larger weight and they form sedimentary streaks of larger thickness this indicates that a feedback exists between the turbulence caused coherent motion which is at the origin of the flow streaks and the mobile bed which conditions the spacing scale of these 4 3 quantitative analysis of sediment erosion in order to characterize the relation between sediment entrainment and bed shear stress caused by the passage of a gravity current new quantities are defined the non dimensional time integral of the bed shear stress which by dimensional analysis is an impulse per unit surface is given by 16 φ 0 t τ b t d t t where the limit t defines the end of sediment entrainment obtained from the analysis of the area of sediment entrained in figs 10 and 15 a specific dimensionless eroded volume is defined as 17 v e r o d e d v e r o d e d d 50 a t o t being veroded the volume of eroded sediment and atot the total surface of the mobile bed as in section 3 2 2 in fig 17 a the quantities calculated per test are represented one against the other and they show a coherent tendency an increase in φ is related to an increase in the erosion in particular fig 17a shows an that the dimensionless eroded volume increases exponentially with the time integral of the normalised bed shear stress the relationship between the eroded volume and a variable which takes into considerations the initial density of the gravity current surrogate of the erosion force and the grain size surrogate of the resistance to erosion is shown in fig 17b eroded volumes decrease with increasing d 50 ρ a δ ρ 1 h b 1 adimensional parameter which counts for the grain size and excess buoyancy confirming that in case of low initial density and with coarser sediments the material on the erodible reach is less mobile and consequently the erosion is weaker particle reynolds number which takes into account both the sediment representative diameter and the density by mean of the reduced gravity have been computed as garcía and parker 1993 18 r e p g d 50 d 50 ν fig 18 a shows the linear relationship between the quantity φ and rep as particle reynolds number decreases the impulse per unit surface produced by the gravity current on the sediment composing the mobile bed is larger this is the same behaviour as indicated by the well known shields diagram shields 1936a shields curve for low particle reynolds numbers left hand side of the plot is the threshold of motion which becomes higher in presence of finer material in fig 18b the dependence of the dimensionless specific eroded volume veroded to the particle reynolds number rep is shown there is a clear decreasing tendency similar to a hyperbola of the volume eroded with the rep particles characterized by a lower rep exhibit an easiness to be entrained and consequently the measured eroded volume is greater 4 4 effect of sediment entrainment on the gravity current as hypothesized earlier the hydrodynamics of the current is influenced by the incorporation of the sediment present at the bed and this interaction is conditioned with the sediment diameter changes on the geometry of the front which are related with the flow resistence are observed in the time evolution of the area of the current as reported in fig 10 from fig 10 two quantities have been calculated θ the angle formed by the line representing the evolution of the current in gray with the horizontal by means of merely geometrical considerations using the lines as presented in fig 10 and hc calculated as the average area of the portion of the image occupied by the current divided by the horizontal dimension of the frame captured with the high speed camera these two have been compared to d 50 ρ a δ ρ 1 h b 1 fig 19 fig 19 shows that the current height hc increases at a higher rate θ in presence of finer sediments this is an evidence of how the incorporation of sediment changes the hydrodynamics of the current the tests where larger quantity of sediment is incorporated cf fig 10 are the ones where the angle theta is higher the results suggest that the incorporation of sediment within the current induces internal energy losses which induce the higher velocity of increase of hc however the influence of the incorporation of sediment in the current geometry is not so evident when regarding the current depth in fact only for the case of the lower initial densities in the lock the incorporation seems to produce an effect 5 conclusions erosion transport and deposition of fine sediment caused by the passage of a saline gravity current have been experimentally investigated for this purpose the cross analysis of data from several measuring techniques is performed instantaneous velocity profiles measured with an acoustic doppler velocity profiler video analysis laser based topography and pictures of deposition patterns compose the available data set the tests carried out with a lock exchange channel with high volume of release flowing over a mobile bed reach included three initial densities of the fluid on the lock and three different sediment sizes composing the mobile bed reach mean flow and fluctuating quantities are estimated and discussed taking into account the different triggering densities in the lock different size classes of suspended sediment react differently to the changes in flow dynamics determined by the initial density in the lock among the computed hydrodynamic quantities such as turbulent and mean upward velocity bed shear stress and turbulent stresses we show that bed shear stress and reynolds stresses are correlated with sediment entrainment for longer periods such that it can be inferred that they are associated to the distal transport of sediment the main responsible for sediment dislodging is found to be the vertical component of the fluid movement which presents a high peak of vertical mean velocity at the front of the currents upward motion characterized by the mean vertical velocity and aided by the vertical component of turbulence promotes vertical mixing of the sediment from the channel bed whereas in the periods between these flow structures the particles have sufficient settling velocities to deposit with the coarser particles depositing sooner than finer ones our combined analysis of the hydrodynamics and the geomorphological imprint of the passage of the gravity current on the mobile bed show a clear relationship between erosion and current shape furthermore our results indicate that the deposition downstream the mobile bed presents the signature of counter rotating vortices aligned with the primary flow in the streamwise direction therefore the presence of feedback mechanisms is assumed with the hydrodynamics of the current imprinting the streaks and entrainment of sediment modifying the current hydrodynamics thus resulting in different streaks geometries acknowledgments this

822,the study of gas water mass transfer in porous media is important in many applications including unconventional resource extraction carbon storage deep geological waste storage and remediation of

have been and are being collected at the field scale e g cahill et al 2017 molofsky et al 2011 osborn et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2005 very few of those studies have looked at movement of contaminants coupled with gas flow dynamics and gas water mass transfer some studies have started to simulate stray gas contamination in aquifers using numerical models e g nowamooz et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 roy et al 2016 field and modelling based studies show that work also needs to be done at the laboratory scale to validate conceptual and mathematical models help to understand the coupled processes of gas migration and its dissolution in groundwater and provide a framework for the development of monitoring strategies at the field scale similar concerns are relevant to the geologic storage of co2 where an understanding of the transitions from stratigraphic to capillary to solubility to mineral storage require an understanding of multiphase flow and mass transfer ipcc 2005 few publications have presented a complete conceptual model for the migration of stray gas in shallow aquifers ryan et al 2015 conceptualized the movement dissolution and fate of stray gas migration based on a literature review and clearly distinguished between free phase and dissolved phase gas cahill et al 2017 conducted a methane gas injection experiment in the borden aquifer and developed a conceptual model based on their field scale observations which highlighted the role of macro scale heterogeneity further systematic investigation and development of these conceptual models is required particularly in regards to the migration of free phase gas its dissolution in groundwater and the expression of stray gas migration at the surface high resolution bench scale experiments are a useful tool to investigate aspects of the conceptual models for stray gas migration aqueous samples are commonly collected from laboratory experiments to study transport processes but often provide limited resolution and can influence flow to better study gas to water mass transfer related to stray gas migration novel techniques are required to measure aqueous concentrations produced by a dissolving trapped gas phase light transmission techniques niemet and selker 2001 tidwell and glass 1994 and the use of dyes have been applied to understand multiphase flow aqueous transport and reactive transport in porous media without the use of invasive sampling werth et al 2013 however previous studies have not used visualization techniques to measure dissolution from a trapped gas related studies have used ph indicator dyes to track the dissolution and transport of carbon dioxide co2 in porous media in the context of geologic storage these studies applied a gas at one boundary and measured macroscopic properties such as finger lengths and widths kneafsey and pruess 2010 thomas et al 2015 parker et al 2006 utilized methyl red indicator dye to investigate the dissolution of co2 in the vadose zone and found that it could be used to detect the boundary of the dissolved plume these previous studies introduced a useful technique but did not investigate the dissolution of trapped gas in an otherwise water saturated porous medium and did not investigate dissolution subject to water flow in addition these studies reported primarily qualitative observations of dissolved co2 transport and did not report local small scale aqueous concentrations of interest for the further development of conceptual models of stray gas migration the purpose of this study was to develop a non invasive technique for use in experiments to better understand the dissolution and transport of gases dissolved in groundwater at near atmospheric pressure for application to stray gas migration the specific objectives of the study were to i develop a light transmission technique to track mass transfer from the gaseous to aqueous phase with high spatial and temporal resolution using co2 as a surrogate gas and ii validate the technique against laboratory experiments of gas injection and dissolution a series of bench scale laboratory experiments were conducted using a thin flow cell and gas injections designed to mimic the source architecture expected to result from stray gas migration 2 materials and methods 2 1 flow cell experiments were conducted in a two dimensional flow cell with internal dimensions of 25 25 1 cm3 fig 1 similar cells have been used for light transmission to study multiphase flow and solute transport at similar length scales for a variety of applications e g krishnamurthy et al 2017 mumford et al 2010 rasmusson et al 2017 selker et al 2007 the cell was constructed of clear acrylic walls separated by a space of 1 cm representative of a two dimensional slice of aquifer the 1 cm thickness is consistent with previous studies that employed light transmission imaging glass et al 2000 mumford et al 2009 niemet and selker 2001 selker et al 2007 and provides an integrated signal through a distance of approximately 14 grain diameters in the sand used here d50 0 713 mm a clear well on one side of the cell distributed the effluent flow while eight influent ports distributed the influent flow the ports were placed 1 cm from the bottom of the cell and spaced 3 3 cm apart for the remainder no clear well on the influent edge allowed injected gas to remain close to the influent edge representative of stray gas adjacent to the outside of a well casing the cell was sealed on the top using a hydrophobic neoprene gasket to provide a gas tight seal 2 2 sand emplacement gas injection and water flow the flow cell was packed using 20 30 accusil sand agsco corporation which has a median grain size of 0 713 mm schroth et al 1996 prior to packing the sand was washed in a three step process i with de ionized water to remove fines ii with 10 sodium hydroxide naoh solution and rinsed with distilled water until the supernatant returned to neutral ph and iii using 10 nitric acid hno3 solution and rinsed with distilled water until the supernatant returned to neutral ph following washing the sand was oven dried at 60 c for 48 h this procedure yee et al 2000 was used to remove any potential buffering capacity of the sand due to the presence of trace impurities washed sand was packed into the flow cell by continuously pouring as a wet slurry of sand and distilled water to promote a homogeneous pack without trapped atmospheric gases the cell was gently vibrated while the slurry was being poured to ensure reduced settlement after packing once the packing was complete the cell was allowed to settle for a minimum of 12 h and a small amount of additional sand was added to prevent a gap between the sand and the top seal sand packs were inspected for signs of bedding and were rejected if bedding was present a similar sand emplacement technique was used by mumford et al 2009 using the same sand and no gas pooling was observed during gas injection despite efforts to create a homogenous sand pack it is expected that gas injection patterns will produce local small scale differences in gas saturation due to pore scale heterogeneity glass et al 2000 ji et al 1993 mumford et al 2009 four gas injection and dissolution experiments were performed table 1 prior to gas injection 3 5 pore volumes of de ionized water dyed with either bromocresol green or resazurin were pumped through the cell to ensure uniform initial dye distribution co2 was selected as the surrogate gas in this study because it has a high acid ionization constant for a gas dissolves readily in water and is non explosive co2 gas was injected through the lowest edge port of flow cell on the influent side using a gas tight syringe at 0 25 ml s followed by the injection of 2 5 or 3 ml of dyed water using the same syringe to remove gas from the injection line injection of the total gas volume over 10 12 s limited dissolution of co2 during the injection such that dissolution could be investigated separate from gas migration the flow rate selected for these experiments was at the low end of flow rates reported for stray gas migration from 0 01 to 5000 m3 day using surface casing vent flow as a surrogate nowamooz et al 2015 this low flow rate was also selected so that gas movement was controlled by gravity and buoyancy but fast enough such that the injected gas spanned the height of the flow cell quickly to limit dissolution during the gas injection flow rates less than 1 6 ml s are expected to be unstable in this sand mumford et al 2009 following gas injection dyed bromocresol green or resazurin de ionized water was pumped masterflex l s 6 600rpm cartridge pump through the eight influent ports at 1 375 ml min providing a darcy flux of 6 3 m day the dye solution was sparged with ambient air to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere prepared at room temperature to prevent exsolution due to warming and the influent ph was monitored continuously accumet xl500 2 3 dye and colour space experiments b1 and r1 were performed to determine an appropriate ph indicator dye the success of an indicator dye at resolving the ph and therefore co2 concentration in space and time within the flow cell relies on its ability to span the expected ph values for co2 dissolution from 3 9 at its solubility limit 1 atm 25 c to 5 6 for distilled water in equilibrium with atmospheric co2 1 atm 25 c methyl red parker et al 2006 and bromocresol green kneafsey and pruess 2010 thomas et al 2015 have been used in previous studies which have ph ranges of 4 4 6 2 and 3 8 5 4 respectively neither of these dyes span the full range of interest limiting detection at higher or lower concentrations of co2 respectively an alternate dye resazurin with a ph range of 3 8 6 5 was also considered in this study preliminary tests conducted in gas tight vials filled with co2 gas and water showed flocculation of methyl red in water which could interfere with the image processing in this study therefore bromocresol green changes from blue to yellow and resazurin changes from purple to orange were selected for these experiments additional preliminary tests conducted in the flow cell showed minimal sorption of bromocresol green and resazurin to sand after the sand was washed as described above changes in the colour of the indicator dyes were assessed using the rgb red green blue hsv hue saturation value and ycbcr colour spaces although other spaces can also be used e g kashuk and iskander 2014 to evaluate the suitability of each colour space in this study images from experiments b1 and r1 were captured shortly after gas injection and once the dissolved co2 plume had travelled half the length of cell areas of these images that first contained no plume and then contained the plume were identified and histograms of each area for the nine colour components three components per colour space were compared experiments r2 and r3 were conducted as replicates of experiment r1 2 4 image capture and analysis light transmission images of each experiment were captured using a digital camera canon eos rebel t5i fitted with a canon efs 15 22 mm lens at a resolution of 2592 1728 pixels every 5 s canon eos utility software camera capture settings were set manually at iso400 f9 0 and a shutter speed of 1 60 which were selected by manual optimization focusing was performed automatically using the auto focus setting on the lens at the beginning of each test and manually held for the remainder of the test the cell was back lit by a led light bank ledgo lg 1200s and the flow cell light bank and camera were covered during the experiments to reduce the effects of ambient light images from each experiment were calibrated by injecting five pore volumes of tap water used in place of distilled water to provide buffering capacity titrated to a ph of 3 8 4 0 4 5 5 0 or 5 6 using sulfuric acid h2so4 to completely fill each sand pack prior to the start of the gas injection experiments images of the water saturated sand pack at each ph were used to develop an empirical calibration relationship because digital imaging was performed at a scale smaller than the average grain size each pixel represents approximately 0 17 0 17 mm2 the calibration images were analysed at different upscaled discretizations to determine the sensitivity of the calibration relationship to the scale of analysis specifically to determine if a single calibration relationship could be used for all locations in the flow cell in this analysis a mean local hue value see section 3 2 for a discussion of hue as the preferred colour component was calculated as the mean of 1 5002 pixels from the ph 5 0 calibration image of experiment r1 representative of all other ph calibration images given the pixels size of 0 17 mm 1 pixel represents an area of 0 03 mm2 while 5002 pixels represents an area of 7225 mm2 this was repeated at 1000 random locations at each discretization to generate 1000 mean local hue values and the variation between these local values and the mean over all 1000 local values was investigated images were processed using the image processing and statistic toolkits in matlab r2016a and were processed in uncompressed format to preserve all captured image data raw rgb images were separated into separate rgb hsv or ycbcr components using matlab functions for experiments with resazurin dye which changes colour from purple to orange hue values were rotated by 180 such that they did not include both 1 and 359 following analysis of each colour component hue ph calibration relationships were developed and used to determine the total dissolved co2 concentration based on carbonate equilibrium as 1 c t 10 2 p h 10 p k a 1 10 p h where ct is the total dissolved co2 concentration and pka 1 is 6 352 at 25 c butler 1991 eq 1 is a simplification of the fourth order representation of the carbonate system based on ph pka 1 where the total concentration of co2 would be mainly comprised of h2co3 and hco3 because of the small thickness of the cell it was assumed that the total dissolved co2 concentrations varied in space but were uniform over the thickness of the cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 gas injection and dissolution example images from experiments b1 and r1 representative of r2 and r3 are shown in fig 2 immediately following co2 gas injection in each experiment injected in the bottom left corner of the images in fig 2 the gas travelled vertically to a height of 20 22 cm above the injection port fig 2a and f this vertical distance was limited by the injected gas volume which was selected to avoid contact with the flow cell lid the resulting gas fingers appeared to be discontinuous with gas trapped throughout the vertical extent of the fingers as expected due to gravity destabilized conditions and as observed during previous gas injections in this sand mumford et al 2009 emphasizing that gas movement was capillary gravity controlled in some experiments the gas injection was approximately parabolic in shape and deviated away from the injection port with increasing height in all experiments the trapped gas was limited to a region less than 5 cm laterally away from the influent face the dissolution of trapped gas produced a local colour change from green to yellow in experiment b1 fig 2b and from purple to orange in experiments r1 r3 fig 2f due to the acidification of the pore water immediately adjacent to the gas horizontal water flow was initiated at 20 s and the colour change extended to the right hand side of the flow cell as the dissolved co2 plume was transported in the direction of flow fig 2b d and f h the colour change appeared most substantial at early time when the bulk of the co2 mass from the gas phase dissolved as dissolution progressed plume fingering occurred fig 2c d g and h but became less pronounced at later time due to lateral dispersion regions of higher co2 concentrations larger colour change appeared to be spatially correlated to regions of higher gas saturation darker initial intensity during gas injection at later time tailing of the plume was observed as the trapped co2 gas was depleted with fingers of acidified indicator colour persisting as the colour returned to the pre injection conditions tailing was particularly pronounced in line with the gas injection port until the end of the experiment fig 2d and h although these experiments were not designed to measure gas saturations the darker intensity indicative of higher gas saturations was sustained throughout the experiment indicating persistence of a gas phase this was despite the colour in the flow cell having returned to pre injection conditions indicating depletion of the co2 gas this is consistent with multi component partitioning where co2 transfers out of the gas phase but o2 and n2 from the influent water transfer in sustaining the gas saturations geistlinger et al 2005 mumford et al 2010 3 2 dye and colour space selection the selection of suitable dyes and colour spaces for mapping dissolved co2 concentrations was based on the results from experiments b1 and r1 a 412 88 pixel 7 1 5 cm2 section was selected from images collected 10 s and 700 s after gas injection in which the co2 plume was not or was present respectively fig 2 a histogram of the 36 256 pixel values was then created for each of the nine separate colour components of the rgb hsv and ycbcr colour spaces for bromocresol green fig 3 and resazurin fig 4 for a colour component to be a viable signal the histograms for when a plume is present and not present should be distinct i e clear peak separation and little overlap each histogram also needs to show a sharp unimodal peak as a tailing effect or multiple peaks can indicate limitations in calibration and dye stability over expected ph ranges to choose between the nine colour components both the peak separation and overlap the area of the overlapping histograms expressed as a fraction of the 36 256 total pixels was determined table 2 all histograms showed a unimodal signal for of each component however the separation and overlap of the peaks varied between components table 2 the colour component red used with resazurin and hue used with both bromocresol green and resazurin were the most promising with the three lowest overlaps and three highest peak separations the red component with resazurin showed relatively separate peaks 0 15 hue units however a higher degree of overlap compared to the other two combinations fig 4a the hue component with bromocresol green fig 3d showed a large separation between peaks 0 35 hue units and only 2 8 overlap however a large tailing effect in the signal was seen when the plume was present which overlapped with a non present plume this tailing is the effect of the limitations in the dye at resolving low ph values 4 4 in comparison the hue component for resazurin showed two distinct peaks separated by 0 25 hue units with only 0 6 overlap of histograms fig 4d based on this analysis the use of resazurin as the indicator dye coupled with the use of the hue colour component was determined to be the most suitable for resolving concentrations of dissolved co2 and was used for all remaining analyses it is important to note that this selection was based on the investigation of the aqueous phase only and other signals may be more helpful for quantification of the gas phase 3 3 discretization analysis this technique was developed to investigate flow processes near the grain size of medium to coarse sand therefore a discretization analysis was performed by 1 calculation of the difference between the mean local hue values at different discretizations to the average of all mean local hue values at that specific discretization section 2 4 and 2 qualitative inspection of key plume features at different discretizations the first analysis was performed on the ph 5 0 calibration image of experiment r1 using between 1 and 5002 pixels results from each of the 1000 realizations at each discretization are shown as symbols in fig 5 along with dashed lines representing the 95 confidence interval fig 5 shows that at the pixel scale 0 17 mm resolution there is large variation in the hue values due to variation in grain colour and lighting changes near the edge of the cell and local hue values can differ from the mean value of the entire flow cell however as the coarseness of discretization is increased the difference between the local and global is reduced until it reaches nearly zero 0 0002 at a resolution of 85 mm the confidence interval shown in fig 5 can be used to estimate the upper bound of the error for a single local hue measurement at a specific discretization the second analysis was performed on the hue image of experiment r1 at 700 s at varying discretizations in order to assess the level of detail observed in the plume fig 6 a very fine discretization 1 mm shows dissolution fingers at multiple locations with heights of 1 cm and greater fig 6b however these characteristics are lost as the discretization size increases above 1 mm fig 6c and d the differences between mean local hue value and global average of the mean local hue values fig 5 demonstrates that a single hue ph calibration relationship developed using a mean value over the entire cell would not accurately represent local dissolved co2 concentrations local calibration relationships developed at the resolution of interest would be necessary to resolve co2 concentrations accurately particularly because the resolution of local concentrations is required to investigate plume fingers fig 6 therefore one must consider both minimizing the error coarser resolution and balancing the level of detail which can be observed in an experiment finer resolution for the purposes of this study it was decided based on the preceding analysis that a 1 mm discretization and local calibration would be used this would provide the ability to draw conclusions about the plume development pathway geometry and longevity 3 4 calibration relationship unique hue ph calibration relationships were developed from each of experiments r1 r3 due to variations in lighting and distance of separation between the camera and the flow cell at a resolution of 1 mm an example calibration relationship is shown in fig 7 a at a resolution of 1 mm 36 pixel scale hue values were used to calculate the mean hue value at that location for each of the five ph values used for calibration 180 total data points and the 95 confidence limit of the second order polynomial fit to the calibration data is based on the variability of these data uncertainty in estimated local ph values during each experiment are therefore based on both this uncertainty in the calibration relationship as well as variation in hue over the 1 mm 1 mm measurement area for example fig 7a shows the upper and lower limits of a mean local measured hue value of 0 30 0 01 2 standard deviations and their intersection with the confidence limits of the calibration relationship which gives a calibrated ph of 5 38 5 47 this uncertainty is a function of ph due to the non linear calibration therefore a greater value of hue with the same measurement error results in greater uncertainty in ph for example a hue of 0 41 0 01 gives a calibrated ph of 4 55 4 94 to determine the influence of this uncertainty on estimated dissolved co2 concentrations the same data are plotted against the co2 concentration in fig 7b based on eq 1 because of this log relationship and the non linear hue ph calibration there is greater uncertainty at higher dissolved co2 concentrations for example using the same data as above a hue value of 0 31 0 01 corresponds to an estimated co2 concentration of 0 043 0 029 mmol l while a hue value of 0 41 0 01 corresponds to an estimated co2 concentration of 1 814 0 308 mmol l this uncertainty must be considered when interpreting estimated co2 concentrations following gas injection and dissolution using this technique particularly because the highest concentrations are the most uncertain 3 5 dissolved co2 concentrations images from experiment r1 processed from raw images using hue ph calibration e g fig 7a d and hue total co2 concentration e g fig 7e h are shown in fig 8 as observed in fig 2e h these images show the development of the dissolved co2 plume following dissolution from the injected free gas phase the movement of the plume front and the plume tail and detachment from the gas phase concentrations near solubility occur immediately following gas injection and are then decreased due to dispersion and depletion of co2 from the gas phase at later times the concentration is sustained longer at the gas injection location than towards the upper extent of the injected gas likely due to higher gas saturations near the injection point as a result of viscous forces during gas injection selker et al 2007 as the gaseous co2 dissolves into the pore water the development of dissolved phase co2 fingers was observed this fingering is related to local areas of higher gaseous co2 saturation produced during injection by local heterogeneity and gravity capillary controlled gas flow fingering was observed in all injections performed do to the steeper slope of the calibration curve at lower total co2 concentrations fig 7b the front of the plume appears distinct however higher concentrations at the core of the plume fingers are sensitive to small changes in hue resolved co2 concentrations fig 8 were used to determine the co2 mass balance for each of experiments r1 r3 breakthrough curves were developed at every vertical location using mean values at a 1 mm resolution at a horizontal location approximately 0 5 cm from the injected gas this location varied between 4 and 6 cm from the influent edge of the flow cell due to different pathways followed by the injected gas in each of the experiments each of the breakthrough curves using images taken every 5 s at 250 vertical locations were integrated to estimate the dissolved co2 mass which was compared to the mass of co2 injected table 3 based on the ideal gas law for a temperature of 25 c and a pressure of 104 kpa it is important to note that while ideal gas law is appropriate for these laboratory conditions and shallow aquifers it may not be suitable for deeper applications mean ratios of the breakthrough mass to the injected mass range from 0 72 to 1 23 these estimates are uncertain with a range as low as 0 37 and as high as 2 75 across all experiments table 2 this is due primarily to uncertainty associated with the highest concentrations in the dissolved co2 plume section 3 4 in all of experiments r1 r3 the 95 confidence interval spanned a ratio of 1 table 3 demonstrating that the mass balance was not significantly different than 100 however this is due to the width of the uncertainty and further research is required to improve the precision at high total co2 concentrations 3 6 potential implications for stray gas migration the results of these co2 gas injection and dissolution experiments analysed using the laboratory technique developed here can serve as a surrogate for stray gas migration and dissolution in shallow homogeneous aquifers they demonstrated key characteristics for consideration first the combination of gravity and capillary forces during gas migration created local areas of high and low gas saturations and gas was mobilized laterally away from the injection point this behaviour will be more pronounced with increased heterogeneity with gas able to pool and spread beneath capillary barriers second this variable initial gas saturation led to a non uniform concentration front plume fingers which are also expected to be more prominent in more heterogeneous media due to both the distribution of gas and the presence of higher permeability flow pathways these plume fingers could complicate the detection of dissolved gas at stray gas sites particularly where trapping and dissolution below low permeability layers suppresses any ground surface expression of the gas migration e g vegetation stress gas flux measurements bubbling in pooled water third multi component mass transfer led to the prolonged presence of the gas phase despite depletion of co2 from the injected gas this is important for both modelling of these systems where multiple dissolved gas species control gas saturation and in turn mass transfer and relative permeability and for detection and monitoring where detection of gas phase is not synonymous with detection of a particular component such as methane 4 conclusions a novel visualization technique was developed to quantify dissolved gas concentrations following dissolution from a trapped gas phase the technique was tested using replicate injections of co2 gas into initially water saturated porous media the results showed that using light transmission visualization combined with resazurin ph indicator and the hue colour component calibrated to ph can facilitate qualitative observations of gas dissolution and dissolved gas transport these observations could be made at a spatial resolution as fine as 1 mm provided that local calibration relationships at the same resolution were employed resazurin indicator combined with the hue colour component provided both greater peak separation and less overlap than the histograms of other colour components in the rgb hsv or ycbcr colour spaces using resazurin or bromocresol green observations facilitated by this technique included relationships between gas migration patterns and plume geometry plume fingers the longevity of the gas source and its variability over the injected gas distribution and dispersion of the dissolved gas in addition results demonstrated the potential to quantify dissolved gas concentrations at this fine resolution with mass balances of 72 102 and 123 across triplicate experiments however the non linear hue total co2 calibration relationship resulted in greater uncertainty at higher dissolved concentrations which led to uncertainty in the mass balance than at lower dissolved concentrations which enabled high resolution of the plume front although not explored in this study it is believed that the proposed technique could be used for experimental applications at higher pressures for example co2 sequestration application at higher pressures would require further consideration of solubility effects on the choice of dye and calibration of the images the results of these gas injection experiments show important implications with respect to the conceptual model and underlying physics of stray gas migration in shallow groundwater systems from energy development stray gas problems are expected to be complex and will be affected by gas dynamics multi component gas water mass transfer across evolving fluid fluid interfaces changes in relative permeability and the overriding influence of geologic heterogeneity these are in addition to subsequent migration from the saturated zone to the vadose zone and biogeochemical reactions associated with natural gas components these experiments demonstrated that the conceptual models for stray gas migration and numerical models developed based on those concepts should account for gravity and capillary forces that dominate the upward gas migration as observed in other gas flow applications in porous media resulting in narrow gas fingers with local gas trapping controlled by small scale heterogeneity however observations also suggest that the influence of viscous forces on the distribution of gas near a leak location seen here as the local trapping of gas near the injection point and prolonged dissolution of co2 into the plume may need to be considered in the assessment of stray gas and its dissolution these results also demonstrated that conceptual and numerical models should account for multi component mass transfer in assessing the effects stray gas which can alter gas and water flow and prolong the longevity of a stray gas source and the dissolved concentrations of compounds of interest further research is required to incorporate these coupled processes into the conceptual and numerical models for stray gas migration to help develop improved monitoring and remedial techniques and establish best practices for risk management acknowledgements this research was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research

822,the study of gas water mass transfer in porous media is important in many applications including unconventional resource extraction carbon storage deep geological waste storage and remediation of contaminated groundwater all of which rely on an understanding of the fate and transport of free and dissolved gas the novel visual technique developed in this study provided both quantitative and qualitative observations of gas water mass transfer findings included interaction between free gas architecture and dissolved plume migration plume geometry and longevity the technique was applied to the injection of co2 in source patterns expected for stray gas originating from oil and gas operations to measure dissolved phase concentrations of co2 at high spatial and temporal resolutions the data set is the first of its kind to provide high resolution quantification of gas water dissolution and will facilitate an improved understanding of the fundamental processes of gas movement and fate in these complex systems keywords stray gas mass transfer methane carbon dioxide light transmission visualization 1 introduction and background unconventional oil and gas plays are becoming prevalent sources of fuel for the increasing global population technology development in the form of hydraulic fracturing and the use of directional drilling is shifting production from conventional to unconventional resources rivard et al 2014 us epa 2016 the environmental impact and potential human health implications specifically from the contamination of groundwater sources vengosh et al 2014 has sparked controversy around shale gas extraction in their 2014 report the council of canadian academies cca stated that the greatest concern around hydraulic fracturing and groundwater is the threat of stray gas migration also referred to as fugitive methane cca 2014 it is postulated that stray gas could travel along pathways from production zones via induced and natural fractures or along damaged or improperly sealed wells used for active hydraulic fracturing and inactive and abandoned wells cca 2014 dusseault and jackson 2014 the most probable pathway for fugitive methane entering shallow aquifers is along wells whose casing integrity has been compromised due to high pressures corrosion decay of well casings and annulus or poor design and installation of the cemented casing cca 2014 davies et al 2014 dusseault and jackson 2014 nowamooz et al 2015 this compromised integrity provides a preferential pathway for free gas phase mostly methane to migrate from pockets of natural gas both inside and outside the production zone to shallower aquifers there are multiple risks associated with stray gas in shallow aquifers including the deterioration of drinking water quality for groundwater users mobilization of contaminants explosion due to methane seeping into basements of residential and commercial buildings and asphyxiation in these basements due to a reduction of indoor air quality kelly et al 1985 son and carlson 2015 us epa 2016 van stempvoort et al 2005 there is a lack of understanding of the movement dissolution and fate of fugitive methane in shallow aquifers as a result of hydraulic fracturing operations vidic et al 2013 in their comprehensive review on the impact of shale gas development on groundwater stated that improved understanding of fate and transport of stray gas will help to mitigate the effects of activities on water sources currently a large portion of scientific literature on this topic is focused at the field scale although data have been and are being collected at the field scale e g cahill et al 2017 molofsky et al 2011 osborn et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2005 very few of those studies have looked at movement of contaminants coupled with gas flow dynamics and gas water mass transfer some studies have started to simulate stray gas contamination in aquifers using numerical models e g nowamooz et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 roy et al 2016 field and modelling based studies show that work also needs to be done at the laboratory scale to validate conceptual and mathematical models help to understand the coupled processes of gas migration and its dissolution in groundwater and provide a framework for the development of monitoring strategies at the field scale similar concerns are relevant to the geologic storage of co2 where an understanding of the transitions from stratigraphic to capillary to solubility to mineral storage require an understanding of multiphase flow and mass transfer ipcc 2005 few publications have presented a complete conceptual model for the migration of stray gas in shallow aquifers ryan et al 2015 conceptualized the movement dissolution and fate of stray gas migration based on a literature review and clearly distinguished between free phase and dissolved phase gas cahill et al 2017 conducted a methane gas injection experiment in the borden aquifer and developed a conceptual model based on their field scale observations which highlighted the role of macro scale heterogeneity further systematic investigation and development of these conceptual models is required particularly in regards to the migration of free phase gas its dissolution in groundwater and the expression of stray gas migration at the surface high resolution bench scale experiments are a useful tool to investigate aspects of the conceptual models for stray gas migration aqueous samples are commonly collected from laboratory experiments to study transport processes but often provide limited resolution and can influence flow to better study gas to water mass transfer related to stray gas migration novel techniques are required to measure aqueous concentrations produced by a dissolving trapped gas phase light transmission techniques niemet and selker 2001 tidwell and glass 1994 and the use of dyes have been applied to understand multiphase flow aqueous transport and reactive transport in porous media without the use of invasive sampling werth et al 2013 however previous studies have not used visualization techniques to measure dissolution from a trapped gas related studies have used ph indicator dyes to track the dissolution and transport of carbon dioxide co2 in porous media in the context of geologic storage these studies applied a gas at one boundary and measured macroscopic properties such as finger lengths and widths kneafsey and pruess 2010 thomas et al 2015 parker et al 2006 utilized methyl red indicator dye to investigate the dissolution of co2 in the vadose zone and found that it could be used to detect the boundary of the dissolved plume these previous studies introduced a useful technique but did not investigate the dissolution of trapped gas in an otherwise water saturated porous medium and did not investigate dissolution subject to water flow in addition these studies reported primarily qualitative observations of dissolved co2 transport and did not report local small scale aqueous concentrations of interest for the further development of conceptual models of stray gas migration the purpose of this study was to develop a non invasive technique for use in experiments to better understand the dissolution and transport of gases dissolved in groundwater at near atmospheric pressure for application to stray gas migration the specific objectives of the study were to i develop a light transmission technique to track mass transfer from the gaseous to aqueous phase with high spatial and temporal resolution using co2 as a surrogate gas and ii validate the technique against laboratory experiments of gas injection and dissolution a series of bench scale laboratory experiments were conducted using a thin flow cell and gas injections designed to mimic the source architecture expected to result from stray gas migration 2 materials and methods 2 1 flow cell experiments were conducted in a two dimensional flow cell with internal dimensions of 25 25 1 cm3 fig 1 similar cells have been used for light transmission to study multiphase flow and solute transport at similar length scales for a variety of applications e g krishnamurthy et al 2017 mumford et al 2010 rasmusson et al 2017 selker et al 2007 the cell was constructed of clear acrylic walls separated by a space of 1 cm representative of a two dimensional slice of aquifer the 1 cm thickness is consistent with previous studies that employed light transmission imaging glass et al 2000 mumford et al 2009 niemet and selker 2001 selker et al 2007 and provides an integrated signal through a distance of approximately 14 grain diameters in the sand used here d50 0 713 mm a clear well on one side of the cell distributed the effluent flow while eight influent ports distributed the influent flow the ports were placed 1 cm from the bottom of the cell and spaced 3 3 cm apart for the remainder no clear well on the influent edge allowed injected gas to remain close to the influent edge representative of stray gas adjacent to the outside of a well casing the cell was sealed on the top using a hydrophobic neoprene gasket to provide a gas tight seal 2 2 sand emplacement gas injection and water flow the flow cell was packed using 20 30 accusil sand agsco corporation which has a median grain size of 0 713 mm schroth et al 1996 prior to packing the sand was washed in a three step process i with de ionized water to remove fines ii with 10 sodium hydroxide naoh solution and rinsed with distilled water until the supernatant returned to neutral ph and iii using 10 nitric acid hno3 solution and rinsed with distilled water until the supernatant returned to neutral ph following washing the sand was oven dried at 60 c for 48 h this procedure yee et al 2000 was used to remove any potential buffering capacity of the sand due to the presence of trace impurities washed sand was packed into the flow cell by continuously pouring as a wet slurry of sand and distilled water to promote a homogeneous pack without trapped atmospheric gases the cell was gently vibrated while the slurry was being poured to ensure reduced settlement after packing once the packing was complete the cell was allowed to settle for a minimum of 12 h and a small amount of additional sand was added to prevent a gap between the sand and the top seal sand packs were inspected for signs of bedding and were rejected if bedding was present a similar sand emplacement technique was used by mumford et al 2009 using the same sand and no gas pooling was observed during gas injection despite efforts to create a homogenous sand pack it is expected that gas injection patterns will produce local small scale differences in gas saturation due to pore scale heterogeneity glass et al 2000 ji et al 1993 mumford et al 2009 four gas injection and dissolution experiments were performed table 1 prior to gas injection 3 5 pore volumes of de ionized water dyed with either bromocresol green or resazurin were pumped through the cell to ensure uniform initial dye distribution co2 was selected as the surrogate gas in this study because it has a high acid ionization constant for a gas dissolves readily in water and is non explosive co2 gas was injected through the lowest edge port of flow cell on the influent side using a gas tight syringe at 0 25 ml s followed by the injection of 2 5 or 3 ml of dyed water using the same syringe to remove gas from the injection line injection of the total gas volume over 10 12 s limited dissolution of co2 during the injection such that dissolution could be investigated separate from gas migration the flow rate selected for these experiments was at the low end of flow rates reported for stray gas migration from 0 01 to 5000 m3 day using surface casing vent flow as a surrogate nowamooz et al 2015 this low flow rate was also selected so that gas movement was controlled by gravity and buoyancy but fast enough such that the injected gas spanned the height of the flow cell quickly to limit dissolution during the gas injection flow rates less than 1 6 ml s are expected to be unstable in this sand mumford et al 2009 following gas injection dyed bromocresol green or resazurin de ionized water was pumped masterflex l s 6 600rpm cartridge pump through the eight influent ports at 1 375 ml min providing a darcy flux of 6 3 m day the dye solution was sparged with ambient air to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere prepared at room temperature to prevent exsolution due to warming and the influent ph was monitored continuously accumet xl500 2 3 dye and colour space experiments b1 and r1 were performed to determine an appropriate ph indicator dye the success of an indicator dye at resolving the ph and therefore co2 concentration in space and time within the flow cell relies on its ability to span the expected ph values for co2 dissolution from 3 9 at its solubility limit 1 atm 25 c to 5 6 for distilled water in equilibrium with atmospheric co2 1 atm 25 c methyl red parker et al 2006 and bromocresol green kneafsey and pruess 2010 thomas et al 2015 have been used in previous studies which have ph ranges of 4 4 6 2 and 3 8 5 4 respectively neither of these dyes span the full range of interest limiting detection at higher or lower concentrations of co2 respectively an alternate dye resazurin with a ph range of 3 8 6 5 was also considered in this study preliminary tests conducted in gas tight vials filled with co2 gas and water showed flocculation of methyl red in water which could interfere with the image processing in this study therefore bromocresol green changes from blue to yellow and resazurin changes from purple to orange were selected for these experiments additional preliminary tests conducted in the flow cell showed minimal sorption of bromocresol green and resazurin to sand after the sand was washed as described above changes in the colour of the indicator dyes were assessed using the rgb red green blue hsv hue saturation value and ycbcr colour spaces although other spaces can also be used e g kashuk and iskander 2014 to evaluate the suitability of each colour space in this study images from experiments b1 and r1 were captured shortly after gas injection and once the dissolved co2 plume had travelled half the length of cell areas of these images that first contained no plume and then contained the plume were identified and histograms of each area for the nine colour components three components per colour space were compared experiments r2 and r3 were conducted as replicates of experiment r1 2 4 image capture and analysis light transmission images of each experiment were captured using a digital camera canon eos rebel t5i fitted with a canon efs 15 22 mm lens at a resolution of 2592 1728 pixels every 5 s canon eos utility software camera capture settings were set manually at iso400 f9 0 and a shutter speed of 1 60 which were selected by manual optimization focusing was performed automatically using the auto focus setting on the lens at the beginning of each test and manually held for the remainder of the test the cell was back lit by a led light bank ledgo lg 1200s and the flow cell light bank and camera were covered during the experiments to reduce the effects of ambient light images from each experiment were calibrated by injecting five pore volumes of tap water used in place of distilled water to provide buffering capacity titrated to a ph of 3 8 4 0 4 5 5 0 or 5 6 using sulfuric acid h2so4 to completely fill each sand pack prior to the start of the gas injection experiments images of the water saturated sand pack at each ph were used to develop an empirical calibration relationship because digital imaging was performed at a scale smaller than the average grain size each pixel represents approximately 0 17 0 17 mm2 the calibration images were analysed at different upscaled discretizations to determine the sensitivity of the calibration relationship to the scale of analysis specifically to determine if a single calibration relationship could be used for all locations in the flow cell in this analysis a mean local hue value see section 3 2 for a discussion of hue as the preferred colour component was calculated as the mean of 1 5002 pixels from the ph 5 0 calibration image of experiment r1 representative of all other ph calibration images given the pixels size of 0 17 mm 1 pixel represents an area of 0 03 mm2 while 5002 pixels represents an area of 7225 mm2 this was repeated at 1000 random locations at each discretization to generate 1000 mean local hue values and the variation between these local values and the mean over all 1000 local values was investigated images were processed using the image processing and statistic toolkits in matlab r2016a and were processed in uncompressed format to preserve all captured image data raw rgb images were separated into separate rgb hsv or ycbcr components using matlab functions for experiments with resazurin dye which changes colour from purple to orange hue values were rotated by 180 such that they did not include both 1 and 359 following analysis of each colour component hue ph calibration relationships were developed and used to determine the total dissolved co2 concentration based on carbonate equilibrium as 1 c t 10 2 p h 10 p k a 1 10 p h where ct is the total dissolved co2 concentration and pka 1 is 6 352 at 25 c butler 1991 eq 1 is a simplification of the fourth order representation of the carbonate system based on ph pka 1 where the total concentration of co2 would be mainly comprised of h2co3 and hco3 because of the small thickness of the cell it was assumed that the total dissolved co2 concentrations varied in space but were uniform over the thickness of the cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 gas injection and dissolution example images from experiments b1 and r1 representative of r2 and r3 are shown in fig 2 immediately following co2 gas injection in each experiment injected in the bottom left corner of the images in fig 2 the gas travelled vertically to a height of 20 22 cm above the injection port fig 2a and f this vertical distance was limited by the injected gas volume which was selected to avoid contact with the flow cell lid the resulting gas fingers appeared to be discontinuous with gas trapped throughout the vertical extent of the fingers as expected due to gravity destabilized conditions and as observed during previous gas injections in this sand mumford et al 2009 emphasizing that gas movement was capillary gravity controlled in some experiments the gas injection was approximately parabolic in shape and deviated away from the injection port with increasing height in all experiments the trapped gas was limited to a region less than 5 cm laterally away from the influent face the dissolution of trapped gas produced a local colour change from green to yellow in experiment b1 fig 2b and from purple to orange in experiments r1 r3 fig 2f due to the acidification of the pore water immediately adjacent to the gas horizontal water flow was initiated at 20 s and the colour change extended to the right hand side of the flow cell as the dissolved co2 plume was transported in the direction of flow fig 2b d and f h the colour change appeared most substantial at early time when the bulk of the co2 mass from the gas phase dissolved as dissolution progressed plume fingering occurred fig 2c d g and h but became less pronounced at later time due to lateral dispersion regions of higher co2 concentrations larger colour change appeared to be spatially correlated to regions of higher gas saturation darker initial intensity during gas injection at later time tailing of the plume was observed as the trapped co2 gas was depleted with fingers of acidified indicator colour persisting as the colour returned to the pre injection conditions tailing was particularly pronounced in line with the gas injection port until the end of the experiment fig 2d and h although these experiments were not designed to measure gas saturations the darker intensity indicative of higher gas saturations was sustained throughout the experiment indicating persistence of a gas phase this was despite the colour in the flow cell having returned to pre injection conditions indicating depletion of the co2 gas this is consistent with multi component partitioning where co2 transfers out of the gas phase but o2 and n2 from the influent water transfer in sustaining the gas saturations geistlinger et al 2005 mumford et al 2010 3 2 dye and colour space selection the selection of suitable dyes and colour spaces for mapping dissolved co2 concentrations was based on the results from experiments b1 and r1 a 412 88 pixel 7 1 5 cm2 section was selected from images collected 10 s and 700 s after gas injection in which the co2 plume was not or was present respectively fig 2 a histogram of the 36 256 pixel values was then created for each of the nine separate colour components of the rgb hsv and ycbcr colour spaces for bromocresol green fig 3 and resazurin fig 4 for a colour component to be a viable signal the histograms for when a plume is present and not present should be distinct i e clear peak separation and little overlap each histogram also needs to show a sharp unimodal peak as a tailing effect or multiple peaks can indicate limitations in calibration and dye stability over expected ph ranges to choose between the nine colour components both the peak separation and overlap the area of the overlapping histograms expressed as a fraction of the 36 256 total pixels was determined table 2 all histograms showed a unimodal signal for of each component however the separation and overlap of the peaks varied between components table 2 the colour component red used with resazurin and hue used with both bromocresol green and resazurin were the most promising with the three lowest overlaps and three highest peak separations the red component with resazurin showed relatively separate peaks 0 15 hue units however a higher degree of overlap compared to the other two combinations fig 4a the hue component with bromocresol green fig 3d showed a large separation between peaks 0 35 hue units and only 2 8 overlap however a large tailing effect in the signal was seen when the plume was present which overlapped with a non present plume this tailing is the effect of the limitations in the dye at resolving low ph values 4 4 in comparison the hue component for resazurin showed two distinct peaks separated by 0 25 hue units with only 0 6 overlap of histograms fig 4d based on this analysis the use of resazurin as the indicator dye coupled with the use of the hue colour component was determined to be the most suitable for resolving concentrations of dissolved co2 and was used for all remaining analyses it is important to note that this selection was based on the investigation of the aqueous phase only and other signals may be more helpful for quantification of the gas phase 3 3 discretization analysis this technique was developed to investigate flow processes near the grain size of medium to coarse sand therefore a discretization analysis was performed by 1 calculation of the difference between the mean local hue values at different discretizations to the average of all mean local hue values at that specific discretization section 2 4 and 2 qualitative inspection of key plume features at different discretizations the first analysis was performed on the ph 5 0 calibration image of experiment r1 using between 1 and 5002 pixels results from each of the 1000 realizations at each discretization are shown as symbols in fig 5 along with dashed lines representing the 95 confidence interval fig 5 shows that at the pixel scale 0 17 mm resolution there is large variation in the hue values due to variation in grain colour and lighting changes near the edge of the cell and local hue values can differ from the mean value of the entire flow cell however as the coarseness of discretization is increased the difference between the local and global is reduced until it reaches nearly zero 0 0002 at a resolution of 85 mm the confidence interval shown in fig 5 can be used to estimate the upper bound of the error for a single local hue measurement at a specific discretization the second analysis was performed on the hue image of experiment r1 at 700 s at varying discretizations in order to assess the level of detail observed in the plume fig 6 a very fine discretization 1 mm shows dissolution fingers at multiple locations with heights of 1 cm and greater fig 6b however these characteristics are lost as the discretization size increases above 1 mm fig 6c and d the differences between mean local hue value and global average of the mean local hue values fig 5 demonstrates that a single hue ph calibration relationship developed using a mean value over the entire cell would not accurately represent local dissolved co2 concentrations local calibration relationships developed at the resolution of interest would be necessary to resolve co2 concentrations accurately particularly because the resolution of local concentrations is required to investigate plume fingers fig 6 therefore one must consider both minimizing the error coarser resolution and balancing the level of detail which can be observed in an experiment finer resolution for the purposes of this study it was decided based on the preceding analysis that a 1 mm discretization and local calibration would be used this would provide the ability to draw conclusions about the plume development pathway geometry and longevity 3 4 calibration relationship unique hue ph calibration relationships were developed from each of experiments r1 r3 due to variations in lighting and distance of separation between the camera and the flow cell at a resolution of 1 mm an example calibration relationship is shown in fig 7 a at a resolution of 1 mm 36 pixel scale hue values were used to calculate the mean hue value at that location for each of the five ph values used for calibration 180 total data points and the 95 confidence limit of the second order polynomial fit to the calibration data is based on the variability of these data uncertainty in estimated local ph values during each experiment are therefore based on both this uncertainty in the calibration relationship as well as variation in hue over the 1 mm 1 mm measurement area for example fig 7a shows the upper and lower limits of a mean local measured hue value of 0 30 0 01 2 standard deviations and their intersection with the confidence limits of the calibration relationship which gives a calibrated ph of 5 38 5 47 this uncertainty is a function of ph due to the non linear calibration therefore a greater value of hue with the same measurement error results in greater uncertainty in ph for example a hue of 0 41 0 01 gives a calibrated ph of 4 55 4 94 to determine the influence of this uncertainty on estimated dissolved co2 concentrations the same data are plotted against the co2 concentration in fig 7b based on eq 1 because of this log relationship and the non linear hue ph calibration there is greater uncertainty at higher dissolved co2 concentrations for example using the same data as above a hue value of 0 31 0 01 corresponds to an estimated co2 concentration of 0 043 0 029 mmol l while a hue value of 0 41 0 01 corresponds to an estimated co2 concentration of 1 814 0 308 mmol l this uncertainty must be considered when interpreting estimated co2 concentrations following gas injection and dissolution using this technique particularly because the highest concentrations are the most uncertain 3 5 dissolved co2 concentrations images from experiment r1 processed from raw images using hue ph calibration e g fig 7a d and hue total co2 concentration e g fig 7e h are shown in fig 8 as observed in fig 2e h these images show the development of the dissolved co2 plume following dissolution from the injected free gas phase the movement of the plume front and the plume tail and detachment from the gas phase concentrations near solubility occur immediately following gas injection and are then decreased due to dispersion and depletion of co2 from the gas phase at later times the concentration is sustained longer at the gas injection location than towards the upper extent of the injected gas likely due to higher gas saturations near the injection point as a result of viscous forces during gas injection selker et al 2007 as the gaseous co2 dissolves into the pore water the development of dissolved phase co2 fingers was observed this fingering is related to local areas of higher gaseous co2 saturation produced during injection by local heterogeneity and gravity capillary controlled gas flow fingering was observed in all injections performed do to the steeper slope of the calibration curve at lower total co2 concentrations fig 7b the front of the plume appears distinct however higher concentrations at the core of the plume fingers are sensitive to small changes in hue resolved co2 concentrations fig 8 were used to determine the co2 mass balance for each of experiments r1 r3 breakthrough curves were developed at every vertical location using mean values at a 1 mm resolution at a horizontal location approximately 0 5 cm from the injected gas this location varied between 4 and 6 cm from the influent edge of the flow cell due to different pathways followed by the injected gas in each of the experiments each of the breakthrough curves using images taken every 5 s at 250 vertical locations were integrated to estimate the dissolved co2 mass which was compared to the mass of co2 injected table 3 based on the ideal gas law for a temperature of 25 c and a pressure of 104 kpa it is important to note that while ideal gas law is appropriate for these laboratory conditions and shallow aquifers it may not be suitable for deeper applications mean ratios of the breakthrough mass to the injected mass range from 0 72 to 1 23 these estimates are uncertain with a range as low as 0 37 and as high as 2 75 across all experiments table 2 this is due primarily to uncertainty associated with the highest concentrations in the dissolved co2 plume section 3 4 in all of experiments r1 r3 the 95 confidence interval spanned a ratio of 1 table 3 demonstrating that the mass balance was not significantly different than 100 however this is due to the width of the uncertainty and further research is required to improve the precision at high total co2 concentrations 3 6 potential implications for stray gas migration the results of these co2 gas injection and dissolution experiments analysed using the laboratory technique developed here can serve as a surrogate for stray gas migration and dissolution in shallow homogeneous aquifers they demonstrated key characteristics for consideration first the combination of gravity and capillary forces during gas migration created local areas of high and low gas saturations and gas was mobilized laterally away from the injection point this behaviour will be more pronounced with increased heterogeneity with gas able to pool and spread beneath capillary barriers second this variable initial gas saturation led to a non uniform concentration front plume fingers which are also expected to be more prominent in more heterogeneous media due to both the distribution of gas and the presence of higher permeability flow pathways these plume fingers could complicate the detection of dissolved gas at stray gas sites particularly where trapping and dissolution below low permeability layers suppresses any ground surface expression of the gas migration e g vegetation stress gas flux measurements bubbling in pooled water third multi component mass transfer led to the prolonged presence of the gas phase despite depletion of co2 from the injected gas this is important for both modelling of these systems where multiple dissolved gas species control gas saturation and in turn mass transfer and relative permeability and for detection and monitoring where detection of gas phase is not synonymous with detection of a particular component such as methane 4 conclusions a novel visualization technique was developed to quantify dissolved gas concentrations following dissolution from a trapped gas phase the technique was tested using replicate injections of co2 gas into initially water saturated porous media the results showed that using light transmission visualization combined with resazurin ph indicator and the hue colour component calibrated to ph can facilitate qualitative observations of gas dissolution and dissolved gas transport these observations could be made at a spatial resolution as fine as 1 mm provided that local calibration relationships at the same resolution were employed resazurin indicator combined with the hue colour component provided both greater peak separation and less overlap than the histograms of other colour components in the rgb hsv or ycbcr colour spaces using resazurin or bromocresol green observations facilitated by this technique included relationships between gas migration patterns and plume geometry plume fingers the longevity of the gas source and its variability over the injected gas distribution and dispersion of the dissolved gas in addition results demonstrated the potential to quantify dissolved gas concentrations at this fine resolution with mass balances of 72 102 and 123 across triplicate experiments however the non linear hue total co2 calibration relationship resulted in greater uncertainty at higher dissolved concentrations which led to uncertainty in the mass balance than at lower dissolved concentrations which enabled high resolution of the plume front although not explored in this study it is believed that the proposed technique could be used for experimental applications at higher pressures for example co2 sequestration application at higher pressures would require further consideration of solubility effects on the choice of dye and calibration of the images the results of these gas injection experiments show important implications with respect to the conceptual model and underlying physics of stray gas migration in shallow groundwater systems from energy development stray gas problems are expected to be complex and will be affected by gas dynamics multi component gas water mass transfer across evolving fluid fluid interfaces changes in relative permeability and the overriding influence of geologic heterogeneity these are in addition to subsequent migration from the saturated zone to the vadose zone and biogeochemical reactions associated with natural gas components these experiments demonstrated that the conceptual models for stray gas migration and numerical models developed based on those concepts should account for gravity and capillary forces that dominate the upward gas migration as observed in other gas flow applications in porous media resulting in narrow gas fingers with local gas trapping controlled by small scale heterogeneity however observations also suggest that the influence of viscous forces on the distribution of gas near a leak location seen here as the local trapping of gas near the injection point and prolonged dissolution of co2 into the plume may need to be considered in the assessment of stray gas and its dissolution these results also demonstrated that conceptual and numerical models should account for multi component mass transfer in assessing the effects stray gas which can alter gas and water flow and prolong the longevity of a stray gas source and the dissolved concentrations of compounds of interest further research is required to incorporate these coupled processes into the conceptual and numerical models for stray gas migration to help develop improved monitoring and remedial techniques and establish best practices for risk management acknowledgements this research was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research

823,lateral cavities are built in the banks of rivers for several purposes to create harbors to capture sediment to keep a central navigable channel i e casiers de girardon in the rhone river or to promote the formation of aquatic habitats if a limited amount of sediment is captured providing hydraulic and morphologic diversity i e the case of japanese wandos this work is focused on this latter purpose promotion of hydraulic and morphologic diversity in these scenarios an increase in the flow discharge in the main channel may however re mobilize the deposit of sediment inside these lateral embayments and cause a sudden increase of the sediment concentration and turbidity in the main channel it is thus of interest to characterize the resistance and resilience of these sedimentary deposits when the main channel is subjected to high flow or flushing events laboratory tests were carried out for five different normalized geometries of the cavities installed in the banks of an open channel and for five hydrographs with different levels of unsteadiness water depth sediment deposit mass sediment concentration and area covered by the settled sediments were recorded throughout each experiment although sediment deposits established at equilibrium before the flushing events are different depending on the geometry of the cavities generally they are recovered after being flushed by the high flow events it is shown that the resistance and resilience of the sediment deposits are strongly dependent on the flow field and the mass exchange between the main channel and the cavities this mass exchange is governed by the geometry of the cavities and the magnitude of the hydrographs applied keywords river embayments macro roughness lateral elements fine sediment unsteady flow hydropeaking seasonal flows groyne 1 introduction throughout history rivers have been channelized to prevent flood hazards or to gain land for social and economic development this human intervention has disrupted the quasi natural equilibrium between the incoming and outcoming fluxes of sediments leading to deficit or excess situations allan and castillo 2007 schleiss et al 2016 this unbalanced sediment equilibrium has led to a twofold morphological response bed erosion and collapse of riverbanks in areas with sediment deficit and strong deposition and clogging in areas with sediment excess from an ecological point of view the disruption of the sediment cycle has important consequences fine suspended sediments in particular are transportation vectors of nutrients essential for riparian ecosystems von bertrab et al 2013 wood and armitage 1997 and they also fixate and trap organic carbon making them relevant to the carbon cycle boix fayos et al 2015 channelized rivers often display a straight path and monotonous banks a measure to promote morphology diversity of river banks is to create lateral embayments or cavities that behave as bank macro roughness elements in cavity sediment deposition is thus observed this contributes to the creation of areas with differentiated velocities that have potential as fish and plant habitats kemp et al 2011 ribi et al 2014 wood and armitage 1997 the wetlands created by the settlement of sediments in these cavities also serve as shelter areas for the biota when flooding events occur in rivers ribi et al 2014 in japan these lateral embayments so called wandos are areas considered to have ecological importance for fish spawning and nurseries nezu and onitsuka 2002 uno et al 2013 within this frame of river bank embayments built for fostering morphology and biota diversity groyne fields are not considered in this work groyne fields are geometrically different they penetrate more into the main channel and the distance between neighboring groynes is larger than in the case of just lateral embayments furthermore groynes are mainly conceived as hydraulic elements that maintain the main channel at a sufficient depth i e navigable qin et al 2017 sukhodolov 2014 sukhodolov et al 2002 weitbrecht et al 2008 yossef and de vriend 2010 the vortex shedding originated at the tips of the groynes prevents mass exchange between the main channel and the lateral embayments mccoy et al 2008 the study of shallow lateral embayments has received attention in recent last years akutina 2015 meile et al 2011a mignot et al 2016 rivière et al 2010 uijttewaal 2014 nevertheless most of these earlier works were focused on the study of i hydrodynamic patterns and ii mass and momentum exchange generated between the main flow and the lateral cavities however none of the above mentioned experimental studies were devoted to analyzing the dynamics of suspended sediment transport in these flows with lateral cavities the transport of sediment in suspension is primarily governed by the balance between the so called turbulent diffusion and the settling of the submerged particles van rijn 2007b by creating regions with lower turbulence levels that nevertheless allow exchange of mass with the main channel the lateral cavities can capture and retain a limited amount of fine sediment transported in suspension in the main channel in juez et al 2017 the transport of suspended sediment by a uniform flow in a channel with lateral rectangular roughness elements was experimentally studied laboratory tests carried out for constant flowrates covered a range of flow shallowness ratios cavity geometric ratios and initial sediment concentrations asymptotic results obtained at equilibrium conditions were discussed regarding the ability of the lateral embayment to be filled partially or totally by sediment and at which rate a follow up question from this previous study is how stable permanent these sediment deposits are that is whether they will be flushed away by an increase of flow discharge in the main channel or whether they will remain this fact is crucial in natural channel networks since they are subjected to flow fluctuations that control the sediment dynamics these flow fluctuations may have the following i a natural origin i e the seasonal flow patterns poff et al 1997 or ii an anthropogenic origin such as those caused by the release of a powerhouse outflow for producing electricity so called hydropeaking meile et al 2011b it is also expected that climate modification more random and intense precipitation schumm 2005 and glacier retreat riihimaki et al 2005 and changes in land use more urbanized and agricultural areas karl 2003 may cause a less visible but continuous variation of the unsteady flow regime of the rivers hauer et al 2012 several studies have been carried out in the past related to the mitigation of the effects of flow fluctuations in rivers regarding sediment patterns lana renault and regués 2009 hydropower operation models meile et al 2011b hydraulic magnitudes wet areas water levels and shear stress spiller et al 2015 and riparian vegetation fishes and macroinvertebrates cereghino et al 2002 person et al 2014 it is known that macroinvertebrates and aquatic plants are impacted and undergo major stress in the case of either natural or anthropic flowrate variations without appropriate sheltering the water level fluctuations can affect the over wintering survival of the fishes scruton et al 2003 and the over day survival of the fishes in the case of hydropeaking in the river reach person et al 2014 ribi et al 2014 thus if most of the fine material trapped inside the lateral cavities is re mobilized during an episode of high discharge this may lead to an increase of the turbidity level in the main channel water which can hinder fish visibility and thus impair visual feeding behavior and fish spawning by clogging the river bed causing zoobenthos scouring blettler et al 2015 sternecker et al 2013 the general objective of the present research is to analyze the resistance sensitivity to disruption and resilience recovery from disruption of the fine sediment deposits in open channel lateral cavities when subjected to an increase in the flow discharge of the main channel systematic experimental tests were carried out with five hydrographs with different unsteadiness degrees for five different normalized geometries of the cavities installed in the banks of an open channel as in juez et al 2017 the experiments were initialized with a base uniform flow conveying sediment in suspension no deposition in the main channel was allowed once a morphodynamic equilibrium condition was achieved inside the cavities stable deposits of fine sediment different high flow events were applied after the high flow which lasted for a period that was variable for each unsteadiness scenario the initial base flow was again imposed in the channel two research questions were addressed the first concerns to which degree the sediment deposits within the cavity resist fully or partially the high flow event this is quantified by the amount of sediment that is re mobilized by the hydrograph the resistance of the sediment deposits depends on the geometry of the cavities relative to the flow unsteadiness of each different hydrograph i e the sheltering effect of the lateral cavity the second question regards the reversibility of the process depending on the re mobilization and on the shelter condition offered by the cavity we analyzed the recovery time of the sediment deposits within the cavity to re establish initial equilibrium morphological patterns 2 experimental setup 2 1 flume description experiments were performed

sediment ii a rectangular 7 5 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 0 m high open channel with a 0 1 slope and iii a downstream tank 3 5 m long 1 m wide and 1 m high that collected the circulating flow the water was pumped from the downstream to the upstream tank the pipe system was equipped with a valve to control the discharge and a flowmeter the channel bottom was smooth and made of painted wood lateral walls were made of glass two mixing systems downstream and upstream from the channel were used to avoid sedimentation downstream from the channel a venetian gate allowed flow depth control in the channel the channel was wide enough to prevent interactions between the symmetrical lateral channel banks a sketch of the experimental setup with these elements is shown in fig 1 2 2 lateral embayment configurations as shown in fig 1 the base channel banks were modified by adding concrete bricks 0 25 m long 0 10 m wide and 0 19 m high to the lateral walls this allowed different lateral embayment configurations to be built see fig 2 as in meile et al 2011a b and juez et al 2017 the lateral cavities were characterized by the length of the cavity l the distance between two cavities l and the lateral depth of the cavities w see fig 2 the combination of these characteristics lengths together with the channel width led to the definition of several geometrical ratios cavity aspect ratio a r w l roughness ratio r r w l and expansion ratio e r b 2 w b the height of the bricks composing the lateral embayment configurations was sufficient to avoid their overflow the lateral embayments correspond to lateral cavities built in the banks of a river reach therefore they had the same height as the river banks and consequently for flow fluctuations which are not extreme events the water remained within the channel without overflowing the lateral embayment configurations tested in this work were based on a prior experimental study carried out by the authors in juez et al 2017 five geometric configurations with high cavity aspect and expansion ratio were chosen due to their favorable behavior for river restoration projects the flow patterns in these embayment configurations fostered partial filling of the cavities with sediments thereby promoting areas with hydraulic and morphology diversity with low and high velocities which are suitable for aquatic biota the five tested lateral embayment configurations are displayed in fig 2 the relation between the geometric configurations herein tested fig 2 and those tested in juez et al 2017 is the following configurations 1 5 in fig 2 correspond to configurations 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 and 2 1 in meile et al 2011a depending on the geometry of the lateral embayments the flow through an open channel with lateral macro roughness may be of three different types skimming normal and reattached see meile et al 2011a the configurations tested in this work belong to the normal recirculating flow type configurations 1 4 and skimming flow type configuration 5 the reattached flow type configuration is not considered in this study since its impact on the trapping of fine sediments is limited due to the low lateral depth of the cavities w 2 3 experimental flow conditions a uniform flow condition of 4 8 l s was imposed as an initial low base flow for all experiments this base flow was imposed until a quasi equilibrium sediment concentration value in the main channel was reached i e 3 h after the beginning of the experiments the initial concentration was set to 0 5 g l this initial concentration was chosen to meet the maximal transport capacity of the flow in the central channel to transport the sediments in suspension i e neither bedload transport nor deposition was allowed in the central channel the concentration recorded by the two turbidimeters converged asymptotically to a lower final value due to the trapping effect of the lateral macro roughness elements the sediment conveyed in suspension within the flow was polyurethane the grain size of the sediment was characterized by d 50 0 2 mm with a density equal to 1160 kg m3 and a coefficient of uniformity equal to 0 47 the mean particle diameter was chosen to be in the range of non cohesive fine sediment 0 062 0 5 mm according to van rijn 2007a and following the grain size of sediment that can be found in suspension in alpine rivers federal office of environment 2016 the artificial nature of these sediments was preferred to natural material to avoid biofilm growth during the experiments which favors cohesion among particles five different high flow events corresponding to different unsteadiness degrees were tested for each cavity configuration see fig 3 the unsteadiness scenarios differed i in duration of the hydrograph the disruption phase in hydrographs l2 and h2 lasts twice as long as the hydrographs l1 and h1 ii in the maximum flowrate for hydrographs l1 and l2 is 8 5 l s and for hydrographs h1 h2 and s1 is 15 0 l s this corresponds to common hydropeaking of two to three times the base flow as observed in alpine rivers federal office of environment 2016 and iii in the rate of flow variation sudden or gradual with a rate of 0 34 l s min the volume of water released with the gradual rate hydrograph s1 is the same as that with immediate variation hydrograph h1 and both hydrographs have the same flowrate magnitude after the high flow event the channel was water worked additionally for two hours to study the morphological response of the system during the recovery time during this period the initial uniform flow condition of 4 8 l s was imposed table 1 displays the hydrodynamic variables corresponding to each phase of the tests the flow is fully turbulent and sub critical for all experiments the maximum flowrates applied in each scenario were chosen by keeping in mind that the relation between the water height h and the channel width b of b h should be between 7 2 and 17 3 to keep the flow shallow in the main channel the suspension criteria were doubly guaranteed first the rouse number was always below 0 8 which implies that the suspended load was the dominant sediment transport mechanism second the ratio between the friction velocity v and the settling velocity vs computed as in zanke 1977 was always above 2 5 which also means that suspended transport was fully dominant within the flow yossef and de vriend 2010 the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the experiments represent a generic 1 40 model froude similarity of an alpine river thus the laboratory model is equivalent to a prototype river reach with i a 20 m width water heights ranging between 1 4 and 2 8 m depending on the discharge and the same bed slope 0 1 ii velocities ranging between 1 43 and 2 24 m s depending on the discharge iii discharges ranging between 48 and 151 m3 s and iv the temporal duration of the hydrograph ranging between 6 and 12 h for scaling the suspended load transport two possibilities exist the first possibility consists of applying the geometrical similarity to the grain size of the prototype i e d 50 200 µm as found in suspension in alpine rivers however this results in very small sediment d 50 m o d e l 3 33 µm with the risk of cohesion among particles the second possibility and the one chosen in this work consists of using a reduced density that reduces the settling velocity while maintaining the grain size gorrick and rodríguez 2014 table 2 displays the unsteadiness parameters p of each high flow event referred to the central channel width i e without lateral embayments the parameter p was computed with the formula proposed by graf and suszka 1985 which characterizes the unsteadiness of the flow by the ratio of the change in flow depth δh and by the hydrograph duration th multiplied by the shear velocity of the base flow u 0 p δ h u 0 t h the values of unsteadiness parameters agree with those observed in the alpine rivers federal office of environment 2016 at several hydropower plants due to hydropeaking high flow events h1 and l1 present higher levels of unsteadiness compared with h2 and l2 2 4 measurement techniques during preliminary tests an ultrasonic probe mounted in a trolley was used to record the water level in the center of the channel along the channel length this was performed for the initial discharge considered for the tests 4 8 l s the flow uniform conditions were guaranteed for the initial and recovery phase of each hydrograph scenario furthermore during the actual experiments the water level was continuously measured along the experiments with a frequency of 10 hz this time the probe was fixed and was located in the middle of the channel longitudinally and transversally in juez et al 2017 the 2d surface piv technique was applied to the same geometric configuration herein tested this piv technique consisted of tracking the position of floating particles with a camera filming from the top at a frequency of 30 hz based on this information the velocity field of the surface flow inside the cavities was then computed for three different steady flowrates such flowrates correspond to the low base flow 4 8 l s and to the peak flows considered in the high flow events 8 5 l s and 15 l s the temporal evolution of the suspended sediment concentration was recorded upstream turbidimeter t1 and downstream turbidimeter t2 in the channel by two cosmos 25 turbidimeters see fig 2 for positions an adaptation length was chosen between the channel inlet and turbidimeter t1 see fig 2 to avoid any perturbation in the measurements due to the upstream boundary conditions in addition the signal was sampled every 100 ms conversely in preliminary tests the vertical sediment concentration profile was measured at the location of t1 several repetitions were carried out to guarantee that the sediment adding and mixing process could be repeated to always obtain the same inflow concentration profile this level of repeatability is further illustrated in fig 6 where for each configuration and regardless of the hydrograph scenario the sediment decay for the first 3 h of base flow is almost identical furthermore plan view photos of the sedimentation patterns were captured in a cavity placed between the two turbidimeters see fig 2 these photos were subsequently treated to extract the surface occupied by the sediments along time finally at the end of the tests the total sediment mass trapped inside the lateral embayments was collected and dried in an oven to determine the dry weight this mass was divided by the total area occupied by the embayments to compute the trapping efficiency in mass per area for each configuration 3 results 3 1 surface flow patterns to measure the surface flow patterns in the lateral cavities for the three flowrates of the applied hydrograph scenarios i e 4 8 8 5 and 15 0 l s see fig 3 a large scale piv technique was used juez et al 2017 fig 4 displays the fields of time averaged transversal velocity v and the mean vorticity defined as ω v x u y results are available for the cavity and for the adjacent area of the main channel to help in the visualization of the in cavity flow patterns the averaged streamwise velocity of the main channel was subtracted from the velocity fields furthermore the algorithm used to estimate the spatial derivatives in the definition of the vorticity is the one proposed by sj and cowen 2004 for a quadrangular grid of a size ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 mm dimensionless coordinates are used to characterize the cavity geometry in the figures x l denotes the longitudinal direction and y l is the transversal direction both normalized by the length of the cavity l cf fig 2 in the dashed areas no information was available for performing piv computations the patterns of transversal time averaged velocity show that for all geometries and flowrates a main recirculation eddy appears mre in the cavity its center is placed downstream of the center of the cavity a dead area da is located at the inner upstream wall of the embayment both hydraulic regions mre and da are the primary regions where in cavity sedimentation occurs velocity fields display higher values at the channel cavity interface for configurations 1 2 and 5 for configurations 3 and 4 corresponding to the highest roughness ratio rr the velocities are lower the vorticity field observed corresponds to the shear between the main recirculating eddy mre and i the inner walls of the cavity and ii the flow of the main channel higher values of vorticity in the vicinity of the lateral boundary layer and in the shear layer between the main channel and the cavity indicate that in these regions higher turbulent energy production may be verified the vorticity field helps in understanding how sediment is captured into the cavity sediments mainly settle in dead water areas da and in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre the first is related to low velocity which favors the deposition of sediment the second is linked with the teacup effect near the bottom the streamlines are more easily curved less inertial than the streamlines at the surface tuna et al 2013 as a result of the teacup effect the sediment is trapped and eventually settles in the center of the mre for the specific conditions of the experiments the sign of the vorticity in this region is negative 3 2 sediment trapped at the end of the experiment the sediment mass trapped inside the lateral embayments at the end of the experiments recovery phase was collected dried and weighed this mass corresponds to equilibrium conditions after the deposit morphology reached a stable configuration it is worth mentioning that the in cavity sediment deposit height was small ranging from 0 2 cm configuration 2 to 0 7 cm configuration 5 therefore the sediment deposits did not significantly affect the in cavity flow dynamics the mass trapped by the lateral embayments was divided by the total area of these embayments to compute the trapping efficiency for each geometric configuration and each high flow event fig 5 displays this trapping efficiency along the channel configuration 5 presents the highest trapping efficiency followed by configuration 1 these geometric configurations correspond to the lower values of the roughness ratio r r w l trapping of sediment decreases with decreasing roughness ratio in all configurations there is a clear influence of the inlet and outlet of the channel that is mass trapped in the first and last cavities 3 3 entrainment coefficient to investigate the morphological resilience of fine sediment deposits in bank lateral cavities exchange processes between the main channel and the cavities and for the different phases of the hydrograph scenarios were calculated to this end the classical first order cavity model approach proposed by valentine and wood 1979 was considered this model was primarily developed to analyze the dynamics of a pollution cloud in the presence of lateral cavities it stated that the temporal evolution of the concentration in the lateral cavity cc is related to the exchange between the main channel and the cavity analogously it is possible to define the temporal evolution of the sediment concentration in the main channel cm assuming that the sediment deposition occurs only in the lateral cavities as in our set of experiments 1 d c m d t k m c c c c m where k m c 1 time is the ratio between the exchanged volume per unit time provided by the main channel q m c and the lateral cavity volume vc 2 k m c q m c v c l h e e n p l w h c n p where l is the length of the cavity he is the water height at the entrance of the cavity e is an exchange velocity w is the width of the cavity np is the number of cavities present in the main channel and hc is the water depth within the cavity the bottom level of the main channel and of the in cavity area was the same in our experiments and we considered only a unique water height for both regions h e h c valentine and wood 1979 proposed the normalization of the exchange velocity e by the mean velocity of the main channel um resulting in the definition of a dimensionless entrainment coefficient k 3 k e u m substituting eq 3 into 2 and 2 into 1 a general dead zone mass conservation equation is obtained 4 d c m d t k u m w c c c m w h e r e k m c k u m w k m c thus represents the slope of the concentration decay 1 time and the dimensional exchange coefficient between the main channel and the cavity in addition it is related to its dimensionless counterpart k with the above set of equations in mind and following weitbrecht et al 2008 and mignot et al 2017 two methods were considered for determining the entrainment coefficient k from experiments first by means of the piv results and second by means of the sediment concentration records collected throughout the experiments in the main channel the surface piv measurements allow the entrainment coefficient k to be directly determined since the exchange velocity e is known the instantaneous exchange velocity along the length of the cavity is computed by integrating the absolute value of the instantaneous transversal velocity v the absolute value of the instantaneous transversal velocity derives from the fact that the instantaneous exchange velocity e collects the information of the fluxes entering and leaving the cavity in addition it is assumed that the flux entering the cavity is equal to the flux reintegrating with the main channel as a result the integral is divided by 2 therefore the instantaneous exchange velocity e is written as 5 e 1 2 l 0 l v d x the following step consisted of time averaging the instantaneous exchange velocity 500 values of e corresponding to 500 time steps a time averaged value was thus obtained e substituting this value into eq 3 the entrainment coefficient kpiv was then given k p i v e u m table 3 provides the kpiv values for the initial and disruption phases of the applied hydrograph scenarios values for the recovery phase are not included since the flowrate in this phase is the same as that in the initial phase i e the kpiv value does not change between the initial and recovery phases this was checked on the basis of flow velocity measurements the second method for determining the entrainment coefficient relies on the analysis of the sediment concentration decay recorded through the experiments by means of two turbidimeters see fig 6 the information provided by the turbidimeters was punctual and corresponds to a value in the vertical concentration profile it was experimentally verified that the chosen vertical position of the turbidimeter ensured that the measured values correspond roughly to the averaged concentration of the vertical profile for the given initial conditions i e sediment concentration of 0 5 g l and flowrate of 4 8 l s the vertical concentration profile was measured previously with a turbidimeter the averaged value of both turbidimeters was analyzed data were normalized by the initial concentration of the experiments c 0 0 5 g l the experiment was initialized with 3 h of base low discharge by the end of this period the channel asymptotically reached a morphological equilibrium state in which the observed changes in suspended sediment concentrations and in sediment deposits inside the cavities were marginal the sediment deposits were periodically measured during the runs with vertical rulers attached to the glass of the flume the subsequent disruption phase forced the total or partial re mobilization of the sediment trapped within the cavities this led to an increase of the suspended sediment concentration in the main channel finally the channel was brought to a new morphological equilibrium state by recovering the initial base low flowrate and consequently a new decay of the sediment concentration was measured sediment concentration data were fitted by an exponential decay of the first order for each phase of the hydrograph applied initial disruption and recovery it was thus possible to linearize the sediment concentration results and link them with the dimensional exchange coefficient k m c which represents the slope of the decay see eq 4 therefore the entrainment coefficient derived from the concentration analysis kca was computed for each of the three phases of the hydrograph as shown in eq 4 k c a w k m c u m as an example fig 7 left side displays the temporal sediment concentration decay averaged value of the two turbidimeters for configuration 3 and hydrograph scenario s1 in addition fig 7 right side shows the linear fit of the exponential decay of the normalized sediment concentration in the main channel for the initial phase of the experiments and the actual values of the measured concentration sediment concentration data related to the beginning of the disruption phase sudden increase of the concentration values were not included in this analysis since the purpose is to determine the sediment transfer from the main channel to the cavities the linear fit was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level with correspondingly high r 2 values r 2 0 99 table 3 includes the kca values for each phase of the applied hydrograph scenarios table 3 also includes the measured entrainment coefficient values kme for the recovery phase the direct method for determining these coefficients was based on collecting drying and weighing the sediment mass trapped inside the lateral cavities ms at the end of the experiments this mass was divided by the total area of the lateral embayments in the channel wlnp the density of the sediments ρs and the mean velocity of the channel um a mean residence time was thus obtained which can also be interpreted as the inverse of the exchange coefficient k m c previously defined in 4 this arrangement allowed the measured entrainment coefficient for the recovery phase to be obtained as 6 k m e m c m s w l n p ρ s u m 1 a n d k m e w k m e m c u m the range of values for the entrainment coefficients displayed in table 3 0 003 0 045 are in good agreement with previous experiments carried out by different researchers mignot et al 2017 tuna et al 2013 valentine and wood 1979 weitbrecht et al 2008 3 4 areas of sediment deposition fig 9 displays the time evolution of the area covered by the sediments a p normalized by the area of the cavity a 0 a a p a 0 during the initial phase and for all geometric configurations the sediment deposits build up quickly until a stable configuration is reached the normalized equilibrium areas of sediment deposits are different depending on the geometrical configurations of the cavities for configurations 3 and 5 a reaches 0 25 or higher whereas for the remaining configurations a is always less than 0 20 furthermore it is important to note that the temporal dynamics of the area covered by the sediments are different from those displayed in fig 6 with the suspended sediment concentration decay this is because of the different nature of the variable represented a surface for fig 9 and a mass for fig 6 a shows different behaviors when the high flow events occur for geometric configuration 1 the decrease in the deposition area is low regardless of the applied high flow scenario in this configuration dead area regions are large since sediment deposits in the dead areas da of the cavities are more stable than those in the main recirculating eddy region mre it is expected that configuration 1 can better shield the trapped sediments furthermore the mre is rather insensitive to the high flow events see fig 4 so the sediment export from the cavities is limited in configuration 5 and to a lesser extent configuration 4 the sediment deposits are partially sheltered for small changes in discharge l1 and l2 most sediments are retained however with higher flows h1 and h2 the sediments are partially flushed away the gradual scenario s1 despite having the same maximum flowrate as h1 and h2 re mobilizes less sediments for configuration 3 and to a lesser extent configuration 2 the resistance of the sediment deposits to being flushed away is low and for the scenarios with higher peak flowrates all sediment is flushed from the cavities for these two configurations the higher the discharge is the faster the complete flushing of the sediments trapped in the cavities after the high flow phase the cavities are filled with the sediment deposits again for most of the configurations the resilience of the system to recover after the high flow phase is high with the exception of configuration 2 and hydrograph scenarios l1 and l2 this means that the process is reversible for most of the tests and that after the events the same sediment deposits develop the findings explained above are further analyzed considering the value of the relative area of the sediment patterns over the area of the cavity a at several instants of the experiments four instants were chosen to be representative of the morphological evolution of the cavities see fig 8 for more details t b corresponds to the instant before the beginning of the increase in the flowrate tb t b corresponds to the instant after the beginning of the increase in the flowrate tb t e corresponds to the instant before the end of the high flow period te and t e corresponds to 1 h after the end of the high flow period te with the measured and normalized areas corresponding to these instants three ratios are defined to analyze the morphological resistance and resilience of the cavities to high flow disruptive events initial resistance a t b a t b representing how much the sediment deposits resist the first moments of the disruptive high flow long term resistance a t e a t b representing how much the sediment deposits resist the whole disruption period caused by the high flow and resilience or recovery a t e a t b representing how much of the initial sediment deposit was recovered after 1 h of the disruptive high flow that is a value close to 1 means that the process is reversible a value larger than 1 means that the spreading of the sediments after the disruption phase is larger the values of these ratios are shown in table 4 for the lower amplitude flood events l1 and l2 all configurations except for 2 present high initial resistance for the high flow events with the high discharges h1 h2 and s1 only geometric configuration 1 maintains high values of the ratio reporting the initial resistance regarding the ratio related to the long term resistance for the lower flood events l1 and l2 configurations 1 and 4 are the ones with higher values followed by configurations 3 and 5 within the scenarios with higher flowrates h1 h2 and s1 configuration 1 continues to be the more resistant in the long term the duration of the high flood events seems not to affect this configuration with the same long term resistance ratio for h1 and h2 in the other geometric configurations there is a decrease of the long term resistance ratio indicating that it is a question of time until the sediment deposits are completely washed from the cavities in terms of resilience of the cavities the results in table 4 and in fig 9 indicate that generally within 1 h all cavities recover the same amount of sediment deposited as before the high flow events configuration 2 for the lower flood events l1 and l2 exhibits the lowest resistance ratio but the analysis of fig 9 leads to the conclusion that the deposits within the cavities tend to be recovered generally the resistance of the sediment deposits in the cavity to the high flow events decreases with increasing amplitude of the latter for low amplitude events l1 and l2 configurations 1 and 4 seem to be completely resistant to the increase of the flowrate the variation of the flowrate in event s1 is imprinted in the temporal evolution of the sediment deposits however this does not affect the resistance ratio which is mainly dependent on the maximum flowrate applied finally results are further explored by displaying in fig 10 the temporal evolution of the sediment deposits inside the cavities the four instants previously defined are considered t b t b t e and t e these results allow a better understanding of the processes linked to the previous results in terms of resistance and resilience of the sediment deposits inside the cavities the deposition of sediment is generally observed in two main regions of the cavities the dead area da and the region of the main recirculating eddy mre see fig 4 between the instants corresponding to before the high flow t b and after the recovery t e the sediment deposits are quite consistent in pattern indicating the reversibility of the deposition process in the case of configuration 1 the deposits of sediment exist mainly in the dead region of the cavity the evolution of the deposits with time confirms the high resistance of these deposits to flushing regardless of the high flow event for configuration 2 the sediment mass trapped was mainly located in the dead area region this accumulation of material in the upstream inner corner is identical before and after the disruption phase see fig 11 furthermore the sediment deposition in the main recirculating eddy area for geometrical configuration 2 was almost negligible for hydrograph scenarios l1 and l2 with a peak discharge of 8 5 l s in contrast the high flow events h2 and s1 completely flush the sediment deposited in the cavities but in the recovery phase these sediment patterns were recovered in the cavity of configuration 3 we find two clear sediment deposits in both the dead area and the main recirculating eddy region as observed before the results in fig 10 show that the resistance of configuration 3 to the high flow events changes radically with the amplitude of the high flow events for the high amplitude events h1 h2 and s1 the cavities are completely flushed whereas for the episodes with lower flowrates l1 and l2 the deposits resist flushing considerably the cavity for configuration 4 presents the main sediment deposit located in the dead region and to some extent in the main recirculating eddy region for the lower flows l1 and l2 the sediment deposits show considerable resistance to flushing as seen before for the higher flow events the results regarding the resistance of the deposits are less conclusive although they seem to be dependent on the duration of the hydrograph finally for configuration 5 the sediment deposits occur mainly in the main recirculating eddy region for the lower flowrates the deposits are quite resistant whereas for the higher flow scenarios they show less resistance nevertheless total flushing of the cavity is never observed 4 discussion 4 1 in channel flow patterns and sediment deposits flow patterns observed during the experiments are primary influenced by the geometry of the lateral embayments the configurations tested in this work belong to the normal recirculation configurations 1 4 and skimming configuration 5 flow type meile et al 2011a this type of flow configuration implies that flow in the cavities is slightly normal recirculating or largely skimming decoupled from the main channel for normal recirculating flow types the cavities worked as a whole and the in cavity flow patterns are similar among cavities however for skimming flow types the lateral embayments work independently and therefore flow patterns are different among cavities these differences in the hydrodynamics are imprinted in the in cavity sediment trapping the geometric configuration with the skimming flow type configuration 5 shows that the morphodynamics of each cavity are independent from other cavities or the macro roughness bank element compared to the normal recirculating flow type configurations 1 4 see fig 5 the variability in the values of mass trapped for each cavity in configuration 5 is larger than in configurations 1 4 where in cavity mass trapped values are similar the cavity aspect ratio a r w l has the strongest influence on the flow field and ultimately on the sediment settling the longer the cavity is low ar the larger the in cavity dead area the dead area acts as a shelter region mitigating the re mobilization of already settled sediments for example the initial and long term resistances are higher for configuration 1 a r 0 2 than for configuration 5 a r 0 8 table 4 in addition the recovery process of the sediment patterns after the peak flow takes less time for low ar the shorter cavities high ar have less mass exchange with the main flow and the recovery process takes longer for example the resilience of configuration 5 a r 0 8 is low compared to the other configurations see table 4 the roughness ratio r r w l is related to the distance between neighboring cavities and consequently to the size of the dead areas lower values of rr i e long cavities have larger dead area regions and sediment trapping is thus favored on the other hand the expansion ratio e r b 2 w b has a minor effect on the flow and sediment deposits in this study due to the slight variation of this parameter ranging from 1 67 to 2 4 2 in cavity flow patterns and sediment deposits large vortical structures were generated inside the cavity at the leading edge of the embayment see fig 4 these structures qualitatively govern the mass exchange between the central channel and the cavities uijttewaal 2014 sediment deposits are thus found in the dead areas da and in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre see fig 4 dead areas are in cavity regions sheltered from the main channel consequently their mass exchange is limited and turbulence levels are lower than in the main channel sediments settle moreover the sedimentation in the main recirculating eddy mre has two origins i the presence of the teacup effect i e the main vortex as a result of its own rotation traps the sediment towards the center of the vortex where it eventually settles akutina 2015 juez et al 2017 and ii the cavity flow having a three dimensional nature i e the flow entering the cavity near the bottom is more easily curved less inertial than the surface flow tuna et al 2013 consequently there is a net flow into the cavity near the bottom and a net flow out of the cavity near the surface this implies that for less shallow cavity flows that is for high discharges the sediment exchange between the main channel and the cavity cannot be completely quantified based on the surface velocities alone this is illustrated in table 3 for configuration 5 in this geometric configuration the mass exchange occurring below the water surface is intense see fig 5 therefore the entrainment coefficients for the disruption phase less shallow cavity conditions obtained by the suspended sediment concentration time series and the surface piv values differ significantly finally in juez et al 2017 it was revealed that the position of the main recirculating eddy mre inside the cavity is related to the cavity aspect ratio a r w l lower values of ar ar 1 correspond to a downstream displacement of the center of the vortex x l 0 5 fig 10 shows that sediment deposits in the dead areas of the cavities are more stable than those in the main recirculating eddy mre region the disruption phase of the hydrograph can destroy temporally the teacup effect until a new uniform flow condition for the peak value is reached and consequently pick up and reintroduce the sediments stored in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre in contrast the dead area da acts as a shelter region preventing complete re mobilization of the sediments during high flow the residence time of the fine sediments in the dead areas da is thus larger that the residence time of the fine sediment located in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre 4 3 entrainment coefficients in geometric configurations 1 4 and for the initial phase of the hydrographs the values of the entrainment coefficients k differ notably between the two methods considered in this work surface piv and sediment concentration analysis this is because of the presence of seiching in such configurations the surface exchange velocity e is not representative of the mixing processes occurring between the lateral embayments and the main channel surface oscillations are thus dominant over the dynamics of the shear layer akutina 2015 juez et al 2017 tuna et al 2013 in contrast configuration 5 does not present seiching and consequently similar values are obtained using the concentration analysis method in addition kpiv values for the disruption phase cannot be trusted since they are blind to the new injection of sediments arriving from the lateral embayments to the main channel sediment deposits are totally or partially re mobilized the superficial exchange velocity integrated along the length of the cavity is not impacted by this added concentration for the recovery phase measured kme coefficients and those obtained from the concentration analysis are in good agreement observing the qualitative evolution of k in table 3 reveals the following i k p i v i decreases while the cavity aspect ratio a r w l increases see configurations 1 5 whose ar values range from 0 2 to 0 8 this is in agreement with previous results reported in weitbrecht et al 2008 and jackson et al 2015 k c a i values follow the same pattern except for in configuration 5 which presents a high entrainment coefficient ii k values obtained with piv and concentration analysis systematically decrease when the flow discharge is increased from 4 8 l s to 8 5 or 15 l s this agrees with mignot et al 2017 but not with the results reported in weitbrecht et al 2008 however it is noted that the results in weitbrecht et al 2008 were related to groyne fields whose flow dynamics differ significantly from those of the lateral embayments in a groyne field the turbulent vortices formed in the corners of the groynes mitigate the mass exchange between the main channel and the lateral embayments mccoy et al 2008 iii k c a d values related to hydrograph scenario s1 are lower than the values related to h1 and h2 although the peak value is the same 15 l s this is due to the gradual varying flowrate applied in s1 iv a comparison between k c a i and k c a r allows the resilience of the sediment deposits built up inside the embayments to be determined similar values of k c a i and k c a r indicate a complete re mobilization of the sediment deposits during the disruption phase in contrast lower values of k c a r with respect to k c a i reflect a morphological resilient lateral embayment configuration configurations 1 and 5 are the more resilient geometrical configurations tested in this work this also agrees with the temporal evolution of the areas summarized in table 4 4 4 influence of the disruption phase the magnitude of the disruption phase provokes a partial or complete remobilization of the sediments in all geometric configurations configurations 1 and 5 provide the best shelter for the sediment deposits despite the disruption phase see the resilience values in table 4 temporal evolution of sediment deposits in fig 4 and entrainment coefficients k c a r in table 3 the impact of the duration of the high flow events is limited as stated in spiller et al 2015 for most of the geometric configurations a morphological equilibrium state is reached just after the beginning of the event this equilibrium in the sediment deposits is maintained until the end of each high flow event see the values concerning resilience in table 4 the gradual increase of discharge during the hydrograph phase s1 decreases the re mobilization of the sediment inside the cavities long term resistance values i e the decrease of the sedimentation area during the hydrograph phase are below the range of the values observed for an instantaneous variation of the flowrate h1 and h2 cf table 4 this fact has a consequence in the sediment concentration decay dataset maximal values are reached for a longer time and are below the maximal values achieved with h1 and h2 fig 5 shows that the sediment trapping efficiency of the different cavities reaches almost the same values for the different configurations regardless of the hydrograph scenario applied the geometrical characteristics of the channel are thus more dominant than the magnitude and shape of the hydrograph 4 5 practical considerations the lateral bank cavities considered in this work are built to promote the formation of ecological hotspots to this end a limited amount of sediment is captured inside the cavities and thus provides hydraulic and morphology diversity i e the case of japanese wandos uno et al 2013 for these cases cavity configurations with highly resistant sediment deposits that promote the appearance of areas with high and low velocities are more suitable ribi et al 2014 i e ar 0 5 or ar 0 8 see fig 11 additionally these types of sediment deposits favorable for habitat enhancement can be improved with continuous entrainment and circulation of nutrients drifting macroinvertebrates in the cavity hence in addition to shelter the lateral embayments can provide opportunities for fish growth the entrainment of nutrients may be accomplished by reducing the roughness ratio i e increasing the distance between two successive cavities for configurations 2 3 and 4 the cavity aspect ratio is the same but in fig 4 it is observed that mass and turbulence exchange between the central channel and the cavity is higher for configurations 2 and 3 these configurations have lower roughness ratios the gradual increase of the high flowrate flow event s1 is also a key element to consider for practical applications the sediment concentration values recorded in the central channel after a gradual increase of flow discharge event s1 were below the values observed with an instantaneous increase of the flowrate event h1 see the k c a r values for the s1 hydrograph in table 3 lower sediment concentration values imply less turbidity in the water consequently an adequate level of vision for finding prey may be guaranteed kemp et al 2011 and gill saturation is avoided epa 2012 5 conclusions in the present contribution lateral cavities in a channel conveying fine sediments under the influence of fluctuations in the flow discharge are analyzed in terms of the resistance and resilience of the sediment deposits built up inside the cavities four main measuring techniques were used for data collection surface piv plan view images concentration measurements and weighing of trapped sediments consequently flow and sediment pattern evolution in the cavities was studied before during and after each flow fluctuation five high flow events with different unsteadiness levels five normalized geometries of the channel bank cavities and one initial sediment concentration were combined and varied in this work the hydrodynamic analysis of the flows shows that the primary areas of sedimentation inside the cavities are found in the dead areas and in the region where the main recirculating eddy is located this occurs because the dead areas are sheltered from the main channel consequently their mass exchange is limited and turbulence levels are lower than in the main channel sediments settle for the main recirculating eddy region the settling of sediments is attributed to the continuous mass exchange with the central channel combined with the increase of the residence time inside the cavity which increases the possibility of the sediments settling sediment deposits accumulated in the cavities are highly resilient to the high flow events it is observed that if an increase of flow discharge is applied to the channel and the initial discharge is then re established the initial configuration of the sediment deposits is generally recovered the speed in the process of recovery of the sediment patterns is dependent on the geometry of the cavities and on the unsteadiness of the high flow event applied partial re mobilization of the sediments corresponds to a quicker recovery of the sediment deposits the complete or partial re mobilization of the sediments trapped in the embayments is strongly dependent on the geometry of the cavities and on the unsteadiness of the high flow scenario low cavity aspect ratios ar i e long cavities favor the presence of large dead water zones and consequently sediments are trapped and sheltered even with high flow discharges cavities with high aspect ratios also act as shields for sediment deposits since they are largely decoupled from the flow in the central channel in contrast medium aspect ratios allow a complete flushing of the sediments settled in the cavities furthermore high roughness ratios rr a large distance between two cavities promote the trapping of sediments high trapping efficiency and the peak in the flowrate cannot completely re mobilize the sediment deposits the magnitude of the disruptive phase remains the most relevant parameter for the changes in the sediment deposits when considering the unsteadiness effect higher peaks introduce higher turbulence levels and sediments are prone to be re mobilized and consequently flushed the duration of the disruptive phase has a minor impact since the sediment deposits are quickly impacted and if this is the case flushed away from the cavities finally the gradual increase of flowrate yields the same mobilization of the sediments as an instantaneous increase of the flow discharge but with a milder tendency for this case the values of suspended sediment concentration recorded in the central channel are lower acknowledgments this work was funded bythe itn programme marie curie actions of the european union s seventh framework programme fp7 people 2013 itn under the rea grant

823,lateral cavities are built in the banks of rivers for several purposes to create harbors to capture sediment to keep a central navigable channel i e casiers de girardon in the rhone river or to promote the formation of aquatic habitats if a limited amount of sediment is captured providing hydraulic and morphologic diversity i e the case of japanese wandos this work is focused on this latter purpose promotion of hydraulic and morphologic diversity in these scenarios an increase in the flow discharge in the main channel may however re mobilize the deposit of sediment inside these lateral embayments and cause a sudden increase of the sediment concentration and turbidity in the main channel it is thus of interest to characterize the resistance and resilience of these sedimentary deposits when the main channel is subjected to high flow or flushing events laboratory tests were carried out for five different normalized geometries of the cavities installed in the banks of an open channel and for five hydrographs with different levels of unsteadiness water depth sediment deposit mass sediment concentration and area covered by the settled sediments were recorded throughout each experiment although sediment deposits established at equilibrium before the flushing events are different depending on the geometry of the cavities generally they are recovered after being flushed by the high flow events it is shown that the resistance and resilience of the sediment deposits are strongly dependent on the flow field and the mass exchange between the main channel and the cavities this mass exchange is governed by the geometry of the cavities and the magnitude of the hydrographs applied keywords river embayments macro roughness lateral elements fine sediment unsteady flow hydropeaking seasonal flows groyne 1 introduction throughout history rivers have been channelized to prevent flood hazards or to gain land for social and economic development this human intervention has disrupted the quasi natural equilibrium between the incoming and outcoming fluxes of sediments leading to deficit or excess situations allan and castillo 2007 schleiss et al 2016 this unbalanced sediment equilibrium has led to a twofold morphological response bed erosion and collapse of riverbanks in areas with sediment deficit and strong deposition and clogging in areas with sediment excess from an ecological point of view the disruption of the sediment cycle has important consequences fine suspended sediments in particular are transportation vectors of nutrients essential for riparian ecosystems von bertrab et al 2013 wood and armitage 1997 and they also fixate and trap organic carbon making them relevant to the carbon cycle boix fayos et al 2015 channelized rivers often display a straight path and monotonous banks a measure to promote morphology diversity of river banks is to create lateral embayments or cavities that behave as bank macro roughness elements in cavity sediment deposition is thus observed this contributes to the creation of areas with differentiated velocities that have potential as fish and plant habitats kemp et al 2011 ribi et al 2014 wood and armitage 1997 the wetlands created by the settlement of sediments in these cavities also serve as shelter areas for the biota when flooding events occur in rivers ribi et al 2014 in japan these lateral embayments so called wandos are areas considered to have ecological importance for fish spawning and nurseries nezu and onitsuka 2002 uno et al 2013 within this frame of river bank embayments built for fostering morphology and biota diversity groyne fields are not considered in this work groyne fields are geometrically different they penetrate more into the main channel and the distance between neighboring groynes is larger than in the case of just lateral embayments furthermore groynes are mainly conceived as hydraulic elements that maintain the main channel at a sufficient depth i e navigable qin et al 2017 sukhodolov 2014 sukhodolov et al 2002 weitbrecht et al 2008 yossef and de vriend 2010 the vortex shedding originated at the tips of the groynes prevents mass exchange between the main channel and the lateral embayments mccoy et al 2008 the study of shallow lateral embayments has received attention in recent last years akutina 2015 meile et al 2011a mignot et al 2016 rivière et al 2010 uijttewaal 2014 nevertheless most of these earlier works were focused on the study of i hydrodynamic patterns and ii mass and momentum exchange generated between the main flow and the lateral cavities however none of the above mentioned experimental studies were devoted to analyzing the dynamics of suspended sediment transport in these flows with lateral cavities the transport of sediment in suspension is primarily governed by the balance between the so called turbulent diffusion and the settling of the submerged particles van rijn 2007b by creating regions with lower turbulence levels that nevertheless allow exchange of mass with the main channel the lateral cavities can capture and retain a limited amount of fine sediment transported in suspension in the main channel in juez et al 2017 the transport of suspended sediment by a uniform flow in a channel with lateral rectangular roughness elements was experimentally studied laboratory tests carried out for constant flowrates covered a range of flow shallowness ratios cavity geometric ratios and initial sediment concentrations asymptotic results obtained at equilibrium conditions were discussed regarding the ability of the lateral embayment to be filled partially or totally by sediment and at which rate a follow up question from this previous study is how stable permanent these sediment deposits are that is whether they will be flushed away by an increase of flow discharge in the main channel or whether they will remain this fact is crucial in natural channel networks since they are subjected to flow fluctuations that control the sediment dynamics these flow fluctuations may have the following i a natural origin i e the seasonal flow patterns poff et al 1997 or ii an anthropogenic origin such as those caused by the release of a powerhouse outflow for producing electricity so called hydropeaking meile et al 2011b it is also expected that climate modification more random and intense precipitation schumm 2005 and glacier retreat riihimaki et al 2005 and changes in land use more urbanized and agricultural areas karl 2003 may cause a less visible but continuous variation of the unsteady flow regime of the rivers hauer et al 2012 several studies have been carried out in the past related to the mitigation of the effects of flow fluctuations in rivers regarding sediment patterns lana renault and regués 2009 hydropower operation models meile et al 2011b hydraulic magnitudes wet areas water levels and shear stress spiller et al 2015 and riparian vegetation fishes and macroinvertebrates cereghino et al 2002 person et al 2014 it is known that macroinvertebrates and aquatic plants are impacted and undergo major stress in the case of either natural or anthropic flowrate variations without appropriate sheltering the water level fluctuations can affect the over wintering survival of the fishes scruton et al 2003 and the over day survival of the fishes in the case of hydropeaking in the river reach person et al 2014 ribi et al 2014 thus if most of the fine material trapped inside the lateral cavities is re mobilized during an episode of high discharge this may lead to an increase of the turbidity level in the main channel water which can hinder fish visibility and thus impair visual feeding behavior and fish spawning by clogging the river bed causing zoobenthos scouring blettler et al 2015 sternecker et al 2013 the general objective of the present research is to analyze the resistance sensitivity to disruption and resilience recovery from disruption of the fine sediment deposits in open channel lateral cavities when subjected to an increase in the flow discharge of the main channel systematic experimental tests were carried out with five hydrographs with different unsteadiness degrees for five different normalized geometries of the cavities installed in the banks of an open channel as in juez et al 2017 the experiments were initialized with a base uniform flow conveying sediment in suspension no deposition in the main channel was allowed once a morphodynamic equilibrium condition was achieved inside the cavities stable deposits of fine sediment different high flow events were applied after the high flow which lasted for a period that was variable for each unsteadiness scenario the initial base flow was again imposed in the channel two research questions were addressed the first concerns to which degree the sediment deposits within the cavity resist fully or partially the high flow event this is quantified by the amount of sediment that is re mobilized by the hydrograph the resistance of the sediment deposits depends on the geometry of the cavities relative to the flow unsteadiness of each different hydrograph i e the sheltering effect of the lateral cavity the second question regards the reversibility of the process depending on the re mobilization and on the shelter condition offered by the cavity we analyzed the recovery time of the sediment deposits within the cavity to re establish initial equilibrium morphological patterns 2 experimental setup 2 1 flume description experiments were performed in a hydraulic closed circuit with the following major components see juez et al 2017 for a more detailed description i an upstream 2 m long 1 m wide and 1 m high tank for mixing the suspended sediment ii a rectangular 7 5 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 0 m high open channel with a 0 1 slope and iii a downstream tank 3 5 m long 1 m wide and 1 m high that collected the circulating flow the water was pumped from the downstream to the upstream tank the pipe system was equipped with a valve to control the discharge and a flowmeter the channel bottom was smooth and made of painted wood lateral walls were made of glass two mixing systems downstream and upstream from the channel were used to avoid sedimentation downstream from the channel a venetian gate allowed flow depth control in the channel the channel was wide enough to prevent interactions between the symmetrical lateral channel banks a sketch of the experimental setup with these elements is shown in fig 1 2 2 lateral embayment configurations as shown in fig 1 the base channel banks were modified by adding concrete bricks 0 25 m long 0 10 m wide and 0 19 m high to the lateral walls this allowed different lateral embayment configurations to be built see fig 2 as in meile et al 2011a b and juez et al 2017 the lateral cavities were characterized by the length of the cavity l the distance between two cavities l and the lateral depth of the cavities w see fig 2 the combination of these characteristics lengths together with the channel width led to the definition of several geometrical ratios cavity aspect ratio a r w l roughness ratio r r w l and expansion ratio e r b 2 w b the height of the bricks composing the lateral embayment configurations was sufficient to avoid their overflow the lateral embayments correspond to lateral cavities built in the banks of a river reach therefore they had the same height as the river banks and consequently for flow fluctuations which are not extreme events the water remained within the channel without overflowing the lateral embayment configurations tested in this work were based on a prior experimental study carried out by the authors in juez et al 2017 five geometric configurations with high cavity aspect and expansion ratio were chosen due to their favorable behavior for river restoration projects the flow patterns in these embayment configurations fostered partial filling of the cavities with sediments thereby promoting areas with hydraulic and morphology diversity with low and high velocities which are suitable for aquatic biota the five tested lateral embayment configurations are displayed in fig 2 the relation between the geometric configurations herein tested fig 2 and those tested in juez et al 2017 is the following configurations 1 5 in fig 2 correspond to configurations 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 and 2 1 in meile et al 2011a depending on the geometry of the lateral embayments the flow through an open channel with lateral macro roughness may be of three different types skimming normal and reattached see meile et al 2011a the configurations tested in this work belong to the normal recirculating flow type configurations 1 4 and skimming flow type configuration 5 the reattached flow type configuration is not considered in this study since its impact on the trapping of fine sediments is limited due to the low lateral depth of the cavities w 2 3 experimental flow conditions a uniform flow condition of 4 8 l s was imposed as an initial low base flow for all experiments this base flow was imposed until a quasi equilibrium sediment concentration value in the main channel was reached i e 3 h after the beginning of the experiments the initial concentration was set to 0 5 g l this initial concentration was chosen to meet the maximal transport capacity of the flow in the central channel to transport the sediments in suspension i e neither bedload transport nor deposition was allowed in the central channel the concentration recorded by the two turbidimeters converged asymptotically to a lower final value due to the trapping effect of the lateral macro roughness elements the sediment conveyed in suspension within the flow was polyurethane the grain size of the sediment was characterized by d 50 0 2 mm with a density equal to 1160 kg m3 and a coefficient of uniformity equal to 0 47 the mean particle diameter was chosen to be in the range of non cohesive fine sediment 0 062 0 5 mm according to van rijn 2007a and following the grain size of sediment that can be found in suspension in alpine rivers federal office of environment 2016 the artificial nature of these sediments was preferred to natural material to avoid biofilm growth during the experiments which favors cohesion among particles five different high flow events corresponding to different unsteadiness degrees were tested for each cavity configuration see fig 3 the unsteadiness scenarios differed i in duration of the hydrograph the disruption phase in hydrographs l2 and h2 lasts twice as long as the hydrographs l1 and h1 ii in the maximum flowrate for hydrographs l1 and l2 is 8 5 l s and for hydrographs h1 h2 and s1 is 15 0 l s this corresponds to common hydropeaking of two to three times the base flow as observed in alpine rivers federal office of environment 2016 and iii in the rate of flow variation sudden or gradual with a rate of 0 34 l s min the volume of water released with the gradual rate hydrograph s1 is the same as that with immediate variation hydrograph h1 and both hydrographs have the same flowrate magnitude after the high flow event the channel was water worked additionally for two hours to study the morphological response of the system during the recovery time during this period the initial uniform flow condition of 4 8 l s was imposed table 1 displays the hydrodynamic variables corresponding to each phase of the tests the flow is fully turbulent and sub critical for all experiments the maximum flowrates applied in each scenario were chosen by keeping in mind that the relation between the water height h and the channel width b of b h should be between 7 2 and 17 3 to keep the flow shallow in the main channel the suspension criteria were doubly guaranteed first the rouse number was always below 0 8 which implies that the suspended load was the dominant sediment transport mechanism second the ratio between the friction velocity v and the settling velocity vs computed as in zanke 1977 was always above 2 5 which also means that suspended transport was fully dominant within the flow yossef and de vriend 2010 the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the experiments represent a generic 1 40 model froude similarity of an alpine river thus the laboratory model is equivalent to a prototype river reach with i a 20 m width water heights ranging between 1 4 and 2 8 m depending on the discharge and the same bed slope 0 1 ii velocities ranging between 1 43 and 2 24 m s depending on the discharge iii discharges ranging between 48 and 151 m3 s and iv the temporal duration of the hydrograph ranging between 6 and 12 h for scaling the suspended load transport two possibilities exist the first possibility consists of applying the geometrical similarity to the grain size of the prototype i e d 50 200 µm as found in suspension in alpine rivers however this results in very small sediment d 50 m o d e l 3 33 µm with the risk of cohesion among particles the second possibility and the one chosen in this work consists of using a reduced density that reduces the settling velocity while maintaining the grain size gorrick and rodríguez 2014 table 2 displays the unsteadiness parameters p of each high flow event referred to the central channel width i e without lateral embayments the parameter p was computed with the formula proposed by graf and suszka 1985 which characterizes the unsteadiness of the flow by the ratio of the change in flow depth δh and by the hydrograph duration th multiplied by the shear velocity of the base flow u 0 p δ h u 0 t h the values of unsteadiness parameters agree with those observed in the alpine rivers federal office of environment 2016 at several hydropower plants due to hydropeaking high flow events h1 and l1 present higher levels of unsteadiness compared with h2 and l2 2 4 measurement techniques during preliminary tests an ultrasonic probe mounted in a trolley was used to record the water level in the center of the channel along the channel length this was performed for the initial discharge considered for the tests 4 8 l s the flow uniform conditions were guaranteed for the initial and recovery phase of each hydrograph scenario furthermore during the actual experiments the water level was continuously measured along the experiments with a frequency of 10 hz this time the probe was fixed and was located in the middle of the channel longitudinally and transversally in juez et al 2017 the 2d surface piv technique was applied to the same geometric configuration herein tested this piv technique consisted of tracking the position of floating particles with a camera filming from the top at a frequency of 30 hz based on this information the velocity field of the surface flow inside the cavities was then computed for three different steady flowrates such flowrates correspond to the low base flow 4 8 l s and to the peak flows considered in the high flow events 8 5 l s and 15 l s the temporal evolution of the suspended sediment concentration was recorded upstream turbidimeter t1 and downstream turbidimeter t2 in the channel by two cosmos 25 turbidimeters see fig 2 for positions an adaptation length was chosen between the channel inlet and turbidimeter t1 see fig 2 to avoid any perturbation in the measurements due to the upstream boundary conditions in addition the signal was sampled every 100 ms conversely in preliminary tests the vertical sediment concentration profile was measured at the location of t1 several repetitions were carried out to guarantee that the sediment adding and mixing process could be repeated to always obtain the same inflow concentration profile this level of repeatability is further illustrated in fig 6 where for each configuration and regardless of the hydrograph scenario the sediment decay for the first 3 h of base flow is almost identical furthermore plan view photos of the sedimentation patterns were captured in a cavity placed between the two turbidimeters see fig 2 these photos were subsequently treated to extract the surface occupied by the sediments along time finally at the end of the tests the total sediment mass trapped inside the lateral embayments was collected and dried in an oven to determine the dry weight this mass was divided by the total area occupied by the embayments to compute the trapping efficiency in mass per area for each configuration 3 results 3 1 surface flow patterns to measure the surface flow patterns in the lateral cavities for the three flowrates of the applied hydrograph scenarios i e 4 8 8 5 and 15 0 l s see fig 3 a large scale piv technique was used juez et al 2017 fig 4 displays the fields of time averaged transversal velocity v and the mean vorticity defined as ω v x u y results are available for the cavity and for the adjacent area of the main channel to help in the visualization of the in cavity flow patterns the averaged streamwise velocity of the main channel was subtracted from the velocity fields furthermore the algorithm used to estimate the spatial derivatives in the definition of the vorticity is the one proposed by sj and cowen 2004 for a quadrangular grid of a size ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 mm dimensionless coordinates are used to characterize the cavity geometry in the figures x l denotes the longitudinal direction and y l is the transversal direction both normalized by the length of the cavity l cf fig 2 in the dashed areas no information was available for performing piv computations the patterns of transversal time averaged velocity show that for all geometries and flowrates a main recirculation eddy appears mre in the cavity its center is placed downstream of the center of the cavity a dead area da is located at the inner upstream wall of the embayment both hydraulic regions mre and da are the primary regions where in cavity sedimentation occurs velocity fields display higher values at the channel cavity interface for configurations 1 2 and 5 for configurations 3 and 4 corresponding to the highest roughness ratio rr the velocities are lower the vorticity field observed corresponds to the shear between the main recirculating eddy mre and i the inner walls of the cavity and ii the flow of the main channel higher values of vorticity in the vicinity of the lateral boundary layer and in the shear layer between the main channel and the cavity indicate that in these regions higher turbulent energy production may be verified the vorticity field helps in understanding how sediment is captured into the cavity sediments mainly settle in dead water areas da and in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre the first is related to low velocity which favors the deposition of sediment the second is linked with the teacup effect near the bottom the streamlines are more easily curved less inertial than the streamlines at the surface tuna et al 2013 as a result of the teacup effect the sediment is trapped and eventually settles in the center of the mre for the specific conditions of the experiments the sign of the vorticity in this region is negative 3 2 sediment trapped at the end of the experiment the sediment mass trapped inside the lateral embayments at the end of the experiments recovery phase was collected dried and weighed this mass corresponds to equilibrium conditions after the deposit morphology reached a stable configuration it is worth mentioning that the in cavity sediment deposit height was small ranging from 0 2 cm configuration 2 to 0 7 cm configuration 5 therefore the sediment deposits did not significantly affect the in cavity flow dynamics the mass trapped by the lateral embayments was divided by the total area of these embayments to compute the trapping efficiency for each geometric configuration and each high flow event fig 5 displays this trapping efficiency along the channel configuration 5 presents the highest trapping efficiency followed by configuration 1 these geometric configurations correspond to the lower values of the roughness ratio r r w l trapping of sediment decreases with decreasing roughness ratio in all configurations there is a clear influence of the inlet and outlet of the channel that is mass trapped in the first and last cavities 3 3 entrainment coefficient to investigate the morphological resilience of fine sediment deposits in bank lateral cavities exchange processes between the main channel and the cavities and for the different phases of the hydrograph scenarios were calculated to this end the classical first order cavity model approach proposed by valentine and wood 1979 was considered this model was primarily developed to analyze the dynamics of a pollution cloud in the presence of lateral cavities it stated that the temporal evolution of the concentration in the lateral cavity cc is related to the exchange between the main channel and the cavity analogously it is possible to define the temporal evolution of the sediment concentration in the main channel cm assuming that the sediment deposition occurs only in the lateral cavities as in our set of experiments 1 d c m d t k m c c c c m where k m c 1 time is the ratio between the exchanged volume per unit time provided by the main channel q m c and the lateral cavity volume vc 2 k m c q m c v c l h e e n p l w h c n p where l is the length of the cavity he is the water height at the entrance of the cavity e is an exchange velocity w is the width of the cavity np is the number of cavities present in the main channel and hc is the water depth within the cavity the bottom level of the main channel and of the in cavity area was the same in our experiments and we considered only a unique water height for both regions h e h c valentine and wood 1979 proposed the normalization of the exchange velocity e by the mean velocity of the main channel um resulting in the definition of a dimensionless entrainment coefficient k 3 k e u m substituting eq 3 into 2 and 2 into 1 a general dead zone mass conservation equation is obtained 4 d c m d t k u m w c c c m w h e r e k m c k u m w k m c thus represents the slope of the concentration decay 1 time and the dimensional exchange coefficient between the main channel and the cavity in addition it is related to its dimensionless counterpart k with the above set of equations in mind and following weitbrecht et al 2008 and mignot et al 2017 two methods were considered for determining the entrainment coefficient k from experiments first by means of the piv results and second by means of the sediment concentration records collected throughout the experiments in the main channel the surface piv measurements allow the entrainment coefficient k to be directly determined since the exchange velocity e is known the instantaneous exchange velocity along the length of the cavity is computed by integrating the absolute value of the instantaneous transversal velocity v the absolute value of the instantaneous transversal velocity derives from the fact that the instantaneous exchange velocity e collects the information of the fluxes entering and leaving the cavity in addition it is assumed that the flux entering the cavity is equal to the flux reintegrating with the main channel as a result the integral is divided by 2 therefore the instantaneous exchange velocity e is written as 5 e 1 2 l 0 l v d x the following step consisted of time averaging the instantaneous exchange velocity 500 values of e corresponding to 500 time steps a time averaged value was thus obtained e substituting this value into eq 3 the entrainment coefficient kpiv was then given k p i v e u m table 3 provides the kpiv values for the initial and disruption phases of the applied hydrograph scenarios values for the recovery phase are not included since the flowrate in this phase is the same as that in the initial phase i e the kpiv value does not change between the initial and recovery phases this was checked on the basis of flow velocity measurements the second method for determining the entrainment coefficient relies on the analysis of the sediment concentration decay recorded through the experiments by means of two turbidimeters see fig 6 the information provided by the turbidimeters was punctual and corresponds to a value in the vertical concentration profile it was experimentally verified that the chosen vertical position of the turbidimeter ensured that the measured values correspond roughly to the averaged concentration of the vertical profile for the given initial conditions i e sediment concentration of 0 5 g l and flowrate of 4 8 l s the vertical concentration profile was measured previously with a turbidimeter the averaged value of both turbidimeters was analyzed data were normalized by the initial concentration of the experiments c 0 0 5 g l the experiment was initialized with 3 h of base low discharge by the end of this period the channel asymptotically reached a morphological equilibrium state in which the observed changes in suspended sediment concentrations and in sediment deposits inside the cavities were marginal the sediment deposits were periodically measured during the runs with vertical rulers attached to the glass of the flume the subsequent disruption phase forced the total or partial re mobilization of the sediment trapped within the cavities this led to an increase of the suspended sediment concentration in the main channel finally the channel was brought to a new morphological equilibrium state by recovering the initial base low flowrate and consequently a new decay of the sediment concentration was measured sediment concentration data were fitted by an exponential decay of the first order for each phase of the hydrograph applied initial disruption and recovery it was thus possible to linearize the sediment concentration results and link them with the dimensional exchange coefficient k m c which represents the slope of the decay see eq 4 therefore the entrainment coefficient derived from the concentration analysis kca was computed for each of the three phases of the hydrograph as shown in eq 4 k c a w k m c u m as an example fig 7 left side displays the temporal sediment concentration decay averaged value of the two turbidimeters for configuration 3 and hydrograph scenario s1 in addition fig 7 right side shows the linear fit of the exponential decay of the normalized sediment concentration in the main channel for the initial phase of the experiments and the actual values of the measured concentration sediment concentration data related to the beginning of the disruption phase sudden increase of the concentration values were not included in this analysis since the purpose is to determine the sediment transfer from the main channel to the cavities the linear fit was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level with correspondingly high r 2 values r 2 0 99 table 3 includes the kca values for each phase of the applied hydrograph scenarios table 3 also includes the measured entrainment coefficient values kme for the recovery phase the direct method for determining these coefficients was based on collecting drying and weighing the sediment mass trapped inside the lateral cavities ms at the end of the experiments this mass was divided by the total area of the lateral embayments in the channel wlnp the density of the sediments ρs and the mean velocity of the channel um a mean residence time was thus obtained which can also be interpreted as the inverse of the exchange coefficient k m c previously defined in 4 this arrangement allowed the measured entrainment coefficient for the recovery phase to be obtained as 6 k m e m c m s w l n p ρ s u m 1 a n d k m e w k m e m c u m the range of values for the entrainment coefficients displayed in table 3 0 003 0 045 are in good agreement with previous experiments carried out by different researchers mignot et al 2017 tuna et al 2013 valentine and wood 1979 weitbrecht et al 2008 3 4 areas of sediment deposition fig 9 displays the time evolution of the area covered by the sediments a p normalized by the area of the cavity a 0 a a p a 0 during the initial phase and for all geometric configurations the sediment deposits build up quickly until a stable configuration is reached the normalized equilibrium areas of sediment deposits are different depending on the geometrical configurations of the cavities for configurations 3 and 5 a reaches 0 25 or higher whereas for the remaining configurations a is always less than 0 20 furthermore it is important to note that the temporal dynamics of the area covered by the sediments are different from those displayed in fig 6 with the suspended sediment concentration decay this is because of the different nature of the variable represented a surface for fig 9 and a mass for fig 6 a shows different behaviors when the high flow events occur for geometric configuration 1 the decrease in the deposition area is low regardless of the applied high flow scenario in this configuration dead area regions are large since sediment deposits in the dead areas da of the cavities are more stable than those in the main recirculating eddy region mre it is expected that configuration 1 can better shield the trapped sediments furthermore the mre is rather insensitive to the high flow events see fig 4 so the sediment export from the cavities is limited in configuration 5 and to a lesser extent configuration 4 the sediment deposits are partially sheltered for small changes in discharge l1 and l2 most sediments are retained however with higher flows h1 and h2 the sediments are partially flushed away the gradual scenario s1 despite having the same maximum flowrate as h1 and h2 re mobilizes less sediments for configuration 3 and to a lesser extent configuration 2 the resistance of the sediment deposits to being flushed away is low and for the scenarios with higher peak flowrates all sediment is flushed from the cavities for these two configurations the higher the discharge is the faster the complete flushing of the sediments trapped in the cavities after the high flow phase the cavities are filled with the sediment deposits again for most of the configurations the resilience of the system to recover after the high flow phase is high with the exception of configuration 2 and hydrograph scenarios l1 and l2 this means that the process is reversible for most of the tests and that after the events the same sediment deposits develop the findings explained above are further analyzed considering the value of the relative area of the sediment patterns over the area of the cavity a at several instants of the experiments four instants were chosen to be representative of the morphological evolution of the cavities see fig 8 for more details t b corresponds to the instant before the beginning of the increase in the flowrate tb t b corresponds to the instant after the beginning of the increase in the flowrate tb t e corresponds to the instant before the end of the high flow period te and t e corresponds to 1 h after the end of the high flow period te with the measured and normalized areas corresponding to these instants three ratios are defined to analyze the morphological resistance and resilience of the cavities to high flow disruptive events initial resistance a t b a t b representing how much the sediment deposits resist the first moments of the disruptive high flow long term resistance a t e a t b representing how much the sediment deposits resist the whole disruption period caused by the high flow and resilience or recovery a t e a t b representing how much of the initial sediment deposit was recovered after 1 h of the disruptive high flow that is a value close to 1 means that the process is reversible a value larger than 1 means that the spreading of the sediments after the disruption phase is larger the values of these ratios are shown in table 4 for the lower amplitude flood events l1 and l2 all configurations except for 2 present high initial resistance for the high flow events with the high discharges h1 h2 and s1 only geometric configuration 1 maintains high values of the ratio reporting the initial resistance regarding the ratio related to the long term resistance for the lower flood events l1 and l2 configurations 1 and 4 are the ones with higher values followed by configurations 3 and 5 within the scenarios with higher flowrates h1 h2 and s1 configuration 1 continues to be the more resistant in the long term the duration of the high flood events seems not to affect this configuration with the same long term resistance ratio for h1 and h2 in the other geometric configurations there is a decrease of the long term resistance ratio indicating that it is a question of time until the sediment deposits are completely washed from the cavities in terms of resilience of the cavities the results in table 4 and in fig 9 indicate that generally within 1 h all cavities recover the same amount of sediment deposited as before the high flow events configuration 2 for the lower flood events l1 and l2 exhibits the lowest resistance ratio but the analysis of fig 9 leads to the conclusion that the deposits within the cavities tend to be recovered generally the resistance of the sediment deposits in the cavity to the high flow events decreases with increasing amplitude of the latter for low amplitude events l1 and l2 configurations 1 and 4 seem to be completely resistant to the increase of the flowrate the variation of the flowrate in event s1 is imprinted in the temporal evolution of the sediment deposits however this does not affect the resistance ratio which is mainly dependent on the maximum flowrate applied finally results are further explored by displaying in fig 10 the temporal evolution of the sediment deposits inside the cavities the four instants previously defined are considered t b t b t e and t e these results allow a better understanding of the processes linked to the previous results in terms of resistance and resilience of the sediment deposits inside the cavities the deposition of sediment is generally observed in two main regions of the cavities the dead area da and the region of the main recirculating eddy mre see fig 4 between the instants corresponding to before the high flow t b and after the recovery t e the sediment deposits are quite consistent in pattern indicating the reversibility of the deposition process in the case of configuration 1 the deposits of sediment exist mainly in the dead region of the cavity the evolution of the deposits with time confirms the high resistance of these deposits to flushing regardless of the high flow event for configuration 2 the sediment mass trapped was mainly located in the dead area region this accumulation of material in the upstream inner corner is identical before and after the disruption phase see fig 11 furthermore the sediment deposition in the main recirculating eddy area for geometrical configuration 2 was almost negligible for hydrograph scenarios l1 and l2 with a peak discharge of 8 5 l s in contrast the high flow events h2 and s1 completely flush the sediment deposited in the cavities but in the recovery phase these sediment patterns were recovered in the cavity of configuration 3 we find two clear sediment deposits in both the dead area and the main recirculating eddy region as observed before the results in fig 10 show that the resistance of configuration 3 to the high flow events changes radically with the amplitude of the high flow events for the high amplitude events h1 h2 and s1 the cavities are completely flushed whereas for the episodes with lower flowrates l1 and l2 the deposits resist flushing considerably the cavity for configuration 4 presents the main sediment deposit located in the dead region and to some extent in the main recirculating eddy region for the lower flows l1 and l2 the sediment deposits show considerable resistance to flushing as seen before for the higher flow events the results regarding the resistance of the deposits are less conclusive although they seem to be dependent on the duration of the hydrograph finally for configuration 5 the sediment deposits occur mainly in the main recirculating eddy region for the lower flowrates the deposits are quite resistant whereas for the higher flow scenarios they show less resistance nevertheless total flushing of the cavity is never observed 4 discussion 4 1 in channel flow patterns and sediment deposits flow patterns observed during the experiments are primary influenced by the geometry of the lateral embayments the configurations tested in this work belong to the normal recirculation configurations 1 4 and skimming configuration 5 flow type meile et al 2011a this type of flow configuration implies that flow in the cavities is slightly normal recirculating or largely skimming decoupled from the main channel for normal recirculating flow types the cavities worked as a whole and the in cavity flow patterns are similar among cavities however for skimming flow types the lateral embayments work independently and therefore flow patterns are different among cavities these differences in the hydrodynamics are imprinted in the in cavity sediment trapping the geometric configuration with the skimming flow type configuration 5 shows that the morphodynamics of each cavity are independent from other cavities or the macro roughness bank element compared to the normal recirculating flow type configurations 1 4 see fig 5 the variability in the values of mass trapped for each cavity in configuration 5 is larger than in configurations 1 4 where in cavity mass trapped values are similar the cavity aspect ratio a r w l has the strongest influence on the flow field and ultimately on the sediment settling the longer the cavity is low ar the larger the in cavity dead area the dead area acts as a shelter region mitigating the re mobilization of already settled sediments for example the initial and long term resistances are higher for configuration 1 a r 0 2 than for configuration 5 a r 0 8 table 4 in addition the recovery process of the sediment patterns after the peak flow takes less time for low ar the shorter cavities high ar have less mass exchange with the main flow and the recovery process takes longer for example the resilience of configuration 5 a r 0 8 is low compared to the other configurations see table 4 the roughness ratio r r w l is related to the distance between neighboring cavities and consequently to the size of the dead areas lower values of rr i e long cavities have larger dead area regions and sediment trapping is thus favored on the other hand the expansion ratio e r b 2 w b has a minor effect on the flow and sediment deposits in this study due to the slight variation of this parameter ranging from 1 67 to 2 4 2 in cavity flow patterns and sediment deposits large vortical structures were generated inside the cavity at the leading edge of the embayment see fig 4 these structures qualitatively govern the mass exchange between the central channel and the cavities uijttewaal 2014 sediment deposits are thus found in the dead areas da and in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre see fig 4 dead areas are in cavity regions sheltered from the main channel consequently their mass exchange is limited and turbulence levels are lower than in the main channel sediments settle moreover the sedimentation in the main recirculating eddy mre has two origins i the presence of the teacup effect i e the main vortex as a result of its own rotation traps the sediment towards the center of the vortex where it eventually settles akutina 2015 juez et al 2017 and ii the cavity flow having a three dimensional nature i e the flow entering the cavity near the bottom is more easily curved less inertial than the surface flow tuna et al 2013 consequently there is a net flow into the cavity near the bottom and a net flow out of the cavity near the surface this implies that for less shallow cavity flows that is for high discharges the sediment exchange between the main channel and the cavity cannot be completely quantified based on the surface velocities alone this is illustrated in table 3 for configuration 5 in this geometric configuration the mass exchange occurring below the water surface is intense see fig 5 therefore the entrainment coefficients for the disruption phase less shallow cavity conditions obtained by the suspended sediment concentration time series and the surface piv values differ significantly finally in juez et al 2017 it was revealed that the position of the main recirculating eddy mre inside the cavity is related to the cavity aspect ratio a r w l lower values of ar ar 1 correspond to a downstream displacement of the center of the vortex x l 0 5 fig 10 shows that sediment deposits in the dead areas of the cavities are more stable than those in the main recirculating eddy mre region the disruption phase of the hydrograph can destroy temporally the teacup effect until a new uniform flow condition for the peak value is reached and consequently pick up and reintroduce the sediments stored in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre in contrast the dead area da acts as a shelter region preventing complete re mobilization of the sediments during high flow the residence time of the fine sediments in the dead areas da is thus larger that the residence time of the fine sediment located in the center of the main recirculating eddy mre 4 3 entrainment coefficients in geometric configurations 1 4 and for the initial phase of the hydrographs the values of the entrainment coefficients k differ notably between the two methods considered in this work surface piv and sediment concentration analysis this is because of the presence of seiching in such configurations the surface exchange velocity e is not representative of the mixing processes occurring between the lateral embayments and the main channel surface oscillations are thus dominant over the dynamics of the shear layer akutina 2015 juez et al 2017 tuna et al 2013 in contrast configuration 5 does not present seiching and consequently similar values are obtained using the concentration analysis method in addition kpiv values for the disruption phase cannot be trusted since they are blind to the new injection of sediments arriving from the lateral embayments to the main channel sediment deposits are totally or partially re mobilized the superficial exchange velocity integrated along the length of the cavity is not impacted by this added concentration for the recovery phase measured kme coefficients and those obtained from the concentration analysis are in good agreement observing the qualitative evolution of k in table 3 reveals the following i k p i v i decreases while the cavity aspect ratio a r w l increases see configurations 1 5 whose ar values range from 0 2 to 0 8 this is in agreement with previous results reported in weitbrecht et al 2008 and jackson et al 2015 k c a i values follow the same pattern except for in configuration 5 which presents a high entrainment coefficient ii k values obtained with piv and concentration analysis systematically decrease when the flow discharge is increased from 4 8 l s to 8 5 or 15 l s this agrees with mignot et al 2017 but not with the results reported in weitbrecht et al 2008 however it is noted that the results in weitbrecht et al 2008 were related to groyne fields whose flow dynamics differ significantly from those of the lateral embayments in a groyne field the turbulent vortices formed in the corners of the groynes mitigate the mass exchange between the main channel and the lateral embayments mccoy et al 2008 iii k c a d values related to hydrograph scenario s1 are lower than the values related to h1 and h2 although the peak value is the same 15 l s this is due to the gradual varying flowrate applied in s1 iv a comparison between k c a i and k c a r allows the resilience of the sediment deposits built up inside the embayments to be determined similar values of k c a i and k c a r indicate a complete re mobilization of the sediment deposits during the disruption phase in contrast lower values of k c a r with respect to k c a i reflect a morphological resilient lateral embayment configuration configurations 1 and 5 are the more resilient geometrical configurations tested in this work this also agrees with the temporal evolution of the areas summarized in table 4 4 4 influence of the disruption phase the magnitude of the disruption phase provokes a partial or complete remobilization of the sediments in all geometric configurations configurations 1 and 5 provide the best shelter for the sediment deposits despite the disruption phase see the resilience values in table 4 temporal evolution of sediment deposits in fig 4 and entrainment coefficients k c a r in table 3 the impact of the duration of the high flow events is limited as stated in spiller et al 2015 for most of the geometric configurations a morphological equilibrium state is reached just after the beginning of the event this equilibrium in the sediment deposits is maintained until the end of each high flow event see the values concerning resilience in table 4 the gradual increase of discharge during the hydrograph phase s1 decreases the re mobilization of the sediment inside the cavities long term resistance values i e the decrease of the sedimentation area during the hydrograph phase are below the range of the values observed for an instantaneous variation of the flowrate h1 and h2 cf table 4 this fact has a consequence in the sediment concentration decay dataset maximal values are reached for a longer time and are below the maximal values achieved with h1 and h2 fig 5 shows that the sediment trapping efficiency of the different cavities reaches almost the same values for the different configurations regardless of the hydrograph scenario applied the geometrical characteristics of the channel are thus more dominant than the magnitude and shape of the hydrograph 4 5 practical considerations the lateral bank cavities considered in this work are built to promote the formation of ecological hotspots to this end a limited amount of sediment is captured inside the cavities and thus provides hydraulic and morphology diversity i e the case of japanese wandos uno et al 2013 for these cases cavity configurations with highly resistant sediment deposits that promote the appearance of areas with high and low velocities are more suitable ribi et al 2014 i e ar 0 5 or ar 0 8 see fig 11 additionally these types of sediment deposits favorable for habitat enhancement can be improved with continuous entrainment and circulation of nutrients drifting macroinvertebrates in the cavity hence in addition to shelter the lateral embayments can provide opportunities for fish growth the entrainment of nutrients may be accomplished by reducing the roughness ratio i e increasing the distance between two successive cavities for configurations 2 3 and 4 the cavity aspect ratio is the same but in fig 4 it is observed that mass and turbulence exchange between the central channel and the cavity is higher for configurations 2 and 3 these configurations have lower roughness ratios the gradual increase of the high flowrate flow event s1 is also a key element to consider for practical applications the sediment concentration values recorded in the central channel after a gradual increase of flow discharge event s1 were below the values observed with an instantaneous increase of the flowrate event h1 see the k c a r values for the s1 hydrograph in table 3 lower sediment concentration values imply less turbidity in the water consequently an adequate level of vision for finding prey may be guaranteed kemp et al 2011 and gill saturation is avoided epa 2012 5 conclusions in the present contribution lateral cavities in a channel conveying fine sediments under the influence of fluctuations in the flow discharge are analyzed in terms of the resistance and resilience of the sediment deposits built up inside the cavities four main measuring techniques were used for data collection surface piv plan view images concentration measurements and weighing of trapped sediments consequently flow and sediment pattern evolution in the cavities was studied before during and after each flow fluctuation five high flow events with different unsteadiness levels five normalized geometries of the channel bank cavities and one initial sediment concentration were combined and varied in this work the hydrodynamic analysis of the flows shows that the primary areas of sedimentation inside the cavities are found in the dead areas and in the region where the main recirculating eddy is located this occurs because the dead areas are sheltered from the main channel consequently their mass exchange is limited and turbulence levels are lower than in the main channel sediments settle for the main recirculating eddy region the settling of sediments is attributed to the continuous mass exchange with the central channel combined with the increase of the residence time inside the cavity which increases the possibility of the sediments settling sediment deposits accumulated in the cavities are highly resilient to the high flow events it is observed that if an increase of flow discharge is applied to the channel and the initial discharge is then re established the initial configuration of the sediment deposits is generally recovered the speed in the process of recovery of the sediment patterns is dependent on the geometry of the cavities and on the unsteadiness of the high flow event applied partial re mobilization of the sediments corresponds to a quicker recovery of the sediment deposits the complete or partial re mobilization of the sediments trapped in the embayments is strongly dependent on the geometry of the cavities and on the unsteadiness of the high flow scenario low cavity aspect ratios ar i e long cavities favor the presence of large dead water zones and consequently sediments are trapped and sheltered even with high flow discharges cavities with high aspect ratios also act as shields for sediment deposits since they are largely decoupled from the flow in the central channel in contrast medium aspect ratios allow a complete flushing of the sediments settled in the cavities furthermore high roughness ratios rr a large distance between two cavities promote the trapping of sediments high trapping efficiency and the peak in the flowrate cannot completely re mobilize the sediment deposits the magnitude of the disruptive phase remains the most relevant parameter for the changes in the sediment deposits when considering the unsteadiness effect higher peaks introduce higher turbulence levels and sediments are prone to be re mobilized and consequently flushed the duration of the disruptive phase has a minor impact since the sediment deposits are quickly impacted and if this is the case flushed away from the cavities finally the gradual increase of flowrate yields the same mobilization of the sediments as an instantaneous increase of the flow discharge but with a milder tendency for this case the values of suspended sediment concentration recorded in the central channel are lower acknowledgments this work was funded bythe itn programme marie curie actions of the european union s seventh framework programme fp7 people 2013 itn under the rea grant

824,the extended method of moments emm is elaborated in recursive algorithmic form for the prediction of the effective diffusivity the taylor dispersion dyadic and the associated longitudinal high

kitanidis 1996 and channels with the periodically varying apertures bolster et al 2009 a good agreement between the b method and random walk computations has been reported bolster et al 2009 salles et

reached its asymptotic value already early works try to explain observed non gaussian curve chatwin 1970 suggests that the leading order deviation of the concentration solution approaching the final

mercer and roberts 1990 construct an asymptotic wavenumber expansion of the concentration solution in the fourier space and recursively reduce the eigenvalue problem to diffusion equations in stream wise uniform flow the inverse transform provides the high order one dimensional upscaled pde with time independent coefficients mercer and roberts 1990 also discuss its initial conditions and attempt to extend their methodology referred to as central manifold approach for the time dependent flow through varying apertures this approach was recently applied ngo cong et al 2015 to build the high order corrections in the logarithmic and power channel velocity profiles in the presence of the shear stress depending diffusion coefficient an improved agreement with the direct resolution has been reported for the 3 th 6 th order solution of the upscaled pde note that in some regard mercer and roberts 1990 result disagrees with frankel and brenner 1989 demonstration on the irrelevance of the high order correction approaching the taylor regime on the other side young and jones 1991 find that although the series expansion mercer and roberts 1990 improves the shorter time approximation it discards the exponentially decaying anomalous diffusion in the pre asymptotic dispersion regime followed after a pure diffusion spread and dominated by the transverse diffusion and longitudinal shearing for that regime lighthill 1966 derives the ballistic spread rate σ t 2 d t 2 valid before the solute starts to interact with the tube wall t 10 1 t d subsequently many different approaches have attempted to derive the longitudinal super diffusivity see review latini and bernoff 2001 which manifests very different pe dependencies in porous beds see bijeljic and blunt 2006 and review herein the recent derivations camassa et al 2010 latini and bernoff 2001 pannone 2012 pay a great deal of attention to the initial conditions latini bernoff extends the analysis lighthill 1966 from a

intermediate regime t d 1 3 t t d or equivalently pe 1 3 t t u l pe u l d 0 unfortunately their fourier derivation must obey free space boundary conditions and it cannot provide transition towards the taylor regime once the solute has reached the pipe boundary pannone 2012 employs the green s function method in the construction of the skewness transition and argues that the asymmetric injection explains the persisting asymmetry of the depth averaged profiles in shallow water channel flow transformed into laterally unbounded profiles using a stochastic approach camassa et al 2010 provide a way to establish a complete history of the variance evolution in pipe flows and determine péclet time scale of the pre asymptotic regime depending on the position of the initial release based on the monte carlo simulations camassa et al 2010 the authors suggest that the variance skewness and kurtosis has identical transition time scaling to the best of our knowledge despite these promising approaches a complete solution for the third and fourth order moments from the release to the asymptotic gaussian curve has not been constructed yet the emm extended method of moments vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 demonstrates that the skewness kurtosis and the higher order moments still deviate from their gaussian solution when the variance has reached the taylor regime even in the landmark example of the straight poiseuille flow after a line release in the present work we further elaborate on this method with focus on the heterogeneous soil modelling assume d dimensional periodic space

vegetation in shallow flow yang et al 2017 zeng et al 2011 by extending the classical approach aris 1956 brenner 1980a we aim to predict the averaged spatial moments ϕ 1 x n c ϕ at the same time we aim to predict the temporal moments t n p x t d t of the residence time distribution rtd due to danckwerts 1953 the rtd can be regarded in the following way assume that the inlet and outlet of a system are at x 0 and x l respectively the rtd is p l t t c l t where c x t is solution of eq 1 typically with the initial and boundary condition in the form of the heaviside step function c x 0 0 and c 0 t 1 see fig 1 the emm vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 develops the ideas of works vikhansky 2008 2011 vikhansky and macinnes 2010 vikhansky and wang 2011 for the prediction of the rtd assume ϕ r and u ϕ r be periodic along one direction of mean seepage velocity u x ϕ 1 u ϕ x the emm searches for the solution of eq 1 in the form of a product of the low frequency slow monochromatic wave and a streamwise periodic spatial component b ω γ r 2 c r t 1 2 π b ω γ r exp i γ x ω t substitution of ansatz 2 into eq 1 yields the steady state equation confined within a single cell with respect to the three unknowns i the oscillating scalar field b ω γ r ii the temporal frequency ω and iii the wavenumber spatial frequency γ we note that the recent method haynes and vanneste 2014 for the taylor dispersion is based on the similar ansatz and it results in a γ parametrised family of eigenvalue problems the emm tackles this problem in two different ways either b ω γ r and γ are both decomposed into series in powers of iω or b ω γ r and ω are both decomposed into series in powers of iγ 3a γ form b ω γ r n 0 b n r i ω n γ ω i n 1 γ n i ω n 3b ω form b ω γ r n 0 b n r i γ n ω γ i n 1 ω n i γ n eqs 3a and 3b are called vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 respectively temporal and spatial expansions the mathematical algorithms based upon will be referred to as the γ form and ω form in this work the b n r sequentially solves a recursive chain of steady state linear advection diffusion equations ade with the explicit space variable mass source the solvability condition of the total mass conservation determines the coefficients γn or ωn in γ form or ω form respectively it has been shown vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 that the temporal moments of the rtd become expressed via γn sufficiently far from the inlet whereas the spatial moments of the average concentration obtain asymptotic solution expressed via ωn moreover since the two expansions in eq 3a are not independent the two sets ωn and γn and therefore the two systems of moments become inter connected through simple algebraic expressions the emm allows to predict any spatial moment and any temporal moment by either using the ω form or the γ form in particular the emm predicts the following asymptotic behaviour for the longitudinal coefficients of the first raw moment μ 1 the variance σ 2 the skewness s k μ 3 σ 3 and the kurtosis ku μ 4 σ 4 3 4a μ 1 t u x t σ t 2 2 d t sk sk s t 1 2 ku ku s t 1 4b μ 1 x u x 1 x σ x 2 2 d u x 3 x sk sk t x 1 2 ku ku t x 1 these two asymptotic regimes apply to the spatial dispersion as t and to the temporal dispersion as x respectively the positive negative skewness quantifies the amplitude and direction right left of the distribution s tail with respect to the gaussian profile whereas the large valued positive valued kurtosis identifies its relative peakedness although the high order moments decay with time and distance they may manifest strong deviations from the gaussian values when t t u l pe or x x l pe our previous work vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 was mostly focused on the original γ form the first four moments in eq 4a were constructed for parabolic flow in a channel and a cylindrical capillary non newtonian power law flow in a capillary shallow flow through different cross section shapes and two stratified heterogeneous systems such as i darcy flow and ii parabolic flow through a straight and circular fracture adjacent to penetrable but purely diffusive matrix these first four moments allowed vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 for a reliable profile reconstruction in the taylor regime by adapting the entropy maximization method bandyopadhyay et al 2004 in the present work several constraints of the original formulation vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 are relaxed and the dimensional dimensionless closure problems are formulated for arbitrarily placed abrupt porosity interfaces and solid obstacles unlike in the case of the stratified heterogeneity the diffusive flux of continuous b field variable b n r undergoes the jumps on the streamwise penetrable interfaces and solid surfaces the ω form and γ form differ only in the source and interface terms but the ω form is simpler and more robust numerically due to these reasons and especially because the γ form becomes undefined at zero mean seepage velocity we focus on the ω form eq 3b in pure diffusion the ω form automatically predicts the effective diffusivity of the composite structure and quantifies its high order moments this simple and efficient technique offers an alternative to monte carlo simulations trinh et al 2000 numerical integration by random walks bolle et al 2000 finite element kim et al 1987 or lattice boltzmann direct simulations in saturated alvarez ramírez et al 1996 chai et al 2016 or unsaturated flow genty and pot 2014 the difference between the moment solution in given velocity field and zero velocity allows to separate the flow field and structure contributions the ω form is extended to full effective and dispersion tensors this method is further substantiated through a correct reduction of the dispersion problem to b equation brenner 1980a salles et al 1993 in microscopic flow and to the volume averaging closure procedure valdés parada et al 2016 whitaker 1999 in homogeneous porosity a tensorial extension to the next orders would require us to operate with the n rank tensors for the n order moments in this work we limit ourselves to the longitudinal values of the high order moments we note that although mercer and roberts 1990 do not relate the truncation corrections in upscaled pde with the high order distribution moments we show that the two approaches result in an equivalent recursive procedure and moments in uniform duct flow we further extend the list of the exact emm solutions firstly we construct the four moments in pure diffusion and uniform darcy velocity through two porous blocks in series since in that case the dispersion and high moments are intrinsically due to the diffusion process the pe scaling contrasts with the stratified parallel darcy system vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 secondly we construct the four moments in i single porous channel governed by brinkman flow and ii a fracture surrounded by either porous flow or diffusive matrix the focus is on the moment dependency upon i darcy number permeability ii porosity iii aspect ratio and iv effective brinkman viscosity applied in flow equation the poiseuille channel moments vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 are expressed in the spatial and temporal systems they serve as the reference for stratified porous flow it should be stressed that although the fracture matrix system is common with the works dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 the emm is principally different from the mobile immobile mim double porosity model gerke and van genuchten 1996 sharifi et al 2012 employed there with the mim the upscaled tracer evolution is represented through a coupled system of two governing ade with respect to the individual open and porous concentration fractions their exchange is mimicked through the semi heuristic source sink mass terms the emm will produce dispersion and higher order moments for the overall cross section averaged concentration the moments predicted by the emm the reconstructed rtd and mean concentration profiles have been compared vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 to the direct numerical solution of eq 1 by the independent trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 based on the two relaxation times trt lattice boltzmann method for advection diffusion equation ginzburg 2005 2007 2013 ginzburg and d humiéres 2007 hammou et al 2011 it has also been observed that a progressive extension of the moments set improves the agreement between numerical and reconstructed profiles at shorter time and distances in this work the symbolic solutions are compared with the two numerical models a direct solving of eq 1 with the trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 and a new scheme for numerical emm formulation based on the trt ade and called trt emm the trt ade has been recently applied batôt et al 2016 for the computation of the dispersion coefficient in herschel bulkley non newtonian profile it should be noted that the numerical formulation of the emm is much more efficient for prediction of the taylor regime moments than the direct simulations because the emm operates with steady state equations and within a single cell the trt emm is formulated for a multi dimensional heterogeneous flow in the accompanying paper where this scheme is first intensively examined with respect to the constructed analytical emm solutions on the one hand the symbolic solutions exemplify the methodology on the other hand they i allow for examination of the transport coefficients in full parameter space and ii provide benchmarks for direct numerical schemes where the moments of distribution may be spoiled ginzburg 2017 ginzburg and roux 2015 by the numerical truncation dispersion skewness and kurtosis moreover an extension following ginzburg 2017 of the emm to the fourth order accurate effective equations of any given ade scheme allows for an analytical derivation of the truncation corrections in moments such approach allowed ginzburg 2017 for identification of the functional form of the second order corrections in dt sk and ku in full parameter space of the trt ade scheme in pure diffusion and homogeneous flow the paper has the following plan section 2 extends the ω form for full molecular diffusion and dispersion tensors section 3 presents the mathematical algorithms for computation of the longitudinal dispersion and the associated high order moments focused on the skewness and kurtosis section 4 applies the emm through a series of porous blocks section 5 addresses uniform duct flow the emm is first simplified for duct flow in section 5 1 the symbolic solutions for the first four moments are then discussed in channel and radial poiseuille flow in section 5 2 stratified darcy flow in section 5 3 porous channel in section 5 4 and the two systems of open porous fracture matrix combination in section 5 5 section 6 concludes the paper further technical details are provided in appendix a and appendix b analytical solutions are gathered for darcy flow in series in c1 stratified darcy flow in

provided in appendix a in summary on the one side eqs 12a with eq 14 extend the emm method vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 for the full molecular diffusion and dispersion dyadic in the presence of a piece wise heterogeneity and solid boundary on the other side the emm extends the closure problems brenner 1980a valdés parada et al 2016 to heterogeneous anisotropic soil further extension for full tensors in the third order and fourth order moments would require us to expand eqs 11a in terms of the triadic ωαβγ and fourth order tensor ωαβγδ respectively to simplify we will develop this procedure only for the most relevant longitudinal diagonal components 3 the emm for longitudinal transport coefficients the emm is formulated for the computation of the longitudinal coefficients of the effective

without the requisite of periodicity for u ϕ r and ϕ r along the transverse directions the volume integration is defined with eq 5 the averaged seepage velocity u is defined with eq 6 in motion u x is assumed to be non zero and the x direction is called streamwise since we restrict ourselves to the longitudinal coefficients γ reduces to the scalar wavenumber γ and eq 9 reduces to eq 2 we also

solution b k r k n these terms are exemplified in eq b 1 the set ωn is built from the solvability condition m n 0 interface condition 20g and boundary condition 20h are prescribed with the normal vectors n n α respectively defined on the interface aϕ and solid boundary as within vϕ these conditions have accounted for the continuity of u ϕ on as and no slip velocity condition on as namely eq 20g enforces the normal component of the diffusive flux ϕ n b n to undergo a jump between any two heterogeneous porous blocks in series along the x axis but to be continuous between any two heterogeneous layers coplanar with the x axis on the remaining part of the external boundary the set b n r shares the periodicity and symmetry of the unit cell by means of eq 19b the terms ϕ k 1 n 1 ω

eq 8 performs with eq 14 3 3 discussion in summary one solves the closure problem 20a once for b 1 r and computes the total longitudinal dispersion coefficient d ω 2 in eq 24a with eq 21b for ω 2 in order to separate the taylor dispersion coefficient dt in eq 24a from the effective diffusivity d e f f one solves eq 20a twice with given velocity field u ϕ r and u ϕ 0 for skewness sk t in eq 24b one sequentially solves eq 20a with respect to b 1 r b 2 r and computes ω 3 with eq 21c for kurtosis ku t in eq 23 one solves eq 20a three times with respect to b 1 b 2 b 3 and determines ω 4 with eq 21c like any advection diffusion problem eq 20a can be worked out in the dimensionless form where it becomes determined by péclet number pe u 0 l d 0 prescribed with the characteristic size l and velocity u 0 see section 3 6 in the creeping flow e g governed by the linear stokes brinkman darcy equation brinkman 1947 iliev and rybak 2008 silva and ginzburg 2016 valdés parada et al 2007 u ϕ r can be computed once and rescaled to any desired value u 0 in inertial flow one needs to recompute u ϕ r and the closure problem 20a for the given reynolds number the closure problem should be recomputed when the selected streamwise direction changes we note that the b field solution becomes b n x and the odd order values ω 2 n 1 change the sign when u x u x it follows that in spatial moments the skewness sk t and the next odd order moments have the opposite signs in the case when the advection points in the opposite direction while the even order moments keep the same sign the longitudinal transport coefficients can be built independently by solving eq 20a for each basis axis in any given coordinate system the cross diagonal dispersion entries can be obtained by means of the full formulation from section 2 finally we note that eq 21a is derived without prescribing any a priori form for the upscaled macroscopic equation if one postulates 27 t c x t n 1 a n x n c x t c

hence a n ω n and in particular a 1 ω 1 u x and a 2 ω 2 d we demonstrate in section 5 that relation a n ω n agrees with the truncation coefficients derived mercer and roberts 1990 in the poiseuille profile the emm finds the system of moments of the averaged distribution without formulating and solving of the high order pde 3 4 the γ form the γ form searches for solution of eq 18 with the help of the temporal expansion 3a without loss of generality we replace b n r in eq 3a by the normalized set b n r which obeys the periodic condition 20f and normalized condition 19b we then substitute eq 3a into eq 18 and equate the term of iω n this gives us eq 20a where mass source components become 28 m n r m n r s n r γ n u ϕ x n 1 m 1 ϕ s 1 0 r v ϕ m n r k 1 n 1 ϕ δ 1 k γ k u ϕ x b n k d ϕ k 1 n m 1

x x u x it has been argued vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 that their asymptotic solution can be predicted from the set γn in the quasi steady taylor regime obeying eq 4a 33 μ 1 x γ 1 x μ 2 x 2 γ 2 x μ 3

becomes b n x and the whole set γn changes the sign when u x u x it follows that sk x ku x and all higher order temporal moments have the same solution with the opposite velocity at a signed distance x from the inlet the derivation vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 of eq 35 assumed the heaviside step function injection c x 0 t h t a larger validity of eq 33 can be suggested sufficiently far from the inlet for example one can think about the solute injection into a fractured open part of the inlet cross section it is emphasized that the γ form is not defined when u x 0 d eff should be computed with the ω form by means of eq 14 with u ϕ 0 however in motion the total dispersion coefficient d in eq 35 coincides with its solution in eq 22 due to inter relations between the two forms discussed below 3 5 the γ form and ω form interconnections when u x 0 ω 1 0 and γ 1 is not defined otherwise plugging eq 3a into eq 3b and vise verse the two forms are related through the following transforms 36a ω 1 1 γ 1 ω 2 γ 2 γ 1 3 ω 3 2 γ 2 2 γ 1 γ 3 γ 1 5 ω 4 5 γ 2 3 5 γ 1 γ 2 γ 3 γ 1 2 γ 4 γ 1 7 36b γ 1 1 ω 1 γ 2 ω 2 ω 1 3 γ 3 2 ω 2 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω 1 5 γ 4 5 ω 2 3 5 ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 1 2 ω 4 ω 1 7 therefore if one set is found the other one can be computed from it with eq 36a moreover we establish with the help of eq 36a that the following relations exist between the solutions in the two forms 37 b 1 γ γ 1 b 1 ω b 2 γ γ 1 2 b 2 ω γ 2 b 1 ω b 3 γ γ 1 3 b 3 ω 2 γ 1 γ 2 b 2 ω γ 3 b 1 ω this is because the terms j n γ and j n ω are inter related with the linear combinations 37 and similar linear combinations relate the mass source terms m n γ and m n ω see eq b 4 in these relations γn can be expressed via ωn with eq 36b thereby the two closure problems are linearly inter related and the solution of γ form can be restored from the solution in ω form and vise verse hence in theory the solutions for the transport coefficients are the same with the two forms except when u x 0 we suggest that the two forms will produce identical numerical moments provided that their discrete equations including their truncation terms remain exactly related with eqs 37 and b 4 this suggestion is confirmed on the solutions of the trt emm numerical formulation in stratified channels and blocks in series 3 6 dimensionless equations giving a characteristic length l and a positive velocity u 0

impermeable boundary we define the following dimensionless coefficients for dispersion skewness and kurtosis 42a k t d 0 d d 0 1 ω 2 pe 1 u x 3 u 0 3 γ 2 pe 1 pe u 0 l d 0 42b sk s sk t u 0 t l 3 ω 3

closure problem 38 41 one gets the set ω n and obtains from it the set γ n with the help of eq 40b when solutions ω n and γ n are found the coefficients in eq 42a become all expressed through pe and the dimensionless parameters of the problem such as the aspect ratio porosity and permeability contrasts on top of the flow governing parameters like the darcy number in brinkman darcy equation or the reynolds number in navier stokes equation when changing the characteristic length and velocity say to l l r l and u u 0 r u in eqs 39 and 42a the dimensionless coefficients from eqs 39 and 42a

u x and γn grows much faster than ωn for n 1 this property makes the ω form more suitable for numerical implementation besides the ω form is simpler and it allows for the consideration of the pure diffusion in eq 1 in general one needs to solve the closure system at given pe however when the pe dependency is known for ω n one may solve the closure problem once for a given geometry and flow and then rescale the solution to any pe for example the asymptotic solution in a stratified streamwise uniform duct flow vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 scales as 46a pe ω n pe n 1 γ n pe n 1 n 1 k t p e 2

eq 46a will remain valid in a streamwise uniform porous flows but this asymptotic behaviour will principally differ in the darcy flow through porous obstacles in series 3 7 reconstruction of the

respectively in terms of the dimensionless coefficients 42a in streamwise uniform duct flow the normalized profiles become asymptotically auto similar for x pe and t pe due to eq 46a 4 two porous

the dimensionless coefficients d r and ku s can be expressed in terms of the porosity ratio rϕ and length ratio rh using the characteristic diffusion time td 52a d e f f d r d 0 d r 1 r h 2 r ϕ r h r

fig 4 it is shown that ku s and hence the peakedness of the profiles increases with the porosity contrast but its dependency upon rh is not monotonous ku s increases when the less porous block is relatively narrow but then ku s decays with its length in the two next diagrams in fig 4 the normalized numerical profiles σ t c x t x x x 0 σ t σ t 2 d t are monitored at time t t d h 2 d 0 when ku s has reached its steady state value these profiles are obtained from the direct diffusion simulation of eq 1 with the trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 through a chain of periodic cells each cell is composed of two equal length blocks with porosity contrast rϕ these two diagrams demonstrate that the symmetric deviation from the gaussian distribution which is parabolic in log scale due to ku s 0 increases with the porosity ratio mean concentration profiles become sharper at the center and manifest longer tails on the periphery 4 2 darcy flow in series when the pressure gradient p is applied through porous blocks of different porosity and permeability in series the darcy velocity u ϕ u ϕ x in eq 1 is constant u ϕ x k p ν ρ 0 with the length weighted harmonic mean effective

after a point release their temporal counterparts from eq 35 sk x and ku x can be obtained with eq 36b they characterize the evolution of the rtd eq 31a under the heaviside step function input the same solution for all transport coefficients can be obtained with eqs 28 in γ form the dimensionless coefficients kt sk s and ku s sk t and ku t are obtained with eq 42a giving l and u 0 they can also be restored from the non dimensional coefficients ω 2 ω 2 u 0 l ω 3 u 0 l 2 and ω 4 u 0 l 3 γ 3 and γ 4 are computed from them with eq 40b equivalently eq 53 can be solved in the dimensionless form 41 the transport coefficients are determined by the porosity ratio r ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 aspect ratio r h h 1 h 2 and péclet number pe u 0 l d 0 they are identical with respect to the simultaneous transform rh 1 rh and rϕ 1 rϕ starting from ω 1 1 the following asymptotic scaling takes place when pe 56 ω 2 pe 1 ω 3 pe 2 ω n pe 1 n and γ n pe 1 n n 1 k t c o n s t sk pe 1 ku pe 1 thereby kt is asymptotically constant and all other transport coefficient decay with pe to be contrasted with the streamwise uniform duct structures where all these coefficients grow with pe eq 46a for example giving l h and u 0

other characteristic system performs with eq 44 finally we underline that although the jump term j n and the mass source term s n scale as pe 1 in eq 41 these terms cannot be omitted even in the asymptotic limit because ω n behaves as pe n and ω 2 scales itself as pe 1 eq 57 4 2 1 dispersion the dispersion coefficient k t d 0 is defined with eq 42a and it vanishes in homogeneous blocks r ϕ 1 rh 0 or rh when d e f f d 0 and d r 0 otherwise it is convenient to measure kt with respect to d e f f from eq 52a the two definitions k t d 0 ω 2 pe 1 and k t d e f f are related by means of eq 43 k

advection process and it scales as pe2 fig 5 demonstrates that k t d e f f monotonously increases with pe towards its asymptotic solution 59a k t d e f f increases with porosity contrast here when rϕ 0 and it reaches its asymptotic limit at the larger pe in the case of higher porosity contrast the last diagram of fig 5 shows that the asymptotic limit is not monotonous with rh at fixed rϕ the same asymptotic dispersion value may correspond to rh 1 and rh 1 the maximum of the dispersion coefficient is located at rh 1 when a smaller porosity block is relatively thick and it is shifted to rh 1 h 1 h 2 when ϕ 1 ϕ 2 4 2 2 skewness the positive negative skewness characterizes the asymmetry of the profile and accordingly the amplitude of its tail right left to the maximum point the skewness coefficient sk s from eq 42a is computed with ω 2 and ω 3 from eqs c 1 c 2 sk t is computed with the help of eq 40b the two coefficients have the following limits 60a lim p e sk s pe 3 2 r h r h 1 r ϕ

dispersion an uniform system r ϕ 1 reduces to the gaussian solution for a point release with sk s ku s 0 accordingly in temporal dispersion it reduces to exact rtd solution of eq 1 with d d 0 k t 0 sk t 3 2 1 k t pe 1 and ku t 30 1 k t pe 1 for the heaviside inlet see for example vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 eq 54 with their notation sk g sk t pe 1 ku g ku t pe 1 the principal difference with the duct flow is that in series sk s and sk t vanish as pe increases whereas they both grow as pe in pipes the symbolic solutions in series were also extended for kurtosis their expressions are lengthy but they are exemplified in table 1 for reconstructed profiles presented in figs 6 and 7 table 1 shows that at the intermediate pe value pe 114 the amplitudes of all transport coefficients are much smaller in series of two equal length blocks and they are far less r ϕ dependent against the stratified flow the sk s and sk t are displayed respectively in figs 6 and 7 versus pe 0 5 102 when r h 1 in the first diagram and versus rh when pe 10 2 in the last diagram the two coefficients sk s p e and sk t p e in the first diagrams monotonously approach their asymptotic infinite pe values at the same time the two skewness coefficients are not monotonous with rh and rϕ as pe grows sk s is negative and sk t is positive the spatial profiles are expected to be skewed right while the rtd profiles are expected to be skewed left the normalized mean concentration profiles σ t c x t in fig 6 are reconstructed from sk s and ku s at pe 113 4 at t t pe t h u x they almost coincide with the normalized gaussian profiles sk s ku s 0 because of the very small high order transport coefficients in series r ϕ 1 2 has the largest value sk s in this example the rtd profiles σxp x τ in figs 7 are reconstructed from sk t and ku t they are also indistinguishable from the gaussian rtd nevertheless although the darcy flow in the stratified system in section 5 3 exhibits much stronger non gaussian behaviour for the same physical parameters the darcy flow in series presents a valuable numerical test for second third and fourth order central moments the effective diffusion coefficient d e f f eq 52a should be exact solution of the second order moment with any direct ade solver of eq 1 and any emm numerical formulation the ku s from eq 52c is generally not exact because of the fourth order truncation error summation and possibly interface corrections for example the trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 in fig 4 with a free parameter space exact ginzburg 2017 for kurtosis in homogeneous soil yields the relative error e ku s 3 10 5 5 67 10 3 for porosity contrast r ϕ 10 2 1 2 in two equal blocks of thickness h 2 20 using a typical model parameter range we note that the smaller diffusion coefficients higher porosity contrasts behave more accurately in this case in the presence of the darcy flow in series the numerical methods deal with the streamwise heterogeneity and the numerical formulation of the emm method like the trt emm scheme should incorporate the interface flux jump condition fig 8 displays the moments extracted from the direct numerical computations with the trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 and the transport coefficients computed from the numerical solution ωn with the trt emm the numerical results and emm analytical predictions agree on the pe shape for three coefficients k t d e f f sk s and ku s however the two numerical methods require relatively fine grids and their accuracy typically deteriorates with the porosity contrast in this example the detailed analysis is addressed in our parallel work one key point for numerical accuracy in this configuration is the precise location of the interface continuity conditions which is mimicked in the two schemes because of their implicitness with respect to interface location similar to implicit heterogeneous flow models ginzburg et al 2015 the analytical solutions for dispersion and high order moments in series allow for detailed examination of the numerical schemes because it is challenging to capture accurately the relatively weak deviations from the second order gaussian

remains the same and sk t ku t are computed with eq 42c by means of the transform 40b from ω n to γ n we first provide the reference poiseuille channel solution in section 5 2 and derive explicit relations between the ωn and the coefficients of the high order corrections in upscaled pde mercer and roberts 1990 section 5 3 compares the transport coefficients in constant darcy flow through the

rtd are restored from the set of the first four moments with eq 47 and displayed in fig 10 for pe 7 4 74 740 the log scale helps to distinguish them from the asymptotic gaussian distribution see also fig 1 since sk s is negative and sk t is positive σ t c x t is skewed right while σxp x τ is skewed left the spatial profiles σ t c x t become pe independent when t pe the rtd profiles σp x τ become

elaborated and compared to solutions for the perpendicular darcy flow in series from section 4 2 like in series the transport coefficients are determined by the porosity ratio rϕ aspect ratio rh and pe they are identical with respect to the simultaneous transform rh 1 rh and rϕ 1 rϕ in the stratified system d e f f d 0 and the dispersion coefficient 42a reads 69 k t p e 2 r h 2 r ϕ 1 2 r h r ϕ 12

and the same pe fig 11 displays kt from eq 69 in similar configurations as in fig 5 these two figures show that in the stratified system kt is one two orders of the magnitude greater in the interval pe 0 102 than in series since kt grows as pe2 in parallel layers the darcy flow through a stratified system becomes infinitely more disperse with pe the last diagram of fig 11 demonstrates that the behaviour k t pe 2 versus rh is also non monotonous cf the last diagram in fig 5 but far less asymmetric the sk s and sk t from eqs 42b and 42c have the following limits in the stratified system 70a lim p e pe 1 2 sk s 3 2 r h 2 r h r ϕ 3 r ϕ 2 3 2 r ϕ sgn r ϕ 1 5 r h 1 r ϕ r h r ϕ r h r ϕ 1 70b lim p e pe 1 2 sk s r h 1 r ϕ 1 3 3 2 10 r ϕ o r ϕ 5 2 and 71a lim p e pe 1 2 sk t 3 2 r h r ϕ 1 r h 2

1 sk t 3 2 pe 1 the sk s pe 1 2 and sk t pe 1 2 are respectively displayed in figs 12 and 13 versus pe 0 102 when r h 1 in the first diagram and versus rh in the asymptotic infinite pe limit in the last diagram the two solutions can be compared to their perpendicular darcy flow counterparts displayed in figs 6 and 7 the principal difference between the two systems is that in series sk s and sk t vanish as pe increases whereas they both grow as pe in a stratified system further in series the two coefficients effectively approach their asymptotic values sk s pe and sk t pe at much higher value pe lim than for sk s pe 1 2 and sk t pe 1 2 in the stratified system pe lim increases with porosity contrast in series e g pe lim 106 when r ϕ 10 2 while the reverse happens in the stratified channel in the two systems the skewness coefficients are not monotonous with rh their amplitudes rapidly increase when rh is relatively small here the less porous layer is thinner and then they decay with rh the symbolic solutions for kurtosis are lengthy see for example ku ku t pe 1 r h 1 given by eq 75 in vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 as one example all transport coefficients are exemplified in table 1 for reconstructed normalized profiles presented in figs 12 and 13 at pe 114 as pe grows sk s is positive and sk t is negative in the stratified layers for high porosity contrast again this is reversed in the perpendicular flow see table 1 the mean concentration profiles in parallel flow are noticeably skewed left in fig 12 due to their large positive values sk s and their sharpness still increases with the porosity contrast the rtd in fig 13 are skewed right according to their negative values sk t and they have heavy tails before the peak clearly observable in the log scale the rtd would become much more asymmetric for r ϕ 10 2 against r ϕ 1 2 at the same distance x h pe however the profiles are then so sharp that the first four moments are insufficient for their reliable reconstruction due to this reason the rtd are displayed in fig 13 at the progressively larger distances as x h 10 pe 3 pe when r ϕ 10 2 1 3 accordingly since they practically coincide with the rtd profile r ϕ 10 1 monitored at x h pe one may suggest that sk t r h 1 r ϕ 1 this observation agrees with the leading order term in eq 71b in summary constant darcy flow through the stratified layers gives us a very illustrative example where a non trivial non gaussian behaviour happens solely due to heterogeneity of the structure although the asymmetric effects are much stronger this configuration is numerically simpler than the cross flow through porous blocks in series because the diffusion flux of the b field variable is continuous on the stratified interface the stratified darcy flow is also much simpler algebraically and the emm allows for a large set of the moments to be computed symbolically a consistent improving in reconstruction of the sharp profiles with respect to the direct numerical solutions of the mean concentration and residence time distributions is achieved vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 by symbolically extending the emm sets of moments to the order n 8 we suggest that this set of moments can be further employed to verify the applicability range of the emm in transition at a progressively shorter time after release and closer to inlet 5 4 single porous channel consider a straight single channel of porosity ϕ and permeability k bounded by two impermeable solid walls at y h 2 the velocity profile u ϕ x y solves brinkman equation brinkman 1947 in the form ginzburg et al

to the parabolic poiseuille flow the opposite limit σ corresponds to a flat darcy flow coupled with zero boundary values since u ϕ x y is proportional to ϕ at fixed σ the dimensionless form of eq 1 becomes ϕ independent and controlled by σ and pe u x h d 0 we apply the dimensionless ω form with eq 63a subject to the no flux boundary condition y b n y 1 2 0 substituting the velocity profile 73 eqs 63a 63c factorize ϕ and the dimensionless transport coefficients become governed by σ and pe the dimensionless solution b n y to eq 63a 63c takes the following form in terms of the n order

however it should be noted that since pe is measured with the mean seepage velocity u x ϕ 1 see eq 73 pe increases when ϕ decreases at a fixed pressure gradient value fig 14 displays in the leftmost diagram the ratio k t σ k t p and shows that k t σ pe 2 monotonously diminishes when σ increases from the stokes to the darcy regime that is the dispersion coefficient decreases with the darcy number at fixed pe fig 14illustrates in the middle diagram the role of f ϕ on the dimensionless velocity profile u ϕ 1 u ϕ x y in the transition zone d a 10 4 since σ decreases with f ϕ the normalized profile u ϕ 1 u ϕ x y shapes more parabolic for smaller f ϕ fig 14illustrates in the last diagram the role of f ϕ on the ratio k t σ k t p at fixed da in agreement with eq 75 k t σ pe 2 decreases when f ϕ increases that means that because of the brinkman viscosity factor k t σ becomes larger for smaller porosity at fixed da and pe the coefficients ω 3 and ω 4 are given in eqs c 5 and c 6 respectively in terms of σ and pe they respect the asymptotic scaling 46a and reduce to poiseuille values ω 3 p and ω 4 p from table 2 in stokes regime σ 0 the coefficients sk s pe σ and ku s pe σ are computed with eq 42b their asymptotic pe scaling obeys eq 46b the series expansion in powers of σ in eqs 75 c 5 and c 6 provides their deviation from the open flow in stokes brinkman regime fig 15 displays r sk s σ pe sk s sk s p and r ku s σ pe r ku s σ pe ku s ku s p versus pe at the fixed value σ 1 10 10 2 10 3 together with the corresponding velocity profile 73 the sk s has the same negative sign as in open flow but ku s may change its sign we observe that r sk s and r ku s have a similar pe schape at small and intermediate pe r sk s and r ku s reduce from 1 in stokes regime towards zero in darcy zone i e when the soil becomes less permeable the non gaussian effects decay with respect to the open flow solution at the same pe however the amplitudes r sk s pe and r ku s pe then increase with pe their asymptotic σ dependent limit pe is displayed in the last diagram of fig 16 fig 15 confirms that solution effectively reaches this σ dependent asymptotic limit at high pe asymptotically in the darcy zone the ratio to open flow becomes 76 pe σ r sk s 22 2 35 5 26 r ku s 286 147 1 95 eq 76 predicts the profiles to become more asymmetric and sharper than in open flow where ku s p 0 at very high pe and very small da the profiles σ t c x t are illustrated at t t 0 49pe in the left diagram of fig 17 when σ 10 2 d a 10 4 and together for pe 7 4 74 740 the reconstruction confirms that the profiles practically coincide between them and with the gaussian profile at pe 7 4 74 because of the very small high moments values but σ t c x t becomes much more skewed right and sharper at pe 740 where r sk s 4 42 and ku s 1 27 the coefficients sk t and ku t of the temporal dispersion are computed from eq 42c with the help of eq 36b their respective ratios to the open flow value r sk t σ pe and r ku t σ pe are displayed in two first diagrams in fig 16 these rtd coefficients have the same sign as in open flow like in the spatial dispersion the skewness and kurtosis are shaped similarly but their behaviour with pe is not monotonous r sk t σ pe and r ku t σ pe have a minimum at pe 10 102 along the intermediate and high pe range the amplitude of r sk t σ pe is much smaller than in the spatial moment the asymptotic high pe limit is displayed versus σ in the last diagram of fig 16 it largest deviation from the open flow happens in the darcy limit with 77 pe σ r sk t 22 29 14 5 1 27 r ku t 572 291 1 96 the reconstructed profiles log σxp x τ in fig 17 illustrate the non monotonous pe behaviour of the high moments here pe 7 4 740 have similar values with r sk t 1 r ku t 1 and very similar shapes around the poiseuille profile at the same time pe 74 is only slightly more asymmetric than the auto similar gaussian rtd in open channel we verify the analytical solutions for kt sk s and ku s in a single porous channel using direct numerical simulations with the trt ade and the trt emm numerical formulation we fix σ 25 in the transition brinkman flow regime and vary pe 2 05 73 8 the results displayed in fig 18 show that two schemes agree on the pe shape with the predicted solution for the three transport coefficients when σ reduces to zero in open flow the agreement improves this is in contrast to the darcy flow where the numerical schemes manifest a progressive worsening of the accuracy with σ because the transport coefficients have very small amplitudes in darcy zone at small pe 10 in summary the dimensionless transport coefficients in single porous channel are determined by σ and pe the porosity enters them implicitly through u x via pe and through f ϕ via σ the relative dispersivity k t pe 2 is predicted to decrease from the stokes to darcy regime and to increase at the fixed da when f ϕ decreases with ϕ in stokes brinkman regime at small and intermediate pe the averaged concentration and rtd profiles are expected to be similar to the gaussian distribution and smoother than in open flow at the same pe asymptotically at high pe in the darcy flow the rtd profiles are only slightly sharper than their poiseuille flow solution at the same time the averaged concentration profiles become much more asymmetric because of the long time mixing in boundary layers 5 5 coupled system of a fracture and porous matrix we consider a bounded stratified system composed of an open fracture straight channel surrounded by two equivalent porous layers such model situation has been considered with the mobile immobile mim approach dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 in the case when the matrix is purely diffusive dejam et al 2014 or when matrix flow is described by the brinkman equation ling et al 2016 unlike with the mim the emm does not postulate any exchange between the matrix averaged and fracture averaged concentrations the emm provides solution for the dispersion coefficient in upscaled eq 7 for the mean concentration averaged over the whole open and porous cross section this total dispersion

the corresponding poiseuille flow solution from table 3 as ϕ 0 when the matrix becomes impenetrable 5 5 3 fracture embedded in a purely diffusive matrix when the permeability k becomes infinitely small the transport in matrix approaches a pure diffusion process with um y 0 this three layered configuration is very similar but not identical to the two layered open diffusive matrix system

u x u b r b ϕ r b y y b 0 2 the two matrix flow governing parameters σ and f ϕ vanish and all transport coefficients become determined by pe ϕ and r b b h eqs 84 apply with the profile 87 and um y 0 then b n m y p 2 n y and b n f p 4 n y the interface and boundary conditions remain the same the dispersion coefficient kt is denoted k t d pe and it is derived with eq 86 88 k t d pe pe 2 51 ϕ 2 r b ϕ 18 r b 2 35 2 r b 3 420 r b 1 2 ϕ r b pe 2 h u x 1 r b d 0 k t d r b k t p pe 2 210 k t d ϕ 0 pe 2 210 r b 2 1 r b 2 in this system peb from eq 83a becomes ϕ and h independent in terms of peb from eq 83b the dispersion coefficient k t d pe reads as 89 k t b p e b p e b 2 51 ϕ 2 r b ϕ 18 r b 2 35 2 r b 3 105 ϕ r b 3 p e b u b b d 0 k t b ϕ 0 k t p 2 p e b 2 105 k t b k t p ϕ 0 1 r b it should be stressed that because of the diffusion into surrounding matrix k t b exceeds the open flow value k t p and reduces to it as ϕ 0 fig 20 illustrates k t d from eq 88 for four porosity values left diagram displays the pe independent ratio k t d k t p versus rb k t d monotonously increases with ϕ and converges to k t p when rb however k t d k t p is not monotonous with respect to rb and unlike k t b in eq 89 k t d may become smaller than k t p at the same pe u x e g at the same mean velocity value u x in the coupled system and in the large open channel of width 2 h 1 r b the middle diagram of fig 20 displays the monotonously increasing function ϕ m a x d r b 0 1 4 k t d k t p when ϕ 0 ϕ m a x d and k t d k t p when ϕ ϕ m a x d 1 since ϕ m a x d r b is very sharp in the most realistic region rb 1 then practically k t d k t p the right diagram displays the ratio of the diffusion coefficients d d p versus pe in the case r b 1 5 here d d p 1 when ϕ 10 2 ϕ m a x d r b 1 5 0 017 d d p 1 otherwise the matrix effect becomes noticeable as pe 10 and the ratio of the diffusion values approaches its finite asymptotic limit d d p k t d k t p figs 21 illustrates the p e b independent ratio k t b k t p here k t b k t p 1 and it converges to 1 when rb eq 89 this system is not well defined in the limit rb 0 when the fracture vanishes to be contrasted with k t d k t b is not monotonous with ϕ at fixed rb the middle diagram displays its maximum point ϕ m a x b r b which increases from 0 to 0 92 when rb 0 1 but ϕ m a x b is very small when rb 1 it follows that when the fracture is much thinner than the matrix k t b k t p practically decreases when ϕ increases at the same peb this is to be contrasted with the k t d k t p which decreases with ϕ at the same pe the right diagram of fig 21 displays the ratio of the diffusion values d d p 1 k t b 1 k t p versus peb for r b 1 5 it appears that unlike in fig 20 the dispersion effect is not monotonous with ϕ it becomes noticeable as peb 1 and the d d p converges to the finite limit equal to k t b k t p when peb grows the spatial coefficients sk s and ku s are derived with eq 42a from ω 3 ω 4 given by eqs c 8 and c 9 their temporal counterparts sk t and ku t are built with the help of eq 40b the asymptotic pe scale obeys eqs 46b typically the transport coefficients approach this limit as pe 102 assuming the same value pe u x in the coupled and open systems we examine four pe independent asymptotic ratios determined by ϕ and rb r sk s sk s sk s p r sk t sk t sk t p and r ku s ku s ku s p r ku t ku t ku t p the first diagram of fig 22 displays the four functions together versus rb they rapidly converge to 1 when the relative matrix effect diminishes as rb 2 here the behaviour with rb is however not monotonous when rb 2 especially at very small value ϕ like ϕ 10 2 shown here the first diagram of fig 23 displays the four functions versus ϕ at r b 10 1 it tells us that when ϕ diminishes a stronger asymmetry than in open flow at the same pe u x might be expected for mean concentration profiles while the rtd may become much sharper because respectively sk s and ku t increase rapidly when ϕ 0 since the aspect ratio effect is not monotonous the high order effects in the limit ϕ 0 may have larger amplitudes when the fracture is relatively thicker here with r b 10 1 against r b 10 2 basically we observe that sk t and ku t have the same sign like in open flow whereas sk s and ku s may change it the relative difference r sk t is smaller than r sk s like in a single porous channel see figs 15 and 16 the two last diagrams in fig 22 present the reconstructed mean concentration profiles in the case where sk s changes its sign r sk s ϕ 1 2 5 6 and hence sk s 0 because sk s p 0 in open flow and r sk s ϕ 1 4 8 35 the profiles are accordingly skewed left and right with respect to solution in the poiseuille profile and they are flatter because r ku s 10 and ku s 0 in open flow it is interesting that in these two configurations with r b 1 3 the small valued pe has the largest deviation from the open flow e g r sk s 1 2 when pe 74 740 the two last diagrams in fig 23 display the reconstructed rtd profiles at pe 740 and compare them with the open flow the results with pe 74 are nearly the same the peakedness increases from ϕ 1 2 to ϕ 1 4 in agreement with the prediction in the first diagram of fig 23 at the same time very sharp reconstructed profiles often manifest a non monotonous decreasing branch most likely because the first four moments become insufficient this typically happens when the rtd profiles are reconstructed close to the inlet x h pe see examples vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 in summary dispersion coefficient of the cell averaged concentration c x t k t d pe in eq 88 and k t b p e b in eq 89 scale respectively as pe2 and p e b 2 the proportionality constant is determined by ϕ and rb the function k t d pe monotonously increases with ϕ and if the coupled system and a large open channel of the total width l 2 h 1 r b have the same seepage velocities k t d pe will exceed k t p when ϕ ϕ m a x d r b ϕ m a x d r b 0 when rb 1 and ϕ m a x d r b 1 4 when rb 1 the behaviour with rb is not monotonous and k t d pe converges to the poiseuille limit k t p pe 2 210 as rb on the other side at the same value peb e g when the coupled system and the poiseuille channel of the width 2b have the same averaged velocity k t b always exceeds k t p due to diffusion into the surrounding matrix to be contrasted with the ratio k t d k t p the k t b k t p decreases with ϕ when rb 1 thereby the diffusive layer may enhance or diminish the taylor dispersion coefficient of the open flow depending on the definition of the reference péclet number in the two systems the rtd is predicted to become much sharper when ϕ decreases but to retain the asymmetry of the open profile remains skewed left in contrast the skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration may change the sign with the matrix porosity all these effects are non monotonous with the aspect ratio rb we find that the porosity and geometry dependency of the transport coefficients in this limit configuration are interesting to take into consideration in the optimal design with respect to the desired dispersion and tailing in artificial porous systems and composite materials 5 5 4 a fracture embedded in porous flow the dispersion coefficient kt denoted by k t m f hereafter is determined with eq 86 in terms of the five governing dimensionless parameters pe σ rb ϕ and f ϕ k t m f scales as pe2 and it has the following limits 90 k t m f r b 0 k t σ σ pe k t m f r b 0 σ 0 k t m f r b k t p pe k t m f σ k t d pe ϕ r b k t b p e b ϕ r b where k t σ corresponds to single porous channel of width l 2 h in eq 75 k t p is poiseuille value k t d and k t b are solutions in a purely diffusive matrix eqs 88 and 89 respectively the symbolic expression of k t m f is lengthy and it is illustrated in two dimensionless systems pe σ and peb λb the first diagram of fig 24 displays k t m f k t p towards σ f ϕ 1 d a 1 2 assuming the same pe in the two systems when ϕ 10 1 and for four different values r b 10 3 1 when σ 0 k t m f converges to k t p when σ k t m f converges to k t d the dependency upon σ is not monotonous k t m f has the minimum at σ min rb its value increases when rb diminishes the purely diffusive limit is reached from below and when the fracture is relatively thinner the limit is reached at larger σ towards the darcy zone σ when σ σ min rb the matrix dominates the fracture and k t m f behaves similarly to the single porous channel in fig 14 k t d overestimates k t m f in the transition to darcy flow the last diagram of fig 24 shows that the magnitude of k t m f may increase by the factor of 10 in the transition regime σ 1 10 2 when d a f ϕ σ 2 decreases with f ϕ ϕ the second diagram of fig 24 displays k t m f k t p at the same peb versus λb since λb rbσ decreases with rb the ratio k t m f k t p becomes clearly sub divided into two zones k t m f k t p decreases with λb is the stokes brinkman regime λb λb min 3 and then increases with λb for brinkman darcy flow at the same time k t m f k t p increases when the fracture becomes relatively thinner and k t m f k t p p e b when rb 1 through all flow regimes fig 25 presents similar analysis when r b 10 1 and the porosity varies ϕ 10 2 1 2 the first diagram confirms that the purely diffusion limit k t d k t p is reached from below when σ however k t m f exceeds k t d in the stokes brinkman regime especially when ϕ is small the purely diffusion limit is reached at larger σ smaller da when ϕ is smaller the last diagram of fig 25 shows that σ ϕ d a reduces with f ϕ ϕ and k t m f approaches its purely diffusive limit at almost the same σ for all porosity values in the second diagram k t m f k t p is plotted versus λb at the same peb the results look qualitatively similar but they confirm that k t m f k t p like in a purely diffusive case for all porosity values when rb 1 fig 26 illustrates the non monotonous behaviour with λb for 1 k t m f 1 k t p displayed in the two first diagrams versus pe and peb respectively the last diagram plots the corresponding ratio pe peb it is shown that this dispersion ratio decreases when small λb increases but then it increases with λb and reaches the asymptotic diffusive value predicted by eq 88 from below when λb 100 fig 27 displays the evolution of the amplitude sk s sk s p versus pe when σ increases from σ 1 stokes flow to σ 10 3 darcy flow at r b 10 1 the results are displayed for ϕ 1 2 and ϕ 10 1 respectively in the two first diagrams they can be compared with a single porous channel in fig 15 where this ratio reduces from 1 in stokes flow to very small values within intermediate pe in darcy flow and then exceeds 1 and obeys eq 76 in the asymptotic pe limit in the presence of heterogeneity sk s sk s p may become relatively large at small pe in the darcy zone where sk s effectively reaches its asymptotic purely diffusive limit at σ 103 and the diffusive matrix analysis then applies through the darcy zone σ it should be said that whereas in a single porous channel the transport coefficients are independent of the porosity and determined by pe and σ the dependency upon ϕ becomes complicated and non monotonous in the coupled system the two first diagrams in fig 27 show that the amplitude sk s sk s p does not necessarily increase when ϕ decreases in compliance with the asymptotic high pe behaviour of sk s sk s p with porosity in fig 23 the asymptotic pe behaviour becomes similar to the single porous channel sk s sk s p becomes confined to the interval around 1 5 in agreement with the last diagram of fig 16 and eq 76 the last diagram of fig 27 displays the ratio sk t sk t p in the rtd profiles like in the case of the porous channel in figs 15 and 16 the deviation from the open flow is much smaller than with the spatial moments however it is monotonous with σ and increases in the darcy zone for all pe unlike with the single porous channel in fig 16 the purely diffusive asymptotic regime is reached at σ 103 like in the spatial system and it predicts a slightly larger asymmetry than in the single porous channel with sk t sk t p 2 3 against r sk t 1 3 eq 77 now the transport coefficients are built with the symbolic procedure from section 5 5 2 and employed for comparison with the trt emm and trt ade schemes in a channel of total width 2 b h 30 with the fracture half thickness b 5 the corresponding normalized velocity profile is illustrated in the first diagram in fig 28 for three typical values σ 1 10 10 2 respectively in stokes brinkman and darcy flow the numerical results are compared to the emm prediction in fig 28 together for ϕ 1 2 pe 31 97 and ϕ 10 1 pe 18 46 numerical results confirm the analytically established dependency with σ in all three coefficients the last diagram in fig 28 confirms that the two schemes agree for kurtosis where we limit the comparison with the analytic predictions to the asymptotic purely diffusive limit σ in that case eqs c 8 c 9 allow for computation of the skewness and kurtosis sk s and ku s effectively approach their asymptotic limit when σ 102 these results indicate that ku s become positive with ϕ 10 1 and the mean concentration profiles are expected to be more asymmetric see sk s sk s p and sharper than in the parabolic profile and than in a more porous coupled system with ϕ 1 2 where ku s p 0 in summary the analytical solutions with the emm show that coupled system manifests a complex behaviour of the dispersion coefficient and skewness in the parameter space σ ϕ rb the flow regime plays a principal role but the dependency upon σ becomes non monotonous in stokes brinkman flow and a relatively thin fracture rb 1 k t m f decreases with σ like in a single channel but k t m f may noticeably exceed the open flow value k t p when the matrix porosity diminishes in brinkman darcy flow for the same configuration the dispersion coefficient increases with σ towards a purely diffusive regime and unlike in the stokes brinkman regime k t m f increases with ϕ further the model parameter of the effective viscosity impacts noticeably the dispersion coefficient in the intermediate brinkman zone in the spatial and temporal dispersion the largest absolute asymmetric effects are expected in the darcy flow at high pe where they become more important for a smaller porosity the purely diffusive limit σ presents the effective solution of the coupled system in brinkman darcy flow approximately reached as σ 102 on the whole the two numerical schemes the direct trt ade solver and the trt emm numerical formulation manifest similar accuracy to the emm predictions in this and other examples but the trt emm is several orders of magnitude faster than the direct numerical simulations and it guarantees the steady state solution of the transport coefficients 5 5 5 the emm and the mim the fracture matrix system has been considered with the mobile immobile mim approach dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 focused on the dispersion coefficient k t f of the averaged fracture concentration the derived solution dejam et al 2014 in fracture diffusive matrix system is k t f p e b 2 175 p e b u b b d 0 to be contrasted with our solution in eq 89 k t f is ϕ independent and hence it does not reduce to the open flow value k t p 2 p e b 2 105 when ϕ 0 the dimensionless velocity profile ling et al 2016 u ϕ x u b is equivalent to eq 80 for f ϕ 1 ling et al 2016 reads with λ λ b h r b 1 h b l b replacing ψl by ψ ψ l u b their coefficient f should read with the opposite sign this darcy scale profile is continuous and in our point of view it should be divided by ϕ in the advection diffusion equation employed in work ling et al 2016 for matrix see eq 2 12b which is the governing ade divided by ϕ further the solution ling et al 2016 for dispersion of the fracture averaged concentration in fracture porous matrix system reads k t f p e b 2 i f with i f ψ 2 105 1 g λ b λ b λ b λ b h g λ b λ b 7 3 u s l i p ψ u s l i p u m y 0 u b u f y 0 u b thus k t f is again ϕ independent and hence it does not converge to open flow when ϕ 0 the solution ling et al 2016 for k t f is expressed in terms of four dimensionless parameters p e b u b b d 0 λ b 2 b 2 k h and ψ where ψ is considered as the independent parameter however with the help of eq 83b one gets 91 ψ ψ l u b 3 λ b 2 λ b 2 3 λ b tanh λ b 3 sech λ b 3 ψ λ b 3 hence ψ is determined by λb and the purely diffusive limit is ψ 3 this limit is easy to verify since u f y λ b 3 2 u b y 2 y u b ψ l 3 however it is reported ling et al 2016 that k t f converges from above to a purely diffusive solution dejam et al 2014 k t b p e b 2 175 when λb and ψ 0 78 see fig 2 ling et al 2016 indeed i f 0 78 2 105 1 175 but it is not clear why ψ 0 78 does not correspond to a purely diffusion limit ψ 3 as λb in velocity profile on top of these technical discrepancies the two principal differences of our solutions k t m f p e b and its purely diffusive limit k t b p e b from the dispersion coefficient k t f p e b established dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 for the fracture averaged concentration are that i k t b p e b and k t m f p e b both depend upon ϕ and converge to a single fracture when ϕ 0 and ii k t m f p e b approaches a purely diffusive limit k t b p e b from below see the two middle diagrams in figs 24 and 25 such a behaviour is principally different from a ϕ independent monotonous k t decrease towards the diffusion limit as λb reported ling et al 2016 for dispersion coefficient in fracture 6 concluding remarks the extended method of moments emm has been presented through a chain of boundary value steady state advection diffusion problems for the prediction of the effective diffusion dyadic taylor dispersion dyadic and the associated high order spatial and temporal moments of the averaged distributions in piece wise continuous soil porosity the two systems of moments can be resolved recursively within the same solution path a stationary exact numerical or approximate incompressible advective velocity field may have any dimension and nature creeping inertial shallow mesoscopic or darcy newtonian or non newtonian with the only constraint being periodic for computing of the longitudinal coefficients the emm expresses the dimensionless transport coefficients through the governing parameters of the flow and transport problems the extension of the high order coefficients to full rank tensors may straightforwardly follow the construction of the dispersion dyadic presented here it has been demonstrated that the two closure formulations brenner 1980a valdés parada et al 2016 are equivalent but differ in their final definition whereas the b method brenner 1980a produces a symmetric dispersion tensor the volume averaging approach valdés parada et al 2016 does not perform its symmetrization since the taylor dispersion coefficients are space independent the three techniques are equivalent in microscopic flow or homogeneous soil the emm extends the previous approaches brenner 1980a valdés parada et al 2016 whitaker 1999 to heterogeneous structures and the high order moments our approach naturally involves the symmetrization step we have shown that in heterogeneous soil the diffusive flux of the b field scalar variable undergoes the jumps on the interfaces non complanar with the longitudinal direction the emm smooths the transition of the averaged distributions to the classical gaussian solution of the upscaled ade and shares with the central manifold approach mercer and roberts 1990 its ability for a mechanistic construction of the successive steady state problems the central manifold aims to analytically build the truncation corrections in the upscaled ade solving then the high order pde for the effective mean concentration profile the emm is much simpler because it algebraically builds the moments from the analytical or numerical solution of the second order ade nevertheless we have shown that the solution mercer and roberts 1990 derived in the streamwise uniform flow has the moments predicted by the emm once the set of moments is predicted the profiles can be restored from it e g for visualization and comparison of the asymmetry or fat tail effect the larger is the set of the predicted moments the better is the reconstruction and the shorter is the time and length where it becomes valid the method has been exemplified through several basic configurations the first three or four moments were presented in closed analytical form in i pure diffusion and darcy flow through two heterogeneous blocks in series ii poiseuille straight and radial flow iii darcy flow through stratified heterogeneous layers iv porous channel with a brinkman velocity profile and v a coupled system of a fracture within a surrounding diffusive matrix further a fracture embedded into brinkman porous flow was addressed in symbolic form several principal properties of these solutions might be useful for practical purpose the parallel and perpendicular obstacles manifest quite different dispersion behaviour caused by their porosity contrast in any parallel arrangement dispersion coefficient kt skewness and kurtosis asymptotically grow as pe2 pe 1 2 and pe respectively in a perpendicular configuration kt is pe independent and the two next order coefficients decay as pe 1 2 and pe 1 accordingly in a single porous channel the dimensionless transport coefficients become determined through the coupling of the darcy number da and pe namely kt decreases from the stokes flow da to darcy regime da 0 and hence it is smaller than in poiseuille flow at the same pe the strongest asymmetry in the spatial system and the largest peakedness in the rtd is predicted for the combination of high pe and small da because of the mixing in boundary layers the emm also allows to estimate the role of the flow model parameters on the transport coefficients this work demonstrated this for brinkman viscosity coefficient νeff e g in a single porous channel kt increases together with ν e f f ν ϕ when ϕ diminishes in heterogeneous stratified systems the emm constructed the transport coefficients for the cross section averaged mixed distribution a coupled system of a fracture embedded in porous flow is controlled in a non monotonous fashion by the darcy number matrix porosity and the relative fracture thickness it has been found that kt decreases in stokes brinkman flow with respect to the open flow but it enhances the open flow dispersivity in darcy flow towards a purely diffusive matrix regime in this limit the relative non gaussian effects will noticeably grow only when ϕ becomes very small in a future work we aim to extend the emm ansatz to mobile immoble mim approach and perhaps to consolidate its upscaling procedure without need of resorting to the heuristic arguments the symbolic and numerical emm solutions provide an excellent benchmark tool for ade solvers from the simplest to complex geometry and flow following ginzburg 2017 the emm can be also employed to derive truncation numerical corrections in dispersion skewness and kurtosis intrinsic to the direct ade schemes in this work the symbolic solutions were approved by the two numerical models based on the lattice boltzmann two relaxation times operator trt the direct trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 and a novel trt emm scheme which complements the trt ade with the space variable mass source and interface boundary advective diffusion flux jump on the one side the emm validates the two numerical schemes on the other side the trt ade confirms the emm and the trt emm via transient computations in comparison to the direct solvers the emm is very powerful and well suitable for the mesh refining confined to a single cell it avoids their pe 2 growing of the computational time because of the progressive increase of the number of cells in the transition towards the taylor regime in the second part of this work the accuracy of the trt emm is examined through its symbolic solutions in basic heterogeneous configurations against the analytical solutions of the emm scheme and for non trivial two dimensional heterogeneous flow against the direct resolution of the breakthrough curves and residence time distributions although implicit interface and boundary conditions make the trt emm very simple and attractive for porous media the emm algorithms formulated in this work can be efficiently performed with any suitable two or three dimensional numerical advection diffusion linear solver and employed for the study of the transport properties in delaying porous rocks and composite materials and in the optimal design of the porous vegetation zones for

824,the extended method of moments emm is elaborated in recursive algorithmic form for the prediction of the effective diffusivity the taylor dispersion dyadic and the associated longitudinal high order coefficients in mean concentration profiles and residence time distributions the method applies in any streamwise periodic stationary d dimensional velocity field resolved in the piecewise continuous heterogeneous porosity field it is demonstrated that emm reduces to the method of moments and the volume averaging formulation in microscopic velocity field and homogeneous soil respectively the emm simultaneously constructs two systems of moments the spatial and the temporal without resorting to solving of the high order upscaled pde at the same time the emm is supported with the reconstruction of distribution from its moments allowing to visualize the deviation from the classical ade solution the emm can be handled by any linear advection diffusion solver with

quantified via pore scale numerical simulations in double porosity carbonates bijeljic et al 2013 yang et al 2013 that the soil heterogeneity enhances the deviation of the breakthrough curves from the normal distribution because of the larger variation in the velocity field at the same time chemical engineers and hydrologists are interested in the time spent by species inside the system e g for tracer response to wetlands su et al 2009 werner and kadlec 2000 according to the classical dispersion theory aris 1956 brenner 1980a frankel and brenner 1989 taylor 1953 after an initial long enough transition time when the solute becomes mixed over the transverse cross section or porous network the averaged tracer concentration evolves to the gaussian curve moving with the mean interstitial fluid velocity and spreading with the effective flow determined dispersion coefficient dt according to early estimates bailey and gogarty 1962 lighthill 1966 taylor 1953 confirmed later by multiple scale expansion analysis auriault and adler 1995 and pore scale modelling bijeljic and blunt 2006 the system reaches such a quasi steady regime at times greater than the diffusion time t d l 2 d 0 where l is the characteristic transverse length e g pipe radius and d 0 is molecular diffusivity under these assumptions taylor 1953 derives dt in a radial capillary aris 1956 provides a rigorous mathematical basis to the taylor s result and extends it to the flows through differently shaped pipes the method of moments aris 1956 links the effective transport coefficients to the corresponding spatial moments of the concentration distribution namely dt relates to the time linear variance of the mean concentration distribution σ t 2 2 d 0 d t t brenner 1980a 1980b extends the taylor aris

reaction shapiro and brenner 1988 and supported through the proof frankel and brenner 1989 of the high order convergence in moments space in inertial velocity field the b fields have to be recomputed for every combination of reynolds and péclet numbers the coupled flow dispersion procedure valdés parada et al 2016 has been optimized for slow flows re 1 that is the solution can be explicitly parametrised with re in the present work we show that the boundary value dispersion problem valdés parada et al 2016 established in homogeneous continuous porosity soil is equivalent to the b equation the numerical solution of the b equation was performed salles et al 1993 by the finite difference formulation and carefully validated in three dimensional stokes flows through regular fractal random and reconstructed porous media more recently being coupled with a velocity field approximation the b equation was adopted for numerical modelling of the macrodispersion in biofilms dykaar and kitanidis 1996 and channels with the periodically varying apertures bolster et al 2009 a good agreement between the b method and random walk computations has been reported bolster et al 2009 salles et al 1993 several interesting numerical examples salles et al 1993 in the presence of the delaying low permeable regions show the asymmetric particles profiles at t td when the variance has already reached its asymptotic value already early works try to explain observed non gaussian curve chatwin 1970 suggests that the leading order deviation of the concentration solution approaching the final gaussian form behaves as t 1 2 he finds that the third order series expansion of the concentration profile provides an excellent agreement with the experiment with respect its skewed form in a poiseuille flow capillary as far as t 0 2 r 2 d 0 chatwin 1970 also argues that the initial tracer distribution will have a small impact on the asymptotic approaching to the normal regime at high pe mercer and roberts 1990 construct an asymptotic wavenumber expansion of the concentration solution in the fourier space and recursively reduce the eigenvalue problem to diffusion equations in stream wise uniform flow the inverse transform provides the high order one dimensional upscaled pde with time independent coefficients mercer and roberts 1990 also discuss its initial conditions and attempt to extend their methodology referred to as central manifold approach for the time dependent flow through varying apertures this approach was recently applied ngo cong et al 2015 to build the high order corrections in the logarithmic and power channel velocity profiles in the presence of the shear stress depending diffusion coefficient an improved agreement with the direct resolution has been reported for the 3 th 6 th order solution of the upscaled pde note that in some regard mercer and roberts 1990 result disagrees with frankel and brenner 1989 demonstration on the irrelevance of the high order correction approaching the taylor regime on the other side young and jones 1991 find that although the series expansion mercer and roberts 1990 improves the shorter time approximation it discards the exponentially decaying anomalous diffusion in the pre asymptotic dispersion regime followed after a pure diffusion spread and dominated by the transverse diffusion and longitudinal shearing for that regime lighthill 1966 derives the ballistic spread rate σ t 2 d t 2 valid before the solute starts to interact with the tube wall t 10 1 t d subsequently many different approaches have attempted to derive the longitudinal super diffusivity see review latini and bernoff 2001 which manifests very different pe dependencies in porous beds see bijeljic and blunt 2006 and review herein the recent derivations camassa et al 2010 latini and bernoff 2001 pannone 2012 pay a great deal of attention to the initial conditions latini bernoff extends the analysis lighthill 1966 from a transversely uniform to center and off center point discharge and present an exact solution for super diffusive variance skewness and kurtosis in radial and straight poiseuille flows valid in the intermediate regime t d 1 3 t t d or equivalently pe 1 3 t t u l pe u l d 0 unfortunately their fourier derivation must obey free space boundary conditions and it cannot provide transition towards the taylor regime once the solute has reached the pipe boundary pannone 2012 employs the green s function method in the construction of the skewness transition and argues that the asymmetric injection explains the persisting asymmetry of the depth averaged profiles in shallow water channel flow transformed into laterally unbounded profiles using a stochastic approach camassa et al 2010 provide a way to establish a complete history of the variance evolution in pipe flows and determine péclet time scale of the pre asymptotic regime depending on the position of the initial release based on the monte carlo simulations camassa et al 2010 the authors suggest that the variance skewness and kurtosis has identical transition time scaling to the best of our knowledge despite these promising approaches a complete solution for the third and fourth order moments from the release to the asymptotic gaussian curve has not been constructed yet the emm extended method of moments vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 demonstrates that the skewness kurtosis and the higher order moments still deviate from their gaussian solution when the variance has reached the taylor regime even in the landmark example of the straight poiseuille flow after a line release in the present work we further elaborate on this method with focus on the heterogeneous soil modelling assume d dimensional periodic space v r in heterogeneous piecewise continuous soil porosity ϕ r the evolution of the solute concentration c r t obeys the d dimensional advection diffusion equation 1 t ϕ c u ϕ c ϕ d 0 c u ϕ 0 at the microscopic level ϕ 0 1 the incompressible velocity field u ϕ can be described by means of the navier stokes equations at the mesoscopic level the stokes brinkman darcy brinkman 1947 ginzburg et al 2015 jackson et al 2012 silva and ginzburg 2016 description provides a continuous flow field across the interfaces between differently packed granular phases and extends for rigid penetrable vegetation in shallow flow yang et al 2017 zeng et al 2011 by extending the classical approach aris 1956 brenner 1980a we aim to predict the averaged spatial moments ϕ 1 x n c ϕ at the same time we aim to predict the temporal moments t n p x t d t of the residence time distribution rtd due to danckwerts 1953 the rtd can be regarded in the following way assume that the inlet and outlet of a system are at x 0 and x l respectively the rtd is p l t t c l t where c x t is solution of eq 1 typically with the initial and boundary condition in the form of the heaviside step function c x 0 0 and c 0 t 1 see fig 1 the emm vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 develops the ideas of works vikhansky 2008 2011 vikhansky and macinnes 2010 vikhansky and wang 2011 for the prediction of the rtd assume ϕ r and u ϕ r be periodic along one direction of mean seepage velocity u x ϕ 1 u ϕ x the emm searches for the solution of eq 1 in the form of a product of the low frequency slow monochromatic wave and a streamwise periodic spatial component b ω γ r 2 c r t 1 2 π b ω γ r exp i γ x ω t substitution of ansatz 2 into eq 1 yields the steady state equation confined within a single cell with respect to the three unknowns i the oscillating scalar field b ω γ r ii the temporal frequency ω and iii the wavenumber spatial frequency γ we note that the recent method haynes and vanneste 2014 for the taylor dispersion is based on the similar ansatz and it results in a γ parametrised family of eigenvalue problems the emm tackles this problem in two different ways either b ω γ r and γ are both decomposed into series in powers of iω or b ω γ r and ω are both decomposed into series in powers of iγ 3a γ form b ω γ r n 0 b n r i ω n γ ω i n 1 γ n i ω n 3b ω form b ω γ r n 0 b n r i γ n ω γ i n 1 ω n i γ n eqs 3a and 3b are called vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 respectively temporal and spatial expansions the mathematical algorithms based upon will be referred to as the γ form and ω form in this work the b n r sequentially solves a recursive chain of steady state linear advection diffusion equations ade with the explicit space variable mass source the solvability condition of the total mass conservation determines the coefficients γn or ωn in γ form or ω form respectively it has been shown vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 that the temporal moments of the rtd become expressed via γn sufficiently far from the inlet whereas the spatial moments of the average concentration obtain asymptotic solution expressed via ωn moreover since the two expansions in eq 3a are not independent the two sets ωn and γn and therefore the two systems of moments become inter connected through simple algebraic expressions the emm allows to predict any spatial moment and any temporal moment by either using the ω form or the γ form in particular the emm predicts the following asymptotic behaviour for the longitudinal coefficients of the first raw moment μ 1 the variance σ 2 the skewness s k μ 3 σ 3 and the kurtosis ku μ 4 σ 4 3 4a μ 1 t u x t σ t 2 2 d t sk sk s t 1 2 ku ku s t 1 4b μ 1 x u x 1 x σ x 2 2 d u x 3 x sk sk t x 1 2 ku ku t x 1 these two asymptotic regimes apply to the spatial dispersion as t and to the temporal dispersion as x respectively the positive negative skewness quantifies the amplitude and direction right left of the distribution s tail with respect to the gaussian profile whereas the large valued positive valued kurtosis identifies its relative peakedness although the high order moments decay with time and distance they may manifest strong deviations from the gaussian values when t t u l pe or x x l pe our previous work vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 was mostly focused on the original γ form the first four moments in eq 4a were constructed for parabolic flow in a channel and a cylindrical capillary non newtonian power law flow in a capillary shallow flow through different cross section shapes and two stratified heterogeneous systems such as i darcy flow and ii parabolic flow through a straight and circular fracture adjacent to penetrable but purely diffusive matrix these first four moments allowed vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 for a reliable profile reconstruction in the taylor regime by adapting the entropy maximization method bandyopadhyay et al 2004 in the present work several constraints of the original formulation vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 are relaxed and the dimensional dimensionless closure problems are formulated for arbitrarily placed abrupt porosity interfaces and solid obstacles unlike in the case of the stratified heterogeneity the diffusive flux of continuous b field variable b n r undergoes the jumps on the streamwise penetrable interfaces and solid surfaces the ω form and γ form differ only in the source and interface terms but the ω form is simpler and more robust numerically due to these reasons and especially because the γ form becomes undefined at zero mean seepage velocity we focus on the ω form eq 3b in pure diffusion the ω form automatically predicts the effective diffusivity of the composite structure and quantifies its high order moments this simple and efficient technique offers an alternative to monte carlo simulations trinh et al 2000 numerical integration by random walks bolle et al 2000 finite element kim et al 1987 or lattice boltzmann direct simulations in saturated alvarez ramírez et al 1996 chai et al 2016 or unsaturated flow genty and pot 2014 the difference between the moment solution in given velocity field and zero velocity allows to separate the flow field and structure contributions the ω form is extended to full effective and dispersion tensors this method is further substantiated through a correct reduction of the dispersion problem to b equation brenner 1980a salles et al 1993 in microscopic flow and to the volume averaging closure procedure valdés parada et al 2016 whitaker 1999 in homogeneous porosity a tensorial extension to the next orders would require us to operate with the n rank tensors for the n order moments in this work we limit ourselves to the longitudinal values of the high order moments we note that although mercer and roberts 1990 do not relate the truncation corrections in upscaled pde with the high order distribution moments we show that the two approaches result in an equivalent recursive procedure and moments in uniform duct flow we further extend the list of the exact emm solutions firstly we construct the four moments in pure diffusion and uniform darcy velocity through two porous blocks in series since in that case the dispersion and high moments are intrinsically due to the diffusion process the pe scaling contrasts with the stratified parallel darcy system vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 secondly we construct the four moments in i single porous channel governed by brinkman flow and ii a fracture surrounded by either porous flow or diffusive matrix the focus is on the moment dependency upon i darcy number permeability ii porosity iii aspect ratio and iv effective brinkman viscosity applied in flow equation the poiseuille channel moments vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 are expressed in the spatial and temporal systems they serve as the reference for stratified porous flow it should be stressed that although the fracture matrix system is common with the works dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 the emm is principally different from the mobile immobile mim double porosity model gerke and van genuchten 1996 sharifi et al 2012 employed there with the mim the upscaled tracer evolution is represented through a coupled system of two governing ade with respect to the individual open and porous concentration fractions their exchange is mimicked through the semi heuristic source sink mass terms the emm will produce dispersion and higher order moments for the overall cross section averaged concentration the moments predicted by the emm the reconstructed rtd and mean concentration profiles have been compared vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 to the direct numerical solution of eq 1 by the independent trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 based on the two relaxation times trt lattice boltzmann method for advection diffusion equation ginzburg 2005 2007 2013 ginzburg and d humiéres 2007 hammou et al 2011 it has also been observed that a progressive extension of the moments set improves the agreement between numerical and reconstructed profiles at shorter time and distances in this work the symbolic solutions are compared with the two numerical models a direct solving of eq 1 with the trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 and a new scheme for numerical emm formulation based on the trt ade and called trt emm the trt ade has been recently applied batôt et al 2016 for the computation of the dispersion coefficient in herschel bulkley non newtonian profile it should be noted that the numerical formulation of the emm is much more efficient for prediction of the taylor regime moments than the direct simulations because the emm operates with steady state equations and within a single cell the trt emm is formulated for a multi dimensional heterogeneous flow in the accompanying paper where this scheme is first intensively examined with respect to the constructed analytical emm solutions on the one hand the symbolic solutions exemplify the methodology on the other hand they i allow for examination of the transport coefficients in full parameter space and ii provide benchmarks for direct numerical schemes where the moments of distribution may be spoiled ginzburg 2017 ginzburg and roux 2015 by the numerical truncation dispersion skewness and kurtosis moreover an extension following ginzburg 2017 of the emm to the fourth order accurate effective equations of any given ade scheme allows for an analytical derivation of the truncation corrections in moments such approach allowed ginzburg 2017 for identification of the functional form of the second order corrections in dt sk and ku in full parameter space of the trt ade scheme in pure diffusion and homogeneous flow the paper has the following plan section 2 extends the ω form for full molecular diffusion and dispersion tensors section 3 presents the mathematical algorithms for computation of the longitudinal dispersion and the associated high order moments focused on the skewness and kurtosis section 4 applies the emm through a series of porous blocks section 5 addresses uniform duct flow the emm is first simplified for duct flow in section 5 1 the symbolic solutions for the first four moments are then discussed in channel and radial poiseuille flow in section 5 2 stratified darcy flow in section 5 3 porous channel in section 5 4 and the two systems of open porous fracture matrix combination in section 5 5 section 6 concludes the paper further technical details are provided in appendix a and appendix b analytical solutions are gathered for darcy flow in series in c1 stratified darcy flow in

eq 8 performs with eq 14 3 3 discussion in summary one solves the closure problem 20a once for b 1 r and computes the total longitudinal dispersion coefficient d ω 2 in eq 24a with eq 21b for ω 2 in order to separate the taylor dispersion coefficient dt in eq 24a from the effective diffusivity d e f f one solves eq 20a twice with given velocity field u ϕ r and u ϕ 0 for skewness sk t in eq 24b one sequentially solves eq 20a with respect to b 1 r b 2 r and computes ω 3 with eq 21c for kurtosis ku t in eq 23 one solves eq 20a three times with respect to b 1 b 2 b 3 and determines ω 4 with eq 21c like any advection diffusion problem eq 20a can be worked out in the dimensionless form where it becomes determined by péclet number pe u 0 l d 0 prescribed with the characteristic size l and velocity u 0 see section 3 6 in the creeping flow e g governed by the linear stokes brinkman darcy equation brinkman 1947 iliev and rybak 2008 silva and ginzburg 2016 valdés parada et al 2007 u ϕ r can be computed once and rescaled to any desired value u 0 in inertial flow one needs to recompute u ϕ r and the closure problem 20a for the given reynolds number the closure problem should be recomputed when the selected streamwise direction changes we note that the b field solution becomes b n x and the odd order values ω 2 n 1 change the sign when u x u x it follows that in spatial moments the skewness sk t and the next odd order moments have the opposite signs in the case when the advection points in the opposite direction while the even order moments keep the same sign the longitudinal transport coefficients can be built independently by solving eq 20a for each basis axis in any given coordinate system the cross diagonal dispersion entries can be obtained by means of the full formulation from section 2 finally we note that eq 21a is derived without prescribing any a priori form for the upscaled macroscopic equation if one postulates 27 t c x t n 1 a n x n c x t c

hence a n ω n and in particular a 1 ω 1 u x and a 2 ω 2 d we demonstrate in section 5 that relation a n ω n agrees with the truncation coefficients derived mercer and roberts 1990 in the poiseuille profile the emm finds the system of moments of the averaged distribution without formulating and solving of the high order pde 3 4 the γ form the γ form searches for solution of eq 18 with the help of the temporal expansion 3a without loss of generality we replace b n r in eq 3a by the normalized set b n r which obeys the periodic condition 20f and normalized condition 19b we then substitute eq 3a into eq 18 and equate the term of iω n this gives us eq 20a where mass source components become 28 m n r m n r s n r γ n u ϕ x n 1 m 1 ϕ s 1 0 r v ϕ m n r k 1 n 1 ϕ δ 1 k γ k u ϕ x b n k d ϕ k 1 n m 1

x x u x it has been argued vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 that their asymptotic solution can be predicted from the set γn in the quasi steady taylor regime obeying eq 4a 33 μ 1 x γ 1 x μ 2 x 2 γ 2 x μ 3

becomes b n x and the whole set γn changes the sign when u x u x it follows that sk x ku x and all higher order temporal moments have the same solution with the opposite velocity at a signed distance x from the inlet the derivation vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 of eq 35 assumed the heaviside step function injection c x 0 t h t a larger validity of eq 33 can be suggested sufficiently far from the inlet for example one can think about the solute injection into a fractured open part of the inlet cross section it is emphasized that the γ form is not defined when u x 0 d eff should be computed with the ω form by means of eq 14 with u ϕ 0 however in motion the total dispersion coefficient d in eq 35 coincides with its solution in eq 22 due to inter relations between the two forms discussed below 3 5 the γ form and ω form interconnections when u x 0 ω 1 0 and γ 1 is not defined otherwise plugging eq 3a into eq 3b and vise verse the two forms are related through the following transforms 36a ω 1 1 γ 1 ω 2 γ 2 γ 1 3 ω 3 2 γ 2 2 γ 1 γ 3 γ 1 5 ω 4 5 γ 2 3 5 γ 1 γ 2 γ 3 γ 1 2 γ 4 γ 1 7 36b γ 1 1 ω 1 γ 2 ω 2 ω 1 3 γ 3 2 ω 2 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω 1 5 γ 4 5 ω 2 3 5 ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω 1 2 ω 4 ω 1 7 therefore if one set is found the other one can be computed from it with eq 36a moreover we establish with the help of eq 36a that the following relations exist between the solutions in the two forms 37 b 1 γ γ 1 b 1 ω b 2 γ γ 1 2 b 2 ω γ 2 b 1 ω b 3 γ γ 1 3 b 3 ω 2 γ 1 γ 2 b 2 ω γ 3 b 1 ω this is because the terms j n γ and j n ω are inter related with the linear combinations 37 and similar linear combinations relate the mass source terms m n γ and m n ω see eq b 4 in these relations γn can be expressed via ωn with eq 36b thereby the two closure problems are linearly inter related and the solution of γ form can be restored from the solution in ω form and vise verse hence in theory the solutions for the transport coefficients are the same with the two forms except when u x 0 we suggest that the two forms will produce identical numerical moments provided that their discrete equations including their truncation terms remain exactly related with eqs 37 and b 4 this suggestion is confirmed on the solutions of the trt emm numerical formulation in stratified channels and blocks in series 3 6 dimensionless equations giving a characteristic length l and a positive velocity u 0

not decay with pe for n 2 without these two terms the closure problem simplifies because m n r becomes a local function the diffusion flux becomes continuous on the interface and it vanishes on the impermeable boundary we define the following dimensionless coefficients for dispersion skewness and kurtosis 42a k t d 0 d d 0 1 ω 2 pe 1 u x 3 u 0 3 γ 2 pe 1 pe u 0 l d 0 42b sk s sk t u 0 t l 3 ω 3

closure problem 38 41 one gets the set ω n and obtains from it the set γ n with the help of eq 40b when solutions ω n and γ n are found the coefficients in eq 42a become all expressed through pe and the dimensionless parameters of the problem such as the aspect ratio porosity and permeability contrasts on top of the flow governing parameters like the darcy number in brinkman darcy equation or the reynolds number in navier stokes equation when changing the characteristic length and velocity say to l l r l and u u 0 r u in eqs 39 and 42a the dimensionless coefficients from eqs 39 and 42a

0 then ω 1 γ 1 1 and x x in eq 42c we mention that γn scales as l n 1 u 0 n with the mesh refining while ωn scales as u 0 l n 1 when the numerical code operates with u 0 1 γ 1 u 0 1 is larger than ω 1 u x and γn grows much faster than ωn for n 1 this property makes the ω form more suitable for numerical implementation besides the ω form is simpler and it allows for the consideration of the pure diffusion in eq 1 in general one needs to solve the closure system at given pe however when the pe dependency is known for ω n one may solve the closure problem once for a given geometry and flow and then rescale the solution to any pe for example the asymptotic solution in a stratified streamwise uniform duct flow vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 scales as 46a pe ω n pe n 1 γ n pe n 1 n 1 k t p e 2

eq 46a will remain valid in a streamwise uniform porous flows but this asymptotic behaviour will principally differ in the darcy flow through porous obstacles in series 3 7 reconstruction of the

coefficient sk s from eq 42a is computed with ω 2 and ω 3 from eqs c 1 c 2 sk t is computed with the help of eq 40b the two coefficients have the following limits 60a lim p e sk s pe 3 2 r h r h 1 r ϕ

dispersion an uniform system r ϕ 1 reduces to the gaussian solution for a point release with sk s ku s 0 accordingly in temporal dispersion it reduces to exact rtd solution of eq 1 with d d 0 k t 0 sk t 3 2 1 k t pe 1 and ku t 30 1 k t pe 1 for the heaviside inlet see for example vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 eq 54 with their notation sk g sk t pe 1 ku g ku t pe 1 the principal difference with the duct flow is that in series sk s and sk t vanish as pe increases whereas they both grow as pe in pipes the symbolic solutions in series were also extended for kurtosis their expressions are lengthy but they are exemplified in table 1 for reconstructed profiles presented in figs 6 and 7 table 1 shows that at the intermediate pe value pe 114 the amplitudes of all transport coefficients are much smaller in series of two equal length blocks and they are far less r ϕ dependent against the stratified flow the sk s and sk t are displayed respectively in figs 6 and 7 versus pe 0 5 102 when r h 1 in the first diagram and versus rh when pe 10 2 in the last diagram the two coefficients sk s p e and sk t p e in the first diagrams monotonously approach their asymptotic infinite pe values at the same time the two skewness coefficients are not monotonous with rh and rϕ as pe grows sk s is negative and sk t is positive the spatial profiles are expected to be skewed right while the rtd profiles are expected to be skewed left the normalized mean concentration profiles σ t c x t in fig 6 are reconstructed from sk s and ku s at pe 113 4 at t t pe t h u x they almost coincide with the normalized gaussian profiles sk s ku s 0 because of the very small high order transport coefficients in series r ϕ 1 2 has the largest value sk s in this example the rtd profiles σxp x τ in figs 7 are reconstructed from sk t and ku t they are also indistinguishable from the gaussian rtd nevertheless although the darcy flow in the stratified system in section 5 3 exhibits much stronger non gaussian behaviour for the same physical parameters the darcy flow in series presents a valuable numerical test for second third and fourth order central moments the effective diffusion coefficient d e f f eq 52a should be exact solution of the second order moment with any direct ade solver of eq 1 and any emm numerical formulation the ku s from eq 52c is generally not exact because of the fourth order truncation error summation and possibly interface corrections for example the trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 in fig 4 with a free parameter space exact ginzburg 2017 for kurtosis in homogeneous soil yields the relative error e ku s 3 10 5 5 67 10 3 for porosity contrast r ϕ 10 2 1 2 in two equal blocks of thickness h 2 20 using a typical model parameter range we note that the smaller diffusion coefficients higher porosity contrasts behave more accurately in this case in the presence of the darcy flow in series the numerical methods deal with the streamwise heterogeneity and the numerical formulation of the emm method like the trt emm scheme should incorporate the interface flux jump condition fig 8 displays the moments extracted from the direct numerical computations with the trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 and the transport coefficients computed from the numerical solution ωn with the trt emm the numerical results and emm analytical predictions agree on the pe shape for three coefficients k t d e f f sk s and ku s however the two numerical methods require relatively fine grids and their accuracy typically deteriorates with the porosity contrast in this example the detailed analysis is addressed in our parallel work one key point for numerical accuracy in this configuration is the precise location of the interface continuity conditions which is mimicked in the two schemes because of their implicitness with respect to interface location similar to implicit heterogeneous flow models ginzburg et al 2015 the analytical solutions for dispersion and high order moments in series allow for detailed examination of the numerical schemes because it is challenging to capture accurately the relatively weak deviations from the second order gaussian

total length of the unit cell in y direction eq 44 transform the transport coefficients to any other characteristic system in open ϕ 1 and porous ϕ 0 1 uniform duct flow ω n respects the pe scaling from eq 46a the transport coefficients scale with eq 46b in spatial dispersion eq 42a with eqs 63d 63e allow to construct the dimensionless coefficients kt sk s and ku s in temporal dispersion kt remains the same and sk t ku t are computed with eq 42c by means of the transform 40b from ω n to γ n we first provide the reference poiseuille channel solution in section 5 2 and derive explicit relations between the ωn and the coefficients of the high order corrections in upscaled pde mercer and roberts 1990 section 5 3 compares the transport coefficients in constant darcy flow through the parallel and perpendicular arrays of porous obstacles section 5 4 discusses four transport coefficients in a single porous channel governed by the brinkman equation section 5 5 combines the poiseuille flow in a fracture with two surrounding penetrable matrix layers either permeable or impermeable to the flow in porous systems we examine the dependency upon i porosity ii permeability and iii effective brinkman viscosity on top of the péclet number and in coupled systems the aspect ratio 5 2 poiseuille flow as a methodological example let us consider poiseuille flow u ϕ x y 3 2 u x 1 4 y 2

and ginzburg 2014 parabolic flow b n y is the polynomial of the order 4n for n 1 the dimensionless coefficients ω n and γ n from eq 39 are gathered in table 2 for a channel and a capillary the corresponding transport coefficients 42a are given in table 3 and illustrated in fig 9 in a straight channel pe is often computed with the half thickness the skewness and kurtosis coefficients then scale with r u 1 r l 2 in eq 44 table 4 provides the asymptotic coefficients in eq 46b they differ from the gaussian solution to eq 7 where sk s ku s 0 and for the heaviside step function input sk t 3 2 1 k t pe 1 and ku t 30 1 k t pe 1 e g vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 eq 54 in contrast with the gaussian solution the emm predicts asymmetric profiles for spatial spread in the rtd a stronger asymmetry than with the gaussian solution is predicted in a straight channel but slightly weaker asymmetry in a capillary see sk s and sk t in table 4 for illustration purpose mean concentration profiles and rtd are restored from the set of the first four moments with eq 47 and displayed in fig 10 for pe 7 4 74 740 the log scale helps to distinguish them from the asymptotic gaussian distribution see also fig 1 since sk s is negative and sk t is positive σ t c x t is skewed right while σxp x τ is skewed left the spatial profiles σ t c x t become pe independent when t pe the rtd profiles σp x τ become pe independent when the distance to inlet x pe this asymptotic regime is approximately reached already for pe 74 although there is a common belief that the spatial profiles become symmetric in the taylor regime e g latini and bernoff 2001 the monte carlo numerical solution latini and bernoff 2001 is indeed skewed left in a circular pipe at a very long time after release in agreement with the emm solution sk t 0 in table 4 the emm solutions in the parabolic straight and radial flows were intensively validated through an analytical account of the truncation numerical moments in the trt ade scheme either extending ginzburg and roux 2015 the taylor ansatz to the fourth order effective mass conservation equation or applying ginzburg 2017 the emm ansatz 2 to it to give one example the trt

work h 40 u x 0 0355 let us compare now the set ωn with the solution mercer and roberts 1990 for truncation coefficients in the upscaled eq 27 67 t c u x x c d x 2 c d 0 b 2 n 3 a n b p e b n x n c p

to the 24th order by means of computer algebra with a 3 2 3088 10 4 and a 4 2 8416 10 5 they give with eq 68 ω 3 0 1443 10 4 pe 2 and ω 4 4 4 10 7 pe 3 this solution coincides with the emm solution in table 3 ω 3 p pe 2 69300 0 00 001443 pe 2 and ω 4 p pe 3 2252250 4 44 000444 10 7 pe 3 furthermore the recursive procedure mercer and roberts 1990 is equivalent to the ω form given by eq 63a in uniform duct flow the emm extends this solution to any streamwise periodic multi dimensional flow without a priori assumption on the form of the truncation corrections to eq 7 5 3 stratified darcy flow we consider a fully periodic system of two parallel porous layers along the x axis the layers have the same permeability but different porosity ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 and different thickness h 1 and h 2 the darcy velocity u ϕ x is constant and parallel with the layers see fig 11 exact concentration solution of eq 1 has been constructed in this system and an expansion of its dispersion relation gives eq 3a see eqs 68 73 in vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 the bfield variable bn y is the polynomial of order 2n the solution for ω 1 ω 4 is gathered in c2 in this section the transport coefficients are further elaborated and compared to solutions for the perpendicular darcy flow in series from section 4 2 like in series the transport coefficients are determined by the porosity ratio rϕ aspect ratio rh and pe they are identical with respect to the simultaneous transform rh 1 rh and rϕ 1 rϕ in the stratified system d e f f d 0 and the dispersion coefficient 42a reads 69 k t p e 2 r h 2 r ϕ 1 2 r h r ϕ 12 r ϕ 1 r h 4 1 r h r ϕ r ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 r h h 1 h 2 pe u 0 h d 0 u 0 u ϕ x h ϕ 1 h 1 ϕ 2 h 2 h h 1 h 2 we note that the parallel and perpendicular two block arrangements have the same averaged velocity u x and the same pe fig 11 displays kt from eq 69 in similar configurations as in fig 5 these two figures show that in the stratified system kt is one two orders of the magnitude greater in the interval pe 0 102 than in series since kt grows as pe2 in parallel layers the darcy flow through a stratified system becomes infinitely more disperse with pe the last diagram of fig 11 demonstrates that the behaviour k t pe 2 versus rh is also non monotonous cf the last diagram in fig 5 but far less asymmetric the sk s and sk t from eqs 42b and 42c have the following limits in the stratified system 70a lim p e pe 1 2 sk s 3 2 r h 2 r h r ϕ 3 r ϕ 2 3 2 r ϕ sgn r ϕ 1 5 r h 1 r ϕ r h r ϕ r h r ϕ 1 70b lim p e pe 1 2 sk s r h 1 r ϕ 1 3 3 2 10 r ϕ o r ϕ 5 2 and 71a lim p e pe 1 2 sk t 3 2 r h r ϕ 1 r h 2

1 sk t 3 2 pe 1 the sk s pe 1 2 and sk t pe 1 2 are respectively displayed in figs 12 and 13 versus pe 0 102 when r h 1 in the first diagram and versus rh in the asymptotic infinite pe limit in the last diagram the two solutions can be compared to their perpendicular darcy flow counterparts displayed in figs 6 and 7 the principal difference between the two systems is that in series sk s and sk t vanish as pe increases whereas they both grow as pe in a stratified system further in series the two coefficients effectively approach their asymptotic values sk s pe and sk t pe at much higher value pe lim than for sk s pe 1 2 and sk t pe 1 2 in the stratified system pe lim increases with porosity contrast in series e g pe lim 106 when r ϕ 10 2 while the reverse happens in the stratified channel in the two systems the skewness coefficients are not monotonous with rh their amplitudes rapidly increase when rh is relatively small here the less porous layer is thinner and then they decay with rh the symbolic solutions for kurtosis are lengthy see for example ku ku t pe 1 r h 1 given by eq 75 in vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 as one example all transport coefficients are exemplified in table 1 for reconstructed normalized profiles presented in figs 12 and 13 at pe 114 as pe grows sk s is positive and sk t is negative in the stratified layers for high porosity contrast again this is reversed in the perpendicular flow see table 1 the mean concentration profiles in parallel flow are noticeably skewed left in fig 12 due to their large positive values sk s and their sharpness still increases with the porosity contrast the rtd in fig 13 are skewed right according to their negative values sk t and they have heavy tails before the peak clearly observable in the log scale the rtd would become much more asymmetric for r ϕ 10 2 against r ϕ 1 2 at the same distance x h pe however the profiles are then so sharp that the first four moments are insufficient for their reliable reconstruction due to this reason the rtd are displayed in fig 13 at the progressively larger distances as x h 10 pe 3 pe when r ϕ 10 2 1 3 accordingly since they practically coincide with the rtd profile r ϕ 10 1 monitored at x h pe one may suggest that sk t r h 1 r ϕ 1 this observation agrees with the leading order term in eq 71b in summary constant darcy flow through the stratified layers gives us a very illustrative example where a non trivial non gaussian behaviour happens solely due to heterogeneity of the structure although the asymmetric effects are much stronger this configuration is numerically simpler than the cross flow through porous blocks in series because the diffusion flux of the b field variable is continuous on the stratified interface the stratified darcy flow is also much simpler algebraically and the emm allows for a large set of the moments to be computed symbolically a consistent improving in reconstruction of the sharp profiles with respect to the direct numerical solutions of the mean concentration and residence time distributions is achieved vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 by symbolically extending the emm sets of moments to the order n 8 we suggest that this set of moments can be further employed to verify the applicability range of the emm in transition at a progressively shorter time after release and closer to inlet 5 4 single porous channel consider a straight single channel of porosity ϕ and permeability k bounded by two impermeable solid walls at y h 2 the velocity profile u ϕ x y solves brinkman equation brinkman 1947 in the form ginzburg et al

to the parabolic poiseuille flow the opposite limit σ corresponds to a flat darcy flow coupled with zero boundary values since u ϕ x y is proportional to ϕ at fixed σ the dimensionless form of eq 1 becomes ϕ independent and controlled by σ and pe u x h d 0 we apply the dimensionless ω form with eq 63a subject to the no flux boundary condition y b n y 1 2 0 substituting the velocity profile 73 eqs 63a 63c factorize ϕ and the dimensionless transport coefficients become governed by σ and pe the dimensionless solution b n y to eq 63a 63c takes the following form in terms of the n order polynomials p n y and x n y 74 b n y k 0 n p 2 k y e n k σ y k 0 n x 2 k y e k n σ y the dispersion coefficient k t ω 2 pe 1 is determined by eq 63d and it reads we denote it k t σ 75 k t σ σ pe pe 2

however it should be noted that since pe is measured with the mean seepage velocity u x ϕ 1 see eq 73 pe increases when ϕ decreases at a fixed pressure gradient value fig 14 displays in the leftmost diagram the ratio k t σ k t p and shows that k t σ pe 2 monotonously diminishes when σ increases from the stokes to the darcy regime that is the dispersion coefficient decreases with the darcy number at fixed pe fig 14illustrates in the middle diagram the role of f ϕ on the dimensionless velocity profile u ϕ 1 u ϕ x y in the transition zone d a 10 4 since σ decreases with f ϕ the normalized profile u ϕ 1 u ϕ x y shapes more parabolic for smaller f ϕ fig 14illustrates in the last diagram the role of f ϕ on the ratio k t σ k t p at fixed da in agreement with eq 75 k t σ pe 2 decreases when f ϕ increases that means that because of the brinkman viscosity factor k t σ becomes larger for smaller porosity at fixed da and pe the coefficients ω 3 and ω 4 are given in eqs c 5 and c 6 respectively in terms of σ and pe they respect the asymptotic scaling 46a and reduce to poiseuille values ω 3 p and ω 4 p from table 2 in stokes regime σ 0 the coefficients sk s pe σ and ku s pe σ are computed with eq 42b their asymptotic pe scaling obeys eq 46b the series expansion in powers of σ in eqs 75 c 5 and c 6 provides their deviation from the open flow in stokes brinkman regime fig 15 displays r sk s σ pe sk s sk s p and r ku s σ pe r ku s σ pe ku s ku s p versus pe at the fixed value σ 1 10 10 2 10 3 together with the corresponding velocity profile 73 the sk s has the same negative sign as in open flow but ku s may change its sign we observe that r sk s and r ku s have a similar pe schape at small and intermediate pe r sk s and r ku s reduce from 1 in stokes regime towards zero in darcy zone i e when the soil becomes less permeable the non gaussian effects decay with respect to the open flow solution at the same pe however the amplitudes r sk s pe and r ku s pe then increase with pe their asymptotic σ dependent limit pe is displayed in the last diagram of fig 16 fig 15 confirms that solution effectively reaches this σ dependent asymptotic limit at high pe asymptotically in the darcy zone the ratio to open flow becomes 76 pe σ r sk s 22 2 35 5 26 r ku s 286 147 1 95 eq 76 predicts the profiles to become more asymmetric and sharper than in open flow where ku s p 0 at very high pe and very small da the profiles σ t c x t are illustrated at t t 0 49pe in the left diagram of fig 17 when σ 10 2 d a 10 4 and together for pe 7 4 74 740 the reconstruction confirms that the profiles practically coincide between them and with the gaussian profile at pe 7 4 74 because of the very small high moments values but σ t c x t becomes much more skewed right and sharper at pe 740 where r sk s 4 42 and ku s 1 27 the coefficients sk t and ku t of the temporal dispersion are computed from eq 42c with the help of eq 36b their respective ratios to the open flow value r sk t σ pe and r ku t σ pe are displayed in two first diagrams in fig 16 these rtd coefficients have the same sign as in open flow like in the spatial dispersion the skewness and kurtosis are shaped similarly but their behaviour with pe is not monotonous r sk t σ pe and r ku t σ pe have a minimum at pe 10 102 along the intermediate and high pe range the amplitude of r sk t σ pe is much smaller than in the spatial moment the asymptotic high pe limit is displayed versus σ in the last diagram of fig 16 it largest deviation from the open flow happens in the darcy limit with 77 pe σ r sk t 22 29 14 5 1 27 r ku t 572 291 1 96 the reconstructed profiles log σxp x τ in fig 17 illustrate the non monotonous pe behaviour of the high moments here pe 7 4 740 have similar values with r sk t 1 r ku t 1 and very similar shapes around the poiseuille profile at the same time pe 74 is only slightly more asymmetric than the auto similar gaussian rtd in open channel we verify the analytical solutions for kt sk s and ku s in a single porous channel using direct numerical simulations with the trt ade and the trt emm numerical formulation we fix σ 25 in the transition brinkman flow regime and vary pe 2 05 73 8 the results displayed in fig 18 show that two schemes agree on the pe shape with the predicted solution for the three transport coefficients when σ reduces to zero in open flow the agreement improves this is in contrast to the darcy flow where the numerical schemes manifest a progressive worsening of the accuracy with σ because the transport coefficients have very small amplitudes in darcy zone at small pe 10 in summary the dimensionless transport coefficients in single porous channel are determined by σ and pe the porosity enters them implicitly through u x via pe and through f ϕ via σ the relative dispersivity k t pe 2 is predicted to decrease from the stokes to darcy regime and to increase at the fixed da when f ϕ decreases with ϕ in stokes brinkman regime at small and intermediate pe the averaged concentration and rtd profiles are expected to be similar to the gaussian distribution and smoother than in open flow at the same pe asymptotically at high pe in the darcy flow the rtd profiles are only slightly sharper than their poiseuille flow solution at the same time the averaged concentration profiles become much more asymmetric because of the long time mixing in boundary layers 5 5 coupled system of a fracture and porous matrix we consider a bounded stratified system composed of an open fracture straight channel surrounded by two equivalent porous layers such model situation has been considered with the mobile immobile mim approach dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 in the case when the matrix is purely diffusive dejam et al 2014 or when matrix flow is described by the brinkman equation ling et al 2016 unlike with the mim the emm does not postulate any exchange between the matrix averaged and fracture averaged concentrations the emm provides solution for the dispersion coefficient in upscaled eq 7 for the mean concentration averaged over the whole open and porous cross section this total dispersion coefficient will have different dependency upon the governing dimensionless parameters than solutions dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 for dispersion of the fracture averaged concentration section 5 5

the corresponding poiseuille flow solution from table 3 as ϕ 0 when the matrix becomes impenetrable 5 5 3 fracture embedded in a purely diffusive matrix when the permeability k becomes infinitely small the transport in matrix approaches a pure diffusion process with um y 0 this three layered configuration is very similar but not identical to the two layered open diffusive matrix system

then b n m y p 2 n y and b n f p 4 n y the interface and boundary conditions remain the same the dispersion coefficient kt is denoted k t d pe and it is derived with eq 86 88 k t d pe pe 2 51 ϕ 2 r b

eq 83b the dispersion coefficient k t d pe reads as 89 k t b p e b p e b 2 51 ϕ 2 r b ϕ 18 r b 2 35 2 r b 3 105 ϕ r b 3 p e b u b b d 0 k t b ϕ 0 k t p 2 p e b 2 105 k t b k t p ϕ 0 1 r b it should be stressed that because of the diffusion into surrounding matrix k t b exceeds the open flow value k t p and reduces to it as ϕ 0 fig 20 illustrates k t d from eq 88 for four porosity values left diagram displays the pe independent ratio k t d k t p versus rb k t d monotonously increases with ϕ and converges to k t p when rb however k t d k t p is not monotonous with respect to rb and unlike k t b in eq 89 k t d may become smaller than k t p at the same pe u x e g at the same mean velocity value u x in the coupled system and in the large open channel of width 2 h 1 r b the middle diagram of fig 20 displays the monotonously increasing function ϕ m a x d r b 0 1 4 k t d k t p when ϕ 0 ϕ m a x d and k t d k t p when ϕ ϕ m a x d 1 since ϕ m a x d r b is very sharp in the most realistic region rb 1 then practically k t d k t p the right diagram displays the ratio of the diffusion coefficients d d p versus pe in the case r b 1 5 here d d p 1 when ϕ 10 2 ϕ m a x d r b 1 5 0 017 d d p 1 otherwise the matrix effect becomes noticeable as pe 10 and the ratio of the diffusion values approaches its finite asymptotic limit d d p k t d k t p figs 21 illustrates the p e b independent ratio k t b k t p here k t b k t p 1 and it converges to 1 when rb eq 89 this system is not well defined in the limit rb 0 when the fracture vanishes to be contrasted with k t d k t b is not monotonous with ϕ at fixed rb the middle diagram displays its maximum point ϕ m a x b r b which increases from 0 to 0 92 when rb 0 1 but ϕ m a x b is very small when rb 1 it follows that when the fracture is much thinner than the matrix k t b k t p practically decreases when ϕ increases at the same peb this is to be contrasted with the k t d k t p which decreases with ϕ at the same pe the right diagram of fig 21 displays the ratio of the diffusion values d d p 1 k t b 1 k t p versus peb for r b 1 5 it appears that unlike in fig 20 the dispersion effect is not monotonous with ϕ it becomes noticeable as peb 1 and the d d p converges to the finite limit equal to k t b k t p when peb grows the spatial coefficients sk s and ku s are derived with eq 42a from ω 3 ω 4 given by eqs c 8 and c 9 their temporal counterparts sk t and ku t are built with the help of eq 40b the asymptotic pe scale obeys eqs 46b typically the transport coefficients approach this limit as pe 102 assuming the same value pe u x in the coupled and open systems we examine four pe independent asymptotic ratios determined by ϕ and rb r sk s sk s sk s p r sk t sk t sk t p and r ku s ku s ku s p r ku t ku t ku t p the first diagram of fig 22 displays the four functions together versus rb they rapidly converge to 1 when the relative matrix effect diminishes as rb 2 here the behaviour with rb is however not monotonous when rb 2 especially at very small value ϕ like ϕ 10 2 shown here the first diagram of fig 23 displays the four functions versus ϕ at r b 10 1 it tells us that when ϕ diminishes a stronger asymmetry than in open flow at the same pe u x might be expected for mean concentration profiles while the rtd may become much sharper because respectively sk s and ku t increase rapidly when ϕ 0 since the aspect ratio effect is not monotonous the high order effects in the limit ϕ 0 may have larger amplitudes when the fracture is relatively thicker here with r b 10 1 against r b 10 2 basically we observe that sk t and ku t have the same sign like in open flow whereas sk s and ku s may change it the relative difference r sk t is smaller than r sk s like in a single porous channel see figs 15 and 16 the two last diagrams in fig 22 present the reconstructed mean concentration profiles in the case where sk s changes its sign r sk s ϕ 1 2 5 6 and hence sk s 0 because sk s p 0 in open flow and r sk s ϕ 1 4 8 35 the profiles are accordingly skewed left and right with respect to solution in the poiseuille profile and they are flatter because r ku s 10 and ku s 0 in open flow it is interesting that in these two configurations with r b 1 3 the small valued pe has the largest deviation from the open flow e g r sk s 1 2 when pe 74 740 the two last diagrams in fig 23 display the reconstructed rtd profiles at pe 740 and compare them with the open flow the results with pe 74 are nearly the same the peakedness increases from ϕ 1 2 to ϕ 1 4 in agreement with the prediction in the first diagram of fig 23 at the same time very sharp reconstructed profiles often manifest a non monotonous decreasing branch most likely because the first four moments become insufficient this typically happens when the rtd profiles are reconstructed close to the inlet x h pe see examples vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 in summary dispersion coefficient of the cell averaged concentration c x t k t d pe in eq 88 and k t b p e b in eq 89 scale respectively as pe2 and p e b 2 the proportionality constant is determined by ϕ and rb the function k t d pe monotonously increases with ϕ and if the coupled system and a large open channel of the total width l 2 h 1 r b have the same seepage velocities k t d pe will exceed k t p when ϕ ϕ m a x d r b ϕ m a x d r b 0 when rb 1 and ϕ m a x d r b 1 4 when rb 1 the behaviour with rb is not monotonous and k t d pe converges to the poiseuille limit k t p pe 2 210 as rb on the other side at the same value peb e g when the coupled system and the poiseuille channel of the width 2b have the same averaged velocity k t b always exceeds k t p due to diffusion into the surrounding matrix to be contrasted with the ratio k t d k t p the k t b k t p decreases with ϕ when rb 1 thereby the diffusive layer may enhance or diminish the taylor dispersion coefficient of the open flow depending on the definition of the reference péclet number in the two systems the rtd is predicted to become much sharper when ϕ decreases but to retain the asymmetry of the open profile remains skewed left in contrast the skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration may change the sign with the matrix porosity all these effects are non monotonous with the aspect ratio rb we find that the porosity and geometry dependency of the transport coefficients in this limit configuration are interesting to take into consideration in the optimal design with respect to the desired dispersion and tailing in artificial porous systems and composite materials 5 5 4 a fracture embedded in porous flow the dispersion coefficient kt denoted by k t m f hereafter is determined with eq 86 in terms of the five governing dimensionless parameters pe σ rb ϕ and f ϕ k t m f scales as pe2 and it has the following limits 90 k t m f r b 0 k t σ σ pe k t m f r b 0 σ 0 k t m f r b k t p pe k t m f σ k t d pe ϕ r b k t b p e b ϕ r b where k t σ corresponds to single porous channel of width l 2 h in eq 75 k t p is poiseuille value k t d and k t b are solutions in a purely diffusive matrix eqs 88 and 89 respectively the symbolic expression of k t m f is lengthy and it is illustrated in two dimensionless systems pe σ and peb λb the first diagram of fig 24 displays k t m f k t p towards σ f ϕ 1 d a 1 2 assuming the same pe in the two systems when ϕ 10 1 and for four different values r b 10 3 1 when σ 0 k t m f converges to k t p when σ k t m f converges to k t d the dependency upon σ is not monotonous k t m f has the minimum at σ min rb its value increases when rb diminishes the purely diffusive limit is reached from below and when the fracture is relatively thinner the limit is reached at larger σ towards the darcy zone σ when σ σ min rb the matrix dominates the fracture and k t m f behaves similarly to the single porous channel in fig 14 k t d overestimates k t m f in the transition to darcy flow the last diagram of fig 24 shows that the magnitude of k t m f may increase by the factor of 10 in the transition regime σ 1 10 2 when d a f ϕ σ 2 decreases with f ϕ ϕ the second diagram of fig 24 displays k t m f k t p at the same peb versus λb since λb rbσ decreases with rb the ratio k t m f k t p becomes clearly sub divided into two zones k t m f k t p decreases with λb is the stokes brinkman regime λb λb min 3 and then increases with λb for brinkman darcy flow at the same time k t m f k t p increases when the fracture becomes relatively thinner and k t m f k t p p e b when rb 1 through all flow regimes fig 25 presents similar analysis when r b 10 1 and the porosity varies ϕ 10 2 1 2 the first diagram confirms that the purely diffusion limit k t d k t p is reached from below when σ however k t m f exceeds k t d in the stokes brinkman regime especially when ϕ is small the purely diffusion limit is reached at larger σ smaller da when ϕ is smaller the last diagram of fig 25 shows that σ ϕ d a reduces with f ϕ ϕ and k t m f approaches its purely diffusive limit at almost the same σ for all porosity values in the second diagram k t m f k t p is plotted versus λb at the same peb the results look qualitatively similar but they confirm that k t m f k t p like in a purely diffusive case for all porosity values when rb 1 fig 26 illustrates the non monotonous behaviour with λb for 1 k t m f 1 k t p displayed in the two first diagrams versus pe and peb respectively the last diagram plots the corresponding ratio pe peb it is shown that this dispersion ratio decreases when small λb increases but then it increases with λb and reaches the asymptotic diffusive value predicted by eq 88 from below when λb 100 fig 27 displays the evolution of the amplitude sk s sk s p versus pe when σ increases from σ 1 stokes flow to σ 10 3 darcy flow at r b 10 1 the results are displayed for ϕ 1 2 and ϕ 10 1 respectively in the two first diagrams they can be compared with a single porous channel in fig 15 where this ratio reduces from 1 in stokes flow to very small values within intermediate pe in darcy flow and then exceeds 1 and obeys eq 76 in the asymptotic pe limit in the presence of heterogeneity sk s sk s p may become relatively large at small pe in the darcy zone where sk s effectively reaches its asymptotic purely diffusive limit at σ 103 and the diffusive matrix analysis then applies through the darcy zone σ it should be said that whereas in a single porous channel the transport coefficients are independent of the porosity and determined by pe and σ the dependency upon ϕ becomes complicated and non monotonous in the coupled system the two first diagrams in fig 27 show that the amplitude sk s sk s p does not necessarily increase when ϕ decreases in compliance with the asymptotic high pe behaviour of sk s sk s p with porosity in fig 23 the asymptotic pe behaviour becomes similar to the single porous channel sk s sk s p becomes confined to the interval around 1 5 in agreement with the last diagram of fig 16 and eq 76 the last diagram of fig 27 displays the ratio sk t sk t p in the rtd profiles like in the case of the porous channel in figs 15 and 16 the deviation from the open flow is much smaller than with the spatial moments however it is monotonous with σ and increases in the darcy zone for all pe unlike with the single porous channel in fig 16 the purely diffusive asymptotic regime is reached at σ 103 like in the spatial system and it predicts a slightly larger asymmetry than in the single porous channel with sk t sk t p 2 3 against r sk t 1 3 eq 77 now the transport coefficients are built with the symbolic procedure from section 5 5 2 and employed for comparison with the trt emm and trt ade schemes in a channel of total width 2 b h 30 with the fracture half thickness b 5 the corresponding normalized velocity profile is illustrated in the first diagram in fig 28 for three typical values σ 1 10 10 2 respectively in stokes brinkman and darcy flow the numerical results are compared to the emm prediction in fig 28 together for ϕ 1 2 pe 31 97 and ϕ 10 1 pe 18 46 numerical results confirm the analytically established dependency with σ in all three coefficients the last diagram in fig 28 confirms that the two schemes agree for kurtosis where we limit the comparison with the analytic predictions to the asymptotic purely diffusive limit σ in that case eqs c 8 c 9 allow for computation of the skewness and kurtosis sk s and ku s effectively approach their asymptotic limit when σ 102 these results indicate that ku s become positive with ϕ 10 1 and the mean concentration profiles are expected to be more asymmetric see sk s sk s p and sharper than in the parabolic profile and than in a more porous coupled system with ϕ 1 2 where ku s p 0 in summary the analytical solutions with the emm show that coupled system manifests a complex behaviour of the dispersion coefficient and skewness in the parameter space σ ϕ rb the flow regime plays a principal role but the dependency upon σ becomes non monotonous in stokes brinkman flow and a relatively thin fracture rb 1 k t m f decreases with σ like in a single channel but k t m f may noticeably exceed the open flow value k t p when the matrix porosity diminishes in brinkman darcy flow for the same configuration the dispersion coefficient increases with σ towards a purely diffusive regime and unlike in the stokes brinkman regime k t m f increases with ϕ further the model parameter of the effective viscosity impacts noticeably the dispersion coefficient in the intermediate brinkman zone in the spatial and temporal dispersion the largest absolute asymmetric effects are expected in the darcy flow at high pe where they become more important for a smaller porosity the purely diffusive limit σ presents the effective solution of the coupled system in brinkman darcy flow approximately reached as σ 102 on the whole the two numerical schemes the direct trt ade solver and the trt emm numerical formulation manifest similar accuracy to the emm predictions in this and other examples but the trt emm is several orders of magnitude faster than the direct numerical simulations and it guarantees the steady state solution of the transport coefficients 5 5 5 the emm and the mim the fracture matrix system has been considered with the mobile immobile mim approach dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 focused on the dispersion coefficient k t f of the averaged fracture concentration the derived solution dejam et al 2014 in fracture diffusive matrix system is k t f p e b 2 175 p e b u b b d 0 to be contrasted with our solution in eq 89 k t f is ϕ independent and hence it does not reduce to the open flow value k t p 2 p e b 2 105 when ϕ 0 the dimensionless velocity profile ling et al 2016 u ϕ x u b is equivalent to eq 80 for f ϕ 1 ling et al 2016 reads with λ λ b h r b 1 h b l b replacing ψl by ψ ψ l u b their coefficient f should read with the opposite sign this darcy scale profile is continuous and in our point of view it should be divided by ϕ in the advection diffusion equation employed in work ling et al 2016 for matrix see eq 2 12b which is the governing ade divided by ϕ further the solution ling et al 2016 for dispersion of the fracture averaged concentration in fracture porous matrix system reads k t f p e b 2 i f with i f ψ 2 105 1 g λ b λ b λ b λ b h g λ b λ b 7 3 u s l i p ψ u s l i p u m y 0 u b u f y 0 u b thus k t f is again ϕ independent and hence it does not converge to open flow when ϕ 0 the solution ling et al 2016 for k t f is expressed in terms of four dimensionless parameters p e b u b b d 0 λ b 2 b 2 k h and ψ where ψ is considered as the independent parameter however with the help of eq 83b one gets 91 ψ ψ l u b 3 λ b 2 λ b 2 3 λ b tanh λ b 3 sech λ b 3 ψ λ b 3 hence ψ is determined by λb and the purely diffusive limit is ψ 3 this limit is easy to verify since u f y λ b 3 2 u b y 2 y u b ψ l 3 however it is reported ling et al 2016 that k t f converges from above to a purely diffusive solution dejam et al 2014 k t b p e b 2 175 when λb and ψ 0 78 see fig 2 ling et al 2016 indeed i f 0 78 2 105 1 175 but it is not clear why ψ 0 78 does not correspond to a purely diffusion limit ψ 3 as λb in velocity profile on top of these technical discrepancies the two principal differences of our solutions k t m f p e b and its purely diffusive limit k t b p e b from the dispersion coefficient k t f p e b established dejam et al 2014 ling et al 2016 for the fracture averaged concentration are that i k t b p e b and k t m f p e b both depend upon ϕ and converge to a single fracture when ϕ 0 and ii k t m f p e b approaches a purely diffusive limit k t b p e b from below see the two middle diagrams in figs 24 and 25 such a behaviour is principally different from a ϕ independent monotonous k t decrease towards the diffusion limit as λb reported ling et al 2016 for dispersion coefficient in fracture 6 concluding remarks the extended method of moments emm has been presented through a chain of boundary value steady state advection diffusion problems for the prediction of the effective diffusion dyadic taylor dispersion dyadic and the associated high order spatial and temporal moments of the averaged distributions in piece wise continuous soil porosity the two systems of moments can be resolved recursively within the same solution path a stationary exact numerical or approximate incompressible advective velocity field may have any dimension and nature creeping inertial shallow mesoscopic or darcy newtonian or non newtonian with the only constraint being periodic for computing of the longitudinal coefficients the emm expresses the dimensionless transport coefficients through the governing parameters of the flow and transport problems the extension of the high order coefficients to full rank tensors may straightforwardly follow the construction of the dispersion dyadic presented here it has been demonstrated that the two closure formulations brenner 1980a valdés parada et al 2016 are equivalent but differ in their final definition whereas the b method brenner 1980a produces a symmetric dispersion tensor the volume averaging approach valdés parada et al 2016 does not perform its symmetrization since the taylor dispersion coefficients are space independent the three techniques are equivalent in microscopic flow or homogeneous soil the emm extends the previous approaches brenner 1980a valdés parada et al 2016 whitaker 1999 to heterogeneous structures and the high order moments our approach naturally involves the symmetrization step we have shown that in heterogeneous soil the diffusive flux of the b field scalar variable undergoes the jumps on the interfaces non complanar with the longitudinal direction the emm smooths the transition of the averaged distributions to the classical gaussian solution of the upscaled ade and shares with the central manifold approach mercer and roberts 1990 its ability for a mechanistic construction of the successive steady state problems the central manifold aims to analytically build the truncation corrections in the upscaled ade solving then the high order pde for the effective mean concentration profile the emm is much simpler because it algebraically builds the moments from the analytical or numerical solution of the second order ade nevertheless we have shown that the solution mercer and roberts 1990 derived in the streamwise uniform flow has the moments predicted by the emm once the set of moments is predicted the profiles can be restored from it e g for visualization and comparison of the asymmetry or fat tail effect the larger is the set of the predicted moments the better is the reconstruction and the shorter is the time and length where it becomes valid the method has been exemplified through several basic configurations the first three or four moments were presented in closed analytical form in i pure diffusion and darcy flow through two heterogeneous blocks in series ii poiseuille straight and radial flow iii darcy flow through stratified heterogeneous layers iv porous channel with a brinkman velocity profile and v a coupled system of a fracture within a surrounding diffusive matrix further a fracture embedded into brinkman porous flow was addressed in symbolic form several principal properties of these solutions might be useful for practical purpose the parallel and perpendicular obstacles manifest quite different dispersion behaviour caused by their porosity contrast in any parallel arrangement dispersion coefficient kt skewness and kurtosis asymptotically grow as pe2 pe 1 2 and pe respectively in a perpendicular configuration kt is pe independent and the two next order coefficients decay as pe 1 2 and pe 1 accordingly in a single porous channel the dimensionless transport coefficients become determined through the coupling of the darcy number da and pe namely kt decreases from the stokes flow da to darcy regime da 0 and hence it is smaller than in poiseuille flow at the same pe the strongest asymmetry in the spatial system and the largest peakedness in the rtd is predicted for the combination of high pe and small da because of the mixing in boundary layers the emm also allows to estimate the role of the flow model parameters on the transport coefficients this work demonstrated this for brinkman viscosity coefficient νeff e g in a single porous channel kt increases together with ν e f f ν ϕ when ϕ diminishes in heterogeneous stratified systems the emm constructed the transport coefficients for the cross section averaged mixed distribution a coupled system of a fracture embedded in porous flow is controlled in a non monotonous fashion by the darcy number matrix porosity and the relative fracture thickness it has been found that kt decreases in stokes brinkman flow with respect to the open flow but it enhances the open flow dispersivity in darcy flow towards a purely diffusive matrix regime in this limit the relative non gaussian effects will noticeably grow only when ϕ becomes very small in a future work we aim to extend the emm ansatz to mobile immoble mim approach and perhaps to consolidate its upscaling procedure without need of resorting to the heuristic arguments the symbolic and numerical emm solutions provide an excellent benchmark tool for ade solvers from the simplest to complex geometry and flow following ginzburg 2017 the emm can be also employed to derive truncation numerical corrections in dispersion skewness and kurtosis intrinsic to the direct ade schemes in this work the symbolic solutions were approved by the two numerical models based on the lattice boltzmann two relaxation times operator trt the direct trt ade scheme vikhansky and ginzburg 2014 and a novel trt emm scheme which complements the trt ade with the space variable mass source and interface boundary advective diffusion flux jump on the one side the emm validates the two numerical schemes on the other side the trt ade confirms the emm and the trt emm via transient computations in comparison to the direct solvers the emm is very powerful and well suitable for the mesh refining confined to a single cell it avoids their pe 2 growing of the computational time because of the progressive increase of the number of cells in the transition towards the taylor regime in the second part of this work the accuracy of the trt emm is examined through its symbolic solutions in basic heterogeneous configurations against the analytical solutions of the emm scheme and for non trivial two dimensional heterogeneous flow against the direct resolution of the breakthrough curves and residence time distributions although implicit interface and boundary conditions make the trt emm very simple and attractive for porous media the emm algorithms formulated in this work can be efficiently performed with any suitable two or three dimensional numerical advection diffusion linear solver and employed for the study of the transport properties in delaying porous rocks and composite materials and in the optimal design of the porous vegetation zones for pollutant remediation chemical reactors or micro channels acknowledgement the authors are grateful to gonçalo silva for the critical reading of the manuscript appendix a derivation of dispersion
