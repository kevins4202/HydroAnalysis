23500,ship owners and classification societies have recently begun to require assessments of the maneuverability of twin screw ships under machinery failure since such an assessment has not yet been previously conducted its concept and process have not been clearly established in this paper we construct a simulation that predicts the maneuverability of a ship under machinery failure and propose a process to conduct imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure and this is referred to as single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure a mathematical model for the simulation under normal operating condition is verified and assumptions are applied to the existing mathematical model to introduce machinery failure the suggested procedure is followed to verify a mathematical model with these assumptions under machinery failure by conducting sea trials finally numerical simulations for mandatory tests are conducted for the defined failures and the physical characteristics of each failure are investigated compared to those under normal operating conditions keywords maneuverability machinery failure single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure cross combination failure 1 introduction twin screw ships have recently become known for their superior maneuverability over single screw ships tankers operating at a low speed gilmore et al 2012 the twin screw lngcs are more efficient than single screw lngc in particular for large lngcs approximately 170 000 cubic meters and up devanney 2008 consequently the ship design favors twin screw since twin screw ships are safer with higher fuel efficiency in specific cases they are preferred by ship owners twin screw ships are now being built for use as ulcss and lngcs the hull propeller and rudder design for twin screw ships is conventionally carried out following similar steps used for single screw ships from a maneuvering point of view mandatory tests evaluate the ship maneuverability based on the recommendations proposed by the imo imo msc 137 76 2002 imo msc circ 1053 2002 and these tests include an initial turning test a 35 turning test a 10 10 zigzag test and a 20 20 zigzag test at the design speed the estimated or measured maneuvering test values have to meet imo maneuvering standards kim et al 2006 2009 evaluated the maneuverability of a single and twin screw container ship using captive model tests they noted that a conventional approach to evaluate the maneuverability is the same for single screw and twin screw ships and this approach does not consider the unique twin screw maneuvering characteristics resulting from the hull propeller and rudder design one of the distinctive characteristics of a twin screw ship is its robustness related to equipment failure the equipment failure is the second largest cause of marine transportation accidents about 16 u s department of transporation 1999 since propulsion failure occurs when a vessel loses its ability to maneuver it could create major marine casualties particularly if it occurs in the middle of heavy traffic near obstructions such as icebergs or near the shore devanney 2008 observed that machinery failures show up as groundings or fires as consequences of the primary cause fowler and sorgard fowler and sogard 2000 insisted that most groundings occur due to wind waves and currents after mechanical failure happens as well regarding the equipment failure and ship design devanney 2008 insisted that the best way to obtain a low speed maneuverability and secure the operational safety is to use a twin screw with engine room redundancy to cope with such recognition by researchers classification societies have developed notation to assess the redundancy in machinery failure ship owners building new ships and classification societies that certify ships performance now require a redundancy assessment including fmea and twin screw maneuvering performance estimation under machinery failure classification societies such as lr abs and dnv have established notation related to the maneuvering performance under machinery failure lr 2016 abs 2016 dnv 2011 the psmr notation to evaluate the maneuverability of twin screw ships was developed by lr lr 2016 the r2 and r2 s notation were proposed by abs abs 2016 and rp notation has been suggested by dnv dnv 2011 however any action plan to request the classification has not been prepared from a shipbuilding company s perspective nevertheless it is necessary to review existing causes of malfunctions to prepare a strategy for machinery failure typical causes of equipment failure include malfunctioning deck machinery and steering and faculty propulsion electrical and fuel systems u s department of transporation 1999 mohovic et al 2013 tried to find the most dangerous scenario considering the failure of a ship s propulsive and steering system previous research provides clues regarding the failure modes that are fatal to a ship s maneuverability even if such research is conducted regardless of the number of screws for twin screw ships machinery failure has been treated as a research topic levine et al 2005 evaluated the operability of a polar endeavor class tanker with a twin screw by plotting the operability curve according to the failure mode you and kim 2017 proposed an approach to evaluate the maneuvering performance of a twin screw container ship under a single rudder failure and kim 2008 introduced the maneuverability of 216 k lngc with two types of single propeller failure from sea trials he conducted imo maneuvering tests under normal operating conditions single propeller failure in the windmill condition and single propeller failure with a fixed condition respectively you and choi 2017 suggested an approach to predict the maneuvering characteristics of a twin screw lngc under a single propeller failure they simulated the maneuverability of the 174 k lngc and compared the results to those of 216 k introduced by kim kim 2008 you and choi 2017 the major difference between lenvine et al levine et al 2005 and that of the engineers mentioned in south korea is the aim that they evaluate the maneuvering performance of machinery failure levine et al 2005 tried to assess the maneuvering performance affected by machinery failure during actual operation for this purpose they applied the concept of a time delay for a seafarer to recognize the machinery failure on board on the other hand you and kim 2017 kim 2008 you and choi 2017 evaluated the maneuvering performance from the point of view of the ship design they assessed the maneuverability under machinery failure from an equilibrium condition to obtain the representative values by conducting imo maneuvering tests from a shipbuilding company s perspective it is necessary to prepare a strategy to cope with a request from ship owners and classification societies in this paper we construct a simulation method to predict the maneuverability of the ship under machinery failure and propose a procedure to conduct imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure various simulations are conducted to investigate unique maneuvering characteristics of a twin screw ship under machinery failure first of all a twin screw lngc which was constructed at dsme was chosen to study the maneuverability under machinery failure before investigating the effect of the machinery failure on the maneuverability a mathematical model was used in a simulation under normal operating conditions compared to free running model tests since a verification was conducted in prior research some results have been included here you and choi 2017 second to assess the maneuverability under machinery failure assumptions were applied on an existing mathematical model that was used to simulate the maneuvering behavior of a ship under normal operating conditions although assumptions of a single propeller failure and a single rudder failure were proposed in prior research you and kim 2017 you and choi 2017 this has not been verified yet third after a proper procedure to evaluate the maneuverability under machinery failure was suggested a simulation following the proposed approach was verified by comparing it with the results of a sea trial we define the types of possible machinery failure to investigate the effect of each failure mode on the maneuverability these include a single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure a procedure was proposed to conduct the imo maneuvering tests under machinery failures and a sea trial was conducted for one of the defined failure types only fourth numerical simulations for each failure were conducted using the verified mathematical model with the corresponding assumptions numerical simulations for mandatory tests were conducted for defined failures and the physical characteristics of each failure were investigated through a comparison with those under normal operating conditions in addition the maneuvering behavior under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering was investigated to understand the asymmetric behavior of the ship under machinery failure due to the wind load and two kinds of sensitivity studies were additionally conducted to check the reliability of the mathematical model the first one was performed to check the effects of 10 enlarged hydrodynamic coefficients on the tactical diameter the second one was conducted to compare the effects of enlarged speed and rudder area from 10 to 10 at 5 intervals on the tactical diameter finally the maneuvering characteristics of the twin screw lngc under machinery failure can be physically understood 2 the mathematical model 2 1 the coordinate system as mentioned above the maneuvering characteristics under machinery failure were studied for a twin screw lngc table 1 shows the principal particulars of the lngc fig 1 shows the coordinate system of this research 2 2 maneuvering equations of motion in this study the maneuvering equations of motion are shown in equation 1 the forces and moment acting on the ship can be expressed as in equation 2 the subscripts h p r and w indicate the hydrodynamic loads due to the hull propellers rudders and wind respectively the mathematical model under normal operating conditions is constructed as follows 1 m u v r x m v u r y i z z r n 2 x x h x p x r x w y y h y r y w n n h n p n r n w the hydrodynamic loads of the hull are calculated as shown in equation 3 and many hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass added mass moment of inertia and rudder lift coefficients were predicted using empirical formulae proposed by kijima et al 1990 and fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 the definitions of each hydrodynamic derivative and nondimensionalization were identical to previous research proposed by kijima et al 1990 the coefficients for the resistance and thrust were obtained from the model tests twin propeller thrust loads are calculated as shown in equation 4 here k t is assumed to depend on the advance ratio which is marked as j p p o r t and j p s t b d twin rudder loads were calculated as shown in equation 5 c l α is calculated using the aspect ratio of each rudder fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 empirical formulae are used since a full spade rudder has a shape similar to the rudder studied in the empirical formulae of course the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from the empirical formulae for a single screw vessel can be regarded as doubtful values to acquire reliable prediction of maneuvering performance even if a mathematical model for a twin screw vessel is not secured it is simply tried to estimate based on the empirical formulae and the conventional experiments like resistance self propulsion and free running model test to minimize the potential risk of the mathematical model about the accuracy maneuvering performance under normal operating condition is compared with that of the free running model test results and maneuvering characteristics under aligned combination failure are compared with those of sea trials in the future it will be necessary to make the accuracy of this research higher by applying the mathematical model for the twin screw vessel especially khanfir et al 2011 and dubbioso et al 2015 adopted more complicated mathematical model including a lot of hydrodynamic coefficients like flow straightening coefficient of yaw rate and rudder propeller interaction coefficients to replicate the maneuvering behavior of a twin screw ship a ship is generally operated according to the ordered engine power if a propeller is overloaded due to environmental load or ship speed rpm is immediately reduced since the overloading on a propeller is an important issue of the maneuvering performance under machinery failure as well representatively coraddu et al 2013 and muscari et al 2017 anticipated that propeller and rudder were significantly affected by the asymmetric behavior of a twin screw vessel they investigated the characteristics of the propeller overloading based on the free running model tests and cfd calculations respectively however this research does not take into account the overloading of a propeller in the maneuvering performance under machinery failure namely the constant rpm is assumed by ignoring the overloading of a propeller the way how to deal with the overloading is being searched from a perspective of a shipbuilding company it will be further developed in near future 3 x h m x u m y x v r v r 1 2 ρ l p p t u 2 x u u cos 2 β y h m y v m x u r y h v r n h j z z r n h v r x g y h v r w

lngc under normal operating conditions by comparing the results of a simulation to those obtained from tests using a free running model test three mandatory tests were compared a 35 turning test a 10 10 zigzag test and a 20 20 zigzag test at design speed here only the trajectories for the 35 turning tests and time histories of the heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle for the 10 10 zigzag test were excerpted fig 2 shows the trajectories for the 35 turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions the solid blue lines and black filled squares indicate the trajectories obtained from the simulations and the free running model tests respectively fig 3 shows the time histories of the heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle for the 10 10 zigzag tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions the solid blue line the dotted blue line and broken blue line respectively indicate the time histories of heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle obtained from the simulations the solid black squares empty black circles and empty black diamonds respectively indicate the time histories of the heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle obtained from the free running model tests as shown in figs 2 and 3 there are insignificant differences between the results of the simulation and the free running model test results therefore the mathematical model is able to simulate the twin screw maneuvering behavior of the lngc under normal operating conditions inherent maneuvering indices predicted from simulations summarized with those regulated by the imo as shown in table 2 imo msc 137 76 2002 you and choi 2017 from the inherent maneuverability an assessment of the maneuverability under machinery failure will be approached as shown in table 2 all simulated results meet the imo maneuvering criteria with a wide margin from the maneuvering point of view the design of the lngc is regarded as an extraordinary one in particular a turning ability with a good performance was observed in addition it is necessary to conduct spiral tests to understand the unusual yaw checking ability under machinery failure in general a spiral test was performed to assess the directional stability of a ship imo msc circ 1053 2002 since the directional stability is closely connected to the yaw checking ability it is helpful for us to understand the maneuvering behavior of the ship the simulated spiral tests are shown in fig 4 and each simulation is conducted with a 1 degree interval of the rudder deflection angle the solid black circles indicate a converged turn rate according to each rudder deflection angle if the ship returns to the zero turn rate the ship is stable imo msc circ 1053 2002 however a slight unstable loop is observed for the lngc if there is an unstable loop the allowable loop width is defined as in equation 6 imo msc circ 1053 2002 since the l p p is 283 5 m and the design speed is 18 2 knots l v is of about 30 28 following the second condition in equation 6 the allowable loop width is 7 09 since the observed loop width is 5 the ship meets explanatory notes as well imo msc circ 1053 2002 of course if there is a directional unstability it is possible to satisfy the imo criteria as shown in the twin screw lngc here however the directional unstability can sometimes affect the zigzag maneuver significantly the unstability will be discussed when the zigzag test under machinery failure is investigated 6 0 degree for l v 9 seconds 3 1 3 l v for 9 l v 45 seconds 12 degrees for 45 l v seconds 2 4 assumptions to consider the machinery failure you and kim 2017 and you and choi 2017 proposed an approach to predict the maneuvering behavior under a single rudder failure and single propeller failure respectively from the anticipated physical phenomenon some values in the mathematical model under normal operating conditions are changed according to the machinery failure first if a propeller is stopped locked the rpm are assumed to be zero of course there are two kinds of states of an uncontrollable propeller windmill and locked kim 2008 from sea trials from 216 k lngc there is a little difference between the windmill and locked propeller under a single propeller failure kim 2008 since the difference can be ignored the locking propeller is assumed here for example if the propeller on the port side is locked n p o r t is set to zero in equation 4 in the case of propeller failure the effect of a locked propeller on a rudder has to be additionally considered since the flow behind the locked propeller is not accelerated the inflow speed at the rudder behind the propeller is assumed to be identical to the ship s speed but in the opposite direction you and choi 2017 for example if the propeller on the port side is locked u r p o r t is assumed to be u second if a rudder cannot be operated the rudder is assumed to be fixed at a certain angle you and kim 2017 and the steering gear can be manually controlled from any fixed angle to 0 if there is any problem in the steering system consequently the locked rudder is always fixed at a neutral angle which is 0 for example if the rudder on the port side is locked the δ p o r t is assumed to be 0 during the simulations the interaction coefficients are used in simulations under machinery failure which is not different from those used in simulations under normal operating conditions although levine levine et al 2005 and you and kim 2017 considered a fixed rudder at a certain angle which is not a neutral angle this kind of extreme condition is excluded during the mandatory simulation in addition the effect of a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle on zigzag tests is investigated to understand the physical characteristics under single rudder failure 3 test procedure suggestion and verification 3 1 suggested test procedure imo maneuvering tests were used to evaluate the ship maneuverability accordingly it is convenient to compare the maneuverability of twin screw lngc under machinery failure previous research conducted by you and choi 2017 recognized that two additional steps were needed before conducting imo maneuvering tests to consider unique machinery failure characteristics and this procedure is shown in fig 5 kim 2008 conducted sea trials of imo maneuvering tests under an equilibrium condition by using an autopilot device as well first the types of machinery failure have yet to be defined since the propeller and rudder failure are only considered here the types can be defined by combining the failure of each device table 3 shows the types of machinery failure that have to be studied there are five conditions including normal operating condition and four types of machinery failure normal refers to the conditions where both the propellers and the rudders operate normally single propeller failure indicates that one propeller is stopped while the other propeller and both rudders operate normally single rudder failure means a rudder on one side is locked while the other rudder and both propellers operate normally the aligned combination failure refers to conditions where both the propeller and rudder on one side are locked while the propeller and rudder on the other side operate normally the cross combination failure means the propeller on one side and the rudder on the opposite side are locked while the other propeller and rudder operate normally and the propellers are installed to rotate in the opposing directions in table 3 only the portside location of the locked device is used except cross combination failure of course more combinations can be created by taking into account the direction of the locked propeller and rudder however since the difference due to installed direction is not significant it is ignored therefore the maneuvering characteristics of the lngc under machinery failure are only investigated through these four failure conditions second the initial conditions including the speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle according to each failure mode were to be found to carry out the imo maneuvering tests a ship has to be going straight at a constant speed however a twin screw ship with machinery failure cannot move straight ahead without controlling rudders for example if a propeller is stopped the reduced thrust causes the ship to slow in addition the unbalanced thrust makes the ship rotate therefore it is essential to control the rudders to prevent the ship from rotating likewise the unbalanced drag due to a failed rudder also affects the predicted maneuvering motion and these are the reasons why the prescribed initial conditions have to be found to find the initial conditions where the lngc goes straight at a constant speed straight maneuvers are simulated with machinery failure the fuzzy control proposed by hasegawa and kouzuki hasegawa and kouzuki 1987 you and rhee 2016 you et al 2018 ahn et al 2012 is applied to determine the rudder angle and in the simulation lngc starts with a design speed of 18 20 knots the operating devices are different according to the types of failure for example if there is an aligned combination failure a propeller on the port side is stopped and a rudder on the port is fixed at 0 since the reduced thrust and drag affects the maneuvers of the lngc the other rudder on the starboard side will be controlled as time passes the ship shows straight path with a converged speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle these values are regarded as the initial conditions for the imo maneuvering tests under an aligned combination failure identical straight maneuvers are then simulated repeatedly under other types of machinery failure third the imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure are simulated from the predicted initial conditions by following the procedure imo msc 137 76 2002 imo msc circ 1053 2002 here it is only possible to control propellers and rudders that normally operate by following the imo maneuvering test procedure in the case of a locked propeller the propeller is assumed to have stopped and its rpm is zero you and choi 2017 in the case of a fixed rudder the deflection angle of the uncontrollable rudder is assumed to be a neutral angle you and kim 2017 3 2 verification under machinery failure from sea trials the results calculated using the proposed method can be verified by comparing them to data obtained from sea trials which is necessary to verify the simulation and procedure for the imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure table 4 shows the sea trial conditions these were conducted under an aligned combination failure only the 35 turning test to the port side and the 10 10 zigzag test to the port side were only conducted at speeds lower than the design speed for safety reasons although verification was limited to the aligned combination failure verification is to be extended because the locked propeller and rudder are considered together since the tests under the machinery failure are not conventional tests this is challenging for a ship building company even if the rpm is constant between the two sea trials the speeds are slightly different due to environmental load in this study the loads are not considered in the simulations and the initial speeds were of about 9 0 knots with wind speeds less than approximately 10 0 knots and the ship encounters head winds at sea fig 6 shows the trajectories for 35 turning tests of the lngc under the aligned combination failure from the sea trials and the simulated tests the black squares and solid blue lines indicate the sea trial results and simulation results respectively for security reasons exact values identifying the maneuverability are removed from the figure the trajectory obtained from sea trials is approximately 10 larger than that predicted from simulations even if the turning circle is similarly shaped fig 7 shows the heading angle and rudder deflection angle of the lngc under the aligned combination failure from sea trials and simulated tests the black squares and solid blue lines indicate the time histories of the heading angle for the results of the sea trials and simulation respectively for security reasons exact values identifying the maneuverability are removed from the figure as well the empty black circles and broken line with diamonds indicate a rudder deflection angle equipped on the port and starboard side from the sea trials and the dotted blue line and broken blue line indicate the rudder deflection angle equipped on the port and starboard side from the simulated trials the time history of the heading angle and rudder deflection angle obtained from the sea trials matches well with those from the simulation 4 investigation of the maneuvering characteristics under machinery failure imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure are simulated based on the verified procedure the results of the simulation are then investigated to find unique maneuvering characteristics of a twin screw lngc under machinery failure there are six types of simulations here first straight maneuvers are simulated to find the equilibrium conditions according to the machinery failure from the acquired steady state information the following five simulations are conducted in order second and third the initial turning tests and 35 turning tests are simulated to evaluate the turning ability under machinery failure fourth 35 turning tests are simulated under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering to observe the asymmetry under machinery failure due to the wind loads fifth the sensitivity study is conducted since it is necessary to check the reliability of the mathematical model under normal operating condition and four failure conditions sixth and seventh 10 10 zigzag tests were simulated to assess the yaw checking ability of the lngc according to the machinery failure 10 10 zigzag tests are additionally simulated by investigating the effect of a fixed rudder at a certain angle on the yaw checking ability eighth and ninth 20 20 zigzag tests were simulated to assess the yaw checking ability of the lngc according to the machinery failure likewise 20 20 zigzag tests are further simulated by investigating the effect of a fixed rudder at a certain angle on the yaw checking ability as well 4 1 finding equilibrium conditions for the initial approach figs 8 10 show the time histories of the speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle during straight maneuvers respectively the solid black line dotted blue line broken red line dotted green line and two point dotted orange line refer to the results under normal operating conditions single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure respectively from here the definition for each line is always identical if any results under the five conditions are plotted together in fig 8 two groups are observed according to the converged speed the normal and single rudder failure belongs to the first group in which there is no speed drop in the case of the single rudder failure both propellers normally operate and a locked rudder is fixed at 0 therefore the ship can go straight with the design speed since the unbalanced thrust and drag are not generated in the initial approach the other failure conditions belong to the second group in which there is a speed drop and the converged speeds under a single propeller failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure are almost the same the reduced thrust due to a locked propeller is a major cause of speed drop and in these cases the rudders have to be controlled to cancel out the unbalance in the thrust due to the propellers and drag due to the rudders when the ship goes straight three features are observed in fig 9 and the characteristics are reviewed to infer the reasons based on physical knowledge the converged heading angles shown in fig 10 are similar to those in fig 9 and these can be intuitively understood based on the explanations in fig 9 as well first a peak of the time histories of the rudder deflection angle are commonly observed before they converge at a certain angle since the control technique determines the command rudder angle the peak is also observed to steer the course of a ship by applying fuzzy control as well ahn et al 2012 fuzzy control is a kind of pd control and the control gains continuously change by combining the difference between the command heading angle and the current heading angle and turn rate as a result an insignificant overshoot related to the change in course is obtained and this is a unique feature of the applied control technique hasegawa and kouzuki 1987 you and rhee 2016 you et al 2018 ahn et al 2012 second the converged rudder deflection angle under a cross combination failure is slightly larger than that under an aligned combination failure this is caused by the unbalanced thrust of an active propeller and drag due to the controllable rudder in both failures the negative moment due to the activated propeller on the starboard side is generated and the direction of the moment due to a controllable rudder is different in the aligned combination failure a positive moment due to the controllable rudder on the starboard side is generated and a negative moment due to the rudder on the port side is generated under a cross combination failure consequently the aggregated yaw moment due to unbalanced thrust and drag is reduced or increased by their direction third the converged rudder deflection angle under a single propeller failure is about half that under the aligned combination failure and cross combination failure the reason for such is that the number of controllable rudders is two under a single propeller failure even though the rudder is only active under two combination failures table 5 shows the converged values of the speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle during straight maneuvers since the actual difference between the deflected heading angles and the rudder deflection angle is not significant the principal effect of each machinery failure on the initial conditions is regarded as a reduced speed from the acquired initial conditions the effect of each locked propeller and rudder on maneuvering behavior will be added according to the simulated tests 4 2 initial turning tests under machinery failure fig 11 shows the predicted trajectories for the initial turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions and machinery failure table 6 shows the relative ratio between the predicted initial track reach of the lngc for initial turning tests under machinery failure and that under the normal operating conditions after some observations in the figure and table a brief inference is described to review the described physical characteristics for the initial turning tests in further detail a discussion will be carried out using other physical values first the initial track reaches to the starboard side is commonly larger than that to the port side under three failure conditions except a single rudder failure shown in fig 11 and table 6 briefly the tendency results from an unbalanced yaw moment due to thrust from a locked propeller on the port side namely the thrust generated from a propeller on the starboard side helps the ship turn to the port side second the initial track reaches to the port and starboard sides under a single propeller failure which is smaller than those under normal operating conditions as shown in fig 11 and table 6 the yaw moment due to the rudders under a single propeller failure is slightly smaller than that under normal operating conditions because the inflow speed at the rudder is not accelerated however the lower initial speed under normal operating conditions causes a short travel distance during each time step and this may cause a reduced initial track reach under a single propeller failure in general the turning ability including initial turning is directly affected by the turn rate kim et al 2013 and to investigate the observed characteristics based on the physical knowledge the time histories of the yaw moment due to rudders and the turn rate are plotted according to the simulated conditions from figs 12 16 in these figures a solid black line with filled black squares and solid black line with empty squares indicate the moment due to the port side rudder and starboard side rudder during the port side turning motion and the solid black line indicates the aggregate moment due to both rudders during the port side turning motion as well otherwise the dotted blue line with filled blue circles and dotted blue line with empty circles indicate the moment due to the port side rudder and starboard side rudder during the starboard side turning motion and the solid blue chain line indicates the aggregate moment due to both rudders during the starboard side turning motion as well the solid black line with filled black diamonds and empty blue diamonds indicate the turn rate of the ship during the initial turning to the port and starboard side respectively from here the definition is always identical if the yaw moment due to rudders and the turn rate according to each condition are plotted together first of all the common features in these figures are explained from figs 12 16 a similar tendency is observed for the yaw moment due to the rudders and the turn rate the yaw moment rapidly increases from zero to about 5 s and it matches the duration to control the rudder in order to execute the initial turning test this test is conducted by changing the rudder deflection angle from a neutral angle to 10 until the heading angle arrives at 10 since the turn rate of a rudder is generally 2 32 d e g s the maximum yaw moment is calculated to be about 5 s once the ship turns according to the generated yaw moment due to the rudders the angle of attack on each rudder decreases and the yaw moment due to the rudders decreases as well the turn rate continuously increases due to the aggregated yaw moment by the rudders and it is natural for the turn rate to be directly affected by the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders as shown in equations 1 and 2 in fig 12 the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders and the turn rate is symmetric in the port and starboard side however other cases show an asymmetric tendency with an insignificant difference since the inflow behind the locked propeller does not accelerate each yaw moment due to each rudder is not identical under a single propeller failure as shown in fig 13 there is a rudder fixed at a neural angle under the single rudder failure aligned with the combination failure and a cross combination failure the aggregate rudder moment under the three conditions become smaller than under normal operating conditions and a single propeller condition basically this is a result of the decrease in the number of activated rudders however the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders decreases more than 50 and the reason is that the fixed rudder prevents the ship from turning in the intended direction like a skeg as shown in figs 14 16 the aggregated yaw moment to the port side is slightly larger than that to the starboard side and the turn rate to the port side is also larger than that to the starboard side even if the difference between the calculated turn rates is insignificant since a larger turn rate of the ship indicates that the ship turns quickly the heading of the ship reaches 10 earlier accordingly the observation that the unbalanced thrust generated from the propeller on the starboard side helps the ship turn to the port side can be understood the asymmetry for the final time of each calculation is observed under a single propeller failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure clearly this feature indicates that the magnitude of the yaw moment due to unbalanced thrust is dominant compared to that due to the unbalanced drag of the rudders it is natural that the thrust of a propeller is much larger than the drag obtained from the normal pressure of a rudder within the design speed range a more convincing explanation is given by investigating the time history of the longitudinal transversal speed and drift angle of the ship for the initial turning tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure as shown in figs 17 and 18 the solid black line with filled black squares solid black line with empty squares and solid black line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under normal operating conditions the dotted blue line with solid blue circles dotted blue line with empty circles and dotted blue line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under a single propeller failure the broken red line with solid red diamonds broken red line with empty diamonds and broken red line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under a single rudder failure the dotted green line with solid green right triangles dotted green line with empty right triangles and dotted green line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under the aligned combination failure the two point dotted orange line with solid orange left triangles two point dotted orange line with empty left triangles and dotted orange line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under a cross combination failure from here the definitions of each line are always identical if the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under five conditions are plotted together the large drift angle during the initial turning indicates that the ship can obtain a small turning trajectory with a good turning ability kim et al 2013 the higher yaw moment is generated due to the rudders as shown in figs 12 16 the higher the drift angle as shown in figs 17 and 18 this matches well with the magnitude of the initial track reach except for the single propeller failure the initial track reach under a single propeller failure is shorter than that under normal operating conditions since the approaching speed is always lower than that under normal operating conditions 4 3 35 turning tests under machinery failures fig 19 shows the predicted trajectories for 35 turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions and machinery failures table 7 shows the relative ratio between the predicted advances transfers and tactical diameters of the lngc for 35 turning tests under machinery failures and those under the normal operating conditions likewise some observations in the figure and in the table are described and other physical values will be discussed to investigate the predicted features in detail first the tendency of the relative ratios of the turning circles are well matched with those of the initial track reach and it is observed that the relative ratios for the advance transfer and tactical diameter to the starboard side are commonly larger than those to the port side under three failure conditions except for a single rudder failure as shown in fig 19 and table 7 this is also affected by the unbalanced thrust as is explained for the initial turning tests for three failure conditions the reason for which the values to the starboard side are smaller than those to the port side under a single rudder failure is that the unbalanced drag makes the yaw moment turn toward the starboard side because there is no unbalanced thrust second the advance under a single propeller failure is smaller than that under normal operating conditions and the reason can be inferred due to reduced initial approaching speed as well third the advance transfer and tactical diameters decrease in the order of the cross combination failure single rudder failure and aligned combination failure in principal the reason why the values under a single rudder failure are larger than those under an aligned combination failure may be the effect of the magnitude of the yaw moment as previously mentioned the turning ability is significantly affected by the yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate kim et al 2013 from this point of view the observed characteristics are reviewed the time histories of the yaw moments due to the rudders and turn rate for the 35 turning test are plotted according to the conditions simulated from figs 20 24 the similarity between the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate is distinctly recognized through a comparison with that for the initial turning tests in figs 12 16 only 35 of turning motion is sufficiently long to observe the various phases related to the turning test lewis 1989 a detailed description of each phase of turning is shown in equation 7 and the turning motion of the ship during the initial turning tests belong to the 1st phase only however each phase can be recognized from the time histories of the turn rate during the 35 turning test 7 1 st phase v 0 r 0 v 0 r 0 2 nd phase v 0 r 0 v 0 r 0 3 rd phase v 0 r 0 v 0 r 0 the common characteristics from figs 20 24 are described below the yaw moment rapidly increases from zero to about 15 s and it matches the duration to control the rudder to execute a 35 turning test once the ship turns according to the generated yaw moment due to the rudders the speed decreases and yaw moment due to the rudders steadily decreases as well in fig 20 the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate is symmetric to the port and starboard side because this case is for normal operating conditions however each yaw moment due to a rudder installed on the port and starboard side is slightly different and this is a result of the yaw moment due to drag when both rudders are synchronized a surge and sway force are completely identical and in the case of the yaw moment due to a rudder it is composed of two components as follows one is generated due to the sway force and the other is affected by the drag surge force as shown in equation 5 since the direction of the installed rudder from the center line is opposite the yaw moment due to the second component makes the yaw moment of each rudder slightly different the yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rates show asymmetric characteristics under machinery failure as shown in figs 21 24 since the inflow behind the locked propeller is not accelerated each yaw moment due to each rudder is not identical together under a single propeller failure as shown in fig 21 the fixed rudder under a single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure have a role like a skeg the aggregated yaw moment to the port side is slightly larger than that to the starboard side under machinery failure except for the single rudder failure as well and the turn rate to the port side is slightly larger than that to the starboard side since a larger turn rate of the ship indicates that the ship turns quickly the heading of the ship reaches 360 earlier the times histories of the longitudinal transversal speed and drift angle of the ship for the initial turning tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failures are shown in figs 25 and 26 the turning trajectories under a single propeller failure clearly shift toward the stern in comparison with those under the normal operating conditions an identical tendency is observed from the sea trial of 216 k lngc kim 2008 since both rudders can operate under a single propeller failure the yaw moment and the turn rate under a single propeller failure have similar values as those under the normal operating conditions however the initial approach speed under a single propeller failure is lower than that under the normal operating conditions which makes a smaller advance if the drift angle during steady turning is similar the tactical diameter is also similar consequently the transfer and tactical diameter is almost the same as those under normal operating conditions the turning circles under the single rudder failure and cross combination failure also shift toward the stern and these are larger than under normal operating conditions in these conditions the speed drop slowly occurs and consequently the speed of the ship is higher than that in other cases where the turn rate is similar and the sailing speed is high the turning circles are thus enlarged and shift toward the stern by comparing the normal turning trajectories of the ship the trajectories are enlarged to the rear direction when the ship turns under single propeller failure single rudder failure and cross combination failure to secure the sailing safety a seafarer has to pay attention to whether there is any obstacle in the wider areas 4 4 35 turning tests under machinery failures under wind from bow quartering levine et al 2005 obtained an asymmetric operability curve under machinery failure affected by wind loads by investigating the effect here the credibility of this simulation can be secured if a similar phenomenon is observed to consider the wind loads acting on the 174 k lngc wind tunnel model test results are used fig 27 shows the nondimensionalized wind load coefficients of the lngc obtained from a wind tunnel model test with 1 200 scale model of the vessel dsme 2008 the wind model test was conducted in the 2 6 m wide boundary layer wind tunnel in december 2007 the tunnel size is 21 0 m x 2 6 m x 1 8 m length x width x height here wind speed corresponds to 12 5 m s and a reynolds number is 9 0 10 5 at the reference height 10 0 m in full scale the model was constructed in wood high density foam and brass it was chosen as a compromise between avoiding scale effects from a model that is too small and avoiding blockage in the wind tunnel caused by a model that is too large wind loads are measured using the 6 component strain gauges at the mid ship location in fig 27 the solid black line dotted blue line and broken red line indicate c x c y and c n respectively for security reasons exact values identifying the maneuverability are removed from the figure the measured wind loads are non dimensionalized by using equation 8 the wind loads are considered by following the common method which is used in prior researches you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 dsme 2008 they are briefly shown in equation 9 8 c x x 1 2 ρ v w 2 a t c y y 1 2 ρ v w 2 a l c n n 1 2 ρ v w 2 a l l o a

r w fig 28 shows the trajectories for 35 turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions and machinery failures under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering 23 5 knots wind is about beaufort number 5 or 6 bhattacharyya 1978 it is regarded as not extreme but moderate to investigate the effect of winds in the ocean in a referred paper a ship was operated under about beaufort 6 for a few days you et al 2018 furthermore the effect of 23 5 knots wind on the turning trajectories under normal operating conditions is not significant as shown in fig 28 consequently 23 5 knots wind is considered as the reference wind speed here the constant wind comes from the starboard side and table 8 shows the relative ratio between the predicted advances transfers and tactical diameters of the lngc for 35 turning tests under 23 5 knots of wind under machinery failure and under normal operating conditions under no wind similarly the observations in the figure and in the table are first described and an additional discussion will be conducted further first the drift directions under the wind of each trajectory are exposed according to the center of the wind load acting on the superstructure and incident angle of the wind you 2013 here for the wind coming from the starboard side bow quartering the trajectories shift toward the port side roughly the effect of the wind load on the turning trajectory is usual when compared to similar research considering the wind load you et al 2017a 2017b you 2013 as intended the asymmetry in the turning trajectories is clearly observed in fig 28 and table 8 from tables 7 and 8 an asymmetric effect due to wind loads can be recognized if winds come from a certain angle trajectories of the ship have to be deformed since the effect of wind loads on turning trajectories according to the turning direction is not symmetric the trajectories influenced by winds show asymmetric tendency levine et al 2005 here the deviated relative ratios of the starboard sides turning are larger than those to port side under single propeller failure and aligned combination failure accordingly the asymmetry of turning trajectories becomes larger according to the wind loads under the failures in the case of single rudder failure a deviation is similar with that under normal operating condition these observations indicate that the extent of asymmetric tendency depends on the types of machinery failure as well an unexpected feature is additionally observed from fig 28 and table 8 the advance transfer and tactical diameter to the starboard under a cross combination failure is significantly enlarged toward the starboard side it shows inverse tendency with previous observation since this observation cannot be intuitively understood further discussion is needed time histories of the yaw moments due to rudders and the turn rate for a 35 turning test under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering are plotted according to the simulated conditions from figs 29 33 basically the dynamic responses during a 35 turning test under the wind are similar to those investigated in figs 20 24 accordingly the unusual characteristics in fig 28 are only reviewed here the tendency of the yaw moment and turn rate under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering is clearly different as that under no wind condition as shown in figs 20 24 in common the turn rate becomes steady as time goes on during the 35 turning test under no wind however in the cases of the port side turning the aggregated yaw moment and turn rate initially increased likewise those values decrease however after being maintained at certain values for a while they decrease again in the cases of the starboard side turning the total yaw moment and turn rate initially increased as well of course those values decrease but after they increase for a while they decrease again this asymmetric tendency affects the asymmetric turning trajectories due to the wind load and this effect especially corresponds to the yaw wind load coefficients until the ship turns to 360 the direction of the yaw moment changes four times since two changes are accompanied with a large difference according to the direction of the yaw wind load coefficients the loads can help the ship turns easily or prevent the ship from turning repeatedly figs 34 and 35 show the time history of the longitudinal transversal speed and drift angle of the ship for the 35 turning tests to the port side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering by comparison with the turning speed under no wind the speed drops are significant under wind regardless of the turning direction the speed decreases to less than that under no wind the wind loads act on the hull as additional resistance the reason why the trajectory to the starboard side under a cross combination failure becomes large is that the speed is relative larger than that to the port side as shown in figs 34 and 35 the ship moves a longer distance with a higher speed at a given time step the large drift angle is observed regardless of the turning direction in particular the drift angle to the port side is much larger than that to the starboard side and a large drift angle indicates that the ship drift overcomes the wind loads slowly the mathematical model used here is not applicable for such a large drift angle because there is a significantly larger hydrodynamic load for the sway and yaw moment that are predicted kang and hasegawa 2007 so we have to take care of faulty reasoning due to incorrect calculations although there is a potential error regarding the mathematical model by considering the large drift angle and extremely low speed during turning an extraordinary observation can be dealt with fig 28 shows a limited maneuvering performance of a ship affected environmental load here the wind is only considered under machinery failure as mentioned in figs 2 and 3 and table 2 the ship show the superior maneuverability under normal operating condition and it is able to tell the identical opinion under normal operating condition with 23 5 knots wind as well however it is hard for the ship to execute 35 turning as shown in fig 33 about 2500 s are needed to complete the turning since the yaw moment generated by rudders is not significantly larger than that needed to turn normally because the yaw moment due to rudders is the smallest under cross combination failure that kind of unique characteristics are observed by comparing other conditions in addition the drift angles of the ship during 35 turning test are variated from about 16 to 30 as shown in figs 25 and 26 however the drift angles become larger at 35 turning tests to the port side as shown in fig 34 reversely the drift angles get smaller at 35 turning tests to the starboard side as shown in fig 35 the reason why the drift angles under winds become larger or smaller than those under no wind condition is due to wind loads acting on the hull in the last phase of turning since the winds come from bow quartering 45 the ship has to overcome the wind load at the last phase of turning in the cases of the port side reversely wind loads assist for the ship to turn easily at the last phase of turning in the cases of the starboard side since the effect of environmental loads on the turning ability under machinery failure the feature is worth attempting a follow up study in near future 4 5 sensitivity study about the 35 turning test results affected by the key parameters lee and shin 1998 did sensitivity study to recognize the hydrodynamic coefficients that more strongly affect the predicted 1st and 2nd overshoot at 10 10 zigzag test since it is necessary to check the reliability of the mathematical model the sensitivity study is also planned here two kinds of sensitivity study are conducted as follows first the enlarged tactical diameter to the starboard side is divided by the value which is predicted by using the original hydrodynamic coefficient after hydrodynamic coefficients are 10 enlarged the values used in the comparison are obtained under normal operating condition only fig 36 shows the relative sensitivity affected by variated hydrodynamic coefficients under normal operating condition hydrodynamic coefficients for yaw moment are mainly affecting the tactical diameter especially n v is the most sensitive value and it makes the tactical diameter to be reduced about 3 7 second from the analysis for the time histories of moment and speed we assumed that the main parameters which affect the predicted maneuvering performance are lift forces and moment affected by the sailing speed and rudder area the ship speed and rudder area are variated from 90 to 110 by 5 intervals initial rpm of the ship is also variated to maintain the variated speed the predicted tactical diameter to starboard side is divided by the value of model ship under each condition as shown in fig 19 relative sensitivities affected by the variated speed and rudder area are summarized from table 9 to table 13 as follows from the relative sensitivity study it is confirmed that the mathematical model does not show the intense sensitivity related to the maneuvering performance due to the speed and rudder area under normal operating condition and other failure conditions the value is maximized with 10 enlarged speed and 10 reduced rudder area and the value is minimized with 10 reduced speed and 10 enlarged rudder area under normal operating condition single propeller failure condition single rudder failure condition and aligned combination failure discriminatively the maximum value is observed with 10 reduced speed and 10 reduced rudder area and the minimum value is observed with 10 enlarged speed and 10 enlarged rudder area under cross combination failure the maximum sensitivity is under 7 with 10 variation of speed and rudder area under normal operating condition on the values predicted under normal operating condition relative sensitivities under other failure conditions become slightly smaller this results from the absolute magnitude of tactical diameter with original speed and rudder area as shown in fig 19 the tactical diameter under normal operating condition is the smallest value by comparing values under other failure conditions even if the variated magnitudes are similar the relative sensitivity under normal operating condition is the largest since a similar value is divided by the larger value 4 6 10 10 zigzag tests under machinery failure zigzag tests need to be conducted according to the initial approaching direction table 9 shows the relative ratio between the predicted 1st and 2nd overshoot angles for 10 10 zigzag tests to the port side and the starboard side respectively the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure become significantly larger than under normal operating conditions as shown in figs 37 and 38 and table 14 the overshoot angles under a single propeller failure are smaller than those under normal operating conditions on the other hand the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles predicted under a single propeller failure decrease when compared to those under normal operating conditions in both approaching directions the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure and the normal operating condition are similar as shown in figs 37 and 38 and table 14 furthermore the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure is smaller than those under normal operating conditions basically two activating rudders help to secure yaw checking ability of the ship since there is no skeg effect due to a fixed rudder in the case of single propeller failure approaching speed is lower than that under normal operating condition the approaching speed affects the necessary loads to reverse its heading by controlling rudders since smaller yaw moment is needed under single propeller failure the overshoot angle becomes smaller the relative magnitude between the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles is dependent on the direction of approach under the aligned combination failure and cross combination failure namely if the ship starts a zigzag motion toward the port side first the relative ratio for the 1st overshoot angle is larger than that for the 2nd overshoot angle on the other hand if the ship starts a zigzag motion to starboard side first the relative ratio for the 2nd overshoot angle is larger than that for the 1st overshoot angle since a locked propeller and rudder are the same in a twin screw ship at the same time the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles have to be predicted with different aspects to review the observed characteristics in detail the time histories of the yaw moments due to rudders and the turn rate for 10 10 zigzag tests are plotted according to the simulated conditions from figs 39 43 the notable difference on the plots compared to the plots obtained from turning tests and aggregated yaw moments due to rudders under machinery failure are not distinguished from those under normal operating conditions in general the yaw checking ability is affected by the yaw moment due to the rudders and speed of approach lewis 1989 since the yaw moment due to the rudders is not largely different a significant difference on the overshoot may result from the sailing speed during the zigzag motion from figs 39 and 43 the yaw moment continuously increases or decreases after the rudder deflection angle is changed from 10 to 10 or from 10 to 10 here the skeg effect due to a fixed rudder is clearly shown however it is somewhat hard to perceive the effect since the duration of the skeg effect acting on the hull is relatively short figs 44 and 45 show time histories of the longitudinal and transversal speed of the ship for 10 10 zigzag tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure the speed drop is closely connected to the number of rudders and its normal pressure to rotate the ship toward the opposite direction for the zigzag behavior a yaw moment due to rudders has to be generated to overcome the moment due to the hull since a ship is regarded as a wing in the plane the speed and drift angle are connected to the yaw moment due to the hull in the case of a normal operating condition and a single propeller failure a speed drop occurs quickly due to normal pressure from the two rudders however the speed drop goes slowly under other failure conditions which is the reason why the overshoot angles are significantly enlarged under a single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure with a small speed drop 4 7 10 10 zigzag tests with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle under single rudder failure to investigate the effect of a failed rudder 10 10 zigzag tests are further simulated by assuming a fixed rudder at a certain angle here it is assumed that the locked rudder is fixed from 2 5 to 2 5 at 2 5 intervals you and choi you and kim 2017 reported that a twin screw ship cannot execute the 35 turning test and zigzag test if a fixed rudder angle exceeds a certain angle and they call the limitation as the acceptable angles of the uncontrollable rudder the fixed angles of 2 5 0 and 2 5 are determined to be smaller than the limitation figs 46 and 47 show the time histories of the heading angle of the lngc for a 10 10 zigzag tests to the port side and starboard side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle respectively a solid black line with filled black squares solid black line with empty squares and solid black line indicate the rudder deflection angle fixed at 0 rudder deflection angle installed on the starboard side and heading angle of the ship the dotted blue line with solid blue circles dotted blue line with empty circles and dotted blue line indicate the rudder deflection angle fixed at 2 5 rudder deflection angle installed on the starboard side and heading angle of the ship the broken red line with solid red diamonds broken red line with empty diamonds and broken red line indicate the rudder deflection angle fixed at 2 5 rudder deflection angle installed on the starboard side and heading angle of the ship from here the definition for each line is always identical if zigzag tests with a fixed rudder at the certain angles under the three conditions are plotted together figs 48 50 show the time histories of yaw moments due to rudders and turn rate for 10 10 zigzag test to the port side and the starboard side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at 0 2 5 and 2 5 respectively as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 10 10 zigzag test to the port side decrease as shown in fig 46 here the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side increase on the other hand as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 10 10 zigzag test to the starboard side increase as shown in fig 47 here the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side decrease the tendency is mainly affected by the fixed rudder angle if the moment generated by fixed rudder can help the ship to turn quickly the overshoot angle becomes smaller reversely if the moment generated by the fixed rudder can keep the ship from turning quickly the overshoot angle becomes larger since the zigzag test is executed for the ship to approach the port side and starboard side in turn the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle have to be opposite and the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle is also different according to the initial approaching direction the fixed rudder has a role like a skeg that helps or interrupts the zigzag motion according to the fixed angle 4 8 20 20 zigzag tests under machinery failure figs 51 and 52 show the time history of the heading angle for the 20 20 zigzag tests to the port side and the starboard side respectively table 15 shows the relative ratio between the predicted 1st and 2nd overshoot angles for the 20 20 zigzag tests to the port side and the starboard side as well the tendency of the relative ratios of the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles for the 20 20 zigzag tests is similar to that for the 10 10 zigzag tests basically the dynamic response during the 20 20 zigzag test is similar to that during the 10 10 zigzag test however the deviations of the relative ratios for the 20 20 zigzag tests shown in table 15 are always smaller than those for the 10 10 zigzag tests as shown in table 14 the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure become larger than under normal operating conditions as shown in figs 51 and 52 and table 15 the overshoot angles under a single propeller failure are smaller than those under normal operating conditions on the other hand the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles predicted under a single propeller failure decrease when compared to those under normal operating conditions in both approaching directions as well the relative magnitude between the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles is dependent on the direction of approach under the aligned combination failure and cross combination failure namely if the ship starts a zigzag motion toward the port side first the relative ratio for the 1st overshoot angle is larger than that for the 2nd overshoot angle on the other hand if the ship starts a zigzag motion to starboard side first the relative ratio for the 2nd overshoot angle is larger than that for the 1st overshoot angle since a locked propeller and rudder are the same in a twin screw ship at the same time the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles have to be predicted with different aspects the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure and the normal operating condition are similar as shown in figs 51 and 52 and table 15 only the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure is slightly smaller than those under normal operating conditions although the 2nd overshoot angle to the starboard side is slightly larger than that under normal operating condition two activating rudders help to secure yaw checking ability of the ship since there is no skeg effect due to a fixed rudder in the case of single propeller failure approaching speed is lower than that under normal operating condition the approaching speed affects the necessary loads to reverse its heading by controlling rudders since smaller yaw moment is needed under single propeller failure the overshoot angle becomes smaller from figs 53 57 that show the time histories of yaw moments due to rudders and the turn rate for 20 20 zigzag tests there is an insignificant difference in the tendency the relative magnitude of the yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate is also similar likewise from figs 58 and 59 that show the time histories of the longitudinal and transversal speed of the ship for a 20 20 zigzag tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure distinct differences cannot be found the relative magnitude of speed drop and drift angle are also similar the reason for which the relative ratio for the 20 20 zigzag tests is significantly reduced has to be related to the intrinsic maneuverability of the ship the significant reduction of the relative ratios of 20 20 zigzag tests by comparison with those of 10 10 zigzag tests is connected with direction stability discussed in fig 4 there is directional unstablility for the lngc the directional unstability is observed when using small deflection angle there the effect of the directional unstablity is distinctly shown for 10 10 zigzag tests in figs 58 and 59 the speed drop is closely connected to the number of rudders and its normal pressure as well as mentioned in the case of a normal operating condition and a single propeller failure a speed drop occurs quickly due to normal pressure from the two rudders however the speed drop goes slowly under other failure conditions which is the reason why the overshoot angles are significantly enlarged under a single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure with a small speed drop 4 9 20 20 zigzag tests with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle under single rudder failure like 10 10 zigzag tests 20 20 zigzag tests are further simulated by assuming a fixed rudder at a certain angle to investigate the effect of a failed rudder it is assumed that the locked rudder is fixed from 5 to 5 at 5 intervals in the acceptable angles of the uncontrollable rudder presented by you and choi you and kim 2017 they are variated according to the maximum angle of the other rudder which is normally activated accordingly the fixed angles of 5 0 and 5 are determined to be smaller than the limitation figs 60 and 61 show the time histories of the heading angle of the lngc for the 20 20 zigzag tests to the port side and starboard side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle respectively figs 62 64 show the time histories of yaw moments due to rudders and turn rate for 20 20 zigzag test to the port side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at 0 5 and 5 respectively the tendency of 1st and 2nd overshoot angle is basically identical with that obtained from 10 10 zigzag test as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 20 20 zigzag test to the port side decrease as shown in fig 60 and the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side increase as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 20 20 zigzag test to the starboard side increase as shown in fig 61 and the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side decrease the tendency is mainly affected by the fixed rudder angle if the moment generated by fixed rudder can help the ship to turn quickly the overshoot angle becomes smaller on the other hand if the moment generated by the fixed rudder can keep the ship from turning quickly the overshoot angle becomes larger since the zigzag test is executed for the ship to approach the port side and starboard side in turn the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle have to be opposite and the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle is also different according to the initial approaching direction the fixed rudder has a role like a skeg that helps or interrupts the zigzag motion according to the fixed angle 5 conclusion in this paper we use a simplified maneuvering mathematical model to predict the maneuverability of the ship under machinery failure and propose a procedure to conduct imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure after a mathematical model is used in a simulation under normal operating conditions assumptions are applied on an existing mathematical model to consider the machinery failure by following the suggested procedure the mathematical model is also verified under machinery failure from sea trials finally numerical simulations for mandatory tests are conducted for defined failures and the physical characteristics of each failure are investigated by comparison with those under normal operating conditions in addition the maneuvering behavior under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering is additionally investigated to understand the asymmetric behaviors of the ship under machinery failure due to wind loads and two kinds of sensitivity studies are additionally conducted to check the reliability of the mathematical model there are three conclusions as follows first the turning ability is mainly affected by the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders since the moment affects the turn rate and drift angle of the ship during the turning motion in particular the number of activated rudders is very important when a rudder is locked according to the failure an uncontrollable rudder prevents the ship from turning like a skeg if the number of activated rudders is identical the initial approach speed affects the magnitude of the turning indices and unbalanced thrust and drag affects the asymmetric turning performance second the asymmetric characteristics due to the wind load are observed related to the turning ability representative wind comes from the starboard side of the bow quartering and the turning trajectories shift as shown in conventional research and an asymmetric shape can be observed the results of the asymmetry from the sailing speed and drift angle affected by the wind load acts on the hull although there is an unusual enlargement of the turning trajectory to the starboard side this results in a speed that is relatively larger than the port side turning just the uncertainty due to a large drift angle has to be further studied third the yaw checking ability under machinery failure is mainly affected by an approaching speed since the approaching speed determines the yaw moment due to hull like a wing if the speed drop is small and slowly observed a higher yaw moment due to the rudders is needed to turn the ship in the opposite direction the number of activated rudders is important since the drag due to the rudder affects the speed of approach during the zigzag motion when a higher speed drop is observed a smaller overshoot angle is acquired and the relative magnitude of the overshoot angles during 10 10 zigzag tests is larger than that during 20 20 zigzag test this is closely connected with the directional unstability predicted from the spiral test as a small deflection angle is ordered

23500,ship owners and classification societies have recently begun to require assessments of the maneuverability of twin screw ships under machinery failure since such an assessment has not yet been previously conducted its concept and process have not been clearly established in this paper we construct a simulation that predicts the maneuverability of a ship under machinery failure and propose a process to conduct imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure and this is referred to as single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure a mathematical model for the simulation under normal operating condition is verified and assumptions are applied to the existing mathematical model to introduce machinery failure the suggested procedure is followed to verify a mathematical model with these assumptions under machinery failure by conducting sea trials finally numerical simulations for mandatory tests are conducted for the defined failures and the physical characteristics of each failure are investigated compared to those under normal operating conditions keywords maneuverability machinery failure single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure cross combination failure 1 introduction twin screw ships have recently become known for their superior maneuverability over single screw ships tankers operating at a low speed gilmore et al 2012 the twin screw lngcs are more efficient than single screw lngc in particular for large lngcs approximately 170 000 cubic meters and up devanney 2008 consequently the ship design favors twin screw since twin screw ships are safer with higher fuel efficiency in specific cases they are preferred by ship owners twin screw ships are now being built for use as ulcss and lngcs the hull propeller and rudder design for twin screw ships is conventionally carried out following similar steps used for single screw ships from a maneuvering point of view mandatory tests evaluate the ship maneuverability based on the recommendations proposed by the imo imo msc 137 76 2002 imo msc circ 1053 2002 and these tests include an initial turning test a 35 turning test a 10 10 zigzag test and a 20 20 zigzag test at the design speed the estimated or measured maneuvering test values have to meet imo maneuvering standards kim et al 2006 2009 evaluated the maneuverability of a single and twin screw container ship using captive model tests they noted that a conventional approach to evaluate the maneuverability is the same for single screw and twin screw ships and this approach does not consider the unique twin screw maneuvering characteristics resulting from the hull propeller and rudder design one of the distinctive characteristics of a twin screw ship is its robustness related to equipment failure the equipment failure is the second largest cause of marine transportation accidents about 16 u s department of transporation 1999 since propulsion failure occurs when a vessel loses its ability to maneuver it could create major marine casualties particularly if it occurs in the middle of heavy traffic near obstructions such as icebergs or near the shore devanney 2008 observed that machinery failures show up as groundings or fires as consequences of the primary cause fowler and sorgard fowler and sogard 2000 insisted that most groundings occur due to wind waves and currents after mechanical failure happens as well regarding the equipment failure and ship design devanney 2008 insisted that the best way to obtain a low speed maneuverability and secure the operational safety is to use a twin screw with engine room redundancy to cope with such recognition by researchers classification societies have developed notation to assess the redundancy in machinery failure ship owners building new ships and classification societies that certify ships performance now require a redundancy assessment including fmea and twin screw maneuvering performance estimation under machinery failure classification societies such as lr abs and dnv have established notation related to the maneuvering performance under machinery failure lr 2016 abs 2016 dnv 2011 the psmr notation to evaluate the maneuverability of twin screw ships was developed by lr lr 2016 the r2 and r2 s notation were proposed by abs abs 2016 and rp notation has been suggested by dnv dnv 2011 however any action plan to request the classification has not been prepared from a shipbuilding company s perspective nevertheless it is necessary to review existing causes of malfunctions to prepare a strategy for machinery failure typical causes of equipment failure include malfunctioning deck machinery and steering and faculty propulsion electrical and fuel systems u s department of transporation 1999 mohovic et al 2013 tried to find the most dangerous scenario considering the failure of a ship s propulsive and steering system previous research provides clues regarding the failure modes that are fatal to a ship s maneuverability even if such research is conducted regardless of the number of screws for twin screw ships machinery failure has been treated as a research topic levine et al 2005 evaluated the operability of a polar endeavor class tanker with a twin screw by plotting the operability curve according to the failure mode you and kim 2017 proposed an approach to evaluate the maneuvering performance of a twin screw container ship under a single rudder failure and kim 2008 introduced the maneuverability of 216 k lngc with two types of single propeller failure from sea trials he conducted imo maneuvering tests under normal operating conditions single propeller failure in the windmill condition and single propeller failure with a fixed condition respectively you and choi 2017 suggested an approach to predict the maneuvering characteristics of a twin screw lngc under a single propeller failure they simulated the maneuverability of the 174 k lngc and compared the results to those of 216 k introduced by kim kim 2008 you and choi 2017 the major difference between lenvine et al levine et al 2005 and that of the engineers mentioned in south korea is the aim that they evaluate the maneuvering performance of machinery failure levine et al 2005 tried to assess the maneuvering performance affected by machinery failure during actual operation for this purpose they applied the concept of a time delay for a seafarer to recognize the machinery failure on board on the other hand you and kim 2017 kim 2008 you and choi 2017 evaluated the maneuvering performance from the point of view of the ship design they assessed the maneuverability under machinery failure from an equilibrium condition to obtain the representative values by conducting imo maneuvering tests from a shipbuilding company s perspective it is necessary to prepare a strategy to cope with a request from ship owners and classification societies in this paper we construct a simulation method to predict the maneuverability of the ship under machinery failure and propose a procedure to conduct imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure various simulations are conducted to investigate unique maneuvering characteristics of a twin screw ship under machinery failure first of all a twin screw lngc which was constructed at dsme was chosen to study the maneuverability under machinery failure before investigating the effect of the machinery failure on the maneuverability a mathematical model was used in a simulation under normal operating conditions compared to free running model tests since a verification was conducted in prior research some results have been included here you and choi 2017 second to assess the maneuverability under machinery failure assumptions were applied on an existing mathematical model that was used to simulate the maneuvering behavior of a ship under normal operating conditions although assumptions of a single propeller failure and a single rudder failure were proposed in prior research you and kim 2017 you and choi 2017 this has not been verified yet third after a proper procedure to evaluate the maneuverability under machinery failure was suggested a simulation following the proposed approach was verified by comparing it with the results of a sea trial we define the types of possible machinery failure to investigate the effect of each failure mode on the maneuverability these include a single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure a procedure was proposed to conduct the imo maneuvering tests under machinery failures and a sea trial was conducted for one of the defined failure types only fourth numerical simulations for each failure were conducted using the verified mathematical model with the corresponding assumptions numerical simulations for mandatory tests were conducted for defined failures and the physical characteristics of each failure were investigated through a comparison with those under normal operating conditions in addition the maneuvering behavior under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering was investigated to understand the asymmetric behavior of the ship under machinery failure due to the wind load and two kinds of sensitivity studies were additionally conducted to check the reliability of the mathematical model the first one was performed to check the effects of 10 enlarged hydrodynamic coefficients on the tactical diameter the second one was conducted to compare the effects of enlarged speed and rudder area from 10 to 10 at 5 intervals on the tactical diameter finally the maneuvering characteristics of the twin screw lngc under machinery failure can be physically understood 2 the mathematical model 2 1 the coordinate system as mentioned above the maneuvering characteristics under machinery failure were studied for a twin screw lngc table 1 shows the principal particulars of the lngc fig 1 shows the coordinate system of this research 2 2 maneuvering equations of motion in this study the maneuvering equations of motion are shown in equation 1 the forces and moment acting on the ship can be expressed as in equation 2 the subscripts h p r and w indicate the hydrodynamic loads due to the hull propellers rudders and wind respectively the mathematical model under normal operating conditions is constructed as follows 1 m u v r x m v u r y i z z r n 2 x x h x p x r x w y y h y r y w n n h n p n r n w the hydrodynamic loads of the hull are calculated as shown in equation 3 and many hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass added mass moment of inertia and rudder lift coefficients were predicted using empirical formulae proposed by kijima et al 1990 and fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 the definitions of each hydrodynamic derivative and nondimensionalization were identical to previous research proposed by kijima et al 1990 the coefficients for the resistance and thrust were obtained from the model tests twin propeller thrust loads are calculated as shown in equation 4 here k t is assumed to depend on the advance ratio which is marked as j p p o r t and j p s t b d twin rudder loads were calculated as shown in equation 5 c l α is calculated using the aspect ratio of each rudder fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 empirical formulae are used since a full spade rudder has a shape similar to the rudder studied in the empirical formulae of course the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from the empirical formulae for a single screw vessel can be regarded as doubtful values to acquire reliable prediction of maneuvering performance even if a mathematical model for a twin screw vessel is not secured it is simply tried to estimate based on the empirical formulae and the conventional experiments like resistance self propulsion and free running model test to minimize the potential risk of the mathematical model about the accuracy maneuvering performance under normal operating condition is compared with that of the free running model test results and maneuvering characteristics under aligned combination failure are compared with those of sea trials in the future it will be necessary to make the accuracy of this research higher by applying the mathematical model for the twin screw vessel especially khanfir et al 2011 and dubbioso et al 2015 adopted more complicated mathematical model including a lot of hydrodynamic coefficients like flow straightening coefficient of yaw rate and rudder propeller interaction coefficients to replicate the maneuvering behavior of a twin screw ship a ship is generally operated according to the ordered engine power if a propeller is overloaded due to environmental load or ship speed rpm is immediately reduced since the overloading on a propeller is an important issue of the maneuvering performance under machinery failure as well representatively coraddu et al 2013 and muscari et al 2017 anticipated that propeller and rudder were significantly affected by the asymmetric behavior of a twin screw vessel they investigated the characteristics of the propeller overloading based on the free running model tests and cfd calculations respectively however this research does not take into account the overloading of a propeller in the maneuvering performance under machinery failure namely the constant rpm is assumed by ignoring the overloading of a propeller the way how to deal with the overloading is being searched from a perspective of a shipbuilding company it will be further developed in near future 3 x h m x u m y x v r v r 1 2 ρ l p p t u 2 x u u cos 2 β y h m y v m x u r y h v r n h j z z r n h v r x g y h v r w

lngc under normal operating conditions by comparing the results of a simulation to those obtained from tests using a free running model test three mandatory tests were compared a 35 turning test a 10 10 zigzag test and a 20 20 zigzag test at design speed here only the trajectories for the 35 turning tests and time histories of the heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle for the 10 10 zigzag test were excerpted fig 2 shows the trajectories for the 35 turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions the solid blue lines and black filled squares indicate the trajectories obtained from the simulations and the free running model tests respectively fig 3 shows the time histories of the heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle for the 10 10 zigzag tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions the solid blue line the dotted blue line and broken blue line respectively indicate the time histories of heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle obtained from the simulations the solid black squares empty black circles and empty black diamonds respectively indicate the time histories of the heading angle turn rate and rudder deflection angle obtained from the free running model tests as shown in figs 2 and 3 there are insignificant differences between the results of the simulation and the free running model test results therefore the mathematical model is able to simulate the twin screw maneuvering behavior of the lngc under normal operating conditions inherent maneuvering indices predicted from simulations summarized with those regulated by the imo as shown in table 2 imo msc 137 76 2002 you and choi 2017 from the inherent maneuverability an assessment of the maneuverability under machinery failure will be approached as shown in table 2 all simulated results meet the imo maneuvering criteria with a wide margin from the maneuvering point of view the design of the lngc is regarded as an extraordinary one in particular a turning ability with a good performance was observed in addition it is necessary to conduct spiral tests to understand the unusual yaw checking ability under machinery failure in general a spiral test was performed to assess the directional stability of a ship imo msc circ 1053 2002 since the directional stability is closely connected to the yaw checking ability it is helpful for us to understand the maneuvering behavior of the ship the simulated spiral tests are shown in fig 4 and each simulation is conducted with a 1 degree interval of the rudder deflection angle the solid black circles indicate a converged turn rate according to each rudder deflection angle if the ship returns to the zero turn rate the ship is stable imo msc circ 1053 2002 however a slight unstable loop is observed for the lngc if there is an unstable loop the allowable loop width is defined as in equation 6 imo msc circ 1053 2002 since the l p p is 283 5 m and the design speed is 18 2 knots l v is of about 30 28 following the second condition in equation 6 the allowable loop width is 7 09 since the observed loop width is 5 the ship meets explanatory notes as well imo msc circ 1053 2002 of course if there is a directional unstability it is possible to satisfy the imo criteria as shown in the twin screw lngc here however the directional unstability can sometimes affect the zigzag maneuver significantly the unstability will be discussed when the zigzag test under machinery failure is investigated 6 0 degree for l v 9 seconds 3 1 3 l v for 9 l v 45 seconds 12 degrees for 45 l v seconds 2 4 assumptions to consider the machinery failure you and kim 2017 and you and choi 2017 proposed an approach to predict the maneuvering behavior under a single rudder failure and single propeller failure respectively from the anticipated physical phenomenon some values in the mathematical model under normal operating conditions are changed according to the machinery failure first if a propeller is stopped locked the rpm are assumed to be zero of course there are two kinds of states of an uncontrollable propeller windmill and locked kim 2008 from sea trials from 216 k lngc there is a little difference between the windmill and locked propeller under a single propeller failure kim 2008 since the difference can be ignored the locking propeller is assumed here for example if the propeller on the port side is locked n p o r t is set to zero in equation 4 in the case of propeller failure the effect of a locked propeller on a rudder has to be additionally considered since the flow behind the locked propeller is not accelerated the inflow speed at the rudder behind the propeller is assumed to be identical to the ship s speed but in the opposite direction you and choi 2017 for example if the propeller on the port side is locked u r p o r t is assumed to be u second if a rudder cannot be operated the rudder is assumed to be fixed at a certain angle you and kim 2017 and the steering gear can be manually controlled from any fixed angle to 0 if there is any problem in the steering system consequently the locked rudder is always fixed at a neutral angle which is 0 for example if the rudder on the port side is locked the δ p o r t is assumed to be 0 during the simulations the interaction coefficients are used in simulations under machinery failure which is not different from those used in simulations under normal operating conditions although levine levine et al 2005 and you and kim 2017 considered a fixed rudder at a certain angle which is not a neutral angle this kind of extreme condition is excluded during the mandatory simulation in addition the effect of a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle on zigzag tests is investigated to understand the physical characteristics under single rudder failure 3 test procedure suggestion and verification 3 1 suggested test procedure imo maneuvering tests were used to evaluate the ship maneuverability accordingly it is convenient to compare the maneuverability of twin screw lngc under machinery failure previous research conducted by you and choi 2017 recognized that two additional steps were needed before conducting imo maneuvering tests to consider unique machinery failure characteristics and this procedure is shown in fig 5 kim 2008 conducted sea trials of imo maneuvering tests under an equilibrium condition by using an autopilot device as well first the types of machinery failure have yet to be defined since the propeller and rudder failure are only considered here the types can be defined by combining the failure of each device table 3 shows the types of machinery failure that have to be studied there are five conditions including normal operating condition and four types of machinery failure normal refers to the conditions where both the propellers and the rudders operate normally single propeller failure indicates that one propeller is stopped while the other propeller and both rudders operate normally single rudder failure means a rudder on one side is locked while the other rudder and both propellers operate normally the aligned combination failure refers to conditions where both the propeller and rudder on one side are locked while the propeller and rudder on the other side operate normally the cross combination failure means the propeller on one side and the rudder on the opposite side are locked while the other propeller and rudder operate normally and the propellers are installed to rotate in the opposing directions in table 3 only the portside location of the locked device is used except cross combination failure of course more combinations can be created by taking into account the direction of the locked propeller and rudder however since the difference due to installed direction is not significant it is ignored therefore the maneuvering characteristics of the lngc under machinery failure are only investigated through these four failure conditions second the initial conditions including the speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle according to each failure mode were to be found to carry out the imo maneuvering tests a ship has to be going straight at a constant speed however a twin screw ship with machinery failure cannot move straight ahead without controlling rudders for example if a propeller is stopped the reduced thrust causes the ship to slow in addition the unbalanced thrust makes the ship rotate therefore it is essential to control the rudders to prevent the ship from rotating likewise the unbalanced drag due to a failed rudder also affects the predicted maneuvering motion and these are the reasons why the prescribed initial conditions have to be found to find the initial conditions where the lngc goes straight at a constant speed straight maneuvers are simulated with machinery failure the fuzzy control proposed by hasegawa and kouzuki hasegawa and kouzuki 1987 you and rhee 2016 you et al 2018 ahn et al 2012 is applied to determine the rudder angle and in the simulation lngc starts with a design speed of 18 20 knots the operating devices are different according to the types of failure for example if there is an aligned combination failure a propeller on the port side is stopped and a rudder on the port is fixed at 0 since the reduced thrust and drag affects the maneuvers of the lngc the other rudder on the starboard side will be controlled as time passes the ship shows straight path with a converged speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle these values are regarded as the initial conditions for the imo maneuvering tests under an aligned combination failure identical straight maneuvers are then simulated repeatedly under other types of machinery failure third the imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure are simulated from the predicted initial conditions by following the procedure imo msc 137 76 2002 imo msc circ 1053 2002 here it is only possible to control propellers and rudders that normally operate by following the imo maneuvering test procedure in the case of a locked propeller the propeller is assumed to have stopped and its rpm is zero you and choi 2017 in the case of a fixed rudder the deflection angle of the uncontrollable rudder is assumed to be a neutral angle you and kim 2017 3 2 verification under machinery failure from sea trials the results calculated using the proposed method can be verified by comparing them to data obtained from sea trials which is necessary to verify the simulation and procedure for the imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure table 4 shows the sea trial conditions these were conducted under an aligned combination failure only the 35 turning test to the port side and the 10 10 zigzag test to the port side were only conducted at speeds lower than the design speed for safety reasons although verification was limited to the aligned combination failure verification is to be extended because the locked propeller and rudder are considered together since the tests under the machinery failure are not conventional tests this is challenging for a ship building company even if the rpm is constant between the two sea trials the speeds are slightly different due to environmental load in this study the loads are not considered in the simulations and the initial speeds were of about 9 0 knots with wind speeds less than approximately 10 0 knots and the ship encounters head winds at sea fig 6 shows the trajectories for 35 turning tests of the lngc under the aligned combination failure from the sea trials and the simulated tests the black squares and solid blue lines indicate the sea trial results and simulation results respectively for security reasons exact values identifying the maneuverability are removed from the figure the trajectory obtained from sea trials is approximately 10 larger than that predicted from simulations even if the turning circle is similarly shaped fig 7 shows the heading angle and rudder deflection angle of the lngc under the aligned combination failure from sea trials and simulated tests the black squares and solid blue lines indicate the time histories of the heading angle for the results of the sea trials and simulation respectively for security reasons exact values identifying the maneuverability are removed from the figure as well the empty black circles and broken line with diamonds indicate a rudder deflection angle equipped on the port and starboard side from the sea trials and the dotted blue line and broken blue line indicate the rudder deflection angle equipped on the port and starboard side from the simulated trials the time history of the heading angle and rudder deflection angle obtained from the sea trials matches well with those from the simulation 4 investigation of the maneuvering characteristics under machinery failure imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure are simulated based on the verified procedure the results of the simulation are then investigated to find unique maneuvering characteristics of a twin screw lngc under machinery failure there are six types of simulations here first straight maneuvers are simulated to find the equilibrium conditions according to the machinery failure from the acquired steady state information the following five simulations are conducted in order second and third the initial turning tests and 35 turning tests are simulated to evaluate the turning ability under machinery failure fourth 35 turning tests are simulated under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering to observe the asymmetry under machinery failure due to the wind loads fifth the sensitivity study is conducted since it is necessary to check the reliability of the mathematical model under normal operating condition and four failure conditions sixth and seventh 10 10 zigzag tests were simulated to assess the yaw checking ability of the lngc according to the machinery failure 10 10 zigzag tests are additionally simulated by investigating the effect of a fixed rudder at a certain angle on the yaw checking ability eighth and ninth 20 20 zigzag tests were simulated to assess the yaw checking ability of the lngc according to the machinery failure likewise 20 20 zigzag tests are further simulated by investigating the effect of a fixed rudder at a certain angle on the yaw checking ability as well 4 1 finding equilibrium conditions for the initial approach figs 8 10 show the time histories of the speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle during straight maneuvers respectively the solid black line dotted blue line broken red line dotted green line and two point dotted orange line refer to the results under normal operating conditions single propeller failure single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure respectively from here the definition for each line is always identical if any results under the five conditions are plotted together in fig 8 two groups are observed according to the converged speed the normal and single rudder failure belongs to the first group in which there is no speed drop in the case of the single rudder failure both propellers normally operate and a locked rudder is fixed at 0 therefore the ship can go straight with the design speed since the unbalanced thrust and drag are not generated in the initial approach the other failure conditions belong to the second group in which there is a speed drop and the converged speeds under a single propeller failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure are almost the same the reduced thrust due to a locked propeller is a major cause of speed drop and in these cases the rudders have to be controlled to cancel out the unbalance in the thrust due to the propellers and drag due to the rudders when the ship goes straight three features are observed in fig 9 and the characteristics are reviewed to infer the reasons based on physical knowledge the converged heading angles shown in fig 10 are similar to those in fig 9 and these can be intuitively understood based on the explanations in fig 9 as well first a peak of the time histories of the rudder deflection angle are commonly observed before they converge at a certain angle since the control technique determines the command rudder angle the peak is also observed to steer the course of a ship by applying fuzzy control as well ahn et al 2012 fuzzy control is a kind of pd control and the control gains continuously change by combining the difference between the command heading angle and the current heading angle and turn rate as a result an insignificant overshoot related to the change in course is obtained and this is a unique feature of the applied control technique hasegawa and kouzuki 1987 you and rhee 2016 you et al 2018 ahn et al 2012 second the converged rudder deflection angle under a cross combination failure is slightly larger than that under an aligned combination failure this is caused by the unbalanced thrust of an active propeller and drag due to the controllable rudder in both failures the negative moment due to the activated propeller on the starboard side is generated and the direction of the moment due to a controllable rudder is different in the aligned combination failure a positive moment due to the controllable rudder on the starboard side is generated and a negative moment due to the rudder on the port side is generated under a cross combination failure consequently the aggregated yaw moment due to unbalanced thrust and drag is reduced or increased by their direction third the converged rudder deflection angle under a single propeller failure is about half that under the aligned combination failure and cross combination failure the reason for such is that the number of controllable rudders is two under a single propeller failure even though the rudder is only active under two combination failures table 5 shows the converged values of the speed rudder deflection angle and heading angle during straight maneuvers since the actual difference between the deflected heading angles and the rudder deflection angle is not significant the principal effect of each machinery failure on the initial conditions is regarded as a reduced speed from the acquired initial conditions the effect of each locked propeller and rudder on maneuvering behavior will be added according to the simulated tests 4 2 initial turning tests under machinery failure fig 11 shows the predicted trajectories for the initial turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions and machinery failure table 6 shows the relative ratio between the predicted initial track reach of the lngc for initial turning tests under machinery failure and that under the normal operating conditions after some observations in the figure and table a brief inference is described to review the described physical characteristics for the initial turning tests in further detail a discussion will be carried out using other physical values first the initial track reaches to the starboard side is commonly larger than that to the port side under three failure conditions except a single rudder failure shown in fig 11 and table 6 briefly the tendency results from an unbalanced yaw moment due to thrust from a locked propeller on the port side namely the thrust generated from a propeller on the starboard side helps the ship turn to the port side second the initial track reaches to the port and starboard sides under a single propeller failure which is smaller than those under normal operating conditions as shown in fig 11 and table 6 the yaw moment due to the rudders under a single propeller failure is slightly smaller than that under normal operating conditions because the inflow speed at the rudder is not accelerated however the lower initial speed under normal operating conditions causes a short travel distance during each time step and this may cause a reduced initial track reach under a single propeller failure in general the turning ability including initial turning is directly affected by the turn rate kim et al 2013 and to investigate the observed characteristics based on the physical knowledge the time histories of the yaw moment due to rudders and the turn rate are plotted according to the simulated conditions from figs 12 16 in these figures a solid black line with filled black squares and solid black line with empty squares indicate the moment due to the port side rudder and starboard side rudder during the port side turning motion and the solid black line indicates the aggregate moment due to both rudders during the port side turning motion as well otherwise the dotted blue line with filled blue circles and dotted blue line with empty circles indicate the moment due to the port side rudder and starboard side rudder during the starboard side turning motion and the solid blue chain line indicates the aggregate moment due to both rudders during the starboard side turning motion as well the solid black line with filled black diamonds and empty blue diamonds indicate the turn rate of the ship during the initial turning to the port and starboard side respectively from here the definition is always identical if the yaw moment due to rudders and the turn rate according to each condition are plotted together first of all the common features in these figures are explained from figs 12 16 a similar tendency is observed for the yaw moment due to the rudders and the turn rate the yaw moment rapidly increases from zero to about 5 s and it matches the duration to control the rudder in order to execute the initial turning test this test is conducted by changing the rudder deflection angle from a neutral angle to 10 until the heading angle arrives at 10 since the turn rate of a rudder is generally 2 32 d e g s the maximum yaw moment is calculated to be about 5 s once the ship turns according to the generated yaw moment due to the rudders the angle of attack on each rudder decreases and the yaw moment due to the rudders decreases as well the turn rate continuously increases due to the aggregated yaw moment by the rudders and it is natural for the turn rate to be directly affected by the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders as shown in equations 1 and 2 in fig 12 the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders and the turn rate is symmetric in the port and starboard side however other cases show an asymmetric tendency with an insignificant difference since the inflow behind the locked propeller does not accelerate each yaw moment due to each rudder is not identical under a single propeller failure as shown in fig 13 there is a rudder fixed at a neural angle under the single rudder failure aligned with the combination failure and a cross combination failure the aggregate rudder moment under the three conditions become smaller than under normal operating conditions and a single propeller condition basically this is a result of the decrease in the number of activated rudders however the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders decreases more than 50 and the reason is that the fixed rudder prevents the ship from turning in the intended direction like a skeg as shown in figs 14 16 the aggregated yaw moment to the port side is slightly larger than that to the starboard side and the turn rate to the port side is also larger than that to the starboard side even if the difference between the calculated turn rates is insignificant since a larger turn rate of the ship indicates that the ship turns quickly the heading of the ship reaches 10 earlier accordingly the observation that the unbalanced thrust generated from the propeller on the starboard side helps the ship turn to the port side can be understood the asymmetry for the final time of each calculation is observed under a single propeller failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure clearly this feature indicates that the magnitude of the yaw moment due to unbalanced thrust is dominant compared to that due to the unbalanced drag of the rudders it is natural that the thrust of a propeller is much larger than the drag obtained from the normal pressure of a rudder within the design speed range a more convincing explanation is given by investigating the time history of the longitudinal transversal speed and drift angle of the ship for the initial turning tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure as shown in figs 17 and 18 the solid black line with filled black squares solid black line with empty squares and solid black line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under normal operating conditions the dotted blue line with solid blue circles dotted blue line with empty circles and dotted blue line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under a single propeller failure the broken red line with solid red diamonds broken red line with empty diamonds and broken red line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under a single rudder failure the dotted green line with solid green right triangles dotted green line with empty right triangles and dotted green line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under the aligned combination failure the two point dotted orange line with solid orange left triangles two point dotted orange line with empty left triangles and dotted orange line indicate the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under a cross combination failure from here the definitions of each line are always identical if the longitudinal speed transversal speed and drift angle under five conditions are plotted together the large drift angle during the initial turning indicates that the ship can obtain a small turning trajectory with a good turning ability kim et al 2013 the higher yaw moment is generated due to the rudders as shown in figs 12 16 the higher the drift angle as shown in figs 17 and 18 this matches well with the magnitude of the initial track reach except for the single propeller failure the initial track reach under a single propeller failure is shorter than that under normal operating conditions since the approaching speed is always lower than that under normal operating conditions 4 3 35 turning tests under machinery failures fig 19 shows the predicted trajectories for 35 turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions and machinery failures table 7 shows the relative ratio between the predicted advances transfers and tactical diameters of the lngc for 35 turning tests under machinery failures and those under the normal operating conditions likewise some observations in the figure and in the table are described and other physical values will be discussed to investigate the predicted features in detail first the tendency of the relative ratios of the turning circles are well matched with those of the initial track reach and it is observed that the relative ratios for the advance transfer and tactical diameter to the starboard side are commonly larger than those to the port side under three failure conditions except for a single rudder failure as shown in fig 19 and table 7 this is also affected by the unbalanced thrust as is explained for the initial turning tests for three failure conditions the reason for which the values to the starboard side are smaller than those to the port side under a single rudder failure is that the unbalanced drag makes the yaw moment turn toward the starboard side because there is no unbalanced thrust second the advance under a single propeller failure is smaller than that under normal operating conditions and the reason can be inferred due to reduced initial approaching speed as well third the advance transfer and tactical diameters decrease in the order of the cross combination failure single rudder failure and aligned combination failure in principal the reason why the values under a single rudder failure are larger than those under an aligned combination failure may be the effect of the magnitude of the yaw moment as previously mentioned the turning ability is significantly affected by the yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate kim et al 2013 from this point of view the observed characteristics are reviewed the time histories of the yaw moments due to the rudders and turn rate for the 35 turning test are plotted according to the conditions simulated from figs 20 24 the similarity between the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate is distinctly recognized through a comparison with that for the initial turning tests in figs 12 16 only 35 of turning motion is sufficiently long to observe the various phases related to the turning test lewis 1989 a detailed description of each phase of turning is shown in equation 7 and the turning motion of the ship during the initial turning tests belong to the 1st phase only however each phase can be recognized from the time histories of the turn rate during the 35 turning test 7 1 st phase v 0 r 0 v 0 r 0 2 nd phase v 0 r 0 v 0 r 0 3 rd phase v 0 r 0 v 0 r 0 the common characteristics from figs 20 24 are described below the yaw moment rapidly increases from zero to about 15 s and it matches the duration to control the rudder to execute a 35 turning test once the ship turns according to the generated yaw moment due to the rudders the speed decreases and yaw moment due to the rudders steadily decreases as well in fig 20 the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate is symmetric to the port and starboard side because this case is for normal operating conditions however each yaw moment due to a rudder installed on the port and starboard side is slightly different and this is a result of the yaw moment due to drag when both rudders are synchronized a surge and sway force are completely identical and in the case of the yaw moment due to a rudder it is composed of two components as follows one is generated due to the sway force and the other is affected by the drag surge force as shown in equation 5 since the direction of the installed rudder from the center line is opposite the yaw moment due to the second component makes the yaw moment of each rudder slightly different the yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rates show asymmetric characteristics under machinery failure as shown in figs 21 24 since the inflow behind the locked propeller is not accelerated each yaw moment due to each rudder is not identical together under a single propeller failure as shown in fig 21 the fixed rudder under a single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure have a role like a skeg the aggregated yaw moment to the port side is slightly larger than that to the starboard side under machinery failure except for the single rudder failure as well and the turn rate to the port side is slightly larger than that to the starboard side since a larger turn rate of the ship indicates that the ship turns quickly the heading of the ship reaches 360 earlier the times histories of the longitudinal transversal speed and drift angle of the ship for the initial turning tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failures are shown in figs 25 and 26 the turning trajectories under a single propeller failure clearly shift toward the stern in comparison with those under the normal operating conditions an identical tendency is observed from the sea trial of 216 k lngc kim 2008 since both rudders can operate under a single propeller failure the yaw moment and the turn rate under a single propeller failure have similar values as those under the normal operating conditions however the initial approach speed under a single propeller failure is lower than that under the normal operating conditions which makes a smaller advance if the drift angle during steady turning is similar the tactical diameter is also similar consequently the transfer and tactical diameter is almost the same as those under normal operating conditions the turning circles under the single rudder failure and cross combination failure also shift toward the stern and these are larger than under normal operating conditions in these conditions the speed drop slowly occurs and consequently the speed of the ship is higher than that in other cases where the turn rate is similar and the sailing speed is high the turning circles are thus enlarged and shift toward the stern by comparing the normal turning trajectories of the ship the trajectories are enlarged to the rear direction when the ship turns under single propeller failure single rudder failure and cross combination failure to secure the sailing safety a seafarer has to pay attention to whether there is any obstacle in the wider areas 4 4 35 turning tests under machinery failures under wind from bow quartering levine et al 2005 obtained an asymmetric operability curve under machinery failure affected by wind loads by investigating the effect here the credibility of this simulation can be secured if a similar phenomenon is observed to consider the wind loads acting on the 174 k lngc wind tunnel model test results are used fig 27 shows the nondimensionalized wind load coefficients of the lngc obtained from a wind tunnel model test with 1 200 scale model of the vessel dsme 2008 the wind model test was conducted in the 2 6 m wide boundary layer wind tunnel in december 2007 the tunnel size is 21 0 m x 2 6 m x 1 8 m length x width x height here wind speed corresponds to 12 5 m s and a reynolds number is 9 0 10 5 at the reference height 10 0 m in full scale the model was constructed in wood high density foam and brass it was chosen as a compromise between avoiding scale effects from a model that is too small and avoiding blockage in the wind tunnel caused by a model that is too large wind loads are measured using the 6 component strain gauges at the mid ship location in fig 27 the solid black line dotted blue line and broken red line indicate c x c y and c n respectively for security reasons exact values identifying the maneuverability are removed from the figure the measured wind loads are non dimensionalized by using equation 8 the wind loads are considered by following the common method which is used in prior researches you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 dsme 2008 they are briefly shown in equation 9 8 c x x 1 2 ρ v w 2 a t c y y 1 2 ρ v w 2 a l c n n 1 2 ρ v w 2 a l l o a

r w fig 28 shows the trajectories for 35 turning tests of the lngc under normal operating conditions and machinery failures under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering 23 5 knots wind is about beaufort number 5 or 6 bhattacharyya 1978 it is regarded as not extreme but moderate to investigate the effect of winds in the ocean in a referred paper a ship was operated under about beaufort 6 for a few days you et al 2018 furthermore the effect of 23 5 knots wind on the turning trajectories under normal operating conditions is not significant as shown in fig 28 consequently 23 5 knots wind is considered as the reference wind speed here the constant wind comes from the starboard side and table 8 shows the relative ratio between the predicted advances transfers and tactical diameters of the lngc for 35 turning tests under 23 5 knots of wind under machinery failure and under normal operating conditions under no wind similarly the observations in the figure and in the table are first described and an additional discussion will be conducted further first the drift directions under the wind of each trajectory are exposed according to the center of the wind load acting on the superstructure and incident angle of the wind you 2013 here for the wind coming from the starboard side bow quartering the trajectories shift toward the port side roughly the effect of the wind load on the turning trajectory is usual when compared to similar research considering the wind load you et al 2017a 2017b you 2013 as intended the asymmetry in the turning trajectories is clearly observed in fig 28 and table 8 from tables 7 and 8 an asymmetric effect due to wind loads can be recognized if winds come from a certain angle trajectories of the ship have to be deformed since the effect of wind loads on turning trajectories according to the turning direction is not symmetric the trajectories influenced by winds show asymmetric tendency levine et al 2005 here the deviated relative ratios of the starboard sides turning are larger than those to port side under single propeller failure and aligned combination failure accordingly the asymmetry of turning trajectories becomes larger according to the wind loads under the failures in the case of single rudder failure a deviation is similar with that under normal operating condition these observations indicate that the extent of asymmetric tendency depends on the types of machinery failure as well an unexpected feature is additionally observed from fig 28 and table 8 the advance transfer and tactical diameter to the starboard under a cross combination failure is significantly enlarged toward the starboard side it shows inverse tendency with previous observation since this observation cannot be intuitively understood further discussion is needed time histories of the yaw moments due to rudders and the turn rate for a 35 turning test under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering are plotted according to the simulated conditions from figs 29 33 basically the dynamic responses during a 35 turning test under the wind are similar to those investigated in figs 20 24 accordingly the unusual characteristics in fig 28 are only reviewed here the tendency of the yaw moment and turn rate under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering is clearly different as that under no wind condition as shown in figs 20 24 in common the turn rate becomes steady as time goes on during the 35 turning test under no wind however in the cases of the port side turning the aggregated yaw moment and turn rate initially increased likewise those values decrease however after being maintained at certain values for a while they decrease again in the cases of the starboard side turning the total yaw moment and turn rate initially increased as well of course those values decrease but after they increase for a while they decrease again this asymmetric tendency affects the asymmetric turning trajectories due to the wind load and this effect especially corresponds to the yaw wind load coefficients until the ship turns to 360 the direction of the yaw moment changes four times since two changes are accompanied with a large difference according to the direction of the yaw wind load coefficients the loads can help the ship turns easily or prevent the ship from turning repeatedly figs 34 and 35 show the time history of the longitudinal transversal speed and drift angle of the ship for the 35 turning tests to the port side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering by comparison with the turning speed under no wind the speed drops are significant under wind regardless of the turning direction the speed decreases to less than that under no wind the wind loads act on the hull as additional resistance the reason why the trajectory to the starboard side under a cross combination failure becomes large is that the speed is relative larger than that to the port side as shown in figs 34 and 35 the ship moves a longer distance with a higher speed at a given time step the large drift angle is observed regardless of the turning direction in particular the drift angle to the port side is much larger than that to the starboard side and a large drift angle indicates that the ship drift overcomes the wind loads slowly the mathematical model used here is not applicable for such a large drift angle because there is a significantly larger hydrodynamic load for the sway and yaw moment that are predicted kang and hasegawa 2007 so we have to take care of faulty reasoning due to incorrect calculations although there is a potential error regarding the mathematical model by considering the large drift angle and extremely low speed during turning an extraordinary observation can be dealt with fig 28 shows a limited maneuvering performance of a ship affected environmental load here the wind is only considered under machinery failure as mentioned in figs 2 and 3 and table 2 the ship show the superior maneuverability under normal operating condition and it is able to tell the identical opinion under normal operating condition with 23 5 knots wind as well however it is hard for the ship to execute 35 turning as shown in fig 33 about 2500 s are needed to complete the turning since the yaw moment generated by rudders is not significantly larger than that needed to turn normally because the yaw moment due to rudders is the smallest under cross combination failure that kind of unique characteristics are observed by comparing other conditions in addition the drift angles of the ship during 35 turning test are variated from about 16 to 30 as shown in figs 25 and 26 however the drift angles become larger at 35 turning tests to the port side as shown in fig 34 reversely the drift angles get smaller at 35 turning tests to the starboard side as shown in fig 35 the reason why the drift angles under winds become larger or smaller than those under no wind condition is due to wind loads acting on the hull in the last phase of turning since the winds come from bow quartering 45 the ship has to overcome the wind load at the last phase of turning in the cases of the port side reversely wind loads assist for the ship to turn easily at the last phase of turning in the cases of the starboard side since the effect of environmental loads on the turning ability under machinery failure the feature is worth attempting a follow up study in near future 4 5 sensitivity study about the 35 turning test results affected by the key parameters lee and shin 1998 did sensitivity study to recognize the hydrodynamic coefficients that more strongly affect the predicted 1st and 2nd overshoot at 10 10 zigzag test since it is necessary to check the reliability of the mathematical model the sensitivity study is also planned here two kinds of sensitivity study are conducted as follows first the enlarged tactical diameter to the starboard side is divided by the value which is predicted by using the original hydrodynamic coefficient after hydrodynamic coefficients are 10 enlarged the values used in the comparison are obtained under normal operating condition only fig 36 shows the relative sensitivity affected by variated hydrodynamic coefficients under normal operating condition hydrodynamic coefficients for yaw moment are mainly affecting the tactical diameter especially n v is the most sensitive value and it makes the tactical diameter to be reduced about 3 7 second from the analysis for the time histories of moment and speed we assumed that the main parameters which affect the predicted maneuvering performance are lift forces and moment affected by the sailing speed and rudder area the ship speed and rudder area are variated from 90 to 110 by 5 intervals initial rpm of the ship is also variated to maintain the variated speed the predicted tactical diameter to starboard side is divided by the value of model ship under each condition as shown in fig 19 relative sensitivities affected by the variated speed and rudder area are summarized from table 9 to table 13 as follows from the relative sensitivity study it is confirmed that the mathematical model does not show the intense sensitivity related to the maneuvering performance due to the speed and rudder area under normal operating condition and other failure conditions the value is maximized with 10 enlarged speed and 10 reduced rudder area and the value is minimized with 10 reduced speed and 10 enlarged rudder area under normal operating condition single propeller failure condition single rudder failure condition and aligned combination failure discriminatively the maximum value is observed with 10 reduced speed and 10 reduced rudder area and the minimum value is observed with 10 enlarged speed and 10 enlarged rudder area under cross combination failure the maximum sensitivity is under 7 with 10 variation of speed and rudder area under normal operating condition on the values predicted under normal operating condition relative sensitivities under other failure conditions become slightly smaller this results from the absolute magnitude of tactical diameter with original speed and rudder area as shown in fig 19 the tactical diameter under normal operating condition is the smallest value by comparing values under other failure conditions even if the variated magnitudes are similar the relative sensitivity under normal operating condition is the largest since a similar value is divided by the larger value 4 6 10 10 zigzag tests under machinery failure zigzag tests need to be conducted according to the initial approaching direction table 9 shows the relative ratio between the predicted 1st and 2nd overshoot angles for 10 10 zigzag tests to the port side and the starboard side respectively the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure become significantly larger than under normal operating conditions as shown in figs 37 and 38 and table 14 the overshoot angles under a single propeller failure are smaller than those under normal operating conditions on the other hand the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles predicted under a single propeller failure decrease when compared to those under normal operating conditions in both approaching directions the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure and the normal operating condition are similar as shown in figs 37 and 38 and table 14 furthermore the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure is smaller than those under normal operating conditions basically two activating rudders help to secure yaw checking ability of the ship since there is no skeg effect due to a fixed rudder in the case of single propeller failure approaching speed is lower than that under normal operating condition the approaching speed affects the necessary loads to reverse its heading by controlling rudders since smaller yaw moment is needed under single propeller failure the overshoot angle becomes smaller the relative magnitude between the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles is dependent on the direction of approach under the aligned combination failure and cross combination failure namely if the ship starts a zigzag motion toward the port side first the relative ratio for the 1st overshoot angle is larger than that for the 2nd overshoot angle on the other hand if the ship starts a zigzag motion to starboard side first the relative ratio for the 2nd overshoot angle is larger than that for the 1st overshoot angle since a locked propeller and rudder are the same in a twin screw ship at the same time the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles have to be predicted with different aspects to review the observed characteristics in detail the time histories of the yaw moments due to rudders and the turn rate for 10 10 zigzag tests are plotted according to the simulated conditions from figs 39 43 the notable difference on the plots compared to the plots obtained from turning tests and aggregated yaw moments due to rudders under machinery failure are not distinguished from those under normal operating conditions in general the yaw checking ability is affected by the yaw moment due to the rudders and speed of approach lewis 1989 since the yaw moment due to the rudders is not largely different a significant difference on the overshoot may result from the sailing speed during the zigzag motion from figs 39 and 43 the yaw moment continuously increases or decreases after the rudder deflection angle is changed from 10 to 10 or from 10 to 10 here the skeg effect due to a fixed rudder is clearly shown however it is somewhat hard to perceive the effect since the duration of the skeg effect acting on the hull is relatively short figs 44 and 45 show time histories of the longitudinal and transversal speed of the ship for 10 10 zigzag tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure the speed drop is closely connected to the number of rudders and its normal pressure to rotate the ship toward the opposite direction for the zigzag behavior a yaw moment due to rudders has to be generated to overcome the moment due to the hull since a ship is regarded as a wing in the plane the speed and drift angle are connected to the yaw moment due to the hull in the case of a normal operating condition and a single propeller failure a speed drop occurs quickly due to normal pressure from the two rudders however the speed drop goes slowly under other failure conditions which is the reason why the overshoot angles are significantly enlarged under a single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure with a small speed drop 4 7 10 10 zigzag tests with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle under single rudder failure to investigate the effect of a failed rudder 10 10 zigzag tests are further simulated by assuming a fixed rudder at a certain angle here it is assumed that the locked rudder is fixed from 2 5 to 2 5 at 2 5 intervals you and choi you and kim 2017 reported that a twin screw ship cannot execute the 35 turning test and zigzag test if a fixed rudder angle exceeds a certain angle and they call the limitation as the acceptable angles of the uncontrollable rudder the fixed angles of 2 5 0 and 2 5 are determined to be smaller than the limitation figs 46 and 47 show the time histories of the heading angle of the lngc for a 10 10 zigzag tests to the port side and starboard side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle respectively a solid black line with filled black squares solid black line with empty squares and solid black line indicate the rudder deflection angle fixed at 0 rudder deflection angle installed on the starboard side and heading angle of the ship the dotted blue line with solid blue circles dotted blue line with empty circles and dotted blue line indicate the rudder deflection angle fixed at 2 5 rudder deflection angle installed on the starboard side and heading angle of the ship the broken red line with solid red diamonds broken red line with empty diamonds and broken red line indicate the rudder deflection angle fixed at 2 5 rudder deflection angle installed on the starboard side and heading angle of the ship from here the definition for each line is always identical if zigzag tests with a fixed rudder at the certain angles under the three conditions are plotted together figs 48 50 show the time histories of yaw moments due to rudders and turn rate for 10 10 zigzag test to the port side and the starboard side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at 0 2 5 and 2 5 respectively as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 10 10 zigzag test to the port side decrease as shown in fig 46 here the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side increase on the other hand as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 10 10 zigzag test to the starboard side increase as shown in fig 47 here the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side decrease the tendency is mainly affected by the fixed rudder angle if the moment generated by fixed rudder can help the ship to turn quickly the overshoot angle becomes smaller reversely if the moment generated by the fixed rudder can keep the ship from turning quickly the overshoot angle becomes larger since the zigzag test is executed for the ship to approach the port side and starboard side in turn the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle have to be opposite and the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle is also different according to the initial approaching direction the fixed rudder has a role like a skeg that helps or interrupts the zigzag motion according to the fixed angle 4 8 20 20 zigzag tests under machinery failure figs 51 and 52 show the time history of the heading angle for the 20 20 zigzag tests to the port side and the starboard side respectively table 15 shows the relative ratio between the predicted 1st and 2nd overshoot angles for the 20 20 zigzag tests to the port side and the starboard side as well the tendency of the relative ratios of the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles for the 20 20 zigzag tests is similar to that for the 10 10 zigzag tests basically the dynamic response during the 20 20 zigzag test is similar to that during the 10 10 zigzag test however the deviations of the relative ratios for the 20 20 zigzag tests shown in table 15 are always smaller than those for the 10 10 zigzag tests as shown in table 14 the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure become larger than under normal operating conditions as shown in figs 51 and 52 and table 15 the overshoot angles under a single propeller failure are smaller than those under normal operating conditions on the other hand the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles predicted under a single propeller failure decrease when compared to those under normal operating conditions in both approaching directions as well the relative magnitude between the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles is dependent on the direction of approach under the aligned combination failure and cross combination failure namely if the ship starts a zigzag motion toward the port side first the relative ratio for the 1st overshoot angle is larger than that for the 2nd overshoot angle on the other hand if the ship starts a zigzag motion to starboard side first the relative ratio for the 2nd overshoot angle is larger than that for the 1st overshoot angle since a locked propeller and rudder are the same in a twin screw ship at the same time the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles have to be predicted with different aspects the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure and the normal operating condition are similar as shown in figs 51 and 52 and table 15 only the 1st and 2nd overshoot angles under single propeller failure is slightly smaller than those under normal operating conditions although the 2nd overshoot angle to the starboard side is slightly larger than that under normal operating condition two activating rudders help to secure yaw checking ability of the ship since there is no skeg effect due to a fixed rudder in the case of single propeller failure approaching speed is lower than that under normal operating condition the approaching speed affects the necessary loads to reverse its heading by controlling rudders since smaller yaw moment is needed under single propeller failure the overshoot angle becomes smaller from figs 53 57 that show the time histories of yaw moments due to rudders and the turn rate for 20 20 zigzag tests there is an insignificant difference in the tendency the relative magnitude of the yaw moment due to the rudders and turn rate is also similar likewise from figs 58 and 59 that show the time histories of the longitudinal and transversal speed of the ship for a 20 20 zigzag tests to the port and starboard side under normal operating conditions and machinery failure distinct differences cannot be found the relative magnitude of speed drop and drift angle are also similar the reason for which the relative ratio for the 20 20 zigzag tests is significantly reduced has to be related to the intrinsic maneuverability of the ship the significant reduction of the relative ratios of 20 20 zigzag tests by comparison with those of 10 10 zigzag tests is connected with direction stability discussed in fig 4 there is directional unstablility for the lngc the directional unstability is observed when using small deflection angle there the effect of the directional unstablity is distinctly shown for 10 10 zigzag tests in figs 58 and 59 the speed drop is closely connected to the number of rudders and its normal pressure as well as mentioned in the case of a normal operating condition and a single propeller failure a speed drop occurs quickly due to normal pressure from the two rudders however the speed drop goes slowly under other failure conditions which is the reason why the overshoot angles are significantly enlarged under a single rudder failure aligned combination failure and cross combination failure with a small speed drop 4 9 20 20 zigzag tests with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle under single rudder failure like 10 10 zigzag tests 20 20 zigzag tests are further simulated by assuming a fixed rudder at a certain angle to investigate the effect of a failed rudder it is assumed that the locked rudder is fixed from 5 to 5 at 5 intervals in the acceptable angles of the uncontrollable rudder presented by you and choi you and kim 2017 they are variated according to the maximum angle of the other rudder which is normally activated accordingly the fixed angles of 5 0 and 5 are determined to be smaller than the limitation figs 60 and 61 show the time histories of the heading angle of the lngc for the 20 20 zigzag tests to the port side and starboard side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at a certain angle respectively figs 62 64 show the time histories of yaw moments due to rudders and turn rate for 20 20 zigzag test to the port side under single rudder failure with a failed rudder fixed at 0 5 and 5 respectively the tendency of 1st and 2nd overshoot angle is basically identical with that obtained from 10 10 zigzag test as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 20 20 zigzag test to the port side decrease as shown in fig 60 and the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side increase as the fixed rudder is variated from negative value to positive value the 1st overshoot angles predicted from 20 20 zigzag test to the starboard side increase as shown in fig 61 and the 2nd overshoot angles predicted side decrease the tendency is mainly affected by the fixed rudder angle if the moment generated by fixed rudder can help the ship to turn quickly the overshoot angle becomes smaller on the other hand if the moment generated by the fixed rudder can keep the ship from turning quickly the overshoot angle becomes larger since the zigzag test is executed for the ship to approach the port side and starboard side in turn the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle have to be opposite and the tendency of 1st overshoot angle and 2nd overshoot angle is also different according to the initial approaching direction the fixed rudder has a role like a skeg that helps or interrupts the zigzag motion according to the fixed angle 5 conclusion in this paper we use a simplified maneuvering mathematical model to predict the maneuverability of the ship under machinery failure and propose a procedure to conduct imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure after a mathematical model is used in a simulation under normal operating conditions assumptions are applied on an existing mathematical model to consider the machinery failure by following the suggested procedure the mathematical model is also verified under machinery failure from sea trials finally numerical simulations for mandatory tests are conducted for defined failures and the physical characteristics of each failure are investigated by comparison with those under normal operating conditions in addition the maneuvering behavior under 23 5 knots of wind from bow quartering is additionally investigated to understand the asymmetric behaviors of the ship under machinery failure due to wind loads and two kinds of sensitivity studies are additionally conducted to check the reliability of the mathematical model there are three conclusions as follows first the turning ability is mainly affected by the aggregated yaw moment due to the rudders since the moment affects the turn rate and drift angle of the ship during the turning motion in particular the number of activated rudders is very important when a rudder is locked according to the failure an uncontrollable rudder prevents the ship from turning like a skeg if the number of activated rudders is identical the initial approach speed affects the magnitude of the turning indices and unbalanced thrust and drag affects the asymmetric turning performance second the asymmetric characteristics due to the wind load are observed related to the turning ability representative wind comes from the starboard side of the bow quartering and the turning trajectories shift as shown in conventional research and an asymmetric shape can be observed the results of the asymmetry from the sailing speed and drift angle affected by the wind load acts on the hull although there is an unusual enlargement of the turning trajectory to the starboard side this results in a speed that is relatively larger than the port side turning just the uncertainty due to a large drift angle has to be further studied third the yaw checking ability under machinery failure is mainly affected by an approaching speed since the approaching speed determines the yaw moment due to hull like a wing if the speed drop is small and slowly observed a higher yaw moment due to the rudders is needed to turn the ship in the opposite direction the number of activated rudders is important since the drag due to the rudder affects the speed of approach during the zigzag motion when a higher speed drop is observed a smaller overshoot angle is acquired and the relative magnitude of the overshoot angles during 10 10 zigzag tests is larger than that during 20 20 zigzag test this is closely connected with the directional unstability predicted from the spiral test as a small deflection angle is ordered directional unstability is clearly observed after the imo maneuvering tests under machinery failure were simulated by following the suggested method unique characteristics due to failure were investigated the tendency of the predicted indices under machinery failure can be understood based on physical knowledge from this kind of unconventional approach sailing safety of twin screw vessels

23501,this paper presents two novel globally exponentially stable position estimators using hydroacoustic measurements from a single transponder to several transceivers on the vehicle a comparison study of these and several existing filters is conducted with both experimental and simulated data two classes of filters for position estimation are compared filters expressing the position of an underwater vehicle in the body fixed and north east down coordinate frames the comparison study showed that the latter formulation yields lower estimation errors furthermore one of the novel filters developed in this paper using the north east down formulation is found to serve well as a compromise between performance theoretical stability and computational complexity relative to the near optimal linearization based filters with which it is compared keywords kalman filter aided inertial navigation acoustic sensor networks 1 introduction current subsea inspection maintenance and repair imr operations are heavily dependent on manually operated remotely operated vehicles rovs this is time consuming and expensive as it requires deployment of a surface vessel and experienced personnel schjølberg et al 2016 increased autonomy in current rov operations may make current operations more efficient while being a stepping stone towards future solution that e g are independent of the expensive surface vessel this paper considers inertial navigation of an uv in areas of little interest e g in transit between subsea facilities inertial navigation of an underwater vehicle uv commonly involves two steps one is the integration of rate measurements in order to update position and attitude estimates these measurements are often provided by accelerometers or doppler velocity log dvl for position estimation and angular rate sensor ars for attitude estimation due to the noisy and biased nature of inertial measurements the integration causes the position and attitude estimates to drift over time therefore a second step is needed namely aiding the inertial navigation using absolute measurements of position and attitude the absolute measurement for attitude estimation is often provided by on board sensors such as accelerometers and magnetometers or compasses these provide body fixed measurements of known reference vectors in the global frame and from this the rotation between the body fixed and global frame can be calculated for underwater position estimation these absolute measurements often come from hydroacoustic networks providing range measurements from known locations most commonly used is the long baseline lbl network in which several transducers are mounted on the sea bed and one transducer is carried by the vehicle the short baseline sbl has a similar structure except the array of transducers are mounted under a surface vessel from which the uv with one transducer is often employed in ultrashort baseline usbl systems the array of transducers are compactly fitted inside an apparatus that is mounted under a surface vessel the baselines i e the geometry of transducers impact the position estimation accuracy where longer distances and more diversity generally yield higher estimation accuracy for an overview of these set ups we refer to vickery 1998 these acoustic set ups also exist in slightly modified configurations the gps intelligent buoy gib network is similar to lbl only that the transducers are mounted to global positioning system gps positioned buoys in inverted ultrashort baseline iusbl the usbl apparatus is mounted on the uv lastly stovner and johansen 2017 suggested an inverted short baseline isbl set up in which transducers are spaced out as widely as possible on the uv this gives a similar set up as the iusbl but the baselines are now confined to the size of the uv instead of a small apparatus this set up is depicted in fig 1 the advantage of both isbl and iusbl compared to e g lbl is the lower requirement for external infrastructure assuming an attitude estimate is available isbl and iusbl only needs contact with one transponder in order to find its global position whereas with lbl three transponders are typically needed in areas of little interest e g in transit between subsea facilities it is desirable to install as little infrastructure as possible both to save deployment and maintenance costs the trade off of navigation precision for less infrastructure is not critical in these areas due to longer baselines isbl is potentially more accurate than iusbl also one can use cheap light weight transducer elements instead of a relatively expensive heavy and large usbl apparatus this is especially important for small light weight uvs morgado et al 2011a b batista et al 2014 developed kalman filters kfs with global stability properties using a linear model achieved through state augmentation for iusbl measurements there the range and range difference measurements were used in a tightly coupled scheme and not used to calculate a position measurement or range and bearing measurements as is common with usbl sensors also the receiver baselines on the vehicle are larger than one would typically expect from a usbl apparatus i e they spanned 20 30 30 c m therefore the proposed hydroacoustic set up in morgado et al 2011a has many similarities with the measurement set up used in this paper morgado et al 2013 presented an extended kalman filter ekf based solution for the same measurement set up where the full state i e position velocity and attitude along with ars and accelerometer biases was estimated another set up that requires only one transponder exists in which only one transceiver on the vehicle is assumed as well this estimation problem is not observable in each instant but can be shown to be observable over time for sufficiently rich vehicle movements as shown by batista et al 2010 for a state augmentation based solution to the nonlinear estimation problem several ekf and particle filter pf based solutions have also been developed see e g ferreira et al 2010 saúde and aguiar 2009 the ekf is the workhorse for estimation of nonlinear systems it linearizes the nonlinear model about its own estimate and employs the linearized model in a linear kf however the feedback of the state estimate as a linearization point is potentially destabilizing this has inspired solutions where a linear model is achieved without the need for the feedback of the state estimate batista et al 2012 and morgado et al 2011a find a linear model by algebraic manipulation of the measurement equations thus avoiding the feedback of a linearization point furthermore they are able to show global stability properties another way of linearizing the nonlinear model while avoiding the feedback of a linearization point is to linearize about an exogenous state estimate which has desired stability properties but may be suboptimal this is the idea of the exogenous kalman filter xkf of johansen and fossen 2017 a special case of the xkf is the three stage filter 3sf of johansen et al 2016 where the linearization point is provided by a cascade of an algebraic transformation that supplies a linear model to a suboptimal but globally asymptotically stable kf the algebraic transformation stage is generally similar to that in bancroft 1985 and chaffee and abel 1994 stovner et al 2016 developed a 3sf for underwater position estimation using an lbl network which jørgensen et al 2016 improved upon by a more accurate model of the noise in stovner et al 2017 the 3sf was used for body fixed position estimation with an isbl network and stovner and johansen 2017 extended the work to aid attitude estimation in the case of unreliable magnetometer measurements the presented work contains several contributions the 3sfs of stovner et al 2017 are improved upon by using a novel algebraic transformation inspired by morgado et al 2011a the novel algebraic transformation produces a linear time varying ltv measurement model where the original range and range difference measurements are still used as measurements this is contrary to batista et al 2012 where a position was calculated and used as measurement morgado et al 2011a b and batista et al 2014 where state augmentation was used to handle nonlinear terms and stovner et al 2017 where the algebraic transformation constructed new measurements that drastically increased the effect of measurement noise the novel filters which essentially are improvements on those of stovner et al 2017 express the state both in the body fixed and northeast down ned coordinate frames these are thoroughly developed and shown to have global exponential stability ges error dynamics the filters are compared both in simulations and experimentally to stovner et al 2017 a loosely coupled filter and a standard ekf implementation the second stage ltv kfs using the ned formulation is shown to outperform the second stage filters of stovner et al 2017 in fact it is shown to yield nearly as good performance as the third stage filter based on the linearized model therefore with a minor reduction in estimation precision one can reduce the computational burden by half relative to the 3sf presented in stovner et al 2017 the contributions are summarized below two novel three stage filter for underwater position estimation are developed and proven to have global exponential stability error dynamics this comes with robustness guarantees especially with regards to the transient behavior the filters are verified in simulations and experiments and calculated mean absolute error values show that ekf like performance is achieved 2 preliminaries on the uv there is one transmitting and m receiving hydroacoustic transducer elements denoted the sender and receivers respectively in the vehicle s surroundings a transponder is placed capable of both receiving and transmitting this set up is depicted in fig 1 let p b c a denote the position of point c relative to point b decomposed in the coordinate frame a in the case where c or b generally denote a coordinate frame the point is the origin of the respective frame now p b c j b and p t b b denotes the position of receiver c j relative to the vehicle and the vehicle relative the transponder t respectively both decomposed in the body fixed frame p n b n and p n t n denotes the position of the vehicle and transponder relative to the origin of the local ned frame respectively both decomposed in the ned frame similarly the ground velocity of the vehicle decomposed in the body fixed and ned frames is v n b b and v n b n respectively now we define the body fixed and ned state vectors as 1 x p t b b v n b b χ p n b n v n b n respectively denote the rotation from the body fixed to ned frame as r b n in this paper the ars measurements are assumed to be biased and the ars bias b b is assumed estimated by an attitude estimator now we define the attitude state tuple z r b n b b for z 1 r 1 b 1 and z 2 r 2 b 2 we define the notation z 1 z 2 r 1 r 2 b 1 b 2 also z 1 2 r 1 2 b 1 2 3 modeling 3 1

sender is mounted next to receiver c m which is responsible for contacting the transponder further assume that the vehicle moves slowly relative to the speed of sound the time of arrival toa detected by c m measures the distance from sender to transponder and back in addition to noise 2 ρ m ε y ε m therefore we model the range measurement y m by 3 y m h m x ρ m 1 2 ε y 1 2 ε m where ε y n 0 σ y 2

ars bias gravity vector and the acceleration respectively the accelerometer and ars noise terms are described by ε a r s n 0 σ a r s 2 and ε a c c n 0 σ a c c 2 respectively note the implicit assumption that the origin of the body fixed frame coincides with the inertial measurement unit imu if this is not the case the accelerometer measurements would be more appropriately modeled by f n i m b a n b b s 2 ω n i b p i b b s ω n i b p i b b r q b n g n ε a c c where i denotes the body fixed frame centered in the imu here one could either assume that p i b b or ω n i b and ω n i b are small enough that the coriolis terms are negligible or subtract estimates of the coriolis terms to cancel them out the normalized magnetometer measurement vector m b is modeled by m b r b n m n ε m a

error dynamics are derived the 3sfs consist of an attitude observer and three stages of position estimation the first stage described in section 4 2 is an algebraic transformation that algebraically linearizes the nonlinear measurement model the second stage is a kf using the algebraically transformed ltv model and is described in section 4 3 in section 4 4 the third stage is described in which the nonlinear model is linearized about the estimate from the second stage the general structure of the body fixed and ned formulations are depicted in fig 2 before deriving the estimators two key assumptions are stated assumption 1 there are at least two nonparallel reference vectors assumption 2 there are at least four non coplanar receivers on the uv 4 1 attitude observer the nonlinear

modeled by 39 y d p n t 3 n r b ˇ 3 n 0 1 3 c d b z ˇ x 0 0 1 0 1 3 c d n χ where r b ˇ 3 n and p n t 3 n are the third rows of r b ˇ n and p n t n respectively is added to the filters by appending y d to y c d b to c x and h x and c d n to c χ and h χ it can be shown that this relaxes assumption 2 to minimum 3 non collinear receivers that construct minimally 2 non vertical baselines in the implementation of the filters some practical considerations were taken s p t b b and s v n b b were removed from g x x since they greatly deteriorated the estimation this is assumed to be caused by errors in the estimate of p t b b leading to an erroneous increase in the covariance matrix over time since p t b b typically is large this may have a detrimental effect on estimation for the body fixed filters the depth measurement variance was increased by a factor of 100 i e ℛ d 100 σ d 2 this accounted for the impact of small errors in r b ˇ n which was amplified by the distance to the transponder as can be seen in 39 in the plots below the following color coding is used 1 image 1 true or camera system trajectory 2 image 2 stage 1 and 2 from stovner and johansen 2017 3 image 3 body

the loosely coupled filter 5 is a ned formulated filter with the measurement model p n b n c χ where c i 3 0 3 3 6 1 simulations the simulations were conducted with three different transponder positions in order to show how the estimators perform with increasing range measurements in each of the three simulated scenarios 50 simulations were run with different randomly generated noise in the 800 s long scenario the uv stood still for 400 s before following the trajectory shown in fig 3 the transponder was placed at p n t n 10 20 5 m p n t n 100 200 50 m and p n t n 1000 2000 50 m in the three scenarios while the m 4 receivers on the body were at p b c 1 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m p b c 2 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m p b c 3 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m p b c 4 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m where p b c 4 b was also the position of the sender the initial state of the vehicle was given by p n b n 0 0 0 m v n b n 0 0 0 m s r b n i 3 while the ars bias was b b 0 012 0 021 0 014 r a d s the standard deviations of the measurement noises were σ y 1 m σ 0 01 m σ d 0 1 m σ a c c 0 01 m s 2 σ a r s 0 01 r a d s and σ m a g 0 01 the reference vectors used for attitude estimation were r 1 n g n r 1 b f n b m b r 2 n m n 1 0 0 and r 2 b m b the frequency of acoustic depth and imu measurement retrieval were 1 h z 10 h z and 100 h z respectively the initial position velocity attitude and bias estimates were p ˇ n b n 0 0 0 0 m v ˇ n b n 0 0 0 0 m s r b ˇ n 0 i 3 and b ˇ b ˇ 0 0 0 0 r a d s from which the initial state of all estimators were found the initial covariance matrix were chosen as p 0 blockdiag i 3 0 1 i 3 where blockdiag forms a block diagonal matrix of its inputs choices for the attitude observer tuning parameters were k i 0 05 σ 1 and k p 1 all estimators were updated with 100 h z the difficult geometry of this estimation problem i e the short baselines between receivers compared to the distance to transponder makes this set up sensitive to noise on the acoustic measurements this calls for conservative measurement updates in the kf this can be seen by the slow convergence of the estimators in fig 4 which is seen to take approximately 100 s for all estimators even with no initial errors apart from the ars bias little of the slow convergence can be attributed to the initial ars bias error since the ned and body fixed filters converge with approximately the same speeds rather this is due to the convergence of the covariance matrix in table 1 the mae of the horizontal xy and vertical z positions for the last 400 s of simulations of the three scenarios are shown the increasing horizontal mae with increasing distance to transponder is evidence that the noise sensitivity increases with distance as well the vertical errors however vary less with distance the ned formulated filters 4 5 7 and 8 have constant vertical mae while the body fixed filters 2 3 and 6 increase somewhat moreover the vertical errors are more that 10 times higher for the body fixed filters than the ned filters this is due to the noisy rotation matrix in 39 which has a detrimental effect on the depth measurements one can draw the conclusion that the ned filters generally outperform the body fixed filters both in vertical and horizontal performance looking at the ned formulated filters only we see that the loosely coupled filter 5 performs substantially worse than the others this is due to the highly noise sensitive calculation of p n b n and speaks for the benefit of using a tightly coupled filter scheme filter 4 has somewhat higher mae than the linearization based filters 7 and 8 compared to filter 7 it only has half the computational complexity since it employs one kf instead of two and compared to filter 8 it has guaranteed stability therefore it is argued that filter 4 yields the best compromise between computational load stability and performance this is especially true in the suggested case where the uv is far away from infrastructure and the highest precision of estimation is not crucial filter 7 and 8 have similar performances which is expected as filter 8 is just an ekf version of filter 7 in this simulation study it was assumed that the range measurement was retrieved instantaneously and not influenced by the travel time of the sound wave this assumption was made for simplicity in a realistic scenario especially when the vehicle is far from the transponder this should be taken into account 6 2 experiments the experiment was conducted in the marine cybernetic laboratory mclab which is a water tank at ntnu the mclab is equipped with an oqus underwater camera positioning system from qualisys providing reference position and attitude trajectories the experimental set up was slightly different than in the simulations described below the imu used in the experiments an adis16485 does not contain a magnetometer therefore measurements from 3 additional transponders was used in order to provide yaw information to the attitude estimator also for ease of implementation a standard multiplicative extended kalman filter mekf was employed using accelerometer and the acoustics as reference vector measurements no pressure sensor was available so the vertical position output from the qualisys camera system was used instead onto this signal a white noise w d n 0 0 05 2 was added the acoustic system provided range measurements from this range difference measurements were calculated by subtraction simple outlier rejection was employed to prevent corruption of the estimates the sensor platform was a 0 5 0 5 0 5 m aluminum frame onto which an underwater housing containing an imu was fastened seen in fig 5 the transceiver positions were p b c 1 b 0 78 0 27 0 26 m p b c 2 b 0 45 0 58 0 28 m p b c 3 b 0 44 0 23 0 16 m p b c 4 b 0 44 0 27 0 25 m and the transponder position p n t n 2 11 1 92 0 76 m acoustic measurements were retrieved with 1 h z while imu and depth measurements were retrieved with 100 h z and 5 h z respectively the tuning parameter standard deviations of the 3sfs and mekf were σ y 0 2 m σ 0 1 m σ a c c 0 034 m s 2 σ a r s 0 0021 r a d s and σ δ p 0 1 m where σ δ p represents the noise of the acoustic reference vector measurement used for the mekf discussed above the initial ars bias estimate in the experiments was set to the values found by offline calibration from fig 6 we see that all filters except the loosely coupled filter 5 successfully tracked the true trajectory except about 300 s into the experiments this was due to range measurement dropouts which resulted in a period of dead reckoning it is likely that filter 5 struggled because of small undetected outliers that greatly affected the noise sensitive calculation of p n b n table 2 suggests that the body fixed stage 2 filters i e filter 2 and 3 perform worse than the ned stage 2 filter i e filter 4 this confirms the conclusion drawn from the simulation study also filter 4 performs equally well as the linearized filters i e filter 6 8 this was also seen in the simulation study here however the distance between vehicle and transponder was much shorter than in the simulation study this indicates that neglecting the noise terms in the denominators of 17 is justified also for short distances that the performance of the body fixed and ned linearized filters were similar was expected as the distance to the transponder was small figs 7 and 8 show satisfying attitude and ars bias estimation in the experiments 7 conclusion in this paper two novel ges 3sfs for underwater position estimation using imu isbl and depth measurements was presented these employed nonlinear transformations of the hydroacoustic measurement equations that yielded measurement equations on ltv forms kfs were implemented using these ltv forms which constituted the second stage of two new 3sfs based on the estimates from these third stage linearized filters were implemented a comparison study between several kfs based on ned and body fixed formulations were conducted generally it was found that the ned formulated filters performed better than the body fixed ones this was likely due to that the ned formulated filters are better incorporating depth measurements and have a lower sensitivity to noisy attitude and ars bias estimates specifically the novel second stage filter employing the ned formulation showed the most promise at it performed nearly as well as its purely linearization based third stage filter and ekf counterparts while leaving half the computational footprint of the full 3sf and guaranteeing global stability in contrast to the local stability of the ekf future work should include a comparison study with the other contributors to this estimation problem especially morgado et al 2011b 2013 batista

23501,this paper presents two novel globally exponentially stable position estimators using hydroacoustic measurements from a single transponder to several transceivers on the vehicle a comparison study of these and several existing filters is conducted with both experimental and simulated data two classes of filters for position estimation are compared filters expressing the position of an underwater vehicle in the body fixed and north east down coordinate frames the comparison study showed that the latter formulation yields lower estimation errors furthermore one of the novel filters developed in this paper using the north east down formulation is found to serve well as a compromise between performance theoretical stability and computational complexity relative to the near optimal linearization based filters with which it is compared keywords kalman filter aided inertial navigation acoustic sensor networks 1 introduction current subsea inspection maintenance and repair imr operations are heavily dependent on manually operated remotely operated vehicles rovs this is time consuming and expensive as it requires deployment of a surface vessel and experienced personnel schjølberg et al 2016 increased autonomy in current rov operations may make current operations more efficient while being a stepping stone towards future solution that e g are independent of the expensive surface vessel this paper considers inertial navigation of an uv in areas of little interest e g in transit between subsea facilities inertial navigation of an underwater vehicle uv commonly involves two steps one is the integration of rate measurements in order to update position and attitude estimates these measurements are often provided by accelerometers or doppler velocity log dvl for position estimation and angular rate sensor ars for attitude estimation due to the noisy and biased nature of inertial measurements the integration causes the position and attitude estimates to drift over time therefore a second step is needed namely aiding the inertial navigation using absolute measurements of position and attitude the absolute measurement for attitude estimation is often provided by on board sensors such as accelerometers and magnetometers or compasses these provide body fixed measurements of known reference vectors in the global frame and from this the rotation between the body fixed and global frame can be calculated for underwater position estimation these absolute measurements often come from hydroacoustic networks providing range measurements from known locations most commonly used is the long baseline lbl network in which several transducers are mounted on the sea bed and one transducer is carried by the vehicle the short baseline sbl has a similar structure except the array of transducers are mounted under a surface vessel from which the uv with one transducer is often employed in ultrashort baseline usbl systems the array of transducers are compactly fitted inside an apparatus that is mounted under a surface vessel the baselines i e the geometry of transducers impact the position estimation accuracy where longer distances and more diversity generally yield higher estimation accuracy for an overview of these set ups we refer to vickery 1998 these acoustic set ups also exist in slightly modified configurations the gps intelligent buoy gib network is similar to lbl only that the transducers are mounted to global positioning system gps positioned buoys in inverted ultrashort baseline iusbl the usbl apparatus is mounted on the uv lastly stovner and johansen 2017 suggested an inverted short baseline isbl set up in which transducers are spaced out as widely as possible on the uv this gives a similar set up as the iusbl but the baselines are now confined to the size of the uv instead of a small apparatus this set up is depicted in fig 1 the advantage of both isbl and iusbl compared to e g lbl is the lower requirement for external infrastructure assuming an attitude estimate is available isbl and iusbl only needs contact with one transponder in order to find its global position whereas with lbl three transponders are typically needed in areas of little interest e g in transit between subsea facilities it is desirable to install as little infrastructure as possible both to save deployment and maintenance costs the trade off of navigation precision for less infrastructure is not critical in these areas due to longer baselines isbl is potentially more accurate than iusbl also one can use cheap light weight transducer elements instead of a relatively expensive heavy and large usbl apparatus this is especially important for small light weight uvs morgado et al 2011a b batista et al 2014 developed kalman filters kfs with global stability properties using a linear model achieved through state augmentation for iusbl measurements there the range and range difference measurements were used in a tightly coupled scheme and not used to calculate a position measurement or range and bearing measurements as is common with usbl sensors also the receiver baselines on the vehicle are larger than one would typically expect from a usbl apparatus i e they spanned 20 30 30 c m therefore the proposed hydroacoustic set up in morgado et al 2011a has many similarities with the measurement set up used in this paper morgado et al 2013 presented an extended kalman filter ekf based solution for the same measurement set up where the full state i e position velocity and attitude along with ars and accelerometer biases was estimated another set up that requires only one transponder exists in which only one transceiver on the vehicle is assumed as well this estimation problem is not observable in each instant but can be shown to be observable over time for sufficiently rich vehicle movements as shown by batista et al 2010 for a state augmentation based solution to the nonlinear estimation problem several ekf and particle filter pf based solutions have also been developed see e g ferreira et al 2010 saúde and aguiar 2009 the ekf is the workhorse for estimation of nonlinear systems it linearizes the nonlinear model about its own estimate and employs the linearized model in a linear kf however the feedback of the state estimate as a linearization point is potentially destabilizing this has inspired solutions where a linear model is achieved without the need for the feedback of the state estimate batista et al 2012 and morgado et al 2011a find a linear model by algebraic manipulation of the measurement equations thus avoiding the feedback of a linearization point furthermore they are able to show global stability properties another way of linearizing the nonlinear model while avoiding the feedback of a linearization point is to linearize about an exogenous state estimate which has desired stability properties but may be suboptimal this is the idea of the exogenous kalman filter xkf of johansen and fossen 2017 a special case of the xkf is the three stage filter 3sf of johansen et al 2016 where the linearization point is provided by a cascade of an algebraic transformation that supplies a linear model to a suboptimal but globally asymptotically stable kf the algebraic transformation stage is generally similar to that in bancroft 1985 and chaffee and abel 1994 stovner et al 2016 developed a 3sf for underwater position estimation using an lbl network which jørgensen et al 2016 improved upon by a more accurate model of the noise in stovner et al 2017 the 3sf was used for body fixed position estimation with an isbl network and stovner and johansen 2017 extended the work to aid attitude estimation in the case of unreliable magnetometer measurements the presented work contains several contributions the 3sfs of stovner et al 2017 are improved upon by using a novel algebraic transformation inspired by morgado et al 2011a the novel algebraic transformation produces a linear time varying ltv measurement model where the original range and range difference measurements are still used as measurements this is contrary to batista et al 2012 where a position was calculated and used as measurement morgado et al 2011a b and batista et al 2014 where state augmentation was used to handle nonlinear terms and stovner et al 2017 where the algebraic transformation constructed new measurements that drastically increased the effect of measurement noise the novel filters which essentially are improvements on those of stovner et al 2017 express the state both in the body fixed and northeast down ned coordinate frames these are thoroughly developed and shown to have global exponential stability ges error dynamics the filters are compared both in simulations and experimentally to stovner et al 2017 a loosely coupled filter and a standard ekf implementation the second stage ltv kfs using the ned formulation is shown to outperform the second stage filters of stovner et al 2017 in fact it is shown to yield nearly as good performance as the third stage filter based on the linearized model therefore with a minor reduction in estimation precision one can reduce the computational burden by half relative to the 3sf presented in stovner et al 2017 the contributions are summarized below two novel three stage filter for underwater position estimation are developed and proven to have global exponential stability error dynamics this comes with robustness guarantees especially with regards to the transient behavior the filters are verified in simulations and experiments and calculated mean absolute error values show that ekf like performance is achieved 2 preliminaries on the uv there is one transmitting and m receiving hydroacoustic transducer elements denoted the sender and receivers respectively in the vehicle s surroundings a transponder is placed capable of both receiving and transmitting this set up is depicted in fig 1 let p b c a denote the position of point c relative to point b decomposed in the coordinate frame a in the case where c or b generally denote a coordinate frame the point is the origin of the respective frame now p b c j b and p t b b denotes the position of receiver c j relative to the vehicle and the vehicle relative the transponder t respectively both decomposed in the body fixed frame p n b n and p n t n denotes the position of the vehicle and transponder relative to the origin of the local ned frame respectively both decomposed in the ned frame similarly the ground velocity of the vehicle decomposed in the body fixed and ned frames is v n b b and v n b n respectively now we define the body fixed and ned state vectors as 1 x p t b b v n b b χ p n b n v n b n respectively denote the rotation from the body fixed to ned frame as r b n in this paper the ars measurements are assumed to be biased and the ars bias b b is assumed estimated by an attitude estimator now we define the attitude state tuple z r b n b b for z 1 r 1 b 1 and z 2 r 2 b 2 we define the notation z 1 z 2 r 1 r 2 b 1 b 2 also z 1 2 r 1 2 b 1 2 3 modeling 3 1

sender is mounted next to receiver c m which is responsible for contacting the transponder further assume that the vehicle moves slowly relative to the speed of sound the time of arrival toa detected by c m measures the distance from sender to transponder and back in addition to noise 2 ρ m ε y ε m therefore we model the range measurement y m by 3 y m h m x ρ m 1 2 ε y 1 2 ε m where ε y n 0 σ y 2 is noise on the range measurement and ε j n 0 σ 2 j 1 m is a noise term unique for receiver c j the time difference of arrival tdoa measured at receiver c j for j 1 m 1 is described by 4 δ y j h j x ρ

ars bias gravity vector and the acceleration respectively the accelerometer and ars noise terms are described by ε a r s n 0 σ a r s 2 and ε a c c n 0 σ a c c 2 respectively note the implicit assumption that the origin of the body fixed frame coincides with the inertial measurement unit imu if this is not the case the accelerometer measurements would be more appropriately modeled by f n i m b a n b b s 2 ω n i b p i b b s ω n i b p i b b r q b n g n ε a c c where i denotes the body fixed frame centered in the imu here one could either assume that p i b b or ω n i b and ω n i b are small enough that the coriolis terms are negligible or subtract estimates of the coriolis terms to cancel them out the normalized magnetometer measurement vector m b is modeled by m b r b n m n ε m a

error dynamics are derived the 3sfs consist of an attitude observer and three stages of position estimation the first stage described in section 4 2 is an algebraic transformation that algebraically linearizes the nonlinear measurement model the second stage is a kf using the algebraically transformed ltv model and is described in section 4 3 in section 4 4 the third stage is described in which the nonlinear model is linearized about the estimate from the second stage the general structure of the body fixed and ned formulations are depicted in fig 2 before deriving the estimators two key assumptions are stated assumption 1 there are at least two nonparallel reference vectors assumption 2 there are at least four non coplanar receivers on the uv 4 1 attitude observer the nonlinear

observable uco and uniformly completely controllable ucc proof theorem 6 o12 in chen 1998 proves that the pairs a t d t is uco if the observability co distribution formed by a t and d t have full rank we define the placeholder matrix d t c x x c χ χ z ˇ h x x h χ χ z ˇ and note its general form d d p t 0 m 3 where d p t ℝ m 3 the top 2 m rows of the observability co distributions are 34 d o d p t 0 m 3 d p t where denotes an arbitrary matrix of appropriate size from theorem 4 2 of meyer 1973 it follows that if d p t has full rank then d o has full rank the rank of d p t is full for all four systems under assumption 2 and thus all systems are uco using theorem 6 12 in chen 1998 in a similar way it is trivial to show ucc of all four systems since a x c x b x φ x are smooth and z z ˇ p t b

there also exists a constant α χ 0 such that 36 ξ χ χ z χ z ˇ α χ p n b n p n b n 2 z 2 notice that only the position and not the full state is used in the bounds 35 36 since the errors ξ x and ξ χ do

equilibrium points z 0 0 and x 0 of the error dynamics cascade σ z σ x is ges 2 the equilibrium points z 0 0 and χ 0 of the error dynamics cascade σ z σ χ is ges proof the proof uses similar arguments as johansen and fossen 2017 notice that in the noise free case we have p t b b p t b b and p n b n p n b n furthermore when z ˇ z then ξ x 0 and ξ χ 0 using proposition 2 the equilibrium points x 0

loria and panteley 2005 now proves that the equilibrium points z 0 0 and x 0 and χ 0 of the error dynamics cascades σ z σ x and σ z σ χ respectively are ges from proposition 3 it follows that x and χ

error dynamics cascade σ z σ χ σ ˆ χ is ges proof the proof is similar to that of proposition 3 6 results in this section the results of simulations and experiments are shown a depth measurement modeled by 39 y d p n t 3 n r b ˇ 3 n 0 1 3 c d b z ˇ x 0 0 1 0 1 3 c d n χ where r b ˇ 3 n and p n t 3 n are the third rows of r b ˇ n and p n t n respectively is added to the filters by appending y d to y c d b to c x and h x and c d n to c χ and h χ it can be shown that this relaxes assumption 2 to minimum 3 non collinear receivers that construct minimally 2 non vertical baselines in the implementation of the filters some practical considerations were taken s p t b b and s v n b b were removed from g x x since they greatly deteriorated the estimation this is assumed to be caused by errors in the estimate of p t b b leading to an erroneous increase in the covariance matrix over time since p t b b typically is large this may have a detrimental effect on estimation for the body fixed filters the depth measurement variance was increased by a factor of 100 i e ℛ d 100 σ d 2 this accounted for the impact of small errors in r b ˇ n which was amplified by the distance to the transponder as can be seen in 39 in the plots below the following color coding is used 1 image 1 true or camera system trajectory 2 image 2 stage 1 and 2 from stovner and johansen 2017 3 image 3 body

the loosely coupled filter 5 is a ned formulated filter with the measurement model p n b n c χ where c i 3 0 3 3 6 1 simulations the simulations were conducted with three different transponder positions in order to show how the estimators perform with increasing range measurements in each of the three simulated scenarios 50 simulations were run with different randomly generated noise in the 800 s long scenario the uv stood still for 400 s before following the trajectory shown in fig 3 the transponder was placed at p n t n 10 20 5 m p n t n 100 200 50 m and p n t n 1000 2000 50 m in the three scenarios while the m 4 receivers on the body were at p b c 1 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m p b c 2 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m p b c 3 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m p b c 4 b 0 6 0 3 0 3 m where p b c 4 b was also the position of the sender the initial state of the vehicle was given by p n b n 0 0 0 m v n b n 0 0 0 m s r b n i 3 while the ars bias was b b 0 012 0 021 0 014 r a d s the standard deviations of the measurement noises were σ y 1 m σ 0 01 m σ d 0 1 m σ a c c 0 01 m s 2 σ a r s 0 01 r a d s and σ m a g 0 01 the reference vectors used for attitude estimation were r 1 n g n r 1 b f n b m b r 2 n m n 1 0 0 and r 2 b m b the frequency of acoustic depth and imu measurement retrieval were 1 h z 10 h z and 100 h z respectively the initial position velocity attitude and bias estimates were p ˇ n b n 0 0 0 0 m v ˇ n b n 0 0 0 0 m s r b ˇ n 0 i 3 and b ˇ b ˇ 0 0 0 0 r a d s from which the initial state of all estimators were found the initial covariance matrix were chosen as p 0 blockdiag i 3 0 1 i 3 where blockdiag forms a block diagonal matrix of its inputs choices for the attitude observer tuning parameters were k i 0 05 σ 1 and k p 1 all estimators were updated with 100 h z the difficult geometry of this estimation problem i e the short baselines between receivers compared to the distance to transponder makes this set up sensitive to noise on the acoustic measurements this calls for conservative measurement updates in the kf this can be seen by the slow convergence of the estimators in fig 4 which is seen to take approximately 100 s for all estimators even with no initial errors apart from the ars bias little of the slow convergence can be attributed to the initial ars bias error since the ned and body fixed filters converge with approximately the same speeds rather this is due to the convergence of the covariance matrix in table 1 the mae of the horizontal xy and vertical z positions for the last 400 s of simulations of the three scenarios are shown the increasing horizontal mae with increasing distance to transponder is evidence that the noise sensitivity increases with distance as well the vertical errors however vary less with distance the ned formulated filters 4 5 7 and 8 have constant vertical mae while the body fixed filters 2 3 and 6 increase somewhat moreover the vertical errors are more that 10 times higher for the body fixed filters than the ned filters this is due to the noisy rotation matrix in 39 which has a detrimental effect on the depth measurements one can draw the conclusion that the ned filters generally outperform the body fixed filters both in vertical and horizontal performance looking at the ned formulated filters only we see that the loosely coupled filter 5 performs substantially worse than the others this is due to the highly noise sensitive calculation of p n b n and speaks for the benefit of using a tightly coupled filter scheme filter 4 has somewhat higher mae than the linearization based filters 7 and 8 compared to filter 7 it only has half the computational complexity since it employs one kf instead of two and compared to filter 8 it has guaranteed stability therefore it is argued that filter 4 yields the best compromise between computational load stability and performance this is especially true in the suggested case where the uv is far away from infrastructure and the highest precision of estimation is not crucial filter 7 and 8 have similar performances which is expected as filter 8 is just an ekf version of filter 7 in this simulation study it was assumed that the range measurement was retrieved instantaneously and not influenced by the travel time of the sound wave this assumption was made for simplicity in a realistic scenario especially when the vehicle is far from the transponder this should be taken into account 6 2 experiments the experiment was conducted in the marine cybernetic laboratory mclab which is a water tank at ntnu the mclab is equipped with an oqus underwater camera positioning system from qualisys providing reference position and attitude trajectories the experimental set up was slightly different than in the simulations described below the imu used in the experiments an adis16485 does not contain a magnetometer therefore measurements from 3 additional transponders was used in order to provide yaw information to the attitude estimator also for ease of implementation a standard multiplicative extended kalman filter mekf was employed using accelerometer and the acoustics as reference vector measurements no pressure sensor was available so the vertical position output from the qualisys camera system was used instead onto this signal a white noise w d n 0 0 05 2 was added the acoustic system provided range measurements from this range difference measurements were calculated by subtraction simple outlier rejection was employed to prevent corruption of the estimates the sensor platform was a 0 5 0 5 0 5 m aluminum frame onto which an underwater housing containing an imu was fastened seen in fig 5 the transceiver positions were p b c 1 b 0 78 0 27 0 26 m p b c 2 b 0 45 0 58 0 28 m p b c 3 b 0 44 0 23 0 16 m p b c 4 b 0 44 0 27 0 25 m and the transponder position p n t n 2 11 1 92 0 76 m acoustic measurements were retrieved with 1 h z while imu and depth measurements were retrieved with 100 h z and 5 h z respectively the tuning parameter standard deviations of the 3sfs and mekf were σ y 0 2 m σ 0 1 m σ a c c 0 034 m s 2 σ a r s 0 0021 r a d s and σ δ p 0 1 m where σ δ p represents the noise of the acoustic reference vector measurement used for the mekf discussed above the initial ars bias estimate in the experiments was set to the values found by offline calibration from fig 6 we see that all filters except the loosely coupled filter 5 successfully tracked the true trajectory except about 300 s into the experiments this was due to range measurement dropouts which resulted in a period of dead reckoning it is likely that filter 5 struggled because of small undetected outliers that greatly affected the noise sensitive calculation of p n b n table 2 suggests that the body fixed stage 2 filters i e filter 2 and 3 perform worse than the ned stage 2 filter i e filter 4 this confirms the conclusion drawn from the simulation study also filter 4 performs equally well as the linearized filters i e filter 6 8 this was also seen in the simulation study here however the distance between vehicle and transponder was much shorter than in the simulation study this indicates that neglecting the noise terms in the denominators of 17 is justified also for short distances that the performance of the body fixed and ned linearized filters were similar was expected as the distance to the transponder was small figs 7 and 8 show satisfying attitude and ars bias estimation in the experiments 7 conclusion in this paper two novel ges 3sfs for underwater position estimation using imu isbl and depth measurements was presented these employed nonlinear transformations of the hydroacoustic measurement equations that yielded measurement equations on ltv forms kfs were implemented using these ltv forms which constituted the second stage of two new 3sfs based on the estimates from these third stage linearized filters were implemented a comparison study between several kfs based on ned and body fixed formulations were conducted generally it was found that the ned formulated filters performed better than the body fixed ones this was likely due to that the ned formulated filters are better incorporating depth measurements and have a lower sensitivity to noisy attitude and ars bias estimates specifically the novel second stage filter employing the ned formulation showed the most promise at it performed nearly as well as its purely linearization based third stage filter and ekf counterparts while leaving half the computational footprint of the full 3sf and guaranteeing global stability in contrast to the local stability of the ekf future work should include a comparison study with the other contributors to this estimation problem especially morgado et al 2011b 2013 batista

23502,although the number of marine accidents has gradually decreased fatal ones continue to occur to prevent huge losses of life environment and property there are sufficient laws rules and regulations which include many technical solutions notably many solutions for damaged ships are suggested to prevent capsizing and sinking however many pioneering ideas for damaged ships remain at the conception level because of the lack of technical and economic feasibility to have both technical and economic feasibility in the design process in this study a business model adopted design process has been considered using this design process a new concept for buoyancy support systems is studied which considers the technical and economic matters in the design process in addition a fixed fire fighting system and 3d laser scan data basis 3 dimensional buoyancy support system are been studied to convince the usability of the suggested concept computational simulation was used at the abstract level because there can be thousands of damage scenarios for a ship sampled catastrophic damage scenarios are used in the case study to confirm the possibility of the suggested concept of buoyancy support systems keywords buoyancy support stability buoyancy support fixed fire fighting system flooding 3d laser scan 1 introduction and background every ship is designed and built according to the rules and regulations to enable each ship to be prepared for various marine accidents it is also furnished with the safety equipment and facilities required by safety of life at sea solas imo 2009 imo has continued to make concerted efforts to improve ship safety in efforts to prevent a vessel from sinking due to flooding of accidents very valuable results are now available including guidelines for flooding detection system on passenger ship imo msc 2009 guidelines on safe return to port for passenger ships imo sdc 2015 guidelines on harmonized aeronautical and maritime search and rescue procedures including sar training matters imo ncsr 2016 with these meaningful efforts the best way to ensure a safe voyage of vessels is to comply with relevant laws and regulations nevertheless studies of technological alternatives to reduce human lives the environment and property damages in the event of an unexpected accident is still in progress in cases of marine accidents such as collisions and groundings excessive damage and flooding cause the ship to sink capsize or impede the use of its essential navigation equipment as ship has watertight bulkheads doors hatches and other means the consequence of flooding accident usually can be mitigated in early phase of an accident but in some excessive damaged case the operation of the essential equipment that is crucial for sailing such as the navigation radar or generator can be becomes impossible kang et al 2013 in addition the progressive flooding after the excessive accident can cause sinking or capsizing of the ship to counter these problems many pioneering studies are in progress such as research to avoid parametric roll bačkalov et al 2016 studies of numerical prediction of damage ship stability papanikolaou and spanos 2004 and papanikolaou 2007 improvement of ship stability and safety in damaged condition through operational measures boulougouris et al 2016 and onboard damage control system dcs and an incident management system ims shafie pour and sajdak 2015 in addition several concepts of the buoyancy support system that is attached to the outer hull in the forms of sponson and ducktail for passenger vessel have been applied to fulfill solas 95 which is called stockholm agreement vassalos and papanikolaou 2002 the inner ship structure that prevents the ship from losing its stability has also been introduced by research projects such as eu fp7 project susy surfacing system for ship recovery for cargo vessels smith et al 2011 and the foam resin based on damage stability recovery system dsrs vassalos et al 2016 for an inner hull buoyancy support system sharp bumps such as brackets with complicated geometrical shapes in the hull can damage the buoyancy chamber during inflation for foam resin reusability of essential equipment for safe return to port have to be considered the additional requirements to install the gas or foam resin valves nozzles and control systems such as sensors power and data lines worsen the applicability of the concept when the buoyancy support system is installed outside the ship additional consideration for lack of lifetime maintainability should also be considered because the buoyancy support system is exposed to sunlight and salty sea breeze to enhance damaged ships safety design alternatives for buoyancy support should be considered not only from technical but also economic feasibility for this reason in this paper alternatives for buoyancy support system has studied more in detail from the initial concept which has been introduced as a proceeding at prads 2016 kang and choi 2016 based on the buoyancy support function an alternative has studied that could be used at an acceptable cost without degradation of the vessel s performance applicability to a variety of vessels and the life cycle maintenance were also considered 2 requirement analysis the technology to be developed must be analyzed for technical and economic feasibility to put the previously proposed concepts into practical use and identify them as requirements of the new concept design the system engineering basis design process applied for various meaningful requirement analyses because the buoyancy support systems of previous research have relatively simple configurations the roll of the buoyancy support system has been reanalyzed as requirements for the new system as shown in table 1 when we consider these requirements for the practical use of the technical concepts for buoyancy support systems the measure of effectiveness moe can be set to secure the utility of the developed technology based on the results from requirement analysis measures of performance mop and technical performance measures tpms to determine and support the key performance parameters kpps in table 2 in the design process the suggested tpms of table 2 must be obtained for moe kpp and mop to reach each goal of tpms through the design process all technical economic and other related matters should be consistently and intuitively considered thus during the establishment of the development technology based on the identified tpm a business model is used as a system analysis and control tool kang et al 2014 table 3 shows the business model for the designing system configuration 3 functional analysis and allocation in terms of tpm1 which corresponded to r1 function f1 was set to maintain the stability of the ship by inflating the buoyancy chamber to secure the operability of the essential sailing equipment such as the navigation radar the ability of function f1 to maintain stability must be controlled in the range that would not damage the operability of equipment even when the roll angle is changed because of flooding because of its potential damage in terms of tpm2 which corresponded to r2 function f2 was applied to secure the working space for damage control in flooding areas even when the buoyancy chamber was unfolded in terms of tpm3 for r3 f3 was set as the inner hull installation function table 4 shows the function list configuration to accept the requirement analysis results the proposed required function list is meant to satisfy the requirements and must be synthesized within the boundary of the business model 4 synthesis the buoyancy support system of function f1 must minimize the need of remodeling the ship not extend beyond the category of infra channel of the business model and fulfill the task by offering the preparatory buoyancy of value to the stakeholder of the business model the configured buoyancy chamber must have the sufficient volume to secure the buoyancy of the inner hull to retain the ability of function f2 which provides the working space the passage and workspace must also be secured for the worker to waterproof the damage area after inflating the buoyancy chamber the complicated geometrical shape of the buoyancy support system operation area and the equipment operability must also be considered therefore the shape of the buoyancy chamber should be configured so that it does not interfere with the inner hull structure but secures the passage and workspace for the worker as an alternative the use of 3d point cloud data can be considered yoon et al 2015 fig 1 shows the concept of installation of a 3 dimensional shaped buoyancy chamber which uses 3d laser scanning data in the inner hull because the ship charterage loss and dry dock fee for the suggested system installation are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars per day the developed buoyancy support system must be installed during the loading or unloading periods when the ship is anchored at the port of call it must also be secured to satisfy the required installability and operability therefore to exclude the necessity to install the additional buoyancy chamber inflating gas tanks pipes and nozzles with power and data line for system control the study considers using the fixed fire fighting system which is pre installed inside a ship for the inlet gas using fixed fire fighting system for the buoyancy chamber carbon dioxide nitrogen and foam can be considered however in this paper carbon dioxide is considered in terms of storage efficiency the use of the carbon dioxide fire fighting system for the buoyancy support system considers that fire and flooding accidents historically do not commonly occur together however in that case the fixed fire fighting system should consider the urgency of each accident situation for the selective or concurrent use with certain limitation fig 2 shows the 3d shaped buoyancy chamber configuration concept using the carbon dioxide fire fighting system the folded buoyancy chamber can be located in the ceiling or other free space in the ship for the buoyancy inflation time and maintainability the chamber may consist of several to a dozen of sub chambers depending on the number of nozzles and their locations the deployed buoyancy chamber should be able to be fixed in the hull using electromagnets or restraint to prevent it from being pushed by flooding water to prevent accidents such as asphyxiation and squeezing in the deployment of the buoyancy chamber the crews must evacuate from the area before gas inlet the buoyancy chamber will be constructed so that it can withstand the pressure of flooding in addition to prevent carbon dioxide leak from the buoyancy chamber a single directional valve should be considered in the gas injection site of the buoyancy chamber fig 3 shows the diagram of the buoyancy support system to use the high pressure carbon dioxide fire fighting system based on the existing fixed fire fighting system for ships to deploy the buoyancy chamber one should change the fire valve from the fire mode to the flood mode by using the existing remote valve control system in the machinery control room or the bridge table 5 shows the synthesis result of each function the buoyancy chamber deployment is assumed to take less than 2 min considering nfpa 2005 for the fixed fire fighting system because the gas inlet time is adjustable with the number of gas inlet nozzles and unit buoyancy chamber size in the computational simulation the effects of flooded water while the buoyancy chamber was deployed were not considered for the simulation the suitability of the designed pressure and flow rate was checked using the open source chemical process simulator dwsim dwsim fossee in in the simulation the temperature of the carbon dioxide inlet nozzle decreased to 80 3 degrees celsius thus the buoyancy chamber should consist of materials and structures that are not damaged by the rapid cooling effects during the carbon dioxide injection otherwise to prevent damages to the buoyancy chamber a heater was considered for the gas inlet system as shown in table 6 regarding the materials for the buoyancy chamber commercial pvc polyvinyl chloride which satisfies bs en 1876 1 1998 was considered at this time the nozzle specification and required number of carbon dioxide cylinders should be calculated considering the material and gas filling velocity of the buoyancy chamber one should also consider the allowable internal pressure of the buoyancy chambers and volume of injected carbon dioxide gas in this study the materials of the buoyancy chamber were assumed to satisfy iso 9650 3 2012 the carbon dioxide cylinders and nozzles of the fixed fire fighting system were assumed to satisfy iso 15738 2002 the pressure relief valve was assumed to be installed using pressure switches to prevent the pressure of the chamber from exceeding a certain level as shown in table 7 generally cylinders for liquefied carbon dioxide are designed to correspond to a normal pressure of approximately 57 65 bar with up to 45 50 kg capacity a cylinder with a diameter of 700 mm 2600 mm is required to carry 1 78 kg of carbon dioxide for a ton of buoyancy then one 50 kg commercial carbon dioxide cylinder is assumed to have 25 28 ton buoyancy with 90 filling rate in the machinery room compressed carbon dioxide should be discharged in 2 min nfpa 2005 for the necessary volume and number of the buoyancy chamber the capacity of the carbon dioxide inlet nozzles and number of cylinders can be easily modified 5 case study applicability check for target vessels 5 1 case 1 cargo vessel machinery room to check the applicability the effectiveness of the suggested buoyancy support system was simply checked using computational simulation methods as the suggested buoyancy support system has 3d shaped buoyancy chamber required volume of the buoyancy chamber to prevent or postpone sinking or capsizing of damaged ships should be checked in case of the machinery room generally permeability assumed as 0 85 means machineries have volume of 15 compare to whole space of machinery room solas 2009 except working spaces and small spaces which not appropriate for buoyancy chamber deployment abt 70 of machinery space will be available for buoyancy chamber deployment to check the effectiveness of machinery room in this study hanjin cheongjeong nuri which is a low level

situation which cause ship capsizing has considered a circular damage due to collision with bulbous bow of other ship has assumed with the diameter of 2 0 m above 2 5 m from the bottom of the ship in case of wave condition though real ship does not operate in such severe operating condition severe wave conditions has adopted to convince the effectiveness of the buoyancy support system for the simulation each compartments of the ship and loading conditions are temporarily set up based on the published design data of similar vessels fig 4 shows the ship modeling result using commercial ship

2010 table 9 shows the simulated damage cases regarding the entrance angle height and λ l of regular wave the waves used in the simulations are regular waves including beam sea entrance angle of 90 condition 3 conditions of 0 45 90 degrees of entrance angle are considered wave height has set to 3 m and 4 m to set the extremely severe environment generally the ship does not operate such in severe wave conditions wave length over ship length λ l has set from 1 406 to 3 164 as considering sea condition of korean onshore operation www khoa go kr wave frequency has set to 1 0 hertz in the flooding simulation results only two of 30 cases cases no 14 and 17 were capsized in the rough sea condition simulation as shown in table 9 to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed concept of the buoyancy support system this study applied the suggested design concept to case 14 which was the most severe case with a wave height of 3 m where the ship is most likely not to sail in an actual situation fig 5 shows the simulation result of the damaged ship as a function of time when the buoyancy chamber unfolds with 0 a 30 b 50 c and 70 d of its volume compared to the inner space of the machinery room the buoyancy chamber assumed that can be inflated in 120 s as follow the requirements of nfpa 2005 in the simulation specific 3 dimensional shape of the buoyancy chamber has not been considered only total volume of the buoyancy chamber compare to machinery room permeability 0 85 has considered as 0 30 50 and 70 of machinery room space in this study air compression and air flows related to flooding and expanding buoyancy chamber have not been considered the results show that capsizing from flooding can be prevented when the buoyancy chamber is unfolded to approximately 70 of the room space from the simulation the marginal time for buoyancy chamber inflation was assumed as 450 sec 7 5 min from fig 5 suggested buoyancy support system has possibility to prevent or postpone capsizing in the simulation level however for other cargo ships such as oil tankers the suggested concept is only applicable to empty tanks because the deployment of a buoyancy chamber in the oil filled tank can worsen the problems by pushing oil spill 5 2 case 2 ro ro ferry car deck in case of a passenger ship particularly a ro ro line there are car decks along the entire ship length thus when the car deck is submerged a dangerous situation can occur because car deck submerging causes excessive hull behavior change and capsizing however in most normal ship operations because every ship obeys safe rules and regulations and have all required equipment facilities for safe navigation catastrophic accidents such as costa concordia and sewol will not occur from real accident data violating rules such as overloading with less ballast water condition can cause loss of necessary stability of a ship when excessive ship motion occurs if heavy loads such as containers and vehicles are not properly lashed a sudden movement of the loads can cause unexpected change in ship motion and capsizing with this understanding a simulation was performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed buoyancy support system for the ro ro ferry mv sewol of table 10 for the flooding simulation the ship model mv sewol of gyeong joong lee 2015 has used in this simulation the ship and opening conditions were set as follow simulation report of kriso 2014 as roughly shown in fig 6 the ship has rear ramps which assumed to have gap of 0 01 m and opened doors a slope between c d car deck a hole for lift and stairs and engine casing holes are considered as openings to get the similar accident case back it is assumed that the transverse center of gravity of the model ship has moved 0 27 m in the direction of the y axis due to movement of poorly lashed heavy loads kg distance between keel and longitudinal center of gravity has assumed as 4 24 m for the computational simulation air compressibility has accounted air flow routes has modeled with air passage not to block water flow entirely for flooding analysis between compartments orifice model lee 2014a b has adopted in case of flooded water dynamics model quasi static methods has adopted center of gravity of flooded water considered to affect the ship s behavior fig 7 shows modeling result of compartments and rooms using napa as same as previous case study only total volume of the buoyancy chamber compare to d car deck space has considered as 0 30 50 and 70 the buoyancy chamber assumed that can be inflated in 120 s in the simulation beam sea to stbd starboard directional regular wave has adopted then wave height of 1 0m with λ l of 1 0 with a time step 0 02 s has set as same as previous case study compressed air flow correlated between the expanding buoyancy chamber and flooding water has not considered as shown in fig 8 a the inclined vessel was capsized as time goes at beam sea directional regular waves of 1 0m significant wave height the limited conditions in the simulation should be considered but the deployment of the buoyancy chamber with 30 volume of the d car deck space fig 8 b shows limited possibility of the target vessel to prevent capsizing however in real cases because many variables cannot be considered in the simulation we only ensure the possibility of that the time to capsizing can be delayed with the suggested buoyancy support system to secure sufficient evacuation and rescue time generally the car deck is sufficiently high to operate the suggested buoyancy support system even when various types of vehicles are loaded because the weights of vehicles are strictly controlled the car deck is rarely filled with a huge truck that can reach the ceiling it shall also be considered that the use of carbon dioxide can be restricted in the car deck space to prevent suffocation for these reason to apply the suggested buoyancy support system to actual ships some guidance and regulation will be required to properly arrange vehicles and make space for the buoyancy support system operation 6 complementing technologies and further considerations suggested buoyancy support system has pros in ship performance technical complexity maintainability in abstract level comparison for buoyancy support suggested system has no added mass which affects the ship resistance performance like as sponson and ducktail existing fixed fire fighting system basis system configuration has pros in technical complexity and ship remodeling cost for installation compare to foam resin maintainability and cost inner ship basis buoyancy chamber has pros for routine examine and maintenance compare to eu fp7 project susy after recovering damage suggested buoyancy support can be helpful for rapid drain and restart of major equipment for return to port so the suggested buoyancy support system meet the requirements and fulfill the functions of 2 requirement analysis and 3 functional analysis and allocation under the boundaries of the business model however despite the new technology proposed the value of existing concepts for buoyancy support are still stands those alternatives will be chosen taking into consideration its applicability and economic feasibility when we consider the actual ship operation of the suggested concept of the buoyancy support system the system should be operated as a means of supporting the contingency plan for this previous study for survivability assessment lee et al 2005 and vessel triage nordström et al 2016 are considerable in case of modern cruise ships and naval vessels which have enhanced accident response system so called dcs damage control system or ipms integrated platform management systems suggested buoyancy support system can be merged into that systems to response emergency situation as follow systematic accident response scenarios so called kill cards when using the buoyancy support system as carbon dioxide has the cooling and suffocation effect so any personnel of the compartment shall be evacuated before use as same as fixed carbon dioxide fire fighting system though there are many previous studies about decision support systems and methods which use the results of flooding simulations jasionowski 2011 pennanen et al 2015 ruponen et al 2017 calabrese et al 2012 the needs of buoyancy support system and timing of system operation should follow the ship s contingency plan and decision of the captain as follow the requirements of relevant rules regulations and is not considered for use when crews can respond to flooding with conventional water proof measures in addition in case of naval vessels the buoyancy support system can be disabled if an inside the hull explosion happened if there is a possibility of injuries in the compartment the use of buoyancy support system also should be limited the buoyancy support system can be used only if the existing water tight closures make it difficult to control flooding accidents and the ship has high possibility of sinking or capsizing for effective decision making of buoyancy chamber inflation various decision support information needs to be utilized and such dcs and ipms may help since that kind of system serve decision support function 7 conclusions in this study a new and original concept for buoyancy support systems has been studied for damaged ships to mitigate the catastrophic consequence of capsizing and inoperability of the main equipment because of flooding the pros and cons of existing buoyancy support systems were examined then based on the system engineering based design process to consider various related issues including technical and economic issues in the design process a business model is used as a form of system analysis and control tool then the designed buoyancy support system has technical and economic benefits compared to previous concepts because the suggested buoyancy support system uses the existing fire fighting system as a gas inlet system for the buoyancy chamber and the buoyancy system is applicable to complex inner ship spaces with 3 dimensional geometry based on 3d laser scan data the applicability of the suggested system was checked using computational flooding and ship motion analysis simulation in abstract level however the research results do not include applications to a real ship and applicability such as empty cargo holds so additional studies are required including actual ship basis prototype building and tests in the near future acknowledgement this research was supported by a grant from the endowment project of a basic research on next generation energy transportation technology based on safety performance improvement technology centered on modular natural

23502,although the number of marine accidents has gradually decreased fatal ones continue to occur to prevent huge losses of life environment and property there are sufficient laws rules and regulations which include many technical solutions notably many solutions for damaged ships are suggested to prevent capsizing and sinking however many pioneering ideas for damaged ships remain at the conception level because of the lack of technical and economic feasibility to have both technical and economic feasibility in the design process in this study a business model adopted design process has been considered using this design process a new concept for buoyancy support systems is studied which considers the technical and economic matters in the design process in addition a fixed fire fighting system and 3d laser scan data basis 3 dimensional buoyancy support system are been studied to convince the usability of the suggested concept computational simulation was used at the abstract level because there can be thousands of damage scenarios for a ship sampled catastrophic damage scenarios are used in the case study to confirm the possibility of the suggested concept of buoyancy support systems keywords buoyancy support stability buoyancy support fixed fire fighting system flooding 3d laser scan 1 introduction and background every ship is designed and built according to the rules and regulations to enable each ship to be prepared for various marine accidents it is also furnished with the safety equipment and facilities required by safety of life at sea solas imo 2009 imo has continued to make concerted efforts to improve ship safety in efforts to prevent a vessel from sinking due to flooding of accidents very valuable results are now available including guidelines for flooding detection system on passenger ship imo msc 2009 guidelines on safe return to port for passenger ships imo sdc 2015 guidelines on harmonized aeronautical and maritime search and rescue procedures including sar training matters imo ncsr 2016 with these meaningful efforts the best way to ensure a safe voyage of vessels is to comply with relevant laws and regulations nevertheless studies of technological alternatives to reduce human lives the environment and property damages in the event of an unexpected accident is still in progress in cases of marine accidents such as collisions and groundings excessive damage and flooding cause the ship to sink capsize or impede the use of its essential navigation equipment as ship has watertight bulkheads doors hatches and other means the consequence of flooding accident usually can be mitigated in early phase of an accident but in some excessive damaged case the operation of the essential equipment that is crucial for sailing such as the navigation radar or generator can be becomes impossible kang et al 2013 in addition the progressive flooding after the excessive accident can cause sinking or capsizing of the ship to counter these problems many pioneering studies are in progress such as research to avoid parametric roll bačkalov et al 2016 studies of numerical prediction of damage ship stability papanikolaou and spanos 2004 and papanikolaou 2007 improvement of ship stability and safety in damaged condition through operational measures boulougouris et al 2016 and onboard damage control system dcs and an incident management system ims shafie pour and sajdak 2015 in addition several concepts of the buoyancy support system that is attached to the outer hull in the forms of sponson and ducktail for passenger vessel have been applied to fulfill solas 95 which is called stockholm agreement vassalos and papanikolaou 2002 the inner ship structure that prevents the ship from losing its stability has also been introduced by research projects such as eu fp7 project susy surfacing system for ship recovery for cargo vessels smith et al 2011 and the foam resin based on damage stability recovery system dsrs vassalos et al 2016 for an inner hull buoyancy support system sharp bumps such as brackets with complicated geometrical shapes in the hull can damage the buoyancy chamber during inflation for foam resin reusability of essential equipment for safe return to port have to be considered the additional requirements to install the gas or foam resin valves nozzles and control systems such as sensors power and data lines worsen the applicability of the concept when the buoyancy support system is installed outside the ship additional consideration for lack of lifetime maintainability should also be considered because the buoyancy support system is exposed to sunlight and salty sea breeze to enhance damaged ships safety design alternatives for buoyancy support should be considered not only from technical but also economic feasibility for this reason in this paper alternatives for buoyancy support system has studied more in detail from the initial concept which has been introduced as a proceeding at prads 2016 kang and choi 2016 based on the buoyancy support function an alternative has studied that could be used at an acceptable cost without degradation of the vessel s performance applicability to a variety of vessels and the life cycle maintenance were also considered 2 requirement analysis the technology to be developed must be analyzed for technical and economic feasibility to put the previously proposed concepts into practical use and identify them as requirements of the new concept design the system engineering basis design process applied for various meaningful requirement analyses because the buoyancy support systems of previous research have relatively simple configurations the roll of the buoyancy support system has been reanalyzed as requirements for the new system as shown in table 1 when we consider these requirements for the practical use of the technical concepts for buoyancy support systems the measure of effectiveness moe can be set to secure the utility of the developed technology based on the results from requirement analysis measures of performance mop and technical performance measures tpms to determine and support the key performance parameters kpps in table 2 in the design process the suggested tpms of table 2 must be obtained for moe kpp and mop to reach each goal of tpms through the design process all technical economic and other related matters should be consistently and intuitively considered thus during the establishment of the development technology based on the identified tpm a business model is used as a system analysis and control tool kang et al 2014 table 3 shows the business model for the designing system configuration 3 functional analysis and allocation in terms of tpm1 which corresponded to r1 function f1 was set to maintain the stability of the ship by inflating the buoyancy chamber to secure the operability of the essential sailing equipment such as the navigation radar the ability of function f1 to maintain stability must be controlled in the range that would not damage the operability of equipment even when the roll angle is changed because of flooding because of its potential damage in terms of tpm2 which corresponded to r2 function f2 was applied to secure the working space for damage control in flooding areas even when the buoyancy chamber was unfolded in terms of tpm3 for r3 f3 was set as the inner hull installation function table 4 shows the function list configuration to accept the requirement analysis results the proposed required function list is meant to satisfy the requirements and must be synthesized within the boundary of the business model 4 synthesis the buoyancy support system of function f1 must minimize the need of remodeling the ship not extend beyond the category of infra channel of the business model and fulfill the task by offering the preparatory buoyancy of value to the stakeholder of the business model the configured buoyancy chamber must have the sufficient volume to secure the buoyancy of the inner hull to retain the ability of function f2 which provides the working space the passage and workspace must also be secured for the worker to waterproof the damage area after inflating the buoyancy chamber the complicated geometrical shape of the buoyancy support system operation area and the equipment operability must also be considered therefore the shape of the buoyancy chamber should be configured so that it does not interfere with the inner hull structure but secures the passage and workspace for the worker as an alternative the use of 3d point cloud data can be considered yoon et al 2015 fig 1 shows the concept of installation of a 3 dimensional shaped buoyancy chamber which uses 3d laser scanning data in the inner hull because the ship charterage loss and dry dock fee for the suggested system installation are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars per day the developed buoyancy support system must be installed during the loading or unloading periods when the ship is anchored at the port of call it must also be secured to satisfy the required installability and operability therefore to exclude the necessity to install the additional buoyancy chamber inflating gas tanks pipes and nozzles with power and data line for system control the study considers using the fixed fire fighting system which is pre installed inside a ship for the inlet gas using fixed fire fighting system for the buoyancy chamber carbon dioxide nitrogen and foam can be considered however in this paper carbon dioxide is considered in terms of storage efficiency the use of the carbon dioxide fire fighting system for the buoyancy support system considers that fire and flooding accidents historically do not commonly occur together however in that case the fixed fire fighting system should consider the urgency of each accident situation for the selective or concurrent use with certain limitation fig 2 shows the 3d shaped buoyancy chamber configuration concept using the carbon dioxide fire fighting system the folded buoyancy chamber can be located in the ceiling or other free space in the ship for the buoyancy inflation time and maintainability the chamber may consist of several to a dozen of sub chambers depending on the number of nozzles and their locations the deployed buoyancy chamber should be able to be fixed in the hull using electromagnets or restraint to prevent it from being pushed by flooding water to prevent accidents such as asphyxiation and squeezing in the deployment of the buoyancy chamber the crews must evacuate from the area before gas inlet the buoyancy chamber will be constructed so that it can withstand the pressure of flooding in addition to prevent carbon dioxide leak from the buoyancy chamber a single directional valve should be considered in the gas injection site of the buoyancy chamber fig 3 shows the diagram of the buoyancy support system to use the high pressure carbon dioxide fire fighting system based on the existing fixed fire fighting system for ships to deploy the buoyancy chamber one should change the fire valve from the fire mode to the flood mode by using the existing remote valve control system in the machinery control room or the bridge table 5 shows the synthesis result of each function the buoyancy chamber deployment is assumed to take less than 2 min considering nfpa 2005 for the fixed fire fighting system because the gas inlet time is adjustable with the number of gas inlet nozzles and unit buoyancy chamber size in the computational simulation the effects of flooded water while the buoyancy chamber was deployed were not considered for the simulation the suitability of the designed pressure and flow rate was checked using the open source chemical process simulator dwsim dwsim fossee in in the simulation the temperature of the carbon dioxide inlet nozzle decreased to 80 3 degrees celsius thus the buoyancy chamber should consist of materials and structures that are not damaged by the rapid cooling effects during the carbon dioxide injection otherwise to prevent damages to the buoyancy chamber a heater was considered for the gas inlet system as shown in table 6 regarding the materials for the buoyancy chamber commercial pvc polyvinyl chloride which satisfies bs en 1876 1 1998 was considered at this time the nozzle specification and required number of carbon dioxide cylinders should be calculated considering the material and gas filling velocity of the buoyancy chamber one should also consider the allowable internal pressure of the buoyancy chambers and volume of injected carbon dioxide gas in this study the materials of the buoyancy chamber were assumed to satisfy iso 9650 3 2012 the carbon dioxide cylinders and nozzles of the fixed fire fighting system were assumed to satisfy iso 15738 2002 the pressure relief valve was assumed to be installed using pressure switches to prevent the pressure of the chamber from exceeding a certain level as shown in table 7 generally cylinders for liquefied carbon dioxide are designed to correspond to a normal pressure of approximately 57 65 bar with up to 45 50 kg capacity a cylinder with a diameter of 700 mm 2600 mm is required to carry 1 78 kg of carbon dioxide for a ton of buoyancy then one 50 kg commercial carbon dioxide cylinder is assumed to have 25 28 ton buoyancy with 90 filling rate in the machinery room compressed carbon dioxide should be discharged in 2 min nfpa 2005 for the necessary volume and number of the buoyancy chamber the capacity of the carbon dioxide inlet nozzles and number of cylinders can be easily modified 5 case study applicability check for target vessels 5 1 case 1 cargo vessel machinery room to check the applicability the effectiveness of the suggested buoyancy support system was simply checked using computational simulation methods as the suggested buoyancy support system has 3d shaped buoyancy chamber required volume of the buoyancy chamber to prevent or postpone sinking or capsizing of damaged ships should be checked in case of the machinery room generally permeability assumed as 0 85 means machineries have volume of 15 compare to whole space of machinery room solas 2009 except working spaces and small spaces which not appropriate for buoyancy chamber deployment abt 70 of machinery space will be available for buoyancy chamber deployment to check the effectiveness of machinery room in this study hanjin cheongjeong nuri which is a low level

23503,duration of cargo operation loading or discharging is of paramount importance for ship owners and port managers since idle time at terminal significantly boost to the cost of providing shipping service hence it is important to choose the appropriate shiploader type for handling bulk materials this paper aims to present a comprehensive multi criteria decision making mcdm method extended by

preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis under it2fss environment to overcome more of the uncertainty of experts judgement and expression in decision making the proposed approach adopts a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of key performance indicator kpi under numerous conditions besides its robust theoretical background this paper prompts practical benefits to decision makers port owners or port managers who make investment decision for appropriate shiploader type in dry bulk cargo shipment keywords maritime transportation shiploader decision making sensitivity analysis interval type 2 fuzzy sets 1 introduction maritime transportation is of critical importance in terms of economic development to countries since almost 80 percent of the world trade is carried by sea unctad 2015 particularly liquid and solid bulk cargo shipments constitutes by far the most important means of goods a considerable amount of liquid and solid bulk cargoes such as grain coal iron ore crude oil petrochemical products etc are carried by ships around the world in this context efficient port operations are necessary to ensure continuous trade and to avoid congestion at berth specifically dry bulk cargo terminals have to meet these requirements since numerous significant operations such as cargo loading cargo discharging shifting or cargo lashing are undertaken specific equipment such as shiploaders are used to improve cargo handling efficiency safe cargo operation and environment friendly operation at dry bulk cargo terminals there are four types of shiploaders fix loader radial loader parallel travelling loader and mobile loader which are capable of improving the efficiency of dry bulk cargo flows by offering different perspective akyuz and celik 2016a although a wide range of studies on cargo operation efficiency have been conducted in the past years those dedicated to shiploaders have remained very limited most of studies related to shiploaders were

nazari and durack 2007 hadianfard and hadianfard 2007 the studies have tendency to focus on more specific case rather than systematic approach however most of ship owners and port managers are seeking systematic approaches which enable to enhance efficiency of cargo handling process although there have been various researches undertaken on container cargo loaders wang et al 2016 yang and lin 2013 imai et al 2013 a particular approach to guide decision makers who make investment decision for appropriate shiploader type in dry bulk cargo shipment has not been introduced yet to remedy the gap this paper aims to introduce a methodological approach utilising ahp and topsis under it2fss environment which is able to deal with uncertainty of experts judgement and expression in decision making the proposed approach is capable of analysing performance of dry bulk cargo shiploaders from the perspective of their operational and technical indicators a sensitivity analysis is performed to gain insight into how the changes can affect outcomes within the fuzzy logic concept in this context the paper is organised as follows this section outlines the general perspective as well as the aim and scope of the paper the next section introduces methodologies and shows how proposed approach is generated in section three choosing the right shiploader for handling dry bulk materials as a case study is used to illustrate the practicality of the proposed approach the final section gives conclusion remarks and future researches in light of the above outline the next section presents theoretical framework of the proposed approach accordingly 2 research methodology this section initially describes theoretical background of methods used in proposed approach 2 1 interval type 2 fuzzy sets type 2 fuzzy sets are firstly introduced by zadeh 1975 as an extension of the concept of a type 1 fuzzy sets karnik and mendel 2001 mendel 2007 type 2 fuzzy sets can represent more uncertainty mendel et al 2006 and can produce more accurate and robust results dereli and altun 2013 dereli et al 2011 while type 2 fuzzy sets have more design degrees of freedom than interval type 2 fuzzy sets castillo and melin 2012 interval type 2 fuzzy sets are used by most of applications because the calculations are easier to apply mendel 2007 the interval type 2 fuzzy sets are applied in the real world mcdm problems celik et al 2014a b 2015 soner et al 2017 in this section basic definitions type 2 fuzzy sets and it2fss are presented mendel et al 2006 chen and lee 2010 celik et al 2014a b celik and gumus 2015 akyuz and celik 2016b soner et al 2017 definition 1 a type 2 fuzzy set a in the universe of discourse x can be represented by a type 2 membership function μ a shown as follows a x u μ a x u x x u j x 0 1 0 μ a x u 1 where j x denotes an interval in 0 1 moreover the type 2 fuzzy set a also can be represented as follows a x x u j x μ a x u x u where j x 0 1 and denotes union over all admissible x and u definition 2 let a be a type 2 fuzzy set in the universe of discourse x represented by the type 2 membership function μ a if all μ a x u 1 then a is called as an interval type 2 fuzzy set an interval type 2 fuzzy set a can be regarded as a special case of a type 2 fuzzy set represented as follows a x x u j x 1 x u where j x 0 1 definition 3 the upper membership function and the lower membership function of an interval type 2 fuzzy set are type 1 membership functions respectively in this paper we present a method using interval type 2 fuzzy sets for handling fuzzy multiple attributes group decision making problems where the reference points and the heights of the upper and the lower membership functions of interval type 2 fuzzy sets are used to characterize interval

problems using both qualitative and quantitative criteria measurement akyuz et al 2015 it has been widely applied in various disciplines akyuz 2015a ho 2008 however it is common for real world decision makers to use linguistic variables to evaluate the ratings of various criteria and alternatives chen 2000 linguistic values are frequently represented by fuzzy numbers akyuz 2016 buckley 1985 integrates interval type 1 fuzzy sets with ahp for considering uncertainty several useful extensions have been developed to enhance the ahp under it2fss kahraman et al 2014 also extended ahp based on it2fss using new ranking method for supplier selection problem celik et al 2014a b also proposed ahp under it2fss for evaluating critical success factors in humanitarian relief logistics abdullah and najib 2014 developed a new type 2 fuzzy set of linguistic variables for evaluation of work safety and early warning rating of hot and humid environments cevik onar et al 2014 used ahp under it2fss for determining of the weights of the strategic decision factors oztaysi 2015 used ahp under it2fss for erp enterprise resource planning selection problem the important criteria in emergency department is determined using ahp based on the it2fss gul et al 2016 in this paper we implemented ahp based on it2fss to obtain importance for weights of key performance indicators the steps of proposed approach are presented as follows step 1 the pairwise comparisons are consulted to the expert for the key performance indicator using linguistic variables step 2 the consistency of the fuzzy pair wise comparison is analyzed in this step if the result of the pairwise comparison matrix a is consistent then the result of the interval type 2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix a is also consistent a consistency ratio cr of 0 1 or less is considered as acceptable the cr is calculated to measure how consistent the judgements have been relative to large samples of purely random judgements if the cr is bigger than 0 1 the judgements are considered untrustworthy in this step the center of area defuzzification method kahraman et al 2014 is used step 3 the pair wise comparison matrix is constructed under it2fss among key performance indicators the linguistic terms are presented in table 1 1 a 1 a 12 a 1 m a 21 1 a 2 m a m 1 a m 2 1 1 a 12 a 1 m 1 a 12 1 a 2 m 1 a 1 m 1 a 2 m 1 where 1 a i j 1 a

it2fss and actual data topsis one of the classical multicriteria decision making mcdm methods was proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 it is based on the concept that chosen the best alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the farthest from the negative ideal solution nis for solving a mcdm problem celik et al 2016 it is used effectively different application areas two extensive literature review on topsis approach are presented by behzadian et al 2012 and zavadskas et al 2016 the seven steps of the procedure of topsis approach under it2fss environment and actual data are presented as follows step 1 two evaluation matrix is constructed consisting of m alternatives and n key performance indicators o p n o p n with intersection of each alternative and key performance indicators given as x i j and y i j we therefore have a matrix x i j m o and y i j m p in this step the linguistic variable and corresponding it2f is presented in table 2 step 2 the data is normalized for calculating the normalize decision matrix in this paper the normalization technique is applied for the data the normalized value r i j is calculated as follows 6 r i j y i j i 1 m y i j 2 step 3 the weighted normalized decision matrix is calculated the weighted normalized value is calculated as 7 v i j x i j x w j where w j is the weight of the j t h key performance indicators j 1 o 8 v i j r i j x w j where w j is the weight of the j t h key performance indicators j o 1 n step 4 based on eq 9 the defuzzified value of the interval type 2 fuzzy set w c

14 c c i d i d i d i step 8 the preference order is ranked for ranking alternatives using this index we can rank alternatives in decreasing order the best optimal alternative can now be decided with respect to the preference rank order of c c i therefore the best alternative is the one that has the shortest distance to the ideal solution hwang and yoon 1981 2 4 proposed approach it2fahp topsis in this section the proposed methodology is presented to guide the decision makers port owners or port managers who will make investment decision for appropriate shiploader type in dry bulk cargo shipment the ahp and topsis under it2fss environment and actual data is applied and systematic procedure is followed fig 2 shows flow chart of the proposed approach the proposed approach consists of two main steps in the first step the importance weights of key performance indicators kpis is determining based on the unbiased experts opinions which describes kpis in the second step calculated importance weights of the kpis are used as input data for the topsis under it2fss environment based on the results obtained from the first step the performance of dry bulk cargo shiploaders is evaluated from their operational and technical aspects 3 application shiploader selection in dry bulk cargo terminals the proposed approach is applied to select appropriate shiploader type in maritime transportation by assessing performance indicators in operational and technical aspects 3 1 problem statement a shiploader is kind of a special equipment ensuring continuous loading of dry bulk cargo into ship s cargo hold and performance of it plays a key role in reducing idle time at port also shiploader ensures cargo handling efficiency inadequate shiploader can cause huge delay at port bimco 2014 there are certain vulnerabilities such as low cargo loading rate continuous mechanical failure insufficient physical endurance high energy consumption high emission failure frequency etc for shiploaders in order to minimize aforementioned deficiencies and speed up the operation process port owners or port managers must decide to select the right shiploader for handling dry bulk materials since there are a wide range of critical factors that need to be thoroughly evaluated when selecting the proper process and associated equipment for handling dry bulk cargoes this paper brings a methodological solution to guide the decision makers during selecting right type of shiploader in maritime transportation industry 3 2 analysis of respondents an expert judgement can be a good solution in problem solving and decision making due to the lack of data in maritime transportation industry akyuz 2015b the expert judgement is considered as input in the presence of a large number of options in decision making three dry bulk cargo terminals which are equipped with different size modern shiploaders cooperatively provided data and expert opinions for the purposes of this article there are nine shiploaders at terminal four of them are parallel loaders one is radial loader one is fix loader and the rest are mobile loaders in order to reflect opinion of shipowner two prestigious dry bulk cargo shipping companies were visited the companies have different size bulk carrier ship fleets the experts details are provided in table 3 surveys were performed with port managers as well as ship superintendents since they have sufficient experience and knowledge 3 3 key performance indicators key performance indicators are used to evaluate performance of dry bulk cargo shiploaders from their operational and technical aspects there are mainly four different types of shiploaders used in dry bulk cargo terminals table 4 gives brief descriptions of the shiploaders akyuz and celik 2016a b ics 2011 a wide range of kpis in terms of operational and technical aspects are ascertained in the view of experts table 5 shows kpis for instance loading capacity i6 is one of the substantial kpi to measure performance of the shiploader since high loading rate is essential to meet customer requirements likewise environment friendly operation i7 is another kpi which addressing minimum impact on the environment by reducing dust and emissions reliability of shiploader i9 is of paramount importance and expectation is to complete cargo handling without failure breaks of equipment 3 4 data collection considering the importance selection of the appropriate shiploader in dry bulk cargo terminals this paper is supported with data obtain from observation versus manufacturing performance data and linguistic statements the data i2 i6 i7 i8 were collected by reviewing records of dry bulk cargo terminal related documents and correspondence communication with experts on the other hand linguistic data i1 i3 i4 i5 i9 were received from the view of seven experts since terminals were not willing to share their data due to commercial reason therefore the authors used fuzzy logic to address problems in which data of indicators are imprecise and vague 3 5 selecting of the appropriate shiploader type it2fahp is applied to analyze the kpis for prioritization the importance weight of each indicator is obtained by using it2fahp seven experts from the dry bulk cargo terminal and ship owner company used a nine point scale as shown in table 1 to evaluate the kpis the result of the pair wise comparisons of the kpis evaluation was performed by seven experts using eq 1 the consistency of the fuzzy pair wise comparison is analyzed by using the center of area coa defuzzification method kahraman et al 2014 celik and akyuz 2016 according to the defuzzified evaluation matrix the consistency ratio for each expert and aggregated evaluation matrix for main criteria is calculated as 0 054 0 027 0 077 0 033 and 0 096 respectively the comparison results are consistent because of the cr value of each expert and aggregated evaluation is less than 0 10 the aggregated type 2 fuzzy evaluation matrix for the factors weights is obtained it is presented in table 6 the type 2 fuzzy geometric means of the factors are obtained in step 3 byusing eq 2 for example the geometric mean of the first row is calculated as follows r 1 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 15 a 16 a 17 a 18 a 19 1 n 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 9 0 9 0 24 0 33 0 33 0 55 1 1 0 28 0 33 0 33 0 41 0 9 0 9 0 82 1 15

12 1 12 1 6 1 1 0 89 1 12 1 12 1 35 0 9 0 9 0 88 1 24 1 24 1 71 1 1 1 05 1 24 1 24 1 45 0 9 0 9 1 08 1 55 1 55 2 07 1 1 1 31 1 55 1 55 1 8 0 9 0 9 1 9 0 58 0 8 0 8 1 12 1 1 0 69 0 8 0 8 0 94 0 9 0 9 the type 2 fuzzy weights are calculated using eq 3 for example the type 2 fuzzy weight of the first row i1 is calculated as follows w 1 r 1 r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 r 9 1 0 58 0 8 0 8 1 12 1 1 0 69 0 8 0 8 0 94 0 9 0 9 1 75 2 37 2 37 3 02 1 1 2 06 2 37 2 37 2 68 0 9 0 9 0 49 0 73 0 73 1 09 1 1 0 6 0 73 0 73 0 88 0 9 0 9 1 2 1 73 1 73 2 33 1 1 1 46 1 73 1 73 2 01 0 9 0 9 0 85 1 2 1 2 1 65 1 1 1 02 1 2 1 2 1 4 0 9 0 9 2 07 2 78 2 78 3 49 1 1 2 43 2 78 2 78 3 13 0 9 0 9 0 56 0 77 0 77 1 06 1 1 0 66 0 77 0 77 0 89 0 9 0 9 0 97 1 4 1 4 1 91 1 1 1 19 1 4 1 4 1 64 0 9 0 9 0 38 0 51 0 51 0 72 1 1 0 44 0 51 0 51 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 0 04 0 07 0 07 0 13 1 1 0 05 0 07 0 07 0 09 0 9 0 9 following the same process the type 2 fuzzy weights of the other kpis for prioritization are calculated as shown in the second row of table 7 the if2fss is defuzzified by using center of area method kahraman et al 2014 celik and akyuz 2016 obtaining weights of each criterion using eq 4 for example the defuzzified weights of the first row is calculated as follows d e f u z z i f i e d w 1 0 13 0 04 1 0 07 0 04 1 0 07 0 04 4 0 04 0 09 0 05 0 9 0 09 0 07 0 9 0 09 0 07 4 0 05 2 d e f u z z i f i e d w 1 0 068 the crisp weights of technical and operational evaluation criteria are normalized using eq 5 for example the normalized weight of the first row is also computed as follows w 1 d e f u z z i f i e d w 1 j 1 n 9 d e f u z z i f i e d w j w 1 0 068 0 068 0 197 0 063 0 146 0 102 0 231 0 065 0 118 0 044 w 1 0 0662 the results of the it2fahp are presented in table 7 additionally the weights of 9 key performance indicators are ranked with respect to the normalized weights while loading capacity i6 is determined as the most important kpi based on experts evaluation power fuel consumption i2 and physical endurance i4 are determined as the second and third in this paper topsis method is used to decide what kind of shiploader type is the appropriate for dry bulk cargo terminals the proposed approach is based on it2fss linguistic and numeric data since the port managers of dry bulk cargo terminals were not willing to share data due to commercial reason some of the kpis installation cost versatility physical endurance cost efficiency are evaluated by experts by using linguistics variables presented in table 2 the others power fuel consumption loading capacity co2 emission environment friendly operation reliability were obtained from the terminals table 8 is showing the linguistic and numeric data evaluations obtained from the terminals and experts according to the evaluation of experts the aggregated interval type 2 fuzzy numbers and numeric data is presented in table 9 then the numeric data is normalized by using eq 6 and the results are presented in table 10 furthermore the weighted type 2 fuzzy performance values of the shiploader are calculated by multiplying the importance weights of the kpis under type 2 fuzzy performance values table 11 in this step the importance weights of each kpi is obtained by using it2fahp the defuzzified value of the interval type 2 fuzzy set are calculated for obtaining the defuzzified weighted decision matrix by using eq 9 the positive ideal and negative ideal solution is determined by using eq 10 and eq 11 accordingly the results are presented in table 12 then the distances of each alternative from the positive ideal solution pis and the negative ideal solution nis are calculated by using eq 12 and eq 13 table 13 shows distance form pis and nis finally the closeness coefficient eq 14 is calculated for ranking the shiploader types table 14 3 6 sensitivity analysis the concept of sensitivity analysis investigates the impact of kpi with the proposed ahp and topsis under it2fss linguistic environment and numeric data to validate the outcomes twelve cases are generated as indicated in table 15 the first case indicates the current importance weights for the kpi the case 2 is generated as allocating the lowest weight wwc to all criteria in order to analyze critical indicators of the ship loaders and then the medium weights are considered in the case 3 the cases from 4 to 12 are generated as allocating the highest weight to specific kpis and the lowest weight to the rest of the kpis the closeness coefficients and rankings of twelve cases are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 respectively it is observed that different ranking of the shiploader are obtained for instance s1 has the best performance indicators in eight cases likewise s4 shows the best performance in three cases on the other hand s2 has only the best performance in one case case 11 this shows that there are significant effect of the key performance indicators on selecting appropriate shiploader type in maritime transportation the first change in ranking is observed when the weight of installation cost i1 is increased to the highest weight and the rest set up to the lowest it can be concluded that installation cost i1 physical endurance i5 reliability i8 and user friendly i9 have a positive impact on performance indicators of ship loaders in maritime transportation according to the sensitivity analysis this research finds that the proposed approach can produce satisfactory result and provide proper information to assist executers in the decision making problems 3 7 findings and discussion in the light of the outcomes parallel travelling shiploader s1 has the best performance criteria among the alternatives and loading capacity i6 is the most substantial indicator among the criteria in most of the twelve cases investigated based on fig 3 the shiploader should be operated up to maximum cargo loading capacity to complete the ship on time otherwise huge amount of demurrage may emerge due to the delay of ship considering the generic outcomes parallel travelling shiploader apparently is the right shiploader type for handling dry bulk materials based on fig 3 since it the most efficient machine to operate compared to the other designs from the point of operational management setup time among the cargo holds is reduced as much as possible therefore minimizing idle time of the ship and maximising throughput of cargo in parallel loader operation since commercial activity is one of the sustainable efficiency for the ship owners parallel loader provides quicker ship turnaround and decreases demurrage fees on the other hand according to the fig 3 the performance of shiploader may change in accordance with different situations according to the case 4 for instance mobile shiploader s4 has the best performance indicators in case installation cost i1 is considered as the most critical criteria and the rest is considered as equal or less importance at this point mobile shiploader can be selected by dry bulk cargo terminal executives who care about installation cost initially likewise in case 8 parallel shiploader can be the best alternatives if the cost efficiency become the most important criteria according to the case 6 parallel slightly better and mobile shiploaders can be the best choice in case versatility i3 is considered as the most important criteria and the rest is considered as equal or less importance in this context parallel and mobile loader can be selected by dry bulk cargo terminal executives who care about versatility initially considering case 11 radial shiploader s3 has the best performance in case environment friendly operation i7 is considered as the most crucial criteria and the rest is considered as equal or less importance at this point radial shiploader can be a good alternative for dry bulk cargo terminals which strive for high efficiency with minimum impact through the environment since operational costs of the fix shiploader s3 is considerable high it is relatively insignificant when compared to other alternatives the outcomes of the study shows that the fix shiploader is not appropriate for most of dry bulk cargo terminals 4 conclusion this paper presented a research study to select the right shiploader type for handling dry bulk cargo in terminals since there are various critical factors affecting decision making process to accomplish this ahp and topsis methods were integrated under it2fss environment thus the it2fss can deal with more of the uncertainty of expert judgement and expression in decision making the paper was supported with sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of kpis in different conditions in the light of the outcomes it was observed that the parallel travelling shiploader is the right loader type for handling bulk materials in most cases moreover the finding showed that loading capacity is one of the main impact criteria as indicated by the data during choosing the right ship loader for handling bulk materials while there is a lack of empirical researches to handle uncertainty of human decision in evaluating the dry bulk cargo shiploaders this paper remedies a gap by offering a numeric research the findings of the research are highly welcomed by dry bulk cargo terminals professionals port owners and port managers when selecting the proper shiploader for handling dry bulk materials since the research provides a comprehensive insight it can be applicable to other industries such as aviation petrochemical construction software etc acknowledgment the author wishes to thank the reviewers and editor in charge for their very constructive feedback 
23503,duration of cargo operation loading or discharging is of paramount importance for ship owners and port managers since idle time at terminal significantly boost to the cost of providing shipping

makers port owners or port managers who make investment decision for appropriate shiploader type in dry bulk cargo shipment keywords maritime transportation shiploader decision making sensitivity analysis interval type 2 fuzzy sets 1 introduction maritime transportation is of critical importance in terms of economic development to countries since almost 80 percent of the world trade is carried by sea unctad 2015 particularly liquid and solid bulk cargo shipments constitutes by far the most important means of goods a considerable amount of liquid and solid bulk cargoes such as grain coal iron ore crude oil petrochemical products etc are carried by ships around the world in this context efficient port operations are necessary to ensure continuous trade and to avoid congestion at berth specifically dry bulk cargo terminals have to meet these requirements since numerous significant operations such as cargo loading cargo discharging shifting or cargo lashing are undertaken specific equipment such as shiploaders are used to improve cargo handling efficiency safe cargo operation and environment friendly operation at dry bulk cargo terminals there are four types of shiploaders fix loader radial loader parallel travelling loader and mobile loader which are capable of improving the efficiency of dry bulk cargo flows by offering different perspective akyuz and celik 2016a although a wide range of studies on cargo operation efficiency have been conducted in the past years those dedicated to shiploaders have remained very limited most of studies related to shiploaders were focused on the structural design liu and xue 2011 wheeler et al 2007 zhijian et al 2006 strength of the materials bin 2009 optimization wadhwa 2000 automatization mi et al 2015 or failure assessment nazari and durack 2007 hadianfard and hadianfard 2007 the studies have tendency to focus on more specific case rather than systematic approach however most of ship owners and port managers are seeking systematic approaches which enable to enhance efficiency of cargo handling process although there have been various researches undertaken on container cargo loaders wang et al 2016 yang and lin 2013 imai et al 2013 a particular approach to guide decision makers who make investment decision for appropriate shiploader type in dry bulk cargo shipment has not been introduced yet to remedy the gap this paper aims to introduce a methodological approach utilising ahp and topsis under it2fss environment which is able to deal with uncertainty of experts judgement and expression in decision making the proposed approach is capable of analysing performance of dry bulk cargo shiploaders from the perspective of their operational and technical indicators a sensitivity analysis is performed to gain insight into how the changes can affect outcomes within the fuzzy logic concept in this context the paper is organised as follows this section outlines the general perspective as well as the aim and scope of the paper the next section introduces methodologies and shows how proposed approach is generated in section three choosing the right shiploader for handling dry bulk materials as a case study

2006 and can produce more accurate and robust results dereli and altun 2013 dereli et al 2011 while type 2 fuzzy sets have more design degrees of freedom than interval type 2 fuzzy sets castillo and melin 2012 interval type 2 fuzzy sets are used by most of applications because the calculations are easier to apply mendel 2007 the interval type 2 fuzzy sets are applied in the real world mcdm problems celik et al 2014a b 2015 soner et al 2017 in this section basic definitions type 2 fuzzy sets and it2fss are presented mendel et al 2006 chen and lee 2010 celik et al 2014a b celik and gumus 2015 akyuz and celik 2016b soner et al 2017 definition 1 a type 2 fuzzy set a in the universe of discourse x can be represented by a type 2 membership function μ a shown as follows a x u μ a x u x x u j x 0 1 0 μ a x u 1 where j x denotes an interval in 0 1 moreover the type 2 fuzzy set a also can be represented as follows a x x u j x μ a x u x u where j x 0 1 and denotes union over all admissible x and u definition 2 let a be a type 2 fuzzy set in the universe of discourse x represented by the type 2 membership function μ a if all μ a x u 1 then a is called as an interval type 2 fuzzy set an interval type 2 fuzzy set a can be regarded as a special case of a type 2 fuzzy set represented as follows a x x u j x 1 x u where j x 0 1 definition 3 the upper membership function and the lower membership function of an interval type 2 fuzzy set are type 1 membership functions respectively in this paper we present a method using interval type 2 fuzzy sets for handling fuzzy multiple attributes group decision making problems where the reference points and the heights of the upper and the lower membership functions of interval type 2 fuzzy sets are used to characterize interval

problems using both qualitative and quantitative criteria measurement akyuz et al 2015 it has been widely applied in various disciplines akyuz 2015a ho 2008 however it is common for real world decision makers to use linguistic variables to evaluate the ratings of various criteria and alternatives chen 2000 linguistic values are frequently represented by fuzzy numbers akyuz 2016 buckley 1985 integrates interval type 1 fuzzy sets with ahp for considering uncertainty several useful extensions have been developed to enhance the ahp under it2fss kahraman et al 2014 also extended ahp based on it2fss using new ranking method for supplier selection problem celik et al 2014a b also proposed ahp under it2fss for evaluating critical success factors in humanitarian relief logistics abdullah and najib 2014 developed a new type 2 fuzzy set of linguistic variables for evaluation of work safety and early warning rating of hot and humid environments cevik onar et al 2014 used ahp under it2fss for determining of the weights of the strategic decision factors oztaysi 2015 used ahp under it2fss for erp enterprise resource planning selection problem the important criteria in emergency department is determined using ahp based on the it2fss gul et al 2016 in this paper we implemented ahp based on it2fss to obtain importance for weights of key performance indicators the steps of proposed approach are presented as follows step 1 the pairwise comparisons are consulted to the expert for the key performance indicator using linguistic variables step 2 the consistency of the fuzzy pair wise comparison is analyzed in this step if the result of the pairwise comparison matrix a is consistent then the result of the interval type 2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix a is also consistent a consistency ratio cr of 0 1 or less is considered as acceptable the cr is calculated to measure how consistent the judgements have been relative to large samples of purely random judgements if the cr is bigger than 0 1 the judgements are considered untrustworthy in this step the center of area defuzzification method kahraman et al 2014 is used step 3 the pair wise comparison matrix is constructed under it2fss among key performance indicators the linguistic terms are presented in table 1 1 a 1 a 12 a 1 m a 21 1 a 2 m a m 1 a m 2 1 1 a 12 a 1 m 1 a 12 1 a 2 m 1 a 1 m 1 a 2 m 1 where 1 a i j 1 a

it2fss and actual data topsis one of the classical multicriteria decision making mcdm methods was proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 it is based on the concept that chosen the best alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the farthest from the negative ideal solution nis for solving a mcdm problem celik et al 2016 it is used effectively different application areas two extensive literature review on topsis approach are presented by behzadian et al 2012 and zavadskas et al 2016 the seven steps of the procedure of topsis approach under it2fss environment and actual data are presented as follows step 1 two evaluation matrix is constructed consisting of m alternatives and n key performance indicators o p n o p n with intersection of each alternative and key performance indicators given as x i j and y i j we therefore have a matrix x i j m o and y i j m p in this step the linguistic variable and corresponding it2f is presented in table 2 step 2 the data is normalized for calculating the normalize decision matrix in this paper the normalization technique is applied for the data the normalized value r i j is calculated as follows 6 r i j y i j i 1 m y i j 2 step 3 the weighted normalized decision matrix is calculated the weighted normalized value is calculated as 7 v i j x i j x w j where w j is the weight of the j t h key performance indicators j 1 o 8 v i j r i j x w j where w j is the weight of the j t h key performance indicators j o 1 n step 4 based on eq 9 the defuzzified value of the interval type 2 fuzzy set w c

14 c c i d i d i d i step 8 the preference order is ranked for ranking alternatives using this index we can rank alternatives in decreasing order the best optimal alternative can now be decided with respect to the preference rank order of c c i therefore the best alternative is the one that has the shortest distance to the ideal solution hwang and yoon 1981 2 4 proposed approach it2fahp topsis in this section the proposed methodology is presented to guide the decision makers port owners or port managers who will make investment decision for appropriate shiploader type in dry bulk cargo shipment the ahp and topsis under it2fss environment and actual data is applied and systematic procedure is followed fig 2 shows flow chart of the proposed approach the proposed approach consists of two main steps in the first step the importance weights of key performance indicators kpis is determining based on the unbiased experts opinions which describes kpis in the second step calculated importance weights of the kpis are used as input data for the topsis under it2fss environment based on the results obtained from the first step the performance of dry bulk cargo shiploaders is evaluated from their operational and technical aspects 3 application shiploader selection in dry bulk cargo terminals the proposed approach is applied to select appropriate shiploader type in maritime transportation by assessing performance indicators in operational and technical aspects 3 1 problem statement a shiploader is kind of a special equipment ensuring continuous loading of dry bulk cargo into ship s cargo hold and performance of it plays a key role in reducing idle time at port also shiploader ensures cargo handling efficiency inadequate shiploader can cause huge delay at port bimco 2014 there are certain vulnerabilities such as low cargo loading rate continuous mechanical failure insufficient physical endurance high energy consumption high emission failure frequency etc for shiploaders in order to minimize aforementioned deficiencies and speed up the operation process port owners or port managers must decide to select the right shiploader for handling dry bulk materials since there are a wide range of critical factors that need to be thoroughly evaluated when selecting the proper process and associated equipment for handling dry bulk cargoes this paper brings a methodological solution to guide the decision makers during selecting right type of shiploader in maritime transportation industry 3 2 analysis of respondents an expert judgement can be a good solution in problem solving and decision making due to the lack of data in maritime transportation industry akyuz 2015b the expert judgement is considered as input in the presence of a large number of options in decision making three dry bulk cargo terminals which are equipped with different size modern shiploaders cooperatively provided data and expert opinions for the purposes of this article there are nine shiploaders at terminal four of them are parallel loaders one is radial loader one is fix loader and the rest are mobile loaders in order to reflect opinion of shipowner two prestigious dry bulk cargo shipping companies were visited the companies have different size bulk carrier ship fleets the experts details are provided in table 3 surveys were performed with port managers as well as ship superintendents since they have sufficient experience and knowledge 3 3 key performance indicators key performance indicators are used to evaluate performance of dry bulk cargo shiploaders from their operational and technical aspects there are mainly four different types of shiploaders used in dry bulk cargo terminals table 4 gives brief descriptions of the shiploaders akyuz and celik 2016a b ics 2011 a wide range of kpis in terms of operational and technical aspects are ascertained in the view of experts table 5 shows kpis for instance loading capacity i6 is one of the substantial kpi to measure performance of the shiploader since high loading rate is essential to meet customer requirements likewise environment friendly operation i7 is another kpi which addressing minimum impact on the environment by reducing dust and emissions reliability of shiploader i9 is of paramount importance and expectation is to complete cargo handling without failure breaks of equipment 3 4 data collection considering the importance selection of the appropriate shiploader in dry bulk cargo terminals this paper is supported with data obtain from observation versus manufacturing performance data and linguistic statements the data i2 i6 i7 i8 were collected by reviewing records of dry bulk cargo terminal related documents and correspondence communication with experts on the other hand linguistic data i1 i3 i4 i5 i9 were received from the view of seven experts since terminals were not willing to share their data due to commercial reason therefore the authors used fuzzy logic to address problems in which data of indicators are imprecise and vague 3 5 selecting of the appropriate shiploader type it2fahp is applied to analyze the kpis for prioritization the importance weight of each indicator is obtained by using it2fahp seven experts from the dry bulk cargo terminal and ship owner company used a nine point scale as shown in table 1 to evaluate the kpis the result of the pair wise comparisons of the kpis evaluation was performed by seven experts using eq 1 the consistency of the fuzzy pair wise comparison is analyzed by using the center of area coa defuzzification method kahraman et al 2014 celik and akyuz 2016 according to the defuzzified evaluation matrix the consistency ratio for each expert and aggregated evaluation matrix for main criteria is calculated as 0 054 0 027 0 077 0 033 and 0 096 respectively the comparison results are consistent because of the cr value of each expert and aggregated evaluation is less than 0 10 the aggregated type 2 fuzzy evaluation matrix for the factors weights is obtained it is presented in table 6 the type 2 fuzzy geometric means of the factors are obtained in step 3 byusing eq 2 for example the geometric mean of the first row is calculated as follows r 1 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 15 a 16 a 17 a 18 a 19 1 n 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 9 0 9 0 24 0 33 0 33 0 55 1 1 0 28 0 33 0 33 0 41 0 9 0 9 0 82 1 15

the type 2 fuzzy weights are calculated using eq 3 for example the type 2 fuzzy weight of the first row i1 is calculated as follows w 1 r 1 r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 r 9 1 0 58 0 8 0 8 1 12 1 1 0 69 0 8 0 8 0 94 0 9 0 9 1 75 2 37 2 37 3 02 1 1 2 06 2 37 2 37 2 68 0 9 0 9 0 49 0 73 0 73 1 09 1 1 0 6 0 73 0 73 0 88 0 9 0 9 1 2 1 73 1 73 2 33 1 1 1 46 1 73 1 73 2 01 0 9 0 9 0 85 1 2 1 2 1 65 1 1 1 02 1 2 1 2 1 4 0 9 0 9 2 07 2 78 2 78 3 49 1 1 2 43 2 78 2 78 3 13 0 9 0 9 0 56 0 77 0 77 1 06 1 1 0 66 0 77 0 77 0 89 0 9 0 9 0 97 1 4 1 4 1 91 1 1 1 19 1 4 1 4 1 64 0 9 0 9 0 38 0 51 0 51 0 72 1 1 0 44 0 51 0 51 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 0 04 0 07 0 07 0 13 1 1 0 05 0 07 0 07 0 09 0 9 0 9 following the same process the type 2 fuzzy weights of the other kpis for prioritization are calculated as shown in the second row of table 7 the if2fss is defuzzified by using center of area method kahraman et al 2014 celik and akyuz 2016 obtaining weights of each criterion using eq 4 for example the defuzzified weights of the first row is calculated as follows d e f u z z i f i e d w 1 0 13 0 04 1 0 07 0 04 1 0 07 0 04 4 0 04 0 09 0 05 0 9 0 09 0 07 0 9 0 09 0 07 4 0 05 2 d e f u z z i f i e d w 1 0 068 the crisp weights of technical and operational evaluation criteria are normalized using eq 5 for example the normalized weight of the first row is also computed as follows w 1 d e f u z z i f i e d w 1 j 1 n 9 d e f u z z i f i e d w j w 1 0 068 0 068 0 197 0 063 0 146 0 102 0 231 0 065 0 118 0 044 w 1 0 0662 the results of the it2fahp are presented in table 7 additionally the weights of 9 key performance indicators are ranked with respect to the normalized weights while loading capacity i6 is determined as the most important kpi based on experts evaluation power fuel consumption i2 and physical endurance i4 are determined as the second and third in this paper topsis method is used to decide what kind of shiploader type is the appropriate for dry bulk cargo terminals the proposed approach is based on it2fss linguistic and numeric data since the port managers of dry bulk cargo terminals were not willing to share data due to commercial reason some of the kpis installation cost versatility physical endurance cost efficiency are evaluated by experts by using linguistics variables presented in table 2 the others power fuel consumption loading capacity co2 emission environment friendly operation reliability were obtained from the terminals table 8 is showing the linguistic and numeric data evaluations obtained from the terminals and experts according to the evaluation of experts the aggregated interval type 2 fuzzy numbers and numeric data is presented in table 9 then the numeric data is normalized by using eq 6 and the results are presented in table 10 furthermore the weighted type 2 fuzzy performance values of the shiploader are calculated by multiplying the importance weights of the kpis under type 2 fuzzy performance values table 11 in this step the importance weights of each kpi is obtained by using it2fahp the defuzzified value of the interval type 2 fuzzy set are calculated for obtaining the defuzzified weighted decision matrix by using eq 9 the positive ideal and negative ideal solution is determined by using eq 10 and eq 11 accordingly the results are presented in table 12 then the distances of each alternative from the positive ideal solution pis and the negative ideal solution nis are calculated by using eq 12 and eq 13 table 13 shows distance form pis and nis finally the closeness coefficient eq 14 is calculated for ranking the shiploader types table 14 3 6 sensitivity analysis the concept of sensitivity analysis investigates the impact of kpi with the proposed ahp and topsis under it2fss linguistic environment and numeric data to validate the outcomes twelve cases are generated as indicated in table 15 the first case indicates the current importance weights for the kpi the case 2 is generated as allocating the lowest weight wwc to all criteria in order to analyze critical indicators of the ship loaders and then the medium weights are considered in the case 3 the cases from 4 to 12 are generated as allocating the highest weight to specific kpis and the lowest weight to the rest of the kpis the closeness coefficients and rankings of twelve cases are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 respectively it is observed that different ranking of the shiploader are obtained for instance s1 has the best performance indicators in eight cases likewise s4 shows the best performance in three cases on the other hand s2 has only the best performance in one case case 11 this shows that there are significant effect of the key performance indicators on selecting appropriate shiploader type in maritime transportation the first change in ranking is observed when the weight of installation cost i1 is increased to the highest weight and the rest set up to the lowest it can be concluded that installation cost i1 physical endurance i5 reliability i8 and user friendly i9 have a positive impact on performance indicators of ship loaders in maritime transportation according to the sensitivity analysis this research finds that the proposed approach can produce satisfactory result and provide proper information to assist executers in the decision making problems 3 7 findings and discussion in the light of the outcomes parallel travelling shiploader s1 has the best performance criteria among the alternatives and loading capacity i6 is the most substantial indicator among the criteria in most of the twelve cases investigated based on fig 3 the shiploader should be operated up to maximum cargo loading capacity to complete the ship on time otherwise huge amount of demurrage may emerge due to the delay of ship considering the generic outcomes parallel travelling shiploader apparently is the right shiploader type for handling dry bulk materials based on fig 3 since it the most efficient machine to operate compared to the other designs from the point of operational management setup time among the cargo holds is reduced as much as possible therefore minimizing idle time of the ship and maximising throughput of cargo in parallel loader operation since commercial activity is one of the sustainable efficiency for the ship owners parallel loader provides quicker ship turnaround and decreases demurrage fees on the other hand according to the fig 3 the performance of shiploader may change in accordance with different situations according to the case 4 for instance mobile shiploader s4 has the best performance indicators in case installation cost i1 is considered as the most critical criteria and the rest is considered as equal or less importance at this point mobile shiploader can be selected by dry bulk cargo terminal executives who care about installation cost initially likewise in case 8 parallel shiploader can be the best alternatives if the cost efficiency become the most important criteria according to the case 6 parallel slightly better and mobile shiploaders can be the best choice in case versatility i3 is considered as the most important criteria and the rest is considered as equal or less importance in this context parallel and mobile loader can be selected by dry bulk cargo terminal executives who care about versatility initially considering case 11 radial shiploader s3 has the best performance in case environment friendly operation i7 is considered as the most crucial criteria and the rest is considered as equal or less importance at this point radial shiploader can be a good alternative for dry bulk cargo terminals which strive for high efficiency with minimum impact through the environment since operational costs of the fix shiploader s3 is considerable high it is relatively insignificant when compared to other alternatives the outcomes of the study shows that the fix shiploader is not appropriate for most of dry bulk cargo terminals 4 conclusion this paper presented a research study to select the right shiploader type for handling dry bulk cargo in terminals since there are various critical factors affecting decision making process to accomplish this ahp and topsis methods were integrated under it2fss environment thus the it2fss can deal with more of the uncertainty of expert judgement and expression in decision making the paper was supported with sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of kpis in different conditions in the light of the outcomes it was observed that the parallel travelling shiploader is the right loader type for handling bulk materials in most cases moreover the finding showed that loading capacity is one of the main impact criteria as indicated by the data during choosing the right ship loader for handling bulk materials while there is a lack of empirical researches to handle uncertainty of human decision in evaluating the dry bulk cargo shiploaders this paper remedies a gap by offering a numeric research the findings of the research are highly welcomed by dry bulk cargo terminals professionals port owners and port managers when selecting the proper shiploader for handling dry bulk materials since the research provides a comprehensive insight it can be applicable to other industries such as aviation petrochemical construction software etc acknowledgment the author

23504,the vivace converter is a novel and highly efficient renewable energy device in marine hydrokinetic mhk energy the operational principle of the converter is to immerse a slender body with bluff cross section in a flow and extract energy from the transverse oscillations induced by the unsteady von kármán vortex street in general the converter consists of one or more mass spring damper oscillators subjected to non linear hydrodynamic forces these forces are strongly influenced by variations of the inflow velocity damping stiffness and mass ratio which in turn influence the harnessed power and efficiency of the converter for a reliable model of the hydrodynamic forces experimental and numerical research plays a key role in the study of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the converter this study focuses on modelling the harnessed power and efficiency of the converter based on a surrogate model methodology in vortex induced vibration viv and galloping region to avoid excessive experimentation or computational inaccuracy the surrogate model is constructed from a radial basis function rbf network by using experimental data of equal interval harnessing damping ratio and stiffness in a specified design domain the harnessed power at different flow velocities is computed by the present model and is found to be consistent with experimental results optimization is performed to obtain the maximum harnessed power and efficiency and the corresponding harnessed damping ratio and stiffness distributions in both the viv and galloping regions the method introduced in this study provides a novel tool for numerical modelling of oscillators in flow induced vibrations which can be used in engineering applications such as optimization of mhk energy converters keywords modelling flow induced vibration radial basis function vortex induced vibration galloping 1 introduction renewable energy devices are attracting increasing attention in an industrial context energy generated by waves tides open ocean currents rivers ocean thermal gradients and salinity gradients is typically referred to as marine renewable energy mre within mre marine hydrokinetic mhk energy refers to wave tidal current and river energy horizontal hydrokinetic energy refers to mhk energy generated by horizontal currents due to tides ocean currents or rivers since 2005 a focus area of the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab bernitsas et al 2006 bernitsas 2016 at the university of michigan is the basic hydrodynamics of enhancing fluid induced vibration fiv in the form of vortex induced vibrations viv and galloping in order to convert horizontal hydrokinetic energy into mechanical and subsequently electrical energy in 2011 a reliable virtual spring damper v ck system lee et al 2011 was built to replace the physical dampers and springs of the vivace converter by a servo motor and controller v ck was further improved by sun et al 2015 the hydrodynamic force is not included in the control loop thus avoiding bias on the other hand the system identification process particularly for damping is very elaborate requiring careful modelling and repeated testing as well as verification with well calibrated springs and predetermined damping turbulence stimulation was added to cylinders in the form of narrow sand strips named passive turbulence control ptc bernitsas and raghavan 2011 a ptc to fim map has been developed to enable selection of the flow induced vibration of a cylinder with ptc park et al 2013a 2013b thus the viv range of synchronization and the galloping range can be placed back to back resulting in a response amplitude operator with high response starting at the onset of viv and having no end as the flow velocity increases a converter designed that way is very robust is the sense of being able to respond with high amplitude ratio amplitude diameter a d in an open ended range of velocities in viv or galloping bernitsas 2016 a rigid cylinder on end springs in a transverse flow can be excited in one or two degrees of freedom flow induced vibrations fiv starting from zero flow velocity and increasing it gradually when the vortex shedding frequency is sufficiently close to the oscillator s natural frequency lock in is initiated and the self excited oscillations of the cylinder occur galloping also used by the vivace converter is another type of instability of slender structures with bluff cross sections that occurs due to geometric or flow asymmetry when certain flow velocity is reached blevins 1990 chang et al 2011 the underlying hydrodynamic mechanisms are different viv is based on alternating vortex shedding in which interaction between its two shear layers is essential extends over a finite velocity range and is self limiting in amplitude galloping initiates at a critical absolute velocity and does not stop with increasing velocity the galloping generation mechanism interrupts the interaction between the shear layers on the two sides of the cylinder typically galloping initiates at velocities higher than the upper velocity limit of viv by properly designing a converter the two phenomena can be brought close together and overlap a transition region may exist between viv and galloping where both mechanisms coexist in such a case the response amplitude operator of the converter initiates near its natural frequency and does not end resulting in higher and higher response with increasing velocity bernitsas 2016 the harnessed power and efficiency are the main assessment criteria in the conceptual design of green energy devices lower harnessed power and efficiency are typical of renewable energy technologies from a mathematical perspective the converter can be viewed as a linear mass spring damper dynamical system under non linear excitation in the viv range it is under lock in and in the galloping range in instability others interpret viv as linear resonance of variable added mass over the range of synchronization experimental research indicates that the harnessed power and efficiency are related to the values of mechanical parameters lee and bernitsas 2011 bernitsas 2016 in particular the harnessed power and efficiency are functions of the damping ratio and stiffness and of course variation in flow velocity sun et al 2015 meanwhile there is still a lack of theoretical models for the hydrodynamic lift force zdravkovich 1997 2002 blevins 1990 shigehiko et al 2008 foulhous and bernitsas 1993 research related to the harnessed power and efficiency is limited to experiments and computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations wu et al 2011 ding et al 2013 2015 in the mrelab we conduct experiments cfd simulations broad field of view laser visualization mathematical modelling and data processing experiments are the most reliable of course cfd results need to be compared to experiments the experimental setup with the channel the controllers the virtual oscillators based on elaborate system identification took several years to develop but now that all have been developed and thoroughly tested hundreds of experiments are conducted in a matter of hours rather than months as both the spring stiffness and damping function linear or multiple nonlinear forms ma et al 2016 and values can be changed on the run with no need for change and calibration of physical components see figs a1 a4 surrogate models also known as meta models were initially developed as surrogates of expensive simulation processes to improve the overall experimental efforts and costs or computational efficiency wang and shan 2007 using surrogate models in place of high fidelity engineering simulations or experiments can help reduce design cycle times and cost by enabling rapid analysis of alternative designs they can also be used as an efficient replacement of software to predict quantities that cannot be measured directly different surrogate modelling techniques have recently been introduced into areas such as ocean engineering design song et al 2011 sultan et al 2013 mahfouz 2007 guarize et al 2007 and aerodynamic engineering design matias et al 2016 sommerwerket al 2008 popular methods for creating surrogate models include polynomial functions particularly for linear and quadratic models myers and montgomery 1995 radial basis function rbf networks buhmann 2003 and kriging interpolation zhang et al 2015 cresssie 1988 in addition ensembles of surrogate models are proposed to improve the predictive capabilities of the global approximation modelling viana et al 2013 müller and shoemaker 2014 proper meta model determination is dependent on the nature of the engineering problems as well as on the available experimental and numerical data the difficulty within the surrogate modelling lies in the construction of a reliable emulator using as few samples as possible for this reason conducting a comparative analysis of the surrogate models built using the proper methods is of great importance in this work surrogate based modelling is performed to implement a single cylinder vivace design based on experimental data the harnessed damping ratio and stiffness are treated as the basic design variables the surrogate models representing the relationship between the design variables and the hydrodynamic lift force harnessed power or efficiency are constructed by using both the kriging method and rbf networks based on the processes of equal interval sampling in view of the validation of comparison between the kriging and rbf methods rbf networks are finally decided upon as the black box tool for modelling a mhk energy converter vivace a selective sampling point is chosen to verify the forecasting ability of the surrogate modelling on the harnessed power developed in this paper then hybrid optimization based on rbf modelling is performed using the multi objective particle swarm optimizer mopso yang et al 2009 the physical mode of the converter is presented in section 2 the mathematical model for harnessed power and efficiency are presented in section 3 surrogate numerical modelling of the converter is established in section 4 the case study is presented in section 5 conclusions are drawn at the end 2 physical model 2 1 experimental facility ltfsw channel all tests were conducted in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel in the mrelab of the university of michigan fig 1 the ltfsw channel recirculates 10 000 gallons 37 854 lt of fresh water at speeds of up to 1 5 m s using an impeller powered by a 20 hp induction motor the test section is 2 44 m long and 1 0 m wide and is made of transparent plexiglas which enables visualization of the flow past cylinders using two 5 w argon lasers to illuminate 100 μm aluminum oxide seeding particles for this study the water depth at the test section was set at 1 17 m and the maximum flow velocity was limited to 1 35 m s for safety against the galloping instability 2 2 cylinders and distributed roughness in order to enhance the fiv of a circular cylinder in transverse steady flow which would result in harnessing more horizontal hydrokinetic energy distributed roughness in the form of roughness strips was introduced and studied extensively in the mrelab experimentally bernitsas and raghavan 2011 chang et al 2011 park et al 2013a kim et al 2011 and numerically ding et al 2013 2015 the distributed roughness is referred to as ptc passive turbulence control this study resulted in a valuable tool the ptc to fiv map park et al 2013a 2013b as shown in fig 2 ptc consists of a pair of straight roughness strips attached on the cylinder symmetrically with respect to the flow according to the ptc to fiv map the location of the roughness strips determines the response fiv of the cylinder the placement angle α ptc 20 is measured from the forward stagnation point to the upstream edge of the roughness strip based on the results of previous studies on ptc chang et al 2011 park et al 2013a strips with commercial roughness designation p60 and width of 12 7 mm which covers 16 on each side of the cylinder diameter 88 9 mm have been used in this study the total thickness of the ptc is on the order of the boundary layer thickness the robustness of the ptc to fiv map was studied by park et al 2013b defining not only the ptc coverage requirement in the direction of the flow but also the hierarchy of dominance of the zones where ptc is applied ptc has a major impact on the energy conversion and the efficiency of the converter 2 3 vck system for systematic experimental testing particularly in such a large design space two challenges are important to overcome a changing the physical springs and dampers requires extensive preparation for calibration and alignment b the viscous damping of the system is rarely linear as modelled in classical textbooks on vibration to compensate for these two major challenges lee and bernitsas 2011 and lee et al 2011 introduced and implemented the first generation of virtual spring damper device called vck system sun et al 2015 developed the embedded second generation of vck in vivace oscillators as shown in figs 3 and 4 the purpose of vck is to replace the physical springs and dampers of the oscillator with a simulator without including the hydrodynamics in the closed control loop which would bias the fiv phenomenon being measured the mass ratio m is changed by placing a mass shaft inside the cylinder sun et al 2015 the centre to centre distance d d between cylinders in tandem in the flow direction can be adjusted by the rail system starting at 5 12 7 mm in increments of 0 5 1 27 mm the features of the converter are summarised in table 1 based on a non linear viscous damping model the controller force can be expressed as follows 1 f c o n t r o l l e r f n o n l i n e a r d a m p i n g c v i r t u a l y k v i r t u a l y where f controller is the force applied by the virtual system motor and controller f nonlinear damping is the total non linear damping force k virtual is the virtual spring constant or prescribed function and c virtual is the linear viscous damping imposed by the controller regarding damping a prescribed function is added after subtracting the non linear viscous damping of the system so that the system tested has a prescribed and mathematically true damping model the agreement between the real spring system and vck system is very good in viv and galloping measurements over the entire range of velocities tested as has been well documented by sun et al 2015 it should be emphasized that the vck system enables implementation of any spring function and value and any damping model and value 3 mathematical model 3 1 harnessed and dissipated power the flow is in the x direction the motion of the cylinder in the y direction and is modelled the second order linear differential equation of an oscillator as 2 m o s c y c t o t a l y k y f f l u i d where y is the direction perpendicular to the flow and the cylinder axis m osc is the total oscillating system mass which includes one third of the spring mass k is the spring stiffness c total the total damping coefficient for a linear viscous damping model and f fluid is the force exerted by the fluid on the body in the y rection to convert hydrokinetic energy to mechanical energy in the oscillator and subsequently to electrical energy additional damping is introduced into the system the total damping c total s defined as 3 c t o t a l c s t r u c t u r e c h a r n e s s where c structure is the existing damping due to losses in the transmission system in this research all the c structure values are adjusted by the vck system according to m and k to achieve the same dimensionless damping ratio ζ structure the term c harness is the damping added through vck that converts the mechanical energy in the oscillating cylinder to electrical energy simulating the real world from eq 3 we know that c structure d c harness can be expressed using the harnessed damping ratios ζ harness and ζ structure as 4 ζ s t r u c t u r e c s t r u c t u r e 2 m

et al 2015 3 2 power conversion efficiency the power in a fluid is calculated based on the area swept by the cylinders 8 p f l u i d w 1 2 ρ u 3 2 a max d l where a max is the highest amplitude among all cylinders in a multiple cylinder converter the betz limit is the theoretical maximum power that can be extracted from an open flow and is equal to 59 26 16 27 based on the betz limit the power

limit kim and bernitsas 2016 4 modelling of the converter as previously stated the harnessed power p harness and efficiency η harness are the two primary design objectives of the converter as discussed by sun et al 2015 the power performance of the converter is strongly dependent on the variation of the harnessing damping ratio ζ harness and stiffness k under different flow velocities the design of a vivace model could be converted into a modelling construction problem by involving search for the relationship between input mechanical parameters ζ harness k and u and objective functions f fluid p harness and η harness from experimental data surrogate modelling formulae are specified in the following subsections 4 1 range of design variables considering the geometry of the converter experimental configuration as shown in fig 1 the following ranges for the design variables are adopted preliminarily based on engineering specifications and experimental constraints stiffness k the lowest k is chosen as 400 n m f n water 0 89hz to prevent the motion amplitude of the cylinder to exceed the water depth in previous tests sun et al 2015 lower stiffness with lower damping results in higher amplitude that exceeds 3 0d in the galloping range which reaches the limits of water channel in that case blockage effects from bottom raghavan et al 2007 2009 and free surface bernitsas et al 2007 proximity are observed the highest k is set at 1200 n m f n water 1 55hz because of the strength limit of the timing belt of the vck system fig 3 harnessing damping ratio ζ harness the range of ζ harness is set as 0 01 0 24 to meet a broad range of engineering applications flow velocity u as one of the key parameters and the dominant factor for the converter flow velocity variations are considered separately on both viv and galloping during mechanical parameter modelling the independent design variables and constraint ranges considered in this study are summarised in table 2 traditionally for a given design p harness and η harness would be based on the distribution of hydrodynamic lift force found via extensive experimental analysis copious experiments would be performed at defined constant harnessing damping ratio and stiffness with flow velocities in the entire ranges of viv and galloping to reduce this time consuming experimentation and data acquisition and processing it is advisable and necessary to achieve such objectives through numerical modelling instead 4 2 construction of surrogate model a surrogate model is established to analyse the design variables based on sample points the basic formulation of the surrogate model can be expressed as follows 11 f p x f x ε x where f p x is the true response at design point x f x is the model estimate and ε x is the error in the surrogate model there are several approaches that can be used to construct the surrogate model such as polynomial regression the kriging model and rbfs considering that the polynomial model is less accurate for highly non linear problems wang and shan 2006 two types of surrogate model kriging and rbf algorithm are utilised to create the hydrokinetic energy model kriging model the kriging model is named after the pioneering research of d g krige a south african mining engineer van beers 2005 it is useful in predicting temporally and spatially correlated data the main idea of the kriging model is to use its basic formulation to estimate the value of a response at some unstamped location the ordinary estimating deterministic function of the kriging model can be stated as van beers and kleijnen 2004 12 f x μ ε x e ε 0 cov ε x i ε x j 0 i j where μ is the mean of the response at sampled design points and ε is the error with zero expected value the correlation function of a generalised distance is used between the sample data points which determines the accuracy of the model and ensures f x to be an approximation model when the mean squared error between f x and f x is minimised therefore f x becomes 13 f x μ r t x r 1 f μ i where μ ˆ is the estimated value of μ r 1 is the inverse of the correlation matrix r r is the correlation vector f is the observed data with n sample data and i is the vector with n components of 1 for possible correlation structures of r one may refer to the study by queipo et al 2005 and lee et al 2006 rbf model the rbf approximation is a type of neural network employing one hidden layer of radial units and an output layer of linear units that is capable of a universal approximation park and irwin 1991 as shown in fig 5 the basic formulation is 14 f x i 1 n w i h i x ε i where w i is the vector of coefficients h i x i 1 2 n are the basis functions ε i i 1 2 n are the independent errors with variance σ 2 and n is the number of rbfs then the rbf model can be expressed as f hw where h is an n m matrix of rbfs h i x and the coefficients w are given by w h 1 f which is calculated from the training samples generally a surrogate model can be constructed in three main steps sampling of experimental data simulation of selected samples and modelling validation 4 3 experimental sampling data to obtain an accurate surrogate model a series of experiments is used with the available range of harnessing damping ratio and stiffness of the vck experimental system sun et al 2015 in order to use the existing experimental results and reduce additional experimental time the equal interval harnessed damping ratio and stiffness sampling are utilised within the specified design domain finally five sampling points for stiffness k 400 600 755 1000 1200 n m and seven values of harnessing damping ratio ζ harness 0 00 0 04 0 08 0 12 0 16 0 20 0 24 are selected to perform the experimental simulations the flow velocity varies from 0 41 to 1 31 m s in 0 0375 m s intervals for a total of 24 velocity values tested experimentally 4 4 numerical model adapted to experimental data as indicated in section 4 3 a total of 35 groups of experimental data sets are used in this data adaptive modelling process for each given pair of ζ harness k the displacement y t of the oscillating cylinder is recorded for each constant flow velocity in the time domain the amplitude a is derived form the time history y t two dimensionless quantities the amplitude ratio a a d and the body oscillation frequency f o s c are obtained by using eq 15a b 15a a 1 4 π 3 ζ v a c c u m u v a c c u m 2 m o s c f o s c v a c c u m c y t o t a l sin ϕ t o t a l 15b f o s c 1 1 2 π 3 u v a c c u m 2 m o c s a c y t o t a l cos ϕ t o

selected k values fig 6 shows the corresponding plots of the hydrodynamic lift force coefficient vs flow velocity u for six harnessing damping ratios ζ harness and at stiffness k 400n m the hydrodynamic lift force coefficient as function of velocity u for different harnessing damping ratios at k 400 600 755 1000 and 1200 n m are presented in appendix a tables a1 a4 the global technique routes for surrogate based modelling of the hydrodynamic lift force coefficient together with p harness and η harness are outlined as follows 1 initialisation determine the diameter and mass ratio of

constructed based on the selected experiments defined in section 4 3 and the measurements presented in sun et al 2015 they are constructed using isight 5 0 an integration platform for a simulation based design process isight 5 0 user s guide 2011 an assessment of the models accuracy is performed here to find a more suitable model for the design to assess the quality of the surrogate model the cross validation scheme kohavi 1995 is used to perform an error analysis where the sample data are divided into subsets one set is then removed from the training data to act as the testing set at a given time 161 points from the total samples are used for the testing the r 2 value correlation coefficient in the cross validation scheme is used to validate and compare the two constructed models a value of r 2 closer to 1 0 indicates that a higher accuracy of approximation is achieved the r 2 values from the two models are listed in table 45 according to table 4 the rbf approach provides a better approximation the kriging approach identifies the maximum possible estimators and presumes the global functional form which is typically difficult to obtain and use wang and shan 2007 in addition the rbfs are known as local approximation networks as they are composed of several elements that primarily consider the approximation regarding a specific area of the input space herrera et al 2011 as a result rbf can provide arbitrarily good approximations to a prescribed function with a finite number of real variables park and irwin 1991 the dynamic behaviour of the vivace converter is sensitive to the design parameters which may lead to a highly nonlinear governing function in this case local model approaches such as rbf are easier to construct thus the rbf approach is selected to construct the surrogate model to perform the subsequent modelling for the mechanical parametric design fig 7 presents three dimensional graphs of rbf modelling between hydrodynamic lift force versus ζ harness and k at different flow velocities the dependence of power response on the variables is shown in figs 8 and 9 where power is clearly not a monotonic function of the variables and may have several local peak values in the design space especially in viv 5 verification optimisation and discussion of results 5 1 modelling verification and prediction in order to verify the forecasting function of the present surrogate model p harness and η harness are calculated predicted for a pair of harnessing damping ratio and stiffness ζ harness k a random sampling point ζ harness 0 16 k 1 200n m is selected to verify the present model the flow velocity is set in the range 0 63 1 31 m s fig 10 and table 5 show the p harness distribution as function of the flow velocity as predicted by the model and as measured by experiments as indicated in a1 the experimental data used in the model development for the single cylinder with selective roughness are based on previous extensive experimental testing sun et al 2015 all experimental sets of data except for one set were used to achieve a high accuracy model the last dataset was not included in the modelling so it could be used for validation of the methodology and model by using so many experimental datasets we have an effective model the data that we have reserved for validation of the model represent an entire experimental setup with 18 points covering the entire range of flow speed tested the maximum error between experiments and the rfb model prediction is 17 514 in viv and 12 401 in galloping comparison with the kriging model prediction method is also presented in fig 10 the results show that rfb model prediction is much more accurate than kriging model prediction method from the power comparison between experimental and numerical results it can be observed that the relative error is less than 15 0 except in the transition region experimental measurements and numerical results exhibit similar trend both in viv and galloping in the present experimental results the transition region from viv to galloping is identified by the drop in the amplitude of oscillation in other experimental datasets chang et al 2011 increased k values shift the viv region to higher speeds eliminating the gap in this case the transition is identified by a big jump in amplitude response when experimental data are available it is easy to determine the beginning and end of viv and galloping in the case of lack of experimental data the ranges of viv and galloping are determined as follows viv initiates when the strouhal frequency matches the natural frequency of the oscillator in still water where the added mass coefficient c a 1 as shown in eq 17 17 s t f n w d u 0 20 w i t h f n w 1 2 π k m c a m d a n d m d ρ w π d 2 4 l the end of the viv synchronization range occurs approximately at u 11 0 for m d 1 then have 18 u u f n w d 11 u 11 d 1 2 π k m m a that is the end of the viv synchronization range increases proportionally with the square root of the spring stiffness k on the other hand galloping initiates at an absolute value of velocity u u critical given by blevins 1990 as 19 u c r i t i c a l 2 c t o t a l ρ d c y α where c total is the linear viscous damping d is the cylinder diameter and is the derivative of the lift coefficient with respect to the angle of attack u critical is not affected by the spring constant k or the mass m that is initiation of galloping does not depend on k but only on the absolute flow velocity system damping and geometric particulars of the oscillator higher damping would require a higher velocity to initiate galloping the gap between viv and galloping can be bridged by increasing k that would move viv to higher velocities but would not affect galloping as indicated in experimental results the highly discrete distributions of experimental data related to the variations of damping ratio and stiffness make the unstable response in region of transition in galloping the error is limited to 12 even to 5 in most flow velocity cases this means that the flow patterns in galloping are relatively steadier than the patterns in viv and transition from viv to galloping a high error of 52 526 occurs in transition this is expected because in transition both hydrodynamic driving mechanisms coexist and the amplitude response a values are low thus a small change in a results in high percentage error further damping may bring viv and galloping closer or separate them in the latter case a gap appears between viv and galloping and viv may be in desynchronization which involves unstable patterns with complex and unpredictable response in general this comparison between numerical simulation and experimental measurements shows the reliability and feasibility of the present model to predict the power output within the design domain 5 2 modelling and optimization of the harnessed power and efficiency based on the rbf data adaptive surrogate model developed p harness and η harness are treated as the objective function in two separate optimization problems the damping ratio and stiffness distributions corresponding to the optima are derived as function of the flow speed a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is chosen to perform the global optimization analysis the pso algorithm is a nature inspired population based metaheuristic optimization algorithm when a bird flock moves toward a predefined objective the individuals in the swarm try to make progress towards the fittest position known to them and their social circle till now two main versions of the pso algorithm have been developed single objective pso sopso and multi objective pso mopso yang et al 2009 mopso is selected to obtain the optimal design parameters which lead to the optimal objective functions maximise p harness and η harness the optimization model of the maximum p harness and η harness designs is stated as follows find the pair ζ harness k harnessing damping ratio stiffness case i maximum pharness harnessed power at each velocity case ii maximum ηharness power harness efficiency at each velocity amplitude a ymax and cylinder frequency of oscillation fcyl is obtained the hydrodynamic lift force coefficient cy total is generated by reconstructing the force using the governing equation m o s c y c t o t a l y k y f f l u i d m 7 923 kg d 0 0889m harnessing damping ratio 0 00 ζ h a r n e s s l ζ h a r n e s s ζ h a r n e s s u 0 24 stiffness 400 n m k l k k u 1200 n m flow velocity 0 34 m s u l u u u 1 32 m s the subscripts l and u denote the lower and upper bounds of the parameters respectively for the mopso solver the number of particles was set equal to 10 and the algorithm was executed over 5000 iterations the inertia value w which keeps the particles moving and makes the particles to have the tendency to explore new search areas was set equal to 0 9 particle increment was set as 0 9 when the objective function reached the maximum number of iterations the corresponding decision variables were identified and outputted 5 3 case i maximum p harness in this case maximizing p harness is set as the design objective the flow velocity is discretized and 48 values are used to cover the experimental data range from 0 43 to 1 31 m s which includes viv transition and galloping the k and ζ harness values generating the corresponding maximum p harness for each flow velocity are presented in table 6 a c figs 11 13 show the same information for k ζ harness and p harness as function of flow velocity respectively the following observations can be made from table 6 and figs 11 13 1 in viv a the harnessed power graph in fig 13 exhibits a local maximum at the end of the upper branch u 0 71m s b from fig 11 it is observed that the k optimal values increase as the flow velocity increases in the viv region then k maintains the highest value from viv to transition u 0 75 0 95 m s c at the initial branch of viv ζ harness exhibits the same trends with k with flow velocity u 0 43 0 55m s then the optimal ζ harness stays at the higher value with slight variation at u 0 55 0 75m s these observations are reasonable as the flow velocity increases there is more hydrokinetic power to maintain viv at higher velocities higher k is needed shifting the range of viv synchronization to higher velocities vortex structures maintain the frequency of wake equal to the frequency of oscillation but more complex vortex structures appear in the trsl3 flow regime like 2p two pairs 2p s two pairs one single p 2s etc bernitsas 2016 higher conversion from hydrokinetic to mechanical in the oscillator requires higher ζ harness 2 in transition a a drop in p harness reveals a local minimum value with u 0 83 0 95m s due to the fluid structure interaction instability in transition b k maintains a constant high value of k 1200n m with u 0 75 0 99 m s c the minimum value of harnessed damping ratio ζ harness 0 099 with u 0 87m s is attained and higher value would suppress fsi by delaying the onset of galloping in transition the maximum harnessed power is more sensitive to ζ harness than that of k accordingly the optimal ζ harness should be searched carefully very low ζ harness will initiate galloping earlier closing the gap between viv and galloping but would result in low power conversion high ζ harness will delay onset of galloping resulting in a gap between viv and galloping resulting in elimination of any power conversion 3 in galloping a the local maximum is at the highest velocity since galloping is not self limiting and it is an instability phenomenon with response increasing with velocity the optimal p harness is generally obtained with the highest available k as shown in fig 11 b a drop in stiffness k occurs at velocity u 1 15 1 19m s this is an observation relating a change in the hydrodynamics of the galloping instability not studied in this paper c ζ harness increases from 0 158 to 0 219 within the initial galloping u 0 99 1 15m s a decrease occurs when the flow velocity exceeds 1 15 optimal ζ harness reduces from 0 219 to 0 199 5 4 case ii maximum η harness in this second case maximizing η harness is selected as the design objective as in case i the flow velocity is discretized and 48 values are used to cover the experimental data range from 0 43 to 1 31 m s which includes viv transition and galloping the k and ζ harness values corresponding to the maximum η harness are presented in table 7 a c and shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively fig 16 gives the maximum η harness as function of the flow velocity the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in viv as shown in fig 16 the global maximum of η harness is reached in viv the maximum η harness 0 461 with k 999n m and ζ harness 0 238 at u 0 67m s it can be observed in fig 14 that k increases with velocity in the initial stage of viv u 0 43 0 71 m s the k corresponding to the optimal η harness increases from 400n m to 1000n m then stiffness stays constant at k 1000n m for u 0 63 0 81 m s similarly ζ harness increases from 0 136 to 0 238 with velocity in the initial stage of viv u 0 43 0 63m s then remains at the constant value of 0 240 in the velocity range 0 63m s u 0 83m s till the end of viv 2 in transition η harness drops significantly as high damping delays the onset of galloping to the point of almost zero oscillation leaving a valley between viv and galloping the optimal k increases from 1 000n m to the maximum available stiffness k 1 200n m for u 0 83 0 95m s in order to reach the maximum η harness on the contrary a drop of ζ harness occurs from 0 24 to 0 12 to 0 20 with the variation of flow velocity u 0 83 0 99m s low amplitude response allows only for low damping and low energy conversion 3 in galloping in general η harness is much lower in galloping than in viv comparing figs 13 16 we observe that the local maxima in p harness and η harness do not coincide this is the case because the area spanned by the cylinder is variable depending on the amplitude of oscillation as shown by equation 8 the area appears in the denominator of equations 9 and 10 thus making the power in the fluid a variable k maintains its highest available value k 1200n m during galloping u 0 99 1 31m s contrary to case i there is no drop in optimal k distributions in addition the ζ harness should be chosen with high value from 0 24 0 223 0 24 to obtain the maximum η harness as shown in fig 15 6 conclusions a surrogate based model was developed to perform optimization of a hydrokinetic energy converter consisting of a circular cylinder mounted on end springs e g vivace converter the source data was obtained by extensive experiments to ensure a robust basis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the surrogate based model was established and validated using radial basis functions and experimental data both the harnessed power and the efficiency were calculated accurately using the model at different stiffness and harnessing damping ratio values with self adaptive characteristics both in the viv and galloping ranges the hydrodynamic lift force coefficient was derived from experimental measurements as function of the flow velocity with harnessing damping ratio and spring stiffness as parameters 2 parameter optimization was performed based on modelling and a multi objective particle swarm optimizer the optimal distributions of harnessing damping ratio and stiffness were obtained for flow velocities over the entire viv and galloping ranges where experimental data were available for the optimization of harnessed power the harnessing damping ratio and stiffness increase with the flow velocity in the initial phase of viv u 0 43 0 63 m s then the optimal harnessing damping ratio decreases from 0 24 to 0 15 in contrast the stiffness keeps increasing and reaches the maximum available stiffness when the velocity reaches galloping the stiffness maintains its high values the harnessing damping ratio however increases with the increase of galloping velocity to u 1 27 m s after that there is a downward trend in the velocity variation 3 for the case of efficiency optimization the harnessing damping ratio and stiffness show trends similar to those the optimum harnessed power in the initial stage of viv u 0 43 0 63 m s and the post viv stage u 0 63 0 75 m s on the other hand the values of harnessed damping ratio and stiffness are different for the different optimum objectives harnessed power or efficiency the stiffness remains high during galloping whereas the harnessed damping ratio keeps increasing over the intermediate parameter range between viv and galloping 4 the present modelling strategy can be extended to include other parametric effects such as mass ratio modelling and optimization can assist with a variety of testing and engineering applications of the vivace converter like reducing the number of tests required design controls to improve power harnessing and tackle the ultimate design problem of reconciling the local power optima with the local efficiency

23504,the vivace converter is a novel and highly efficient renewable energy device in marine hydrokinetic mhk energy the operational principle of the converter is to immerse a slender body with bluff cross section in a flow and extract energy from the transverse oscillations induced by the unsteady von kármán vortex street in general the converter consists of one or more mass spring damper oscillators subjected to non linear hydrodynamic forces these forces are strongly influenced by variations of the inflow velocity damping stiffness and mass ratio which in turn influence the harnessed power and efficiency of the converter for a reliable model of the hydrodynamic forces experimental and numerical research plays a key role in the study of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the converter this study focuses on modelling the harnessed power and efficiency of the converter based on a surrogate model methodology in vortex induced vibration viv and galloping region to avoid excessive experimentation or computational inaccuracy the surrogate model is constructed from a radial basis function rbf network by using experimental data of equal interval harnessing damping ratio and stiffness in a specified design domain the harnessed power at different flow velocities is computed by the present model and is found to be consistent with experimental results optimization is performed to obtain the maximum harnessed power and efficiency and the corresponding harnessed damping ratio and stiffness distributions in both the viv and galloping regions the method introduced in this study provides a novel tool for numerical modelling of oscillators in flow induced vibrations which can be used in engineering applications such as optimization of mhk energy converters keywords modelling flow induced vibration radial basis function vortex induced vibration galloping 1 introduction renewable energy devices are attracting increasing attention in an industrial context energy generated by waves tides open ocean currents rivers ocean thermal gradients and salinity gradients is typically referred to as marine renewable energy mre within mre marine hydrokinetic mhk energy refers to wave tidal current and river energy horizontal hydrokinetic energy refers to mhk energy generated by horizontal currents due to tides ocean currents or rivers since 2005 a focus area of the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab bernitsas et al 2006 bernitsas 2016 at the university of michigan is the basic hydrodynamics of enhancing fluid induced vibration fiv in the form of vortex induced vibrations viv and galloping in order to convert horizontal hydrokinetic energy into mechanical and subsequently electrical energy in 2011 a reliable virtual spring damper v ck system lee et al 2011 was built to replace the physical dampers and springs of the vivace converter by a servo motor and controller v ck was further improved by sun et al 2015 the hydrodynamic force is not included in the control loop thus avoiding bias on the other hand the system identification process particularly for damping is very elaborate requiring careful modelling and repeated testing as well as verification with well calibrated springs and predetermined damping turbulence stimulation was added to cylinders in the form of narrow sand strips named passive turbulence control ptc bernitsas and raghavan 2011 a ptc to fim map has been developed to enable selection of the flow induced vibration of a cylinder with ptc park et al 2013a 2013b thus the viv range of synchronization and the galloping range can be placed back to back resulting in a response amplitude operator with high response starting at the onset of viv and having no end as the flow velocity increases a converter designed that way is very robust is the sense of being able to respond with high amplitude ratio amplitude diameter a d in an open ended range of velocities in viv or galloping bernitsas 2016 a rigid cylinder on end springs in a transverse flow can be excited in one or two degrees of freedom flow induced vibrations fiv starting from zero flow velocity and increasing it gradually when the vortex shedding frequency is sufficiently close to the oscillator s natural frequency lock in is initiated and the self excited oscillations of the cylinder occur galloping also used by the vivace converter is another type of instability of slender structures with bluff cross sections that occurs due to geometric or flow asymmetry when certain flow velocity is reached blevins 1990 chang et al 2011 the underlying hydrodynamic mechanisms are different viv is based on alternating vortex shedding in which interaction between its two shear layers is essential extends over a finite velocity range and is self limiting in amplitude galloping initiates at a critical absolute velocity and does not stop with increasing velocity the galloping generation mechanism interrupts the interaction between the shear layers on the two sides of the cylinder typically galloping initiates at velocities higher than the upper velocity limit of viv by properly designing a converter the two phenomena can be brought close together and overlap a transition region may exist between viv and galloping where both mechanisms coexist in such a case the response amplitude operator of the converter initiates near its natural frequency and does not end resulting in higher and higher response with increasing velocity bernitsas 2016 the harnessed power and efficiency are the main assessment criteria in the conceptual design of green energy devices lower harnessed power and efficiency are typical of renewable energy technologies from a mathematical perspective the converter can be viewed as a linear mass spring damper dynamical system under non linear excitation in the viv range it is under lock in and in the galloping range in instability others interpret viv as linear resonance of variable added mass over the range of synchronization experimental research indicates that the harnessed power and efficiency are related to the values of mechanical parameters lee and bernitsas 2011 bernitsas 2016 in particular the harnessed power and efficiency are functions of the damping ratio and stiffness and of course variation in flow velocity sun et al 2015 meanwhile there is still a lack of theoretical models for the hydrodynamic lift force zdravkovich 1997 2002 blevins 1990 shigehiko et al 2008 foulhous and bernitsas 1993 research related to the harnessed power and efficiency is limited to experiments and computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations wu et al 2011 ding et al 2013 2015 in the mrelab we conduct experiments cfd simulations broad field of view laser visualization mathematical modelling and data processing experiments are the most reliable of course cfd results need to be compared to experiments the experimental setup with the channel the controllers the virtual oscillators based on elaborate system identification took several years to develop but now that all have been developed and thoroughly tested hundreds of experiments are conducted in a matter of hours rather than months as both the spring stiffness and damping function linear or multiple nonlinear forms ma et al 2016 and values can be changed on the run with no need for change and calibration of physical components see figs a1 a4 surrogate models also known as meta models were initially developed as surrogates of expensive simulation processes to improve the overall experimental efforts and costs or computational efficiency wang and shan 2007 using surrogate models in place of high fidelity engineering simulations or experiments can help reduce design cycle times and cost by enabling rapid analysis of alternative designs they can also be used as an efficient replacement of software to predict quantities that cannot be measured directly different surrogate modelling techniques have recently been introduced into areas such as ocean engineering design song et al 2011 sultan et al 2013 mahfouz 2007 guarize et al 2007 and aerodynamic engineering design matias et al 2016 sommerwerket al 2008 popular methods for creating surrogate models include polynomial functions particularly for linear and quadratic models myers and montgomery 1995 radial basis function rbf networks buhmann 2003 and kriging interpolation zhang et al 2015 cresssie 1988 in addition ensembles of surrogate models are proposed to improve the predictive capabilities of the global approximation modelling viana et al 2013 müller and shoemaker 2014 proper meta model determination is dependent on the nature of the engineering problems as well as on the available experimental and numerical data the difficulty within the surrogate modelling lies in the construction of a reliable emulator using as few samples as possible for this reason conducting a comparative analysis of the surrogate models built using the proper methods is of great importance in this work surrogate based modelling is performed to implement a single cylinder vivace design based on experimental data the harnessed damping ratio and stiffness are treated as the basic design variables the surrogate models representing the relationship between the design variables and the hydrodynamic lift force harnessed power or efficiency are constructed by using both the kriging method and rbf networks based on the processes of equal interval sampling in view of the validation of comparison between the kriging and rbf methods rbf networks are finally decided upon as the black box tool for modelling a mhk energy converter vivace a selective sampling point is chosen to verify the forecasting ability of the surrogate modelling on the harnessed power developed in this paper then hybrid optimization based on rbf modelling is performed using the multi objective particle swarm optimizer mopso yang et al 2009 the physical mode of the converter is presented in section 2 the mathematical model for harnessed power and efficiency are presented in section 3 surrogate numerical modelling of the converter is established in section 4 the case study is presented in section 5 conclusions are drawn at the end 2 physical model 2 1 experimental facility ltfsw channel all tests were conducted in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel in the mrelab of the university of michigan fig 1 the ltfsw channel recirculates 10 000 gallons 37 854 lt of fresh water at speeds of up to 1 5 m s using an impeller powered by a 20 hp induction motor the test section is 2 44 m long and 1 0 m wide and is made of transparent plexiglas which enables visualization of the flow past cylinders using two 5 w argon lasers to illuminate 100 μm aluminum oxide seeding particles for this study the water depth at the test section was set at 1 17 m and the maximum flow velocity was limited to 1 35 m s for safety against the galloping instability 2 2 cylinders and distributed roughness in order to enhance the fiv of a circular cylinder in transverse steady flow which would result in harnessing more horizontal hydrokinetic energy distributed roughness in the form of roughness strips was introduced and studied extensively in the mrelab experimentally bernitsas and raghavan 2011 chang et al 2011 park et al 2013a kim et al 2011 and numerically ding et al 2013 2015 the distributed roughness is referred to as ptc passive turbulence control this study resulted in a valuable tool the ptc to fiv map park et al 2013a 2013b as shown in fig 2 ptc consists of a pair of straight roughness strips attached on the cylinder symmetrically with respect to the flow according to the ptc to fiv map the location of the roughness strips determines the response fiv of the cylinder the placement angle α ptc 20 is measured from the forward stagnation point to the upstream edge of the roughness strip based on the results of previous studies on ptc chang et al 2011 park et al 2013a strips with commercial roughness designation p60 and width of 12 7 mm which covers 16 on each side of the cylinder diameter 88 9 mm have been used in this study the total thickness of the ptc is on the order of the boundary layer thickness the robustness of the ptc to fiv map was studied by park et al 2013b defining not only the ptc coverage requirement in the direction of the flow but also the hierarchy of dominance of the zones where ptc is applied ptc has a major impact on the energy conversion and the efficiency of the converter 2 3 vck system for systematic experimental testing particularly in such a large design space two challenges are important to overcome a changing the physical springs and dampers requires extensive preparation for calibration and alignment b the viscous damping of the system is rarely linear as modelled in classical textbooks on vibration to compensate for these two major challenges lee and bernitsas 2011 and lee et al 2011 introduced and implemented the first generation of virtual spring damper device called vck system sun et al 2015 developed the embedded second generation of vck in vivace oscillators as shown in figs 3 and 4 the purpose of vck is to replace the physical springs and dampers of the oscillator with a simulator without including the hydrodynamics in the closed control loop which would bias the fiv phenomenon being measured the mass ratio m is changed by placing a mass shaft inside the cylinder sun et al 2015 the centre to centre distance d d between cylinders in tandem in the flow direction can be adjusted by the rail system starting at 5 12 7 mm in increments of 0 5 1 27 mm the features of the converter are summarised in table 1 based on a non linear viscous damping model the controller force can be expressed as follows 1 f c o n t r o l l e r f n o n l i n e a r d a m p i n g c v i r t u a l y k v i r t u a l y where f controller is the force applied by the virtual system motor and controller f nonlinear damping is the total non linear damping force k virtual is the virtual spring constant or prescribed function and c virtual is the linear viscous damping imposed by the controller regarding damping a prescribed function is added after subtracting the non linear viscous damping of the system so that the system tested has a prescribed and mathematically true damping model the agreement between the real spring system and vck system is very good in viv and galloping measurements over the entire range of velocities tested as has been well documented by sun et al 2015 it should be emphasized that the vck system enables implementation of any spring function and value and any damping model and value 3 mathematical model 3 1 harnessed and dissipated power the flow is in the x direction the motion of the cylinder in the y direction and is modelled the second order linear differential equation of an oscillator as 2 m o s c y c t o t a l y k y f f l u i d where y is the direction perpendicular to the flow and the cylinder axis m osc is the total oscillating system mass which includes one third of the spring mass k is the spring stiffness c total the total damping coefficient for a linear viscous damping model and f fluid is the force exerted by the fluid on the body in the y rection to convert hydrokinetic energy to mechanical energy in the oscillator and subsequently to electrical energy additional damping is introduced into the system the total damping c total s defined as 3 c t o t a l c s t r u c t u r e c h a r n e s s where c structure is the existing damping due to losses in the transmission system in this research all the c structure values are adjusted by the vck system according to m and k to achieve the same dimensionless damping ratio ζ structure the term c harness is the damping added through vck that converts the mechanical energy in the oscillating cylinder to electrical energy simulating the real world from eq 3 we know that c structure d c harness can be expressed using the harnessed damping ratios ζ harness and ζ structure as 4 ζ s t r u c t u r e c s t r u c t u r e 2 m

et al 2015 3 2 power conversion efficiency the power in a fluid is calculated based on the area swept by the cylinders 8 p f l u i d w 1 2 ρ u 3 2 a max d l where a max is the highest amplitude among all cylinders in a multiple cylinder converter the betz limit is the theoretical maximum power that can be extracted from an open flow and is equal to 59 26 16 27 based on the betz limit the power conversion efficiency η convert and power harness efficiency η harness can be calculated as 9 η c o n v e r t p c o n v e r t p f l u i d b e t z l i m i t 100 10 η h a r n e s s p h a r n e s s p f l u i d b e t z l i m i t 100 commercial scale wind turbines achieve peak efficiencies of 75 80 of the betz limit bernitsas et al 2007 a four cylinder vivace converter can achieve up to 88 of the betz limit kim and bernitsas 2016 4 modelling of the converter as previously stated the harnessed power p harness and efficiency η harness are the two primary design objectives of the converter as discussed by sun et al 2015 the power performance of the converter is strongly dependent on the variation of the harnessing damping ratio ζ harness and stiffness k under different flow velocities the design of a vivace model could be converted into a modelling construction problem by involving search for the relationship between input mechanical parameters ζ harness k and u and objective functions f fluid p harness and η harness from experimental data surrogate modelling formulae are specified in the following subsections 4 1 range of design variables considering the geometry of the converter experimental configuration as shown in fig 1 the following ranges for the design variables are adopted preliminarily based on engineering specifications and experimental constraints stiffness k the lowest k is chosen as 400 n m f n water 0 89hz to prevent the motion amplitude of the cylinder to exceed the water depth in previous tests sun et al 2015 lower stiffness with lower damping results in higher amplitude that exceeds 3 0d in the galloping range which reaches the limits of water channel in that case blockage effects from bottom raghavan et al 2007 2009 and free surface bernitsas et al 2007 proximity are observed the highest k is set at 1200 n m f n water 1 55hz because of the strength limit of the timing belt of the vck system fig 3 harnessing damping ratio ζ harness the range of ζ harness is set as 0 01 0 24 to meet a broad range of engineering applications flow velocity u as one of the key parameters and the dominant factor for the converter flow velocity variations are considered separately on both viv and galloping during mechanical parameter modelling the independent design variables and constraint ranges considered in this study are summarised in table 2 traditionally for a given design p harness and η harness would be based on the distribution of hydrodynamic lift force found via extensive experimental analysis copious experiments would be performed at defined constant harnessing damping ratio and stiffness with flow velocities in the entire ranges of viv and galloping to reduce this time consuming experimentation and data acquisition and processing it is advisable and necessary to achieve such objectives through numerical modelling instead 4 2 construction of surrogate model a surrogate model is established to analyse the design variables based on sample points the basic formulation of the surrogate model can be expressed as follows 11 f p x f x ε x where f p x is the true response at design point x f x is the model estimate and ε x is the error in the surrogate model there are several approaches that can be used to construct the surrogate model such as polynomial regression the kriging model and rbfs considering that the polynomial model is less accurate for highly non linear problems wang and shan 2006 two types of surrogate model kriging and rbf algorithm are utilised to create the hydrokinetic energy model kriging model the kriging model is named after the pioneering research of d g krige a south african mining engineer van beers 2005 it is useful in predicting temporally and spatially correlated data the main idea of the kriging model is to use its basic formulation to estimate the value of a response at some unstamped location the ordinary estimating deterministic function of the kriging model can be stated as van beers and kleijnen 2004 12 f x μ ε x e ε 0 cov ε x i ε x j 0 i j where μ is the mean of the response at sampled design points and ε is the error with zero expected value the correlation function of a generalised distance is used between the sample data points which determines the accuracy of the model and ensures f x to be an approximation model when the mean squared error between f x and f x is minimised therefore f x becomes 13 f x μ r t x r 1 f μ i where μ ˆ is the estimated value of μ r 1 is the inverse of the correlation matrix r r is the correlation vector f is the observed data with n sample data and i is the vector with n components of 1 for possible correlation structures of r one may refer to the study by queipo et al 2005 and lee et al 2006 rbf model the rbf approximation is a type of neural network employing one hidden layer of radial units and an output layer of linear units that is capable of a universal approximation park and irwin 1991 as shown in fig 5 the basic formulation is 14 f x i 1 n w i h i x ε i where w i is the vector of coefficients h i x i 1 2 n are the basis functions ε i i 1 2 n are the independent errors with variance σ 2 and n is the number of rbfs then the rbf model can be expressed as f hw where h is an n m matrix of rbfs h i x and the coefficients w are given by w h 1 f which is calculated from the training samples generally a surrogate model can be constructed in three main steps sampling of experimental data simulation of selected samples and modelling validation 4 3 experimental sampling data to obtain an accurate surrogate model a series of experiments is used with the available range of harnessing damping ratio and stiffness of the vck experimental system sun et al 2015 in order to use the existing experimental results and reduce additional experimental time the equal interval harnessed damping ratio and stiffness sampling are utilised within the specified design domain finally five sampling points for stiffness k 400 600 755 1000 1200 n m and seven values of harnessing damping ratio ζ harness 0 00 0 04 0 08 0 12 0 16 0 20 0 24 are selected to perform the experimental simulations the flow velocity varies from 0 41 to 1 31 m s in 0 0375 m s intervals for a total of 24 velocity values tested experimentally 4 4 numerical model adapted to experimental data as indicated in section 4 3 a total of 35 groups of experimental data sets are used in this data adaptive modelling process for each given pair of ζ harness k the displacement y t of the oscillating cylinder is recorded for each constant flow velocity in the time domain the amplitude a is derived form the time history y t two dimensionless quantities the amplitude ratio a a d and the body oscillation frequency f o s c are obtained by using eq 15a b 15a a 1 4 π 3 ζ v a c c u m u v a c c u m 2 m o s c f o s c v a c c u m c y t o t a l sin ϕ t o t a l 15b f o s c 1 1 2 π 3 u v a c c u m 2 m o c s a c y t o t a l cos ϕ t o

cross validation scheme kohavi 1995 is used to perform an error analysis where the sample data are divided into subsets one set is then removed from the training data to act as the testing set at a given time 161 points from the total samples are used for the testing the r 2 value correlation coefficient in the cross validation scheme is used to validate and compare the two constructed models a value of r 2 closer to 1 0 indicates that a higher accuracy of approximation is achieved the r 2 values from the two models are listed in table 45 according to table 4 the rbf approach provides a better approximation the kriging approach identifies the maximum possible estimators and presumes the global functional form which is typically difficult to obtain and use wang and shan 2007 in addition the rbfs are known as local approximation networks as they are composed of several elements that primarily consider the approximation regarding a specific area of the input space herrera et al 2011 as a result rbf can provide arbitrarily good approximations to a prescribed function with a finite number of real variables park and irwin 1991 the dynamic behaviour of the vivace converter is sensitive to the design parameters which may lead to a highly nonlinear governing function in this case local model approaches such as rbf are easier to construct thus the rbf approach is selected to construct the surrogate model to perform the subsequent modelling for the mechanical parametric design fig 7 presents three dimensional graphs of rbf modelling between hydrodynamic lift force versus ζ harness and k at different flow velocities the dependence of power response on the variables is shown in figs 8 and 9 where power is clearly not a monotonic function of the variables and may have several local peak values in the design space especially in viv 5 verification optimisation and discussion of results 5 1 modelling verification and prediction in order to verify the forecasting function of the present surrogate model p harness and η harness are calculated predicted for a pair of harnessing damping ratio and stiffness ζ harness k a random sampling point ζ harness 0 16 k 1 200n m is selected to verify the present model the flow velocity is set in the range 0 63 1 31 m s fig 10 and table 5 show the p harness distribution as function of the flow velocity as predicted by the model and as measured by experiments as indicated in a1 the experimental data used in the model development for the single cylinder with selective roughness are based on previous extensive experimental testing sun et al 2015 all experimental sets of data except for one set were used to achieve a high accuracy model the last dataset was not included in the modelling so it could be used for validation of the methodology and model by using so many experimental datasets we have an effective model the data that we have reserved for validation of the model represent an entire experimental setup with 18 points covering the entire range of flow speed tested the maximum error between experiments and the rfb model prediction is 17 514 in viv and 12 401 in galloping comparison with the kriging model prediction method is also presented in fig 10 the results show that rfb model prediction is much more accurate than kriging model prediction method from the power comparison between experimental and numerical results it can be observed that the relative error is less than 15 0 except in the transition region experimental measurements and numerical results exhibit similar trend both in viv and galloping in the present experimental results the transition region from viv to galloping is identified by the drop in the amplitude of oscillation in other experimental datasets chang et al 2011 increased k values shift the viv region to higher speeds eliminating the gap in this case the transition is identified by a big jump in amplitude response when experimental data are available it is easy to determine the beginning and end of viv and galloping in the case of lack of experimental data the ranges of viv and galloping are determined as follows viv initiates when the strouhal frequency matches the natural frequency of the oscillator in still water where the added mass coefficient c a 1 as shown in eq 17 17 s t f n w d u 0 20 w i t h f n w 1 2 π k m c a m d a n d m d ρ w π d 2 4 l the end of the viv synchronization range occurs approximately at u 11 0 for m d 1 then have 18 u u f n w d 11 u 11 d 1 2 π k m m a that is the end of the viv synchronization range increases proportionally with the square root of the spring stiffness k on the other hand galloping initiates at an absolute value of velocity u u critical given by blevins 1990 as 19 u c r i t i c a l 2 c t o t a l ρ d c y α where c total is the linear viscous damping d is the cylinder diameter and is the derivative of the lift coefficient with respect to the angle of attack u critical is not affected by the spring constant k or the mass m that is initiation of galloping does not depend on k but only on the absolute flow velocity system damping and geometric particulars of the oscillator higher damping would require a higher velocity to initiate galloping the gap between viv and galloping can be bridged by increasing k that would move viv to higher velocities but would not affect galloping as indicated in experimental results the highly discrete distributions of experimental data related to the variations of damping ratio and stiffness make the unstable response in region of transition in galloping the error is limited to 12 even to 5 in most flow velocity cases this means that the flow patterns in galloping are relatively steadier than the patterns in viv and transition from viv to galloping a high error of 52 526 occurs in transition this is expected because in transition both hydrodynamic driving mechanisms coexist and the amplitude response a values are low thus a small change in a results in high percentage error further damping may bring viv and galloping closer or separate them in the latter case a gap appears between viv and galloping and viv may be in desynchronization which involves unstable patterns with complex and unpredictable response in general this comparison between numerical simulation and experimental measurements shows the reliability and feasibility of the present model to predict the power output within the design domain 5 2 modelling and optimization of the harnessed power and efficiency based on the rbf data adaptive surrogate model developed p harness and η harness are treated as the objective function in two separate optimization problems the damping ratio and stiffness distributions corresponding to the optima are derived as function of the flow speed a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is chosen to perform the global optimization analysis the pso algorithm is a nature inspired population based metaheuristic optimization algorithm when a bird flock moves toward a predefined objective the individuals in the swarm try to make progress towards the fittest position known to them and their social circle till now two main versions of the pso algorithm have been developed single objective pso sopso and multi objective pso mopso yang et al 2009 mopso is selected to obtain the optimal design parameters which lead to the optimal objective functions maximise p harness and η harness the optimization model of the maximum p harness and η harness designs is stated as follows find the pair ζ harness k harnessing damping ratio stiffness case i maximum pharness harnessed power at each velocity case ii maximum ηharness power harness efficiency at each velocity amplitude a ymax and cylinder frequency of oscillation fcyl is obtained the hydrodynamic lift force coefficient cy total is generated by reconstructing the force using the governing equation m o s c y c t o t a l y k y f f l u i d

subscripts l and u denote the lower and upper bounds of the parameters respectively for the mopso solver the number of particles was set equal to 10 and the algorithm was executed over 5000 iterations the inertia value w which keeps the particles moving and makes the particles to have the tendency to explore new search areas was set equal to 0 9 particle increment was set as 0 9 when the objective function reached the maximum number of iterations the corresponding decision variables were identified and outputted 5 3 case i maximum p harness in this case maximizing p harness is set as the design objective the flow velocity is discretized and 48 values are used to cover the experimental data range from 0 43 to 1 31 m s which includes viv transition and galloping the k and ζ harness values generating the corresponding maximum p harness for each flow velocity are presented in table 6 a c figs 11 13 show the same information for k ζ harness and p harness as function of flow velocity respectively the following observations can be made from table 6 and figs 11 13 1 in viv a the harnessed power graph in fig 13 exhibits a local maximum at the end of the upper branch u 0 71m s b from fig 11 it is observed that the k optimal values increase as the flow velocity increases in the viv region then k maintains the highest value from viv to transition u 0 75 0 95 m s c at the initial branch of viv ζ harness exhibits the same trends with k with flow velocity u 0 43 0 55m s then the optimal ζ harness stays at the higher value with slight variation at u 0 55 0 75m s these observations are reasonable as the flow velocity increases there is more hydrokinetic power to maintain viv at higher velocities higher k is needed shifting the range of viv synchronization to higher velocities vortex structures maintain the frequency of wake equal to the frequency of oscillation but more complex vortex structures appear in the trsl3 flow regime like 2p two pairs 2p s two pairs one single p 2s etc bernitsas 2016 higher conversion from hydrokinetic to mechanical in the oscillator requires higher ζ harness 2 in transition a a drop in p harness reveals a local minimum value with u 0 83 0 95m s due to the fluid structure interaction instability in transition b k maintains a constant high value of k 1200n m with u 0 75 0 99 m s c the minimum value of harnessed damping ratio ζ harness 0 099 with u 0 87m s is attained and higher value would suppress fsi by delaying the onset of galloping in transition the maximum harnessed power is more sensitive to ζ harness than that of k accordingly the optimal ζ harness should be searched carefully very low ζ harness will initiate galloping earlier closing the gap between viv and galloping but would result in low power conversion high ζ harness will delay onset of galloping resulting in a gap between viv and galloping resulting in elimination of any power conversion 3 in galloping a the local maximum is at the highest velocity since galloping is not self limiting and it is an instability phenomenon with response increasing with velocity the optimal p harness is generally obtained with the highest available k as shown in fig 11 b a drop in stiffness k occurs at velocity u 1 15 1 19m s this is an observation relating a change in the hydrodynamics of the galloping instability not studied in this paper c ζ harness increases from 0 158 to 0 219 within the initial galloping u 0 99 1 15m s a decrease occurs when the flow velocity exceeds 1 15 optimal ζ harness reduces from 0 219 to 0 199 5 4 case ii maximum η harness in this second case maximizing η harness is selected as the design objective as in case i the flow velocity is discretized and 48 values are used to cover the experimental data range from 0 43 to 1 31 m s which includes viv transition and galloping the k and ζ harness values corresponding to the maximum η harness are presented in table 7 a c and shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively fig 16 gives the maximum η harness as function of the flow velocity the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in viv as shown in fig 16 the global maximum of η harness is reached in viv the maximum η harness 0 461 with k 999n m and ζ harness 0 238 at u 0 67m s it can be observed in fig 14 that k increases with velocity in the initial stage of viv u 0 43 0 71 m s the k corresponding to the optimal η harness increases from 400n m to 1000n m then stiffness stays constant at k 1000n m for u 0 63 0 81 m s similarly ζ harness increases from 0 136 to 0 238 with velocity in the initial stage of viv u 0 43 0 63m s then remains at the constant value of 0 240 in the velocity range 0 63m s u 0 83m s till the end of viv 2 in transition η harness drops significantly as high damping delays the onset of galloping to the point of almost zero oscillation leaving a valley between viv and galloping the optimal k increases from 1 000n m to the maximum available stiffness k 1 200n m for u 0 83 0 95m s in order to reach the maximum η harness on the contrary a drop of ζ harness occurs from 0 24 to 0 12 to 0 20 with the variation of flow velocity u 0 83 0 99m s low amplitude response allows only for low damping and low energy conversion 3 in galloping in general η harness is much lower in galloping than in viv comparing figs 13 16 we observe that the local maxima in p harness and η harness do not coincide this is the case because the area spanned by the cylinder is variable depending on the amplitude of oscillation as shown by equation 8 the area appears in the denominator of equations 9 and 10 thus making the power in the fluid a variable k maintains its highest available value k 1200n m during galloping u 0 99 1 31m s contrary to case i there is no drop in optimal k distributions in addition the ζ harness should be chosen with high value from 0 24 0 223 0 24 to obtain the maximum η harness as shown in fig 15 6 conclusions a surrogate based model was developed to perform optimization of a hydrokinetic energy converter consisting of a circular cylinder mounted on end springs e g vivace converter the source data was obtained by extensive experiments to ensure a robust basis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the surrogate based model was established and validated using radial basis functions and experimental data both the harnessed power and the efficiency were calculated accurately using the model at different stiffness and harnessing damping ratio values with self adaptive characteristics both in the viv and galloping ranges the hydrodynamic lift force coefficient was derived from experimental measurements as function of the flow velocity with harnessing damping ratio and spring stiffness as parameters 2 parameter optimization was performed based on modelling and a multi objective particle swarm optimizer the optimal distributions of harnessing damping ratio and stiffness were obtained for flow velocities over the entire viv and galloping ranges where experimental data were available for the optimization of harnessed power the harnessing damping ratio and stiffness increase with the flow velocity in the initial phase of viv u 0 43 0 63 m s then the optimal harnessing damping ratio decreases from 0 24 to 0 15 in contrast the stiffness keeps increasing and reaches the maximum available stiffness when the velocity reaches galloping the stiffness maintains its high values the harnessing damping ratio however increases with the increase of galloping velocity to u 1 27 m s after that there is a downward trend in the velocity variation 3 for the case of efficiency optimization the harnessing damping ratio and stiffness show trends similar to those the optimum harnessed power in the initial stage of viv u 0 43 0 63 m s and the post viv stage u 0 63 0 75 m s on the other hand the values of harnessed damping ratio and stiffness are different for the different optimum objectives harnessed power or efficiency the stiffness remains high during galloping whereas the harnessed damping ratio keeps increasing over the intermediate parameter range between viv and galloping 4 the present modelling strategy can be extended to include other parametric effects such as mass ratio modelling and optimization can assist with a variety of testing and engineering applications of the vivace converter like reducing the number of tests required design controls to improve power harnessing and tackle the ultimate design problem of reconciling the local power optima with the local efficiency
