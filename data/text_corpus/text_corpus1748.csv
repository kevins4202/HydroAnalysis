freshwater is essential for the functioning of human societies especially for agriculture producing food and fiber and for the energy system producing fuels heat and electricity in the 20th century not only freshwater consumption in agriculture but also in industry and municipal supply increased sharply 1 at present there is a continuous growth of water withdrawal not only in agriculture but also for the industrial and municipal supply 2 food and fibre production dominate global freshwater use with about 86 of total consumption 3 and 69 of total withdrawal 2 to feed the growing global population especially irrigation water supply increased enormously between 1900 and 1995 global irrigated areas expanded fivefold from 50 to 250 million hectares with half of these areas in only four countries three in asia i e china india and pakistan the other country with increasing irrigated areas is the united states 1 especially in asia most freshwater withdrawal 81 takes place in agriculture 2 freshwater is a scarce natural resource while the aquatic environment shows signs of degradation and decline 4 water availability studies for the major rivers in the world indicate blue water scarcity in many basins sometimes in specific periods of the year sometimes throughout the year 5 for example showed that in the period 1996 to 2005 two thirds of the world s population faced water scarcity for at least one month per year especially in the densely populated countries in south asia like india and pakistan the water situation is alarming blue surface water runoff or the freshwater present in natural river systems is an important source of water especially in densely populated river basins that depend on agriculture and have little rainfall if rainfall is limited there is too little green water i e rainwater stored in the soil available for crops causing green water scarcity in those cases often irrigation water from surface or groundwater compensates for green water scarcity 6 the indus river for example is an important source of freshwater for a densely populated basin mainly dependent on melting water from the glaciers of the tibetan plateau and mountains 7 for these basins it is relevant to understand the balance between supply in the form of available water and actual water consumption 8 however showed that there is an ambiguity in water terminology where words like water use consumptive water use withdrawal water requirement consumption and water demand make it difficult to make quantitative water assessments usable for policy guiding actions or to allocate water over users like farmers industry or municipal supply in this respect it is relevant to distinguish between consumptive water use and non consumptive water use consumptive blue water use can be defined as the volume of freshwater withdrawn from a surface water or groundwater stock for human use and is evaporated transpired or incorporated into products or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment and not returned at a later point in time 8 this consumption is sometimes expressed as a blue water footprint wf 6 water supply can be addressed as the inflow of freshwater in the form of river water inflow and precipitation and the outflow as evaporation seepage to inaccessible groundwater stocks and eventually outflow to the sea wfs are expressed as the wf of a product a person a business or a nation as a whole including its agricultural industrial and municipal sectors 6 although most attention normally goes to the dominant agricultural wfs the industry has recently developed more attention for water use efficiency and some industries might even focus on decreasing their blue wf to zero 9 although differences among countries exist in general agriculture is the largest water consumer while wfs of industry and municipal water supply are far smaller 3 however agricultural water consumption competes with these other users 10 in pakistan in 2008 the agricultural blue and green precipitation wf was a hundred times larger than the industrial blue wf and 50 times the municipal blue wf 11 in 1977 pakistani agriculture withdrew 98 of freshwater industry and municipalities only 1 each in 2017 the contribution of agriculture decreased to 94 of the industry to 0 8 while municipalities took 5 of withdrawn water 2 for comparison in france an important agricultural producer in 2017 agricultural withdrawal was only 12 of total withdrawal but industrial and municipal water withdrawal was 67 and 20 respectively 2 showing the importance of water withdrawal of the industrial and municipal sectors in an industrialized country if freshwater is limited increasing water withdrawal might cause competition among sectors there is a limited amount of studies that assessed the wfs for a specific river basin for the basins in the eu 12 calculated the wfs related to consumption showing the large wfs in densely populated basins 13 assessed the wf of production and consumption in the guadiana basin in spain indicating the dominant contribution of the agricultural sector compared to industry and municipal water supply they also emphasized the importance of proper water management later 14 assessed wf of the segura basin in spain showing the contribution from the agricultural industrial and municipal sectors to total wfs also in relation to virtual water import and export information on national sectoral water withdrawal is available for most countries in the world starting in the sixties of the last century 2 but assessments of the development of water consumption or blue wfs per sector i e agriculture industry and municipal water supply are scarce wf data though are available for products based on a chain approach for example on sugar 15 electricity 16 or construction materials like cement 17 water scarcity is the main reason to make quantification of blue wfs and compare human water consumption with available water in a specific basin there are different ways to assess water scarcity though dependent on different views in pakistan for example the government has set a cap on the volume of water or environmental flow requirement efr that needs to remain in the river indus 18 while hogeboom et al 2021 and 6 define efrs as fractions of available water in a specific basin leading to different outcomes of water scarcity the aim of this study is to assess and evaluate blue wf developments of the industrial sector compared to wfs in agriculture and municipal water supply in a developing water scarce country with both limited green and blue water resources the three research questions are i what is the development of industrial blue water consumption and municipal water supply in a developing water scarce country compared to blue wfs of agriculture in the past fifty years ii can increased water use efficiency in agriculture contribute to guarantee sufficient water supply in the other two sectors in the future and iii what was the development of water scarcity in pakistan in the last fifty years for the assessment of competition over water the study took pakistan as the case study area this is done because pakistan is one of the four fast growing blue water consumers it is located in an extremely water scarce region its water source the indus is well described it shows economic growth in combination with fast population growth and data are available from the pakistani government in english for the assessment the study applied information from an earlier study into blue agricultural wfs in pakistan 19 governmental information on production and river water inflow and data on specific process wfs of products derived from wf studies that used a chain approach the innovation and contribution of the study to existing knowledge is that by making a detailed analysis of the development of blue wfs per sector in the last fifty years and fluctuations of water scarcity in the indus basin in pakistan it shows directions of change towards more efficient production using limited water resources in a sustainable way it identifies sectoral hotspots that if improved can make more water available for other users and decrease competition among or in sectors this information is relevant for policy makers and industry not only in pakistan but in all basins that encounter green and blue water scarcity 2 system analysis 2 1 development agricultural industrial and municipal sectors in pakistan since 1971 after being a colony of great britain india and pakistan including bangladesh became independent in 1947 in 1971 pakistan and bangladesh went their own way so that data on the country pakistan is available from that year on agriculture in pakistan includes two important sectors primary and secondary production five main crops i e sugar cane cotton rice wheat and maize dominate primary production 20 secondary production includes animal husbandry i e cattle buffaloes sheep goats horses mules asses camels mules and chickens 21 in pakistan primary production is most important with 35 of the land used as arable land especially in the provinces punjab and sindh where only 6 5 is grazing land economically agriculture dominates with 61 of the total population working in the sector the size of the cropping areas shows an increasing trend while the size of grazing lands remains the same 22 the population in pakistan more than tripled after the separation from bangladesh from 60 million in 1971 to 212 million in 2018 to feed the increasing population agricultural production kept pace with demand for example rice production increased 3 2 times and wheat production 3 9 times 20 especially consumption of livestock foods increased between 1971 and 2013 beef consumption increased from 5 to 9 kg per capita per year poultry from 0 24 to 5 kg eggs from 0 3 to 3 kg and milk from 106 to 183 kg per capita per year 20 pakistan s industrial sector mainly relies on the production of goods with a low value added and depends on low skilled labor the contribution of agriculture to the national gdp declines in favor of the service based economy 23 compared to other asian countries pakistan shows poor industrial performance its main manufacturing industries textiles and clothing show a relative decline in the world market 24 apart from the textile and clothing industry other relevant products from the manufacturing industry are sugar cigarettes fertilizer cement glass steel paper and board soda cars and bicycles 25 another relevant sector is the manufacturing of bottled drinking water 26 needed because municipal water quality is poor next the industrial sector includes the electricity sector and mining electricity is generated by thermal power plants coal oil natural gas nuclear power hydropower and renewables bagasse wind and solar energy national electric power regulatory authority nepra 2020 pakistan is a large sugar producer with around 75 sugar mills 20 apart from sugar bagasse is an important byproduct that is burned to generate heat and electricity for example ryk mills limited in punjab has a capacity of 12 000 tons of sugar cane per day generating 3600 tons of bagasse it built a 30 mw bagasse cofired power plant to generate electricity for its own needs while it sells the rest to the national grid 65 the total installed capacity of bagasse fueled power plants is around 1000 mw national electric power regulatory authority nepra 2020 mining includes the mining of minerals e g iron ore limestone and chromite and fossil fuels like crude oil coal and natural gas 27 2 2 freshwater resources in pakistan fig 1 shows that pakistan comprises three hydrologic units the indus basin the kharan desert system and the makran coastal drainage most surface and groundwater resources are located in the indus basin that covers 65 of the area of pakistan with 95 of its water resources 28 the river indus provides water for the irrigation network that includes two large reservoirs the tarbela and mangla reservoir and main and linking canals between rivers in the pakistani part of the indus basin next the kharan and makran basins also provide some surface water 28 there are seven rivers in the makran basin of balochistan 18 of the area of pakistan and four rivers in the kharan basin 17 of pakistan these rivers are low volume intermittent rivers but important for the local populations 28 the surface water infrastructure includes the water supply chain from the source where the inlet of river water occurs to the crop fields 29 initially the tarbela and mangla reservoirs were built to store freshwater for agriculture but later hydropower was installed generating a profit in the form of electricity apart from the available surface water pakistan also has groundwater stocks when there is a need of freshwater and surface water is not available in sufficient quantities groundwater is pumped up for example for irrigation purposes 30 or to cool power plants in the sugar industry national electric power regulatory authority nepra 2021 2 3 water footprint concept the water footprint wf concept provides a tool to assess the human consumption of freshwater 6 tony allan introduced the earlier concept of embedded water later renamed as virtual water 31 the wf assesses water consumption in production chains so that all freshwater needed to produce a good or service is accounted for this generates information on wfs of the products in combination with consumption data wfs of persons companies or nations become available the wf differentiates between green water from precipitation blue water from surface water or groundwater and grey water defined as the volume of water needed to dilute polluted water to accepted water quality standards many studies have made assessments of wfs of specific products e g wfs of crops 15 livestock products 32 steel cement and glass 17 sugar 33 or cotton 34 recently 19 have shown the relevance of blue wfs of the irrigation water supply chain in pakistan 2 4 agriculture in pakistan 2 4 1 blue water footprints and crop production in developing countries like pakistan national wfs are dominated by water consumption in agriculture while industrial and municipal water consumption is relatively small 3 almost all crops in pakistan depend on irrigation water either surface water or pumped groundwater because green water is scarce 19 surface water is supplied by the largest gravity fed canal network in the world 35 if there is a surface water shortage farmers pump up groundwater 19 between 1972 and 2000 the irrigated crop area increased by 50 the irrigated area of the five main crops sugar cane cotton rice wheat and maize increased from 10 2 106 ha in 1972 to 15 7 106 ha in 2000 then the increase slowed down in 2020 the agricultural area was about 16 8 106 ha 36 in the same period the production of the five main crops showed a linear growth from 32 106 tonnes per year in 1972 to 117 tonnes per year in 2020 20 2 4 2 blue water footprints and livestock production livestock in pakistan includes the following categories cattle buffaloes sheep goats camels assess horses mules ducks poultry and pets especially the herds of cattle buffaloes sheep and goats are relatively large livestock herd sizes increased between 1972 and 2020 21 37 38 livestock in pakistan mainly depends on non irrigated grazing lands and on feed crops produced in the country itself 22 next to the wf of the feed the animals receive drinking water while service water is needed for cleaning purposes 2 5 blue water footprints and industrial production industrial sectors in pakistan that generate a blue wf are the electricity and manufacturing sectors thermal power plants need an operating license from the national electric power regulatory authority nepra of the islamic republic of pakistan these detailed licenses give the exact location technical information including cooling type and source of cooling water and the builder and owner of the facility all information is available in english on the website of 39 2 5 1 blue water footprints and electricity production thermal power plants tpps contribute a large share of electricity to the pakistani grid in 1947 it was the dominant electricity supplier with a share of 80 the other 20 was supplied by hydropower plants hpps pakistan bureau of statistics 50 years of pakistan however with the building of the large water reservoirs for agriculture and installation of hydropower turbines gradually hydropower became more important in 1953 hpps generated more electricity 871 tj than ttps 817 tj in 1970 the first nuclear power plant became operational in 2020 though 59 of electricity is produced by tpps 31 by hpps 8 by nuclear power and another 3 by other renewables 40 2 5 1 1 blue water footprints of thermal and nuclear power plants the cooling type of tpps mainly determine their blue wfs cooling types include open loop cooling where water is taken in and released again with a higher temperature closed cycle cooling where water evaporates from a cooling tower or air cooling that does not need water 16 if salt water is applied no blue wf is generated especially in the south of pakistan tpps use sea or brackish water in their open loop cooling systems next to the cooling water some water is needed for services and dust suppression 16 some tpps function as a backup source for hydropower for example attock gen limited agl located at morgah rawalpindi it compensates for hydropower shortage in winter 41 also nuclear power plants use water for cooling the two installations in karachi use seawater the other four chasnupp 1 to 4 use freshwater from the chashma lake feeded by the indus river for their closed cycle cooling 39 2 5 1 2 blue water footprints of hydropower hpps blue wf is accounted as the water evaporation from their open water surfaces ows e g impoundments reservoirs and open canals 42 43 these wfs depend on climate geography energy planning and water storage schemes 43 hpps infrastructure varies greatly depending on the geographical and topographical features of the place where they are located these differences may indicate different technologies used to produce electricity namely reservoir and run of the river ror hpps 44 reservoir type hpps impound large volumes of water by means of a dam ror hpps deviate the river flow by means of a series of constructions such as weirs canals small dams and surge tanks reservoir hpps usually have larger blue wfs than their ror counterparts as their owss are larger 45 2 5 1 3 blue water footprints of bagasse fueled power plants in pakistan sugar manufacturing plants normally use the bagasse that becomes available in the sugar production process to generate electricity according to the nepra licenses the bagasse fueled power plants mostly use groundwater in closed cycle cooling systems some sugar mills apply surface water e g the madina sugar mill pvt ltd in punjab 39 2 5 1 4 blue water footprints of wind and solar energy blue wfs of wind and solar energy are relatively small some water is needed to clean solar pv panels 16 2 5 2 blue water footprints and production of manufacturing industries some manufacturing industries use freshwater in their processes for example for the bleaching dying and printing of cotton 34 or in the production process of steel cement and glass 17 for the manufacturing of bottled water also water is needed to produce the pet water bottle the processing of the water treatment and in the cooling system of the electricity consumed together the blue wf of 1 l of bottled water is around 15 l 26 2 5 3 blue water footprints and production of mining some mining processes need freshwater for example to cool the drilling machinery in pakistan deposits of coal crude oil natural gas chromite gypsum limestone iron ore rock salt and marble are available 2 6 blue water footprints of municipal water supply in pakistan municipal water supply in urban areas is primarily controlled by the public sector and individual households with private pumping 46 per capita water consumption varies between 30 l per capita per day in rural areas to 350 l per capita per day in some cities 47 groundwater is the main source of municipal water however the cities karachi hyderabad islamabad and rawalpindi mainly depend on surface water the rawal simply and khanpur reservoirs supply water to islamabad and rawalpindi 48 the hub keenjhar and halejee lakes store surface water for karachi 49 other cities rely on groundwater in pakistan most withdrawn water is lost during conveyance 30 which indicates the poor municipal water infrastructure however part of this water flows to accessible groundwater stocks and remains available for use when the municipal water arrives at the consumers part of the water is lost i e consumed and part goes to the sewage system often agriculture reuses that sewage water 20 and from a wf perspective it is not consumed 2 7 environmental flow requirements in the indus makran and kharan basin in the indus basin in pakistan environmental flow requirements efrs or the volume of water that needs to remain in the river is a topic of concern with different subjective perspectives important issues are not only to avoid salinity in the basin coastal instability in the delta impact on fisheries and nature but also to provide water to the economy 18 to arrive at a realistic optimum the international panel of experts ipoe an advisory committee for the pakistani government has proposed an efr for the basin downstream the kottri barrage of 10 6 109 m3 per year 18 this is a small value compared to the advice of the international union for conservation of nature iucn 2004 of 33 3 109 m3 per year other studies that made an analysis for the efrs of the indus have used relative values 50 applied an efr of 50 of the runoff while 5 51 used an efr of 80 based on the wf manual 6 showing the huge water scarcity in the indus basin for the makran and kharan basins though there are no governmental volumetric caps set for the efrs 3 method and data this study assessed the blue wfs per sector agriculture the industrial sector and municipal water supply in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 agriculture includes crop production and livestock farming the industrial sector includes the most relevant sectors in pakistan i electricity production ii manufacture of sugar cotton yarn and cloth paper and board soda ash caustic soda fertilizer steel cement and bottled drinking water and iii mining of coal crude oil natural gas limestone iron ore rock salt gypsum aragonite marble and chromite data on production were taken from the 20 available reports of the central bureau of statistics of the government of pakistan and from the international energy agency iea there are many studies using a life cycle approach that assessed the wf of a specific product from cradle to consumer giving an overview of direct and indirect virtual wfs of a specific product per chain link 64 this study took data from supply chain analyses to arrive at the blue wfs of the three sectors in pakistan the study collected data from water management and wf studies that include blue wfs of processes in a specific link of a production chain for example the wf of a cotton crop is included in the agricultural sector the production of cotton yarn in the industrial sector while the washing of cotton clothes is included in the wf of the municipal sector the calculations per sector are given below to put the blue wfs into perspective the study compared the blue wfs with water withdrawal the study took data on agricultural water withdrawal from the indus river system authority 52 and for the industrial and municipal sector from aquastat 2 for the industrial sector withdrawals in pakistan aquastat however reports increasing withdrawals from 1 7 109 m3 in 1971 to 3 0 109 m3 in 2000 after 2000 it reports decreasing numbers so that in 2010 and 2020 withdrawals are only half of the values in 2000 although industrial production increased we therefore assumed that there is a ratio between withdrawals and blue wfs we calculated the average ratio for the years 1971 1980 1990 and 2000 and applied this average to estimate the withdrawals for 2010 and 2020 after the assessment of sectoral blue wfs we compared the total annual surface water consumption with water availability for the period 1971 to 2020 giving an indication of the development of water scarcity in pakistan 3 1 estimation of blue water footprints of agriculture agriculture in pakistan consists of arable and livestock farming most crops receive irrigation blue water either from surface or from groundwater the assessment of the total annual agricultural blue surface water footprint for the indus kharan and makran basins for the period 1971 to 2020 in year s blue wf totalsurface s km3 year was calculated as 1 blue wf totalsurface s w s s sfa s s herein w s s is the total surface water withdrawal in the first link of the supply chain 109 m3 year in year s and sfa s s is the groundwater recharge from surface water to a freshwater aquifer 109 m3 year in year s we derived data on water withdrawal for the indus basin in the period 1971 to 2020 from ref 52 for the kharan and makran basins annual inflow and withdrawal data are not available however 28 showed average inflow and withdrawal for both basins for 2007 based on those data we calculated the fractions of inflows from the indus basin and the kharan and makran basins of 1 7 and 3 2 of the indus basin inflow we used these fractions to estimate annual inflow of the kharan and makran basins for the period 1971 2020 assuming that the inflow fractions remain the same we calculated annual agricultural water withdrawal in the makran and kharan basins as a percentage of the inflow using information on inflow and withdrawal for 2007 from ref 28 we arrived at a withdrawal of 17 kharan basin and 22 makran basin of the inflow and assumed that these percentages remain constant in the period 1971 2020 see also appendix 1 table a1 in the si we assumed that groundwater recharge from surface water gr s is a percentage of water withdrawal calculated as 2 g r s g r a w a 100 herein gr a is the average groundwater recharge from surface water 109 m3 year and w a is the average surface water withdrawal 109 m3 year in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 we derived data on average groundwater recharge of 45 6 109 m3 per year from ref 19 and on surface water withdrawal of 119 2 132 3 109 m3 per year from ref 28 for the makran and kharan basins we assumed that 22 of the inflow contributes to groundwater recharge see also appendix 1 table a2 in the si the assessment of the total agricultural blue groundwater footprint for the period 1971 to 2020 bluewf totalgroundwater s m3 year in year s was calculated in a similar way as 3 bluewf totalgroundwater s w g s sfa g s herein w g s is the groundwater withdrawal m3 year in year s sfa g s is the groundwater recharge from groundwater pumping m3 year in year s which is a fraction of w g s of 17 19 we assumed that there is a balance in groundwater recharge and withdrawal so that groundwater tables are constant groundwater withdrawal w g s m3 year was assumed to be equal to 4 w g s s f a s s s f a g s r r a i n s herein r rain s is the average annual groundwater recharge from rain m3 year data on rainwater recharge for 2007 are available from ref 28 we assumed that rainwater recharge is a fraction of water inflow calculated using data on inflow and groundwater recharge from rainfall for 2007 from ref 28 rainwater recharge is 7 5 indus basin 19 kharan basin and 13 4 makran basin of the inflow see appendix 1 table a3 in the si water for arable farming also includes water for feed crops for the assessment of the total blue wf of agriculture to avoid double counting we only added animal drinking water requirements per livestock category a to the blue wfs of agriculture animal drinking water requirements wf drinking a s 109 m3 year in year s were calculated as 5 w f d r i n k i n g a s a 1 n w f a p a s herein wf a is the specific drinking water requirement of animal a m3 year and p a s is the size of animal herd a in year s we derived data on specific drinking water requirements per animal from mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 and data on animal herd sizes for the period 1972 to 2006 from pakistan livestock census reports 21 37 38 the governmental statistics division of pakistan performed livestock census assessments for the years 1972 1996 and 2006 estimates of annual livestock herd sizes for the period 1972 to 2020 are available based on interpolation and extrapolation of census data based on growth rates for the period 2007 2020 only total livestock numbers per category are available to assess the wfs of animal drinking water we applied the ratios of 2006 to estimate the specific animal types per herd for the period 2007 to 2020 the si appendix 2 table a4 gives volumes of livestock drinking and service water consumption and table a5 herd sizes in pakistan from 1972 to 2020 in pakistan only five crops sugar cane rice cotton wheat and maize dominate total agricultural crop production in 1971 these crops contributed 86 and in 2020 89 to total crop production to put the development of agricultural blue wfs of pakistan for the period 1971 2020 in perspective we compared the results with the development of total agricultural production of the five main crops irrigated crop area as well as with the average yields and blue wfs of the five main crops data on total agricultural production and irrigated crop areas in 2020 were taken from the 36 data on areas and production of maize rice wheat sugarcane and cotton for the period 1971 2020 were taken from the 20 total agricultural blue wfs m3 tonne of the five main crops were calculated by dividing total agricultural blue wfs m3 year by the production of these crops tonnes year in year s 3 2 blue water footprints of the industrial sector 3 2 1 blue water footprints of electricity the electricity mix of pakistan in the period 1971 to 2020 was dominated by hydropower thermal power plants coal oil gas and bagasse from sugar mills and from nuclear power plants 53 54 in 2016 some wind and solar energy was added to the mix 55 we assessed the total wfs per electricity generating technology separately appendix 4 table a6 in the si gives an overview of the operational pakistani power plants their location capacity cooling type and whether there is water in the neighborhood information was derived from their nepra licenses 39 3 2 1 1 wfs of hydropower to calculate the blue wf of hydropower we first calculated the total blue wf wf k total m3 year per hydropower plant k as 6 w f k t o t a l 10 3 i 1 n a i k e k where a i k is the surface area of the ows i of power plant k km2 and e k is the average annual evaporation from reservoirs of power plant k mm year some hpps may have more than one ows and therefore equation 6 considers the sum of these areas the factor 103 is applied to convert the units and obtain a w f k t o t a l in m3 year despite the large differences between hpps types the calculation is the same for all hpps the values of a i k for each hpp were estimated by measuring the ows using satellite images from google earth the annual evaporation of the ows of the hpps was obtained from ref 56 or was calculated using the modified penman method 57 the evaporation from tarbela mangla warsak chashma barrage rasul barrage jagran i duber khwar gulpur jinnah new bong scape daral khwar ranolia nandipur shadiwal marala pehur and skardu i and ii was obtained from ref 56 based on proximity of these hpps to the locations included in this study the average annual evaporation e k mm year of the hpps whose location was not close to the reported locations in ref 56 was calculated using the modified penman equation as 7 e k 0 7 δ δ γ r n γ δ γ e a where δ is the saturated vapor pressure gradient γ is the psychometric constant r n is the effective net radiation and e a is the evaporation from a class a pan mm day we used climate data for the calculation of these variables long term average daily climate data except for solar radiation was obtained from the pakistan meteorological department 66 for the years 1953 2000 by coupling hpp owss to meteorological stations in the dataset the stations coupled with the ows were selected based on proximity and similar climatic conditions using the method from ref 45 solar radiation data of ows locations were obtained from the renewables ninja database 58 59 appendix 3 in the si gives the calculations of r n e a and the factors involving δ and γ the ows of two hpps have more than one purpose mangla and tarbela we therefore calculated the annual total blue wf per power plant k w f k o m3 year considering the allocation of the blue wf based on the annual economic output of the different ows purposes i e irrigation and electricity generation as 8 w f k o e k o e k t o t a l w f k t o t a l where e k o i s t h e a n n u a l e c o n o m i c o u t p u t o f a g r i c u l t u r e o r e l e c t r i c i t y a n d e k t o t a l is the total annual economic output of the ows data on annual economic output from 1976 to 2020 for mangla and tarbela hpps were obtained from the water power development authority wapda 2021 finally we calculated the blue wf of the two main hpp types reservoir and ror hpps of 1971 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 by summing the blue wf of the hpps of each type based on the composition of the electricity mix and by considering the variation of the economic output of the different purposes of the ows during those years 3 2 1 2 wfs of thermal power plants the wf of a thermal power plant tpp depends on its electricity generation cooling type and fuel we therefore first made an inventory of all tpps their cooling type fuel and installed capacity the study estimated the total wf per tpp fuel type t w f t m3 year as 9 w f t i c k t k 0 n n k i c k t e l k t w f t c where ic k t is the installed capacity of tpp k and fuel type t mw el k t is the total electricity generation of tpps with fuel type t tj year and wf t c is the wf of electricity from a tpp with a specific cooling type and fuel m3 tj data on installed capacity fuel and cooling type per power plant were taken from ref 39 appendix 4 table a6 in the si gives an overview of operational tpps and a reference to their nepra licenses data on total electricity generation were taken from the international energy agency 55 and on wfs of electricity from ref 16 for bagasse we assumed that cooling water consumption is the same as for coal because the bagasse is also burnt in a thermal power plant where blue wfs m3 tje depend on the cooling type of the plant and not on the hhv of the fuel some tpps use seawater or brackish water for cooling in that case the wf t c is zero appendix 5 table a7 in the si gives an overview of specific wfs of electricity m3 tje for different fuels and cooling types 3 2 2 blue water footprints of the manufacture sector in pakistan 1971 2020 the wfs of manufacture in pakistan m3 year for the period 1971 2020 were calculated for the dominant sectors i e sugar cotton yarn and cloth paper and board soda ash caustic soda fertilizer steel cement and bottled drinking water many studies assessed wfs of specific products taking a life cycle approach to assess wfs of consumption this study however aimed to calculate the wf of sectors to avoid double counting we only included the wfs of the processes to calculate wfs of manufacture and excluded wfs of electricity transport and mining we calculated the total annual wf of manufacture w f m m3 year as 10 w f m l 1 n p l l 1 o w f l m where p l is the total annual production of product l and wf l m is the wf of the manufacturing processes of product l data on manufactural production for the period 1971 2020 were taken from the pakistan bureau of statistics 2021 for soda ash and caustic soda no production data were available for the period 1971 1980 we estimated missing production data by extrapolating the regression trend for the period 1990 2020 we derived data on wfs of specific processes from wf studies although probably water use efficiency has increased since 1971 due to the limited availability of blue wfs for specific products we assumed that wfs of specific processes remained the same between 1971 and 2020 appendix 6 table a8 in the si gives the specific blue wfs of manufactural products and processes of products l kg and their sources 3 2 3 water footprint of mining pakistan has deposits of coal crude oil natural gas chromite gypsum limestone iron ore rock salt and marble no mining data were available for the period 1971 1980 we estimated missing mining data by extrapolating the regression trend for the period 1990 2020 we calculated the wf of mining in the same way as for manufacture data on production were taken from the pakistan bureau of statistics 2021 appendix 6 table a9 in the si gives an overview of the wfs of mining and their source 3 3 blue water footprints of municipal water supply the municipal water supply in pakistan is not well developed withdrawals supply and consumption are poorly estimated and documented the average annual municipal blue wf in year s wfmunicipal s 109 m3 year was calculated as 11 blue wfmunicipal s blue wfstorage blue wfconveyance s blue wfconsumer s herein blue wfstorage blue wfconveyance s and blue wfconsumer s are the water volumes consumed evaporative and non recoverable seepage losses during storage in reservoirs conveyance and consumer end water use in year s return flows to accessible groundwater and surface water e g sewage water are not considered a loss the blue wf of storage was calculated using equation 6 for the following reservoirs rawal simply khanpur and hub reservoirs and the hub keenjhar and halejee lakes data on annual evaporation were taken from ahmad et al 1963 and data on surface areas from several sources given in appendix 7 table a10 in the si the blue wf of conveyance is a fraction of withdrawal and calculated as 12 blue wfconveyance s ws lconveyance ws lconveyance g where ws is the annual freshwater withdrawal for municipal supply in year s lconveyance is the percentage of withdrawal that seeps away and g is the percentage of the seepage to accessible groundwater stocks annual withdrawal data were taken from ref 2 conveyance seepage of 75 was adopted from ref 30 and seepage to accessible groundwater stocks of 80 from ref 19 consumer end water use in year s blue wfconsumer s is also a fraction of withdrawal and calculated as 13 blue wfconsumer s ws 1 lconveyance f where f is the percentage of municipal water supply not ending up in the sewage and actually consumed the percentage of water ending up in the sewage of 90 of municipal water supply was taken from ref 28 we therefore assumed that f is 10 3 4 development blue water scarcity in pakistan 1971 2020 to estimate the development of blue water scarcity in pakistan for the period 1971 to 2020 we compared annual water runoff in the natural system to the annual total of sectoral blue wfs using a water balance approach we first estimated total annual blue surface water runoff bwr 109 m3 year in the natural system as 14 bwr bluewaterinflow bluewaterevaporation groundwater recharge herein bluewaterinflow is the annual water inflow of the rivers of the indus the kharan and makran basins 109 m3 year bluewaterevaporation is the net annual water evaporated from the river surface rainfall minus evaporation 109 m3 year groundwater recharge is the annual volume of water 109 m3 year that seeps from the rivers to groundwater stocks data on annual water inflow for the period 1971 to 2020 were taken from ref 52 net water evaporation and data on groundwater recharge from ref 19 we assessed water scarcity based on two categories of efrs fixed volumes and fixed fractions fixed efr volumes of 10 6 109 m3 per year were taken from the ipoe report 18 and of 33 3 109 m3 per year from the 60 for the fixed fractions we adopted the size of efrs of 50 from ref 50 and of 80 of the total blue surface water runoff from ref 6 water scarcity ws was calculated as 15 w s b l u e w f b w r e f r herein bluewf is the total annual blue wf of agriculture industry and municipal water 109 m3 year we adopted water scarcity severity ranges from ref 51 of low scarcity ws 1 0 moderate 1 0 ws 1 5 significant 1 5 ws 2 0 and severe scarcity ws 2 0 4 results we first show an overview of the blue wfs for all sectors next we give the development per sector 4 1 blue wfs in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 2 shows the development of the total blue wfs of the agricultural industrial and municipal water supply sectors in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 fig 2 shows that the blue wfs of agriculture remain the same but industrial and municipal blue wfs show an increase in addition not only the dominant role of the agricultural sector becomes clear but also the increasing competition over water among the sectors 4 2 development blue wfs agriculture in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 3 a d shows the annual agricultural blue wfs 3a the annual direct livestock blue wfs 3b agricultural blue wfs total agricultural production of the five main crops sugar cane rice cotton wheat and maize and average blue wfs for the five main crops 3c and the irrigated crop area average yield and total production of the five main crops 3d in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 fig 3a shows that the total annual agricultural blue wf of pakistan between 1971 and 2020 fluctuates between 109 2000 and 143 1990 109 m3 year surface water blue wfs show variation among years from 69 2000 to 88 1990 109 m3 year the figure also indicates that small blue surface wfs are not always compensated by larger blue groundwater wfs for example in 2000 both surface and groundwater wfs are relatively small in general there is no upwards trend in agricultural blue wfs between 1971 and 2020 fig 3b shows the large increase of drinking water requirements of the pakistani livestock sector that more than tripled between 1972 and 2020 in 1972 the blue wf was dominated by the wfs of cattle 43 buffaloes 33 and sheep 9 in 2020 the contribution of cattle was the same but the contribution of buffaloes increased to 38 while the contribution of sheep decreased to 5 although the blue wf of livestock increased it remains a small fraction of total agricultural blue wfs in 1972 it contributed 0 4 to the total wf in 2020 1 3 fig 3c shows the agricultural production increase in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 from 32 to 117 106 tonnes year the tripling of agricultural production was possible with about the same amount of irrigation water this is also reflected in the decrease of the average blue wf of the five main crops in pakistan wheat sugar cane cotton rice and maize from 3 5 to 1 1 m3 tonne fig 3d shows the reasons of the production increase of the five main crops in pakistan the first factor is the increase of agricultural land areas from 8 5 to 16 106 ha with the main increase between 1971 and 2000 the second factor is the yield increase from 41 to 77 tonnes ha with the largest increases after 2000 fig 2a d shows that production increase was possible with the same amounts of water especially the production of maize an important feed crop increased tenfold between 1971 and 2020 although livestock drinking water requirements are a minor part of agricultural water demand the blue wf of feed is relevant 4 3 development blue wfs industrial sector in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 4 a d shows the development of blue wfs for the industrial sector in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 fig 4a shows the development of blue wfs of electricity generation fig 4b of manufacture fig 4c of mining and fig 4d of the tree sectors electricity generation mining and manufacture fig 4a shows that hydropower always dominated the blue wfs of electricity generation electricity generation from the hpps with a reservoir contributes most to the total blue wf of electricity generation the contribution of the blue wf of ror hpps is far smaller some contribution comes from the thermal power plants fueled by oil coal and gas and some from nuclear plants the contribution from bagasse fueled power plants in the sugar industry is small the wf of solar and wind energy is negligible and not included in the figure between 1971 and 2020 all blue wfs increased except for hydropower which showed a peak in 1990 and then gradually decreased again this is not caused by smaller evaporation from the reservoirs but rather by a larger allocation to water for agricultural purposes based on economic profits fig 4b shows that yarn and cloth production always dominated the blue wf of manufacture while the contribution of other production is small between 1971 and 2020 the blue wf of yarn production increased tenfold while the blue wf of cloth production increased by only a factor of 1 7 the contribution of the other products like steel cement or water bottles is relatively small fig 4c shows the large contribution of coal mining to the blue wf of mining however especially the blue wf of limestone increased sixfold between 1990 and 2020 when it contributed one third to the total wf of mining the other mining products like marble natural gas and rock salt contribute only little fig 4d gives an overview of the development of the blue wf of the three industrial sectors in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 the blue wf is dominated by the blue wf of manufacture and electricity generation while the contribution of the blue wf of mining is negligible 0 1 0 2 the blue wf of manufacture contributed 76 in 1971 went down to 40 in 1990 and gradually increased again to 73 in 2020 4 4 development blue water footprints municipal water supply in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 5 shows the development of water withdrawal and blue water footprints of municipal water supply in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 the blue water footprint of municipal water supply is only a fraction of municipal water withdrawal ranging between 23 and 44 of the withdrawal between 1971 and 2020 withdrawal increased by a factor of six the blue wf though increased by a factor of 3 6 the difference is due to a larger fraction of municipal water supply that ends up in the sewage system and is not accounted as consumption part of the water is lost in the supply chain but another part is sewage water flowing to surface water bodies from where it can be reused 4 5 development water scarcity in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 6 a b shows the development of water scarcity in the indus makran and kharan basins fig 6a shows water scarcity for the indus basin using four different ways of calculating efrs for the period 1971 2020 fig 6b shows the average annual water scarcity for the indus makran and kharan basin in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 fig 6a shows that water scarcity in the indus basin depends on the definition of efrs if the category of set volumes is applied water scarcity remains below 1 i e low water scarcity except in 2000 if the efr of the 60 is applied if the category of set fractions of 50 of the bwr is applied water scarcity ranges between 1 17 in 2010 and 1 72 in 2000 so between moderate and significant scarcity however if 80 of bwr is used water scarcity ranges between 2 94 in 2010 and 4 31 in 2000 which is considered severe water scarcity appendix 8 table a11 a12 a13 and a14 in si gives the values fig 6b shows that water scarcity is far smaller in the makran and kharan basins than in the indus basin in these basins water scarcity lies between 0 64 makran basin efr 50 and 1 77 kharan basin efr 80 for the indus basin the average value for the period 1970 and 2020 lies between 1 44 efr 50 and 3 6 efr 80 5 discussion this study made a rough estimate of the development of blue wfs for the three sectors in pakistan agriculture industry and municipal water supply between 1971 and 2020 we had to make many assumptions due to limited data availability especially for the industrial and municipal sectors wfs of industrial products do not have time series so we applied recent data for an historical analysis for municipal water supply we encountered a similar lack of data from 2000 onwards annual withdrawal data from ref 2 remain the same which is probably not true agricultural withdrawal however is very well documented probably because it is the largest water consumer in pakistan although the study made many assumptions the general trend is clear agriculture has the largest blue wf by far while industry and municipal water supply contribute little to total national blue wfs however there is an increasing trend in 1971 the industrial blue wfs was 0 5 of the total blue wf in 2020 1 4 while the municipal water supply wf increased from 0 5 to 1 7 although 3 included water withdrawal they also showed the small contribution of the industrial and municipal sector in pakistan for the period 1997 to 2001 for the assessment of the blue wf of the agricultural sector we took a water balance approach starting from water withdrawal for which data are available and included the blue wf of the irrigation supply chain in the calculations this means that our blue wfs not only include the blue wf of crop production but also supply chain wfs so that the blue wfs calculated in here are far larger than assessed in earlier studies for example 61 calculated a blue wf of agricultural crop production in pakistan between 1996 and 2005 of 74 109 m3 while for 2000 our estimate is 109 109 m3 or 47 larger including the wf of the supply chain shows the enormous pressure of the agricultural sector on freshwater resources in pakistan the time trends give an indication of the possibilities of the agricultural sector to produce more with the same amount of water between 1971 and 2020 the sector was able to produce four times more without increasing its total blue wf showing the possibilities to become more water efficient this might make more water available for the industrial and municipal sectors that will probably keep growing in the future so with larger blue wfs to avoid competition in the future more efficient agriculture can make water available for the other sectors for example by identifying hotspots with relatively large water consumption and improve water efficiency or by moving crops to locations where blue wfs are smaller to become less dependent on agriculture the industrial sector could also try to become more water efficient for example the coca cola company already set targets to improve water use efficiency for its products more than ten years ago 67 another example comes from the textile industry according to the cleaner production institute pakistan cpi about 53 of the textile industries are moderately water efficient it has also shown that the industry can reduce its water consumption by 20 i e within process operations 62 it is therefore important to carefully investigate and manage the water consumption of each textile process to minimize water consumption 63 this is also valid for other industrial sectors and municipal water supply where most water is lost during conveyance and never reaches the consumer 30 the enormous blue wf of pakistan compared to its available water shows that it is a huge challenge for the three sectors to increase production and consume more water without harming the efrs production therefore needs to become more water efficient because the limits of how much water can be used are already reached there are different interpretations though concerning efrs and water scarcity the pakistani government has already set a cap on the volume of water that needs to remain in the environment an efr of 10 6 109 m3 per year that is needed to avoid salinity and seawater intrusion and complies with societal water demand 18 if efrs are set at 50 or even 80 of water inflow as used in water scarcity studies the consequences for the three sectors would be huge and efrs could increase to 87 to 140 109 m3 per year this would leave little water behind for societal demand water scarcity however differs among the basins and is less severe in the smaller basins in the south west of pakistan it is impossible to move agriculture to the makran and kharan basins because it is not an agricultural area for municipal water supply this is also not an option however for some industries that could move and face water scarcity at their present location of operation it might be an option policy might also play an important role to allocate sufficient freshwater to the country s main sectors especially the large water losses in supply chains would need an improved water infrastructure to avoid water shortage and competition in the future this example for pakistan might indicate pathways to avoid competition over scarce water resources in other water scarce countries 6 conclusions in pakistan like in many other countries agriculture is the largest blue water consumer by far the contribution of industry and municipal water supply is small from 1971 to 2020 the industrial blue wfs increased from 0 5 to 1 4 of the total national blue wf while the municipal water supply wf increased from 0 5 to 1 7 although the annual agricultural blue wf does not show an upwards trend agriculture has been able to increase production using the same water volumes in fifty years agricultural production tripled using the same amount of irrigation water the average blue wf of the five main crops in pakistan wheat sugar cane cotton rice and maize decreased from 3 5 to 1 1 m3 tonne livestock production also tripled which is reflected in the increase of drinking water requirements especially for cattle and buffaloes if agriculture is able to become even more water efficient more water becomes available for the other two sectors decreasing competition manufacture and electricity generation dominate blue wfs in the industrial sector while the contribution of the blue wf of mining is negligible 0 1 0 2 in 1971 the blue wf of manufacture contributed 76 to the total industrial blue wf of pakistan and 73 in 2020 yarn and cloth production dominate the blue wf of manufacture between 1971 and 2020 the blue wf of yarn production increased tenfold and of cloth production by 1 7 the contribution of the other products like steel cement or water bottles is relatively small hydropower dominated blue wfs of electricity generation electricity from hpps with a reservoir contributes most to the total blue wf the contribution of blue wfs of ror hpps is far smaller some contribution comes from thermal power plants fueled by oil coal and gas and some from nuclear plants the contribution from bagasse fueled power plants in the sugar industry is small between 1971 and 2020 all electricity blue wfs increased except for hydropower between 1971 and 2020 withdrawal for municipal water supply increased by a factor of six the blue wf though increased by a factor of 3 6 the difference is due to a larger fraction of municipal water supply that ends up in the sewage system and is not accounted as consumption part of the water is lost in the supply chain but another part is sewage water flowing to surface water bodies from where it can be reused especially the increasing pakistani population requires more municipal water supply blue water scarcity in pakistan depends on the definition of the environmental flow requirement efr selected for the large indus basin the definition of the government to use a fixed volume to meet societal requirements generates a low water scarcity however if higher efr s are applied e g 50 or 80 of the blue surface water runoff scarcity is moderate to severe in general though water scarcity in the indus basin is larger than in the kharan and makran basin competition over water might decrease if especially agriculture becomes more water efficient so that more water is available for industry and municipal water supply the industrial and municipal water supply sector however can also contribute and use water wisely this is needed because efr limits are already reached policy can play an important role to allocate sufficient freshwater to the country s main sectors especially the large water losses in supply chains would need an improved water infrastructure to avoid water shortage and competition in the future this example for pakistan might indicate pathways to avoid competition over scarce water resources in other water scarce countries author statement a w siyal conceptualization data

freshwater is essential for the functioning of human societies especially for agriculture producing food and fiber and for the energy system producing fuels heat and electricity in the 20th century not only freshwater consumption in agriculture but also in industry and municipal supply increased sharply 1 at present there is a continuous growth of water withdrawal not only in agriculture but also for the industrial and municipal supply 2 food and fibre production dominate global freshwater use with about 86 of total consumption 3 and 69 of total withdrawal 2 to feed the growing global population especially irrigation water supply increased enormously between 1900 and 1995 global irrigated areas expanded fivefold from 50 to 250 million hectares with half of these areas in only four countries three in asia i e china india and pakistan the other country with increasing irrigated areas is the united states 1 especially in asia most freshwater withdrawal 81 takes place in agriculture 2 freshwater is a scarce natural resource while the aquatic environment shows signs of degradation and decline 4 water availability studies for the major rivers in the world indicate blue water scarcity in many basins sometimes in specific periods of the year sometimes throughout the year 5 for example showed that in the period 1996 to 2005 two thirds of the world s population faced water scarcity for at least one month per year especially in the densely populated countries in south asia like india and pakistan the water situation is alarming blue surface water runoff or the freshwater present in natural river systems is an important source of water especially in densely populated river basins that depend on agriculture and have little rainfall if rainfall is limited there is too little green water i e rainwater stored in the soil available for crops causing green water scarcity in those cases often irrigation water from surface or groundwater compensates for green water scarcity 6 the indus river for example is an important source of freshwater for a densely populated basin mainly dependent on melting water from the glaciers of the tibetan plateau and mountains 7 for these basins it is relevant to understand the balance between supply in the form of available water and actual water consumption 8 however showed that there is an ambiguity in water terminology where words like water use consumptive water use withdrawal water requirement consumption and water demand make it difficult to make quantitative water assessments usable for policy guiding actions or to allocate water over users like farmers industry or municipal supply in this respect it is relevant to distinguish between consumptive water use and non consumptive water use consumptive blue water use can be defined as the volume of freshwater withdrawn from a surface water or groundwater stock for human use and is evaporated transpired or incorporated into products or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment and not returned at a later point in time 8 this consumption is sometimes expressed as a blue water footprint wf 6 water supply can be addressed as the inflow of freshwater in the form of river water inflow and precipitation and the outflow as evaporation seepage to inaccessible groundwater stocks and eventually outflow to the sea wfs are expressed as the wf of a product a person a business or a nation as a whole including its agricultural industrial and municipal sectors 6 although most attention normally goes to the dominant agricultural wfs the industry has recently developed more attention for water use efficiency and some industries might even focus on decreasing their blue wf to zero 9 although differences among countries exist in general agriculture is the largest water consumer while wfs of industry and municipal water supply are far smaller 3 however agricultural water consumption competes with these other users 10 in pakistan in 2008 the agricultural blue and green precipitation wf was a hundred times larger than the industrial blue wf and 50 times the municipal blue wf 11 in 1977 pakistani agriculture withdrew 98 of freshwater industry and municipalities only 1 each in 2017 the contribution of agriculture decreased to 94 of the industry to 0 8 while municipalities took 5 of withdrawn water 2 for comparison in france an important agricultural producer in 2017 agricultural withdrawal was only 12 of total withdrawal but industrial and municipal water withdrawal was 67 and 20 respectively 2 showing the importance of water withdrawal of the industrial and municipal sectors in an industrialized country if freshwater is limited increasing water withdrawal might cause competition among sectors there is a limited amount of studies that assessed the wfs for a specific river basin for the basins in the eu 12 calculated the wfs related to consumption showing the large wfs in densely populated basins 13 assessed the wf of production and consumption in the guadiana basin in spain indicating the dominant contribution of the agricultural sector compared to industry and municipal water supply they also emphasized the importance of proper water management later 14 assessed wf of the segura basin in spain showing the contribution from the agricultural industrial and municipal sectors to total wfs also in relation to virtual water import and export information on national sectoral water withdrawal is available for most countries in the world starting in the sixties of the last century 2 but assessments of the development of water consumption or blue wfs per sector i e agriculture industry and municipal water supply are scarce wf data though are available for products based on a chain approach for example on sugar 15 electricity 16 or construction materials like cement 17 water scarcity is the main reason to make quantification of blue wfs and compare human water consumption with available water in a specific basin there are different ways to assess water scarcity though dependent on different views in pakistan for example the government has set a cap on the volume of water or environmental flow requirement efr that needs to remain in the river indus 18 while hogeboom et al 2021 and 6 define efrs as fractions of available water in a specific basin leading to different outcomes of water scarcity the aim of this study is to assess and evaluate blue wf developments of the industrial sector compared to wfs in agriculture and municipal water supply in a developing water scarce country with both limited green and blue water resources the three research questions are i what is the development of industrial blue water consumption and municipal water supply in a developing water scarce country compared to blue wfs of agriculture in the past fifty years ii can increased water use efficiency in agriculture contribute to guarantee sufficient water supply in the other two sectors in the future and iii what was the development of water scarcity in pakistan in the last fifty years for the assessment of competition over water the study took pakistan as the case study area this is done because pakistan is one of the four fast growing blue water consumers it is located in an extremely water scarce region its water source the indus is well described it shows economic growth in combination with fast population growth and data are available from the pakistani government in english for the assessment the study applied information from an earlier study into blue agricultural wfs in pakistan 19 governmental information on production and river water inflow and data on specific process wfs of products derived from wf studies that used a chain approach the innovation and contribution of the study to existing knowledge is that by making a detailed analysis of the development of blue wfs per sector in the last fifty years and fluctuations of water scarcity in the indus basin in pakistan it shows directions of change towards more efficient production using limited water resources in a sustainable way it identifies sectoral hotspots that if improved can make more water available for other users and decrease competition among or in sectors this information is relevant for policy makers and industry not only in pakistan but in all basins that encounter green and blue water scarcity 2 system analysis 2 1 development agricultural industrial and municipal sectors in pakistan since 1971 after being a colony of great britain india and pakistan including bangladesh became independent in 1947 in 1971 pakistan and bangladesh went their own way so that data on the country pakistan is available from that year on agriculture in pakistan includes two important sectors primary and secondary production five main crops i e sugar cane cotton rice wheat and maize dominate primary production 20 secondary production includes animal husbandry i e cattle buffaloes sheep goats horses mules asses camels mules and chickens 21 in pakistan primary production is most important with 35 of the land used as arable land especially in the provinces punjab and sindh where only 6 5 is grazing land economically agriculture dominates with 61 of the total population working in the sector the size of the cropping areas shows an increasing trend while the size of grazing lands remains the same 22 the population in pakistan more than tripled after the separation from bangladesh from 60 million in 1971 to 212 million in 2018 to feed the increasing population agricultural production kept pace with demand for example rice production increased 3 2 times and wheat production 3 9 times 20 especially consumption of livestock foods increased between 1971 and 2013 beef consumption increased from 5 to 9 kg per capita per year poultry from 0 24 to 5 kg eggs from 0 3 to 3 kg and milk from 106 to 183 kg per capita per year 20 pakistan s industrial sector mainly relies on the production of goods with a low value added and depends on low skilled labor the contribution of agriculture to the national gdp declines in favor of the service based economy 23 compared to other asian countries pakistan shows poor industrial performance its main manufacturing industries textiles and clothing show a relative decline in the world market 24 apart from the textile and clothing industry other relevant products from the manufacturing industry are sugar cigarettes fertilizer cement glass steel paper and board soda cars and bicycles 25 another relevant sector is the manufacturing of bottled drinking water 26 needed because municipal water quality is poor next the industrial sector includes the electricity sector and mining electricity is generated by thermal power plants coal oil natural gas nuclear power hydropower and renewables bagasse wind and solar energy national electric power regulatory authority nepra 2020 pakistan is a large sugar producer with around 75 sugar mills 20 apart from sugar bagasse is an important byproduct that is burned to generate heat and electricity for example ryk mills limited in punjab has a capacity of 12 000 tons of sugar cane per day generating 3600 tons of bagasse it built a 30 mw bagasse cofired power plant to generate electricity for its own needs while it sells the rest to the national grid 65 the total installed capacity of bagasse fueled power plants is around 1000 mw national electric power regulatory authority nepra 2020 mining includes the mining of minerals e g iron ore limestone and chromite and fossil fuels like crude oil coal and natural gas 27 2 2 freshwater resources in pakistan fig 1 shows that pakistan comprises three hydrologic units the indus basin the kharan desert system and the makran coastal drainage most surface and groundwater resources are located in the indus basin that covers 65 of the area of pakistan with 95 of its water resources 28 the river indus provides water for the irrigation network that includes two large reservoirs the tarbela and mangla reservoir and main and linking canals between rivers in the pakistani part of the indus basin next the kharan and makran basins also provide some surface water 28 there are seven rivers in the makran basin of balochistan 18 of the area of pakistan and four rivers in the kharan basin 17 of pakistan these rivers are low volume intermittent rivers but important for the local populations 28 the surface water infrastructure includes the water supply chain from the source where the inlet of river water occurs to the crop fields 29 initially the tarbela and mangla reservoirs were built to store freshwater for agriculture but later hydropower was installed generating a profit in the form of electricity apart from the available surface water pakistan also has groundwater stocks when there is a need of freshwater and surface water is not available in sufficient quantities groundwater is pumped up for example for irrigation purposes 30 or to cool power plants in the sugar industry national electric power regulatory authority nepra 2021 2 3 water footprint concept the water footprint wf concept provides a tool to assess the human consumption of freshwater 6 tony allan introduced the earlier concept of embedded water later renamed as virtual water 31 the wf assesses water consumption in production chains so that all freshwater needed to produce a good or service is accounted for this generates information on wfs of the products in combination with consumption data wfs of persons companies or nations become available the wf differentiates between green water from precipitation blue water from surface water or groundwater and grey water defined as the volume of water needed to dilute polluted water to accepted water quality standards many studies have made assessments of wfs of specific products e g wfs of crops 15 livestock products 32 steel cement and glass 17 sugar 33 or cotton 34 recently 19 have shown the relevance of blue wfs of the irrigation water supply chain in pakistan 2 4 agriculture in pakistan 2 4 1 blue water footprints and crop production in developing countries like pakistan national wfs are dominated by water consumption in agriculture while industrial and municipal water consumption is relatively small 3 almost all crops in pakistan depend on irrigation water either surface water or pumped groundwater because green water is scarce 19 surface water is supplied by the largest gravity fed canal network in the world 35 if there is a surface water shortage farmers pump up groundwater 19 between 1972 and 2000 the irrigated crop area increased by 50 the irrigated area of the five main crops sugar cane cotton rice wheat and maize increased from 10 2 106 ha in 1972 to 15 7 106 ha in 2000 then the increase slowed down in 2020 the agricultural area was about 16 8 106 ha 36 in the same period the production of the five main crops showed a linear growth from 32 106 tonnes per year in 1972 to 117 tonnes per year in 2020 20 2 4 2 blue water footprints and livestock production livestock in pakistan includes the following categories cattle buffaloes sheep goats camels assess horses mules ducks poultry and pets especially the herds of cattle buffaloes sheep and goats are relatively large livestock herd sizes increased between 1972 and 2020 21 37 38 livestock in pakistan mainly depends on non irrigated grazing lands and on feed crops produced in the country itself 22 next to the wf of the feed the animals receive drinking water while service water is needed for cleaning purposes 2 5 blue water footprints and industrial production industrial sectors in pakistan that generate a blue wf are the electricity and manufacturing sectors thermal power plants need an operating license from the national electric power regulatory authority nepra of the islamic republic of pakistan these detailed licenses give the exact location technical information including cooling type and source of cooling water and the builder and owner of the facility all information is available in english on the website of 39 2 5 1 blue water footprints and electricity production thermal power plants tpps contribute a large share of electricity to the pakistani grid in 1947 it was the dominant electricity supplier with a share of 80 the other 20 was supplied by hydropower plants hpps pakistan bureau of statistics 50 years of pakistan however with the building of the large water reservoirs for agriculture and installation of hydropower turbines gradually hydropower became more important in 1953 hpps generated more electricity 871 tj than ttps 817 tj in 1970 the first nuclear power plant became operational in 2020 though 59 of electricity is produced by tpps 31 by hpps 8 by nuclear power and another 3 by other renewables 40 2 5 1 1 blue water footprints of thermal and nuclear power plants the cooling type of tpps mainly determine their blue wfs cooling types include open loop cooling where water is taken in and released again with a higher temperature closed cycle cooling where water evaporates from a cooling tower or air cooling that does not need water 16 if salt water is applied no blue wf is generated especially in the south of pakistan tpps use sea or brackish water in their open loop cooling systems next to the cooling water some water is needed for services and dust suppression 16 some tpps function as a backup source for hydropower for example attock gen limited agl located at morgah rawalpindi it compensates for hydropower shortage in winter 41 also nuclear power plants use water for cooling the two installations in karachi use seawater the other four chasnupp 1 to 4 use freshwater from the chashma lake feeded by the indus river for their closed cycle cooling 39 2 5 1 2 blue water footprints of hydropower hpps blue wf is accounted as the water evaporation from their open water surfaces ows e g impoundments reservoirs and open canals 42 43 these wfs depend on climate geography energy planning and water storage schemes 43 hpps infrastructure varies greatly depending on the geographical and topographical features of the place where they are located these differences may indicate different technologies used to produce electricity namely reservoir and run of the river ror hpps 44 reservoir type hpps impound large volumes of water by means of a dam ror hpps deviate the river flow by means of a series of constructions such as weirs canals small dams and surge tanks reservoir hpps usually have larger blue wfs than their ror counterparts as their owss are larger 45 2 5 1 3 blue water footprints of bagasse fueled power plants in pakistan sugar manufacturing plants normally use the bagasse that becomes available in the sugar production process to generate electricity according to the nepra licenses the bagasse fueled power plants mostly use groundwater in closed cycle cooling systems some sugar mills apply surface water e g the madina sugar mill pvt ltd in punjab 39 2 5 1 4 blue water footprints of wind and solar energy blue wfs of wind and solar energy are relatively small some water is needed to clean solar pv panels 16 2 5 2 blue water footprints and production of manufacturing industries some manufacturing industries use freshwater in their processes for example for the bleaching dying and printing of cotton 34 or in the production process of steel cement and glass 17 for the manufacturing of bottled water also water is needed to produce the pet water bottle the processing of the water treatment and in the cooling system of the electricity consumed together the blue wf of 1 l of bottled water is around 15 l 26 2 5 3 blue water footprints and production of mining some mining processes need freshwater for example to cool the drilling machinery in pakistan deposits of coal crude oil natural gas chromite gypsum limestone iron ore rock salt and marble are available 2 6 blue water footprints of municipal water supply in pakistan municipal water supply in urban areas is primarily controlled by the public sector and individual households with private pumping 46 per capita water consumption varies between 30 l per capita per day in rural areas to 350 l per capita per day in some cities 47 groundwater is the main source of municipal water however the cities karachi hyderabad islamabad and rawalpindi mainly depend on surface water the rawal simply and khanpur reservoirs supply water to islamabad and rawalpindi 48 the hub keenjhar and halejee lakes store surface water for karachi 49 other cities rely on groundwater in pakistan most withdrawn water is lost during conveyance 30 which indicates the poor municipal water infrastructure however part of this water flows to accessible groundwater stocks and remains available for use when the municipal water arrives at the consumers part of the water is lost i e consumed and part goes to the sewage system often agriculture reuses that sewage water 20 and from a wf perspective it is not consumed 2 7 environmental flow requirements in the indus makran and kharan basin in the indus basin in pakistan environmental flow requirements efrs or the volume of water that needs to remain in the river is a topic of concern with different subjective perspectives important issues are not only to avoid salinity in the basin coastal instability in the delta impact on fisheries and nature but also to provide water to the economy 18 to arrive at a realistic optimum the international panel of experts ipoe an advisory committee for the pakistani government has proposed an efr for the basin downstream the kottri barrage of 10 6 109 m3 per year 18 this is a small value compared to the advice of the international union for conservation of nature iucn 2004 of 33 3 109 m3 per year other studies that made an analysis for the efrs of the indus have used relative values 50 applied an efr of 50 of the runoff while 5 51 used an efr of 80 based on the wf manual 6 showing the huge water scarcity in the indus basin for the makran and kharan basins though there are no governmental volumetric caps set for the efrs 3 method and data this study assessed the blue wfs per sector agriculture the industrial sector and municipal water supply in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 agriculture includes crop production and livestock farming the industrial sector includes the most relevant sectors in pakistan i electricity production ii manufacture of sugar cotton yarn and cloth paper and board soda ash caustic soda fertilizer steel cement and bottled drinking water and iii mining of coal crude oil natural gas limestone iron ore rock salt gypsum aragonite marble and chromite data on production were taken from the 20 available reports of the central bureau of statistics of the government of pakistan and from the international energy agency iea there are many studies using a life cycle approach that assessed the wf of a specific product from cradle to consumer giving an overview of direct and indirect virtual wfs of a specific product per chain link 64 this study took data from supply chain analyses to arrive at the blue wfs of the three sectors in pakistan the study collected data from water management and wf studies that include blue wfs of processes in a specific link of a production chain for example the wf of a cotton crop is included in the agricultural sector the production of cotton yarn in the industrial sector while the washing of cotton clothes is included in the wf of the municipal sector the calculations per sector are given below to put the blue wfs into perspective the study compared the blue wfs with water withdrawal the study took data on agricultural water withdrawal from the indus river system authority 52 and for the industrial and municipal sector from aquastat 2 for the industrial sector withdrawals in pakistan aquastat however reports increasing withdrawals from 1 7 109 m3 in 1971 to 3 0 109 m3 in 2000 after 2000 it reports decreasing numbers so that in 2010 and 2020 withdrawals are only half of the values in 2000 although industrial production increased we therefore assumed that there is a ratio between withdrawals and blue wfs we calculated the average ratio for the years 1971 1980 1990 and 2000 and applied this average to estimate the withdrawals for 2010 and 2020 after the assessment of sectoral blue wfs we compared the total annual surface water consumption with water availability for the period 1971 to 2020 giving an indication of the development of water scarcity in pakistan 3 1 estimation of blue water footprints of agriculture agriculture in pakistan consists of arable and livestock farming most crops receive irrigation blue water either from surface or from groundwater the assessment of the total annual agricultural blue surface water footprint for the indus kharan and makran basins for the period 1971 to 2020 in year s blue wf totalsurface s km3 year was calculated as 1 blue wf totalsurface s w s s sfa s s herein w s s is the total surface water withdrawal in the first link of the supply chain 109 m3 year in year s and sfa s s is the groundwater recharge from surface water to a freshwater aquifer 109 m3 year in year s we derived data on water withdrawal for the indus basin in the period 1971 to 2020 from ref 52 for the kharan and makran basins annual inflow and withdrawal data are not available however 28 showed average inflow and withdrawal for both basins for 2007 based on those data we calculated the fractions of inflows from the indus basin and the kharan and makran basins of 1 7 and 3 2 of the indus basin inflow we used these fractions to estimate annual inflow of the kharan and makran basins for the period 1971 2020 assuming that the inflow fractions remain the same we calculated annual agricultural water withdrawal in the makran and kharan basins as a percentage of the inflow using information on inflow and withdrawal for 2007 from ref 28 we arrived at a withdrawal of 17 kharan basin and 22 makran basin of the inflow and assumed that these percentages remain constant in the period 1971 2020 see also appendix 1 table a1 in the si we assumed that groundwater recharge from surface water gr s is a percentage of water withdrawal calculated as 2 g r s g r a w a 100 herein gr a is the average groundwater recharge from surface water 109 m3 year and w a is the average surface water withdrawal 109 m3 year in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 we derived data on average groundwater recharge of 45 6 109 m3 per year from ref 19 and on surface water withdrawal of 119 2 132 3 109 m3 per year from ref 28 for the makran and kharan basins we assumed that 22 of the inflow contributes to groundwater recharge see also appendix 1 table a2 in the si the assessment of the total agricultural blue groundwater footprint for the period 1971 to 2020 bluewf totalgroundwater s m3 year in year s was calculated in a similar way as 3 bluewf totalgroundwater s w g s sfa g s herein w g s is the groundwater withdrawal m3 year in year s sfa g s is the groundwater recharge from groundwater pumping m3 year in year s which is a fraction of w g s of 17 19 we assumed that there is a balance in groundwater recharge and withdrawal so that groundwater tables are constant groundwater withdrawal w g s m3 year was assumed to be equal to 4 w g s s f a s s s f a g s r r a i n s herein r rain s is the average annual groundwater recharge from rain m3 year data on rainwater recharge for 2007 are available from ref 28 we assumed that rainwater recharge is a fraction of water inflow calculated using data on inflow and groundwater recharge from rainfall for 2007 from ref 28 rainwater recharge is 7 5 indus basin 19 kharan basin and 13 4 makran basin of the inflow see appendix 1 table a3 in the si water for arable farming also includes water for feed crops for the assessment of the total blue wf of agriculture to avoid double counting we only added animal drinking water requirements per livestock category a to the blue wfs of agriculture animal drinking water requirements wf drinking a s 109 m3 year in year s were calculated as 5 w f d r i n k i n g a s a 1 n w f a p a s herein wf a is the specific drinking water requirement of animal a m3 year and p a s is the size of animal herd a in year s we derived data on specific drinking water requirements per animal from mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 and data on animal herd sizes for the period 1972 to 2006 from pakistan livestock census reports 21 37 38 the governmental statistics division of pakistan performed livestock census assessments for the years 1972 1996 and 2006 estimates of annual livestock herd sizes for the period 1972 to 2020 are available based on interpolation and extrapolation of census data based on growth rates for the period 2007 2020 only total livestock numbers per category are available to assess the wfs of animal drinking water we applied the ratios of 2006 to estimate the specific animal types per herd for the period 2007 to 2020 the si appendix 2 table a4 gives volumes of livestock drinking and service water consumption and table a5 herd sizes in pakistan from 1972 to 2020 in pakistan only five crops sugar cane rice cotton wheat and maize dominate total agricultural crop production in 1971 these crops contributed 86 and in 2020 89 to total crop production to put the development of agricultural blue wfs of pakistan for the period 1971 2020 in perspective we compared the results with the development of total agricultural production of the five main crops irrigated crop area as well as with the average yields and blue wfs of the five main crops data on total agricultural production and irrigated crop areas in 2020 were taken from the 36 data on areas and production of maize rice wheat sugarcane and cotton for the period 1971 2020 were taken from the 20 total agricultural blue wfs m3 tonne of the five main crops were calculated by dividing total agricultural blue wfs m3 year by the production of these crops tonnes year in year s 3 2 blue water footprints of the industrial sector 3 2 1 blue water footprints of electricity the electricity mix of pakistan in the period 1971 to 2020 was dominated by hydropower thermal power plants coal oil gas and bagasse from sugar mills and from nuclear power plants 53 54 in 2016 some wind and solar energy was added to the mix 55 we assessed the total wfs per electricity generating technology separately appendix 4 table a6 in the si gives an overview of the operational pakistani power plants their location capacity cooling type and whether there is water in the neighborhood information was derived from their nepra licenses 39 3 2 1 1 wfs of hydropower to calculate the blue wf of hydropower we first calculated the total blue wf wf k total m3 year per hydropower plant k as 6 w f k t o t a l 10 3 i 1 n a i k e k where a i k is the surface area of the ows i of power plant k km2 and e k is the average annual evaporation from reservoirs of power plant k mm year some hpps may have more than one ows and therefore equation 6 considers the sum of these areas the factor 103 is applied to convert the units and obtain a w f k t o t a l in m3 year despite the large differences between hpps types the calculation is the same for all hpps the values of a i k for each hpp were estimated by measuring the ows using satellite images from google earth the annual evaporation of the ows of the hpps was obtained from ref 56 or was calculated using the modified penman method 57 the evaporation from tarbela mangla warsak chashma barrage rasul barrage jagran i duber khwar gulpur jinnah new bong scape daral khwar ranolia nandipur shadiwal marala pehur and skardu i and ii was obtained from ref 56 based on proximity of these hpps to the locations included in this study the average annual evaporation e k mm year of the hpps whose location was not close to the reported locations in ref 56 was calculated using the modified penman equation as 7 e k 0 7 δ δ γ r n γ δ γ e a where δ is the saturated vapor pressure gradient γ is the psychometric constant r n is the effective net radiation and e a is the evaporation from a class a pan mm day we used climate data for the calculation of these variables long term average daily climate data except for solar radiation was obtained from the pakistan meteorological department 66 for the years 1953 2000 by coupling hpp owss to meteorological stations in the dataset the stations coupled with the ows were selected based on proximity and similar climatic conditions using the method from ref 45 solar radiation data of ows locations were obtained from the renewables ninja database 58 59 appendix 3 in the si gives the calculations of r n e a and the factors involving δ and γ the ows of two hpps have more than one purpose mangla and tarbela we therefore calculated the annual total blue wf per power plant k w f k o m3 year considering the allocation of the blue wf based on the annual economic output of the different ows purposes i e irrigation and electricity generation as 8 w f k o e k o e k t o t a l w f k t o t a l where e k o i s t h e a n n u a l e c o n o m i c o u t p u t o f a g r i c u l t u r e o r e l e c t r i c i t y a n d e k t o t a l is the total annual economic output of the ows data on annual economic output from 1976 to 2020 for mangla and tarbela hpps were obtained from the water power development authority wapda 2021 finally we calculated the blue wf of the two main hpp types reservoir and ror hpps of 1971 1980 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 by summing the blue wf of the hpps of each type based on the composition of the electricity mix and by considering the variation of the economic output of the different purposes of the ows during those years 3 2 1 2 wfs of thermal power plants the wf of a thermal power plant tpp depends on its electricity generation cooling type and fuel we therefore first made an inventory of all tpps their cooling type fuel and installed capacity the study estimated the total wf per tpp fuel type t w f t m3 year as 9 w f t i c k t k 0 n n k i c k t e l k t w f t c where ic k t is the installed capacity of tpp k and fuel type t mw el k t is the total electricity generation of tpps with fuel type t tj year and wf t c is the wf of electricity from a tpp with a specific cooling type and fuel m3 tj data on installed capacity fuel and cooling type per power plant were taken from ref 39 appendix 4 table a6 in the si gives an overview of operational tpps and a reference to their nepra licenses data on total electricity generation were taken from the international energy agency 55 and on wfs of electricity from ref 16 for bagasse we assumed that cooling water consumption is the same as for coal because the bagasse is also burnt in a thermal power plant where blue wfs m3 tje depend on the cooling type of the plant and not on the hhv of the fuel some tpps use seawater or brackish water for cooling in that case the wf t c is zero appendix 5 table a7 in the si gives an overview of specific wfs of electricity m3 tje for different fuels and cooling types 3 2 2 blue water footprints of the manufacture sector in pakistan 1971 2020 the wfs of manufacture in pakistan m3 year for the period 1971 2020 were calculated for the dominant sectors i e sugar cotton yarn and cloth paper and board soda ash caustic soda fertilizer steel cement and bottled drinking water many studies assessed wfs of specific products taking a life cycle approach to assess wfs of consumption this study however aimed to calculate the wf of sectors to avoid double counting we only included the wfs of the processes to calculate wfs of manufacture and excluded wfs of electricity transport and mining we calculated the total annual wf of manufacture w f m m3 year as 10 w f m l 1 n p l l 1 o w f l m where p l is the total annual production of product l and wf l m is the wf of the manufacturing processes of product l data on manufactural production for the period 1971 2020 were taken from the pakistan bureau of statistics 2021 for soda ash and caustic soda no production data were available for the period 1971 1980 we estimated missing production data by extrapolating the regression trend for the period 1990 2020 we derived data on wfs of specific processes from wf studies although probably water use efficiency has increased since 1971 due to the limited availability of blue wfs for specific products we assumed that wfs of specific processes remained the same between 1971 and 2020 appendix 6 table a8 in the si gives the specific blue wfs of manufactural products and processes of products l kg and their sources 3 2 3 water footprint of mining pakistan has deposits of coal crude oil natural gas chromite gypsum limestone iron ore rock salt and marble no mining data were available for the period 1971 1980 we estimated missing mining data by extrapolating the regression trend for the period 1990 2020 we calculated the wf of mining in the same way as for manufacture data on production were taken from the pakistan bureau of statistics 2021 appendix 6 table a9 in the si gives an overview of the wfs of mining and their source 3 3 blue water footprints of municipal water supply the municipal water supply in pakistan is not well developed withdrawals supply and consumption are poorly estimated and documented the average annual municipal blue wf in year s wfmunicipal s 109 m3 year was calculated as 11 blue wfmunicipal s blue wfstorage blue wfconveyance s blue wfconsumer s herein blue wfstorage blue wfconveyance s and blue wfconsumer s are the water volumes consumed evaporative and non recoverable seepage losses during storage in reservoirs conveyance and consumer end water use in year s return flows to accessible groundwater and surface water e g sewage water are not considered a loss the blue wf of storage was calculated using equation 6 for the following reservoirs rawal simply khanpur and hub reservoirs and the hub keenjhar and halejee lakes data on annual evaporation were taken from ahmad et al 1963 and data on surface areas from several sources given in appendix 7 table a10 in the si the blue wf of conveyance is a fraction of withdrawal and calculated as 12 blue wfconveyance s ws lconveyance ws lconveyance g where ws is the annual freshwater withdrawal for municipal supply in year s lconveyance is the percentage of withdrawal that seeps away and g is the percentage of the seepage to accessible groundwater stocks annual withdrawal data were taken from ref 2 conveyance seepage of 75 was adopted from ref 30 and seepage to accessible groundwater stocks of 80 from ref 19 consumer end water use in year s blue wfconsumer s is also a fraction of withdrawal and calculated as 13 blue wfconsumer s ws 1 lconveyance f where f is the percentage of municipal water supply not ending up in the sewage and actually consumed the percentage of water ending up in the sewage of 90 of municipal water supply was taken from ref 28 we therefore assumed that f is 10 3 4 development blue water scarcity in pakistan 1971 2020 to estimate the development of blue water scarcity in pakistan for the period 1971 to 2020 we compared annual water runoff in the natural system to the annual total of sectoral blue wfs using a water balance approach we first estimated total annual blue surface water runoff bwr 109 m3 year in the natural system as 14 bwr bluewaterinflow bluewaterevaporation groundwater recharge herein bluewaterinflow is the annual water inflow of the rivers of the indus the kharan and makran basins 109 m3 year bluewaterevaporation is the net annual water evaporated from the river surface rainfall minus evaporation 109 m3 year groundwater recharge is the annual volume of water 109 m3 year that seeps from the rivers to groundwater stocks data on annual water inflow for the period 1971 to 2020 were taken from ref 52 net water evaporation and data on groundwater recharge from ref 19 we assessed water scarcity based on two categories of efrs fixed volumes and fixed fractions fixed efr volumes of 10 6 109 m3 per year were taken from the ipoe report 18 and of 33 3 109 m3 per year from the 60 for the fixed fractions we adopted the size of efrs of 50 from ref 50 and of 80 of the total blue surface water runoff from ref 6 water scarcity ws was calculated as 15 w s b l u e w f b w r e f r herein bluewf is the total annual blue wf of agriculture industry and municipal water 109 m3 year we adopted water scarcity severity ranges from ref 51 of low scarcity ws 1 0 moderate 1 0 ws 1 5 significant 1 5 ws 2 0 and severe scarcity ws 2 0 4 results we first show an overview of the blue wfs for all sectors next we give the development per sector 4 1 blue wfs in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 2 shows the development of the total blue wfs of the agricultural industrial and municipal water supply sectors in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 fig 2 shows that the blue wfs of agriculture remain the same but industrial and municipal blue wfs show an increase in addition not only the dominant role of the agricultural sector becomes clear but also the increasing competition over water among the sectors 4 2 development blue wfs agriculture in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 3 a d shows the annual agricultural blue wfs 3a the annual direct livestock blue wfs 3b agricultural blue wfs total agricultural production of the five main crops sugar cane rice cotton wheat and maize and average blue wfs for the five main crops 3c and the irrigated crop area average yield and total production of the five main crops 3d in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 fig 3a shows that the total annual agricultural blue wf of pakistan between 1971 and 2020 fluctuates between 109 2000 and 143 1990 109 m3 year surface water blue wfs show variation among years from 69 2000 to 88 1990 109 m3 year the figure also indicates that small blue surface wfs are not always compensated by larger blue groundwater wfs for example in 2000 both surface and groundwater wfs are relatively small in general there is no upwards trend in agricultural blue wfs between 1971 and 2020 fig 3b shows the large increase of drinking water requirements of the pakistani livestock sector that more than tripled between 1972 and 2020 in 1972 the blue wf was dominated by the wfs of cattle 43 buffaloes 33 and sheep 9 in 2020 the contribution of cattle was the same but the contribution of buffaloes increased to 38 while the contribution of sheep decreased to 5 although the blue wf of livestock increased it remains a small fraction of total agricultural blue wfs in 1972 it contributed 0 4 to the total wf in 2020 1 3 fig 3c shows the agricultural production increase in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 from 32 to 117 106 tonnes year the tripling of agricultural production was possible with about the same amount of irrigation water this is also reflected in the decrease of the average blue wf of the five main crops in pakistan wheat sugar cane cotton rice and maize from 3 5 to 1 1 m3 tonne fig 3d shows the reasons of the production increase of the five main crops in pakistan the first factor is the increase of agricultural land areas from 8 5 to 16 106 ha with the main increase between 1971 and 2000 the second factor is the yield increase from 41 to 77 tonnes ha with the largest increases after 2000 fig 2a d shows that production increase was possible with the same amounts of water especially the production of maize an important feed crop increased tenfold between 1971 and 2020 although livestock drinking water requirements are a minor part of agricultural water demand the blue wf of feed is relevant 4 3 development blue wfs industrial sector in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 4 a d shows the development of blue wfs for the industrial sector in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 fig 4a shows the development of blue wfs of electricity generation fig 4b of manufacture fig 4c of mining and fig 4d of the tree sectors electricity generation mining and manufacture fig 4a shows that hydropower always dominated the blue wfs of electricity generation electricity generation from the hpps with a reservoir contributes most to the total blue wf of electricity generation the contribution of the blue wf of ror hpps is far smaller some contribution comes from the thermal power plants fueled by oil coal and gas and some from nuclear plants the contribution from bagasse fueled power plants in the sugar industry is small the wf of solar and wind energy is negligible and not included in the figure between 1971 and 2020 all blue wfs increased except for hydropower which showed a peak in 1990 and then gradually decreased again this is not caused by smaller evaporation from the reservoirs but rather by a larger allocation to water for agricultural purposes based on economic profits fig 4b shows that yarn and cloth production always dominated the blue wf of manufacture while the contribution of other production is small between 1971 and 2020 the blue wf of yarn production increased tenfold while the blue wf of cloth production increased by only a factor of 1 7 the contribution of the other products like steel cement or water bottles is relatively small fig 4c shows the large contribution of coal mining to the blue wf of mining however especially the blue wf of limestone increased sixfold between 1990 and 2020 when it contributed one third to the total wf of mining the other mining products like marble natural gas and rock salt contribute only little fig 4d gives an overview of the development of the blue wf of the three industrial sectors in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 the blue wf is dominated by the blue wf of manufacture and electricity generation while the contribution of the blue wf of mining is negligible 0 1 0 2 the blue wf of manufacture contributed 76 in 1971 went down to 40 in 1990 and gradually increased again to 73 in 2020 4 4 development blue water footprints municipal water supply in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 5 shows the development of water withdrawal and blue water footprints of municipal water supply in pakistan between 1971 and 2020 the blue water footprint of municipal water supply is only a fraction of municipal water withdrawal ranging between 23 and 44 of the withdrawal between 1971 and 2020 withdrawal increased by a factor of six the blue wf though increased by a factor of 3 6 the difference is due to a larger fraction of municipal water supply that ends up in the sewage system and is not accounted as consumption part of the water is lost in the supply chain but another part is sewage water flowing to surface water bodies from where it can be reused 4 5 development water scarcity in pakistan 1971 2020 fig 6 a b shows the development of water scarcity in the indus makran and kharan basins fig 6a shows water scarcity for the indus basin using four different ways of calculating efrs for the period 1971 2020 fig 6b shows the average annual water scarcity for the indus makran and kharan basin in pakistan for the period 1971 2020 fig 6a shows that water scarcity in the indus basin depends on the definition of efrs if the category of set volumes is applied water scarcity remains below 1 i e low water scarcity except in 2000 if the efr of the 60 is applied if the category of set fractions of 50 of the bwr is applied water scarcity ranges between 1 17 in 2010 and 1 72 in 2000 so between moderate and significant scarcity however if 80 of bwr is used water scarcity ranges between 2 94 in 2010 and 4 31 in 2000 which is considered severe water scarcity appendix 8 table a11 a12 a13 and a14 in si gives the values fig 6b shows that water scarcity is far smaller in the makran and kharan basins than in the indus basin in these basins water scarcity lies between 0 64 makran basin efr 50 and 1 77 kharan basin efr 80 for the indus basin the average value for the period 1970 and 2020 lies between 1 44 efr 50 and 3 6 efr 80 5 discussion this study made a rough estimate of the development of blue wfs for the three sectors in pakistan agriculture industry and municipal water supply between 1971 and 2020 we had to make many assumptions due to limited data availability especially for the industrial and municipal sectors wfs of industrial products do not have time series so we applied recent data for an historical analysis for municipal water supply we encountered a similar lack of data from 2000 onwards annual withdrawal data from ref 2 remain the same which is probably not true agricultural withdrawal however is very well documented probably because it is the largest water consumer in pakistan although the study made many assumptions the general trend is clear agriculture has the largest blue wf by far while industry and municipal water supply contribute little to total national blue wfs however there is an increasing trend in 1971 the industrial blue wfs was 0 5 of the total blue wf in 2020 1 4 while the municipal water supply wf increased from 0 5 to 1 7 although 3 included water withdrawal they also showed the small contribution of the industrial and municipal sector in pakistan for the period 1997 to 2001 for the assessment of the blue wf of the agricultural sector we took a water balance approach starting from water withdrawal for which data are available and included the blue wf of the irrigation supply chain in the calculations this means that our blue wfs not only include the blue wf of crop production but also supply chain wfs so that the blue wfs calculated in here are far larger than assessed in earlier studies for example 61 calculated a blue wf of agricultural crop production in pakistan between 1996 and 2005 of 74 109 m3 while for 2000 our estimate is 109 109 m3 or 47 larger including the wf of the supply chain shows the enormous pressure of the agricultural sector on freshwater resources in pakistan the time trends give an indication of the possibilities of the agricultural sector to produce more with the same amount of water between 1971 and 2020 the sector was able to produce four times more without increasing its total blue wf showing the possibilities to become more water efficient this might make more water available for the industrial and municipal sectors that will probably keep growing in the future so with larger blue wfs to avoid competition in the future more efficient agriculture can make water available for the other sectors for example by identifying hotspots with relatively large water consumption and improve water efficiency or by moving crops to locations where blue wfs are smaller to become less dependent on agriculture the industrial sector could also try to become more water efficient for example the coca cola company already set targets to improve water use efficiency for its products more than ten years ago 67 another example comes from the textile industry according to the cleaner production institute pakistan cpi about 53 of the textile industries are moderately water efficient it has also shown that the industry can reduce its water consumption by 20 i e within process operations 62 it is therefore important to carefully investigate and manage the water consumption of each textile process to minimize water consumption 63 this is also valid for other industrial sectors and municipal water supply where most water is lost during conveyance and never reaches the consumer 30 the enormous blue wf of pakistan compared to its available water shows that it is a huge challenge for the three sectors to increase production and consume more water without harming the efrs production therefore needs to become more water efficient because the limits of how much water can be used are already reached there are different interpretations though concerning efrs and water scarcity the pakistani government has already set a cap on the volume of water that needs to remain in the environment an efr of 10 6 109 m3 per year that is needed to avoid salinity and seawater intrusion and complies with societal water demand 18 if efrs are set at 50 or even 80 of water inflow as used in water scarcity studies the consequences for the three sectors would be huge and efrs could increase to 87 to 140 109 m3 per year this would leave little water behind for societal demand water scarcity however differs among the basins and is less severe in the smaller basins in the south west of pakistan it is impossible to move agriculture to the makran and kharan basins because it is not an agricultural area for municipal water supply this is also not an option however for some industries that could move and face water scarcity at their present location of operation it might be an option policy might also play an important role to allocate sufficient freshwater to the country s main sectors especially the large water losses in supply chains would need an improved water infrastructure to avoid water shortage and competition in the future this example for pakistan might indicate pathways to avoid competition over scarce water resources in other water scarce countries 6 conclusions in pakistan like in many other countries agriculture is the largest blue water consumer by far the contribution of industry and municipal water supply is small from 1971 to 2020 the industrial blue wfs increased from 0 5 to 1 4 of the total national blue wf while the municipal water supply wf increased from 0 5 to 1 7 although the annual agricultural blue wf does not show an upwards trend agriculture has been able to increase production using the same water volumes in fifty years agricultural production tripled using the same amount of irrigation water the average blue wf of the five main crops in pakistan wheat sugar cane cotton rice and maize decreased from 3 5 to 1 1 m3 tonne livestock production also tripled which is reflected in the increase of drinking water requirements especially for cattle and buffaloes if agriculture is able to become even more water efficient more water becomes available for the other two sectors decreasing competition manufacture and electricity generation dominate blue wfs in the industrial sector while the contribution of the blue wf of mining is negligible 0 1 0 2 in 1971 the blue wf of manufacture contributed 76 to the total industrial blue wf of pakistan and 73 in 2020 yarn and cloth production dominate the blue wf of manufacture between 1971 and 2020 the blue wf of yarn production increased tenfold and of cloth production by 1 7 the contribution of the other products like steel cement or water bottles is relatively small hydropower dominated blue wfs of electricity generation electricity from hpps with a reservoir contributes most to the total blue wf the contribution of blue wfs of ror hpps is far smaller some contribution comes from thermal power plants fueled by oil coal and gas and some from nuclear plants the contribution from bagasse fueled power plants in the sugar industry is small between 1971 and 2020 all electricity blue wfs increased except for hydropower between 1971 and 2020 withdrawal for municipal water supply increased by a factor of six the blue wf though increased by a factor of 3 6 the difference is due to a larger fraction of municipal water supply that ends up in the sewage system and is not accounted as consumption part of the water is lost in the supply chain but another part is sewage water flowing to surface water bodies from where it can be reused especially the increasing pakistani population requires more municipal water supply blue water scarcity in pakistan depends on the definition of the environmental flow requirement efr selected for the large indus basin the definition of the government to use a fixed volume to meet societal requirements generates a low water scarcity however if higher efr s are applied e g 50 or 80 of the blue surface water runoff scarcity is moderate to severe in general though water scarcity in the indus basin is larger than in the kharan and makran basin competition over water might decrease if especially agriculture becomes more water efficient so that more water is available for industry and municipal water supply the industrial and municipal water supply sector however can also contribute and use water wisely this is needed because efr limits are already reached policy can play an important role to allocate sufficient freshwater to the country s main sectors especially the large water losses in supply chains would need an improved water infrastructure to avoid water shortage and competition in the future this example for pakistan might indicate pathways to avoid competition over scarce water resources in other water scarce countries author statement a w siyal conceptualization data

8741,various techniques have been researched and introduced in water treatment plants to optimise treatment and management processes this paper presents a solution that can help treatment plants to work more effectively and reach their mine water management goals using python 3 7 1 programming language within an anaconda 4 11 0 platform neural networks and regression tree algorithms were compared to find the best performing model after the data had undergone robust data pre processing and exploratory data analysis statistical techniques the main aim was to use this best performing model to forecast mining influenced water miw parameters this approach will help the treatment plant operators in knowing the future miw chemistry and they can eventually plan ahead of time what chemicals and methods to use to treat and manage polluted miw westrand mine pool water near randfontein south africa is used as a case study in which historical data 2016 2021 from shaft 9 is used to train and test the algorithms these algorithms included the artificial neural network ann deep neural network dnn gradient boosting and random forest regression trees while the multivariate long short term memory lstm was used to generate new data for the best performing algorithm different data pre processing approaches were explored including data interpolation and anomaly detection these processes were carried out to highlight the most important part of completing a machine learning related project which is data analytics finally the random forest regression tree algorithm showed the overall best performance and was used to forecast fe and acidity concentrations of miw for 60 days it could be shown that artificial intelligence techniques are capable to optimise and forecast mine water treatment plant parameters and it is imperative to perform robust statistical analysis on the data before attempting to build forecasting models graphical abstract image 1 keywords mining influenced water python programming language forecasting models data analytics south africa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction and background mining influenced water miw especially acid mine drainage amd but also circum neutral and alkaline drainage is a threat to the former mining areas in south africa and worldwide 1 it is therefore imperative that any mine water is treated before it can enter local water courses due to the temporal changes and the longevity of the mine water quality 2 3 mine or treatment plant operators have to make provisions for the variability in the discharge qualities if these changes can be quantified before they are about to occur chemical stock electricity or employee planning could be optimised to avoid over or under stocking or having too many personnel on site several mining companies are introducing advanced digital technologies in the treatment plants to treat and manage miw effectively 4 this study therefore applied machine learning ml techniques to forecast miw parameters for 60 days using fe and acidity exemplified by the former randfontein estates gold mine located in randfontein south africa westrand mine pool this kind of approach has never been tested on mine water dataset except for when more and wolkersdorfer 5 only used regression tree models to forecast ph and ec values of mine water the approach in this study is different due to the robust statistical techniques applied and multiple algorithms compared before deciding on the final model to use for forecasting analysis algorithms tested include the multi layer perceptron artificial neural network ann deep neural network dnn random forest and gradient boosting tree multivariate long short term memory lstm was used to generate new data for the best performing algorithm to forecast acidity and fe of miw in the westrand mine pool miw is pumped from shafts 8 and 9 to the treatment plant and the main aim here is to forecast the mine water chemistry so that the plant operators can be prepared for changing water qualities ahead of time for optimal chemical dosing usually the traditional models fail to use all available parameters to forecast other parameters these traditional models such as auto regressive integrated moving average arima or box jenkins assume that time series data are linear processes 6 7 additionally they forecast data of an individual time series by analysing the underlying data structure and using its patterns and trends in many cases real world scenarios are nonlinear 8 and thus relying only on the traditional time series forecasting techniques is highly disadvantageous and would be inappropriate for time series datasets of miw mine water parameters produce a nonlinear dataset thus ml models were applied in this study ml models such as the neural networks have gained overwhelming attention over the past years in nonlinear time series forecasting e g refs 9 10 and have yielded positive results these techniques including regression tree models use the whole dataset s structure and analyse the relationships between the data of the parameters in the whole dataset to forecast the future patterns and trends in addition to applying ml models thorough data pre processing and exploratory data analysis need to be practiced to produce models that can forecast the data with accuracy and precision missing data and anomalies are frequently encountered while collecting miw data as this was the case with the data used for this study missing data compromise the statistical power of the study while anomalies result in over fitting or under fitting of the models therefore it is advantageous to apply suitable data interpolation and anomaly detection techniques on time series data before attempting to build forecasting models missing data in time series can occur due to several problems known as the missingness mechanism the missingness mechanism can be in three different forms missing completely at random mcar missing at random mar or missing not at random mnar fig 1 11 13 a variable is mcar if the probability of missingness is the same for all units and it is mar if the probability of missingness is depending only on available information additionally missing data in mnar are incomplete data that cannot be verified or predicted in this study the data used consists of missing data that cannot be ignored because doing so would lead to biased results meaning that the type of missing data are mnar therefore numerical statistical modelling was investigated and suitable techniques used to interpolate the missing data approaches investigated include the basis spline b spline curves non uniform rational basis spline nurbs curves and wavelet transform however only b splines were suitable to be applied in this study numerical modelling assumes that the time series data corresponds to an unknown function and the main aim is to fit the function and use it to interpolate the missing values 14 in case of anomalies statistical profiling and predictive confidence level used for the data in this study approaches were investigated in this study statistical profiling involves calculating measures of central tendency of the historical data and examining them while the predictive confidence level approach uses the historical data to build a predictive model to get the overall trend seasonality or cyclic pattern of the data and ultimately detect the anomalies 2 study design 2 1 introduction machine learning models in this study were developed in a three step process i e initial forecasting using the multivariate lstm model choosing the best performing model by comparing the ann dnn random forest and gradient boosting tree models and finally performing the final forecasting analysis fig 2 an lstm model was used to forecast the values of alkalinity ph and so4 and these forecasted values were supplied to the trained and tested best performing model to give the final concentrations of fe and acidity for 60 days 2 2 multivariate long short term memory lstm multivariate long short term memory systems lstms are a special type of recurrent neural network rnn and are mostly favoured because of the disadvantages that normal rnns have normal rnns have no long term memory cannot use information from distant past and cannot learn patterns with long dependencies 16 a way to overcome these issues is by introducing an lstm which has memory cells that enable them to learn long term patterns 16 17 lstm s default behaviour is remembering patterns and trends for a long period they have a chain like structure similar to rnns however the structure of the repeating module differs for rnn the repeating module is made up of a simple structure such as a single tanh hyperbolic tangent layer while lstm s repeating module consist of four neural network layers interacting in a unique way fig 3 2 3 artificial neural network ann and deep neural network dnn artificial neural networks ann and deep neural networks dnn are from the same group of algorithms but only differ by the number of hidden layers a typical neural network is made up of the input layer hidden layer and output layer fig 4 and if the network has one hidden layer then it is an ann structure a neural network that consists of two or more hidden layers is referred to as a dnn model a fully connected layer in the neural network structure is practically composed of the weights and the bias of each neuron and the input size controls the number of weights each neuron has its own activation function 6 9 18 20 an input layer introduces values into the network and it has no activation function hidden layer s perform the network s computations furthermore the number of neurons in the input layer depends on the parameters that will be used in the network as inputs an output layer makes final prediction for the network and its neurons depend on the parameters that need to be predicted while hidden layers can have any number of neurons stacked together hidden and output layer neurons have an activation function such as the sigmoid rectified linear unit relu or softmax normalised exponential function 2 4 regression tree algorithms regression trees are one of the key algorithms used in complex structures such as mine water dataset they are useful when the data has no obvious linear relationship between the input and output parameters in this study random forest and gradient boosting regression trees were used decision trees make the foundation of both the algorithms regression tree algorithms have a tree like structure which consists of root node branches and leaf nodes fig 5 22 23 a random forest algorithm aims to reduce the variance in complex trees while gradient boosting aims to decrease the bias 3 a review of selected data interpolation and anomaly detection techniques for time series 3 1 basis spline b spline data interpolation basis spline b spline curves are an interpolation technique in which the order chosen for the curve is independent of the control points 24 25 control points are used to determine the shape of a spline curve b splines are unique and more advantageous when compared to other interpolation or approximation techniques such as splines and the bezier curves 26 splines follow the general shape of the curve while the bezier curve generally follows the shape of a defining polygon 24 26 27 in the b spline curve the independency of the order of the curve over the local control points makes it a reliable interpolation technique thus the b spline curve provides the local control through control points in every segment of the curve 25 28 for example a curve may have 40 60 or 100 points and there will still be freedom to fix the curve to any shape e g quadratic cubic or higher order as can be seen a b spline curve is not a single curve but it is made up of a number of curve segments and all have the same continuity requirement depending on the order of the curve 24 29 b splines can be applied for the open and closed curves and changing any of the control points changes only a specific segment of the curve fig 6 while in techniques like bezier the whole curve changes therefore applying b spline interpolation in time series ensures that the missing data are interpolated within the population space and are not distorted or isolated 3 2 non uniform rational basis spline nurbs data interpolation non uniform rational basis spline nurbs curves are a modification or rational version of b spline curves their advantage is that they can create smoother surfaces with fewer control points 30 nurbs are mathematical representations of complex structures be it two or three dimensional objects e g cars buildings cones or simple curves they are the computer graphics design industry standard when it comes to creating or interpolating complex objects 30 32 generally they work exceptionally well in three dimensional modelling enabling the designer to easily manipulate control points and the contours smoothness the non uniform in nurbs refers to the idea that some segments or sections of a defined shape can be easily manipulated relative to other sections of the overall shape with control points being associated with weights positive numbers when these control points all have the same weight the curve is called non rational 28 31 33 and the rationality of nurbs means that the curves have the possibility of being rational i e nurbs have the ability to give more weight to the control points in the overall curve shape 3 3 wavelet transform data interpolation wavelet transform is a technique derived from the fourier transform ft and short time fourier transform stft limitations that arise from the ft and stft techniques gave birth to the wavelet transform 24 34 the ft provides frequency information of a signal that represents frequencies and their magnitude however it does not tell when in time these frequency components exist 35 36 therefore it is ideal for signals that do not change with time i e signals that have a constant frequency throughout consequently ft s disadvantage is that it lacks capability to provide frequency information for a localised signal region in time stft was therefore developed to overcome the poor time resolution of the ft thus stft explains the time frequency representation of the signal and it assumes that a certain portion of the non stationary signal is stationary 37 38 the main limitation of stft is that high frequency components appear as short bursts thus needing higher time resolution 39 40 so the wavelet transform improves on this shortfall i e it results in analysing a signal into different frequencies at different resolutions therefore a wavelet is a rapidly decaying wave like oscillation that has zero mean and exists for a finite duration 24 34 38 41 44 wavelet interpolation is a key factor in time series data due to the data s stationarity properties it is advantageous to apply this technique when the function is not smooth and is oscillating pywavelets an open source wavelet transform software for python can be used to interpolate the missing values for oscillating data 45 pywavelets combines a simple high level interface with low level c and cython performance python consists of different types of wavelet families e g haar morlet gaussian or frequency b spline wavelets therefore for accurate results a wavelet family which fits best with the supplied data must be chosen each wavelet family is useful for a different purpose as they have different smoothness shape and compactness 3 4 statistical profiling approach anomaly detection statistical profiling is a simple and fast process that involves calculating measures of central tendency of the historical data and examining them 14 this can be done by calculating the mean median or the moving average of the data standard deviation can also be calculated and be used to set up the uppermost and lower bounds of the dataset as anomaly thresholds this technique is known as the z score analysis in which the anomaly threshold is set by the three standard deviations above and below the mean e g refs 5 46 values that are outside the three standard deviation thresholds are considered strong anomalies fig 7 simple moving average can also be used for anomaly detection it is applied to capture the pattern in time series the difference between the actual and simple moving average can be computed to determine the tolerance band and identify anomalies 3 5 predictive confidence level approach anomaly detection another way of detecting anomalies in time series data is by using the historical data to build a predictive model to get the overall trend seasonality or cyclic pattern of the data the model error can be analysed between the predicted and actual values and use that to compute a confidence interval fig 8 the values falling beyond the confidence band can be regarded as anomalies for example an arima model can be built and use the mean absolute percentage error mape to come up with a confidence band 47 48 other ml or deep learning based algorithms such as the lstm or lstm autoencoder produce accurate results for time series data and thus can be used to find anomalies 49 this technique is highly dependable on the accuracy and good performance of the predictive model therefore the model must be tuned to ensure that it produces a low error 4 dataset 4 1 background sampling and monitoring of mine water is usually done on a regular basis to carefully examine its chemistry this study uses the south african westrand mine water treatment plant s data gathered between 2016 and 03 07 and 2021 07 13 the data contains nine parameters i e acidity alkalinity electrical conductivity ec fe mn ph so4 temperature and turbidity which were used in the units applied by the plant operators the parameters do not have an equal number of observations i e some of the measurements are missing the highest number of observations of an individual parameter is 1123 table 1 robust data analytics approaches which included data interpolation and anomaly detection were conducted to prepare the data to be used in the machine learning models 4 2 stationarity test stationarity tests are critical as several statistical applications and models are computed based on its results for example numerical models are often applied to time series data when it is non stationary and probabilistic models are sometimes useful and accurate when the dataset is stationary 14 data interpolation and anomaly detection approaches are guided by stationarity tests therefore the augmented dickey fuller adf test was used on the dataset to test the stationarity of the time series table 2 a stationary dataset will have a p value that is highly significant 0 05 additionally scatter plots for the dataset were drawn to visualise the patterns trends and seasonality and identify any stationarity or non stationarity properties of the data fig 9 from the statistical results the p value obtained for temperature is less than 0 05 therefore the null hypothesis is rejected i e temperature time series is stationary however the graphs show that temperature data are oscillating a prominent seasonality can be observed in series for the other parameters the p value for the time series is greater than 0 05 therefore the null hypothesis is accepted i e the dataset for the parameters is non stationary finally the statistical results show that numerical modelling can be used to interpolate missing measurements and detect anomalies 4 3 normality test normality tests identify if the data has been sampled from a normal distribution when data are plotted on a frequency distribution the normal distribution can be explained by a bell curve shape with majority of the observations being around the mean value from the graphs plotted the data are log normally bi modally and multi modally distributed and only temperature shows a close to gaussian distribution fig 10 mining influenced water data are continuous data thus the normality test is a crucial process for deciding statistical methods and measures of central tendency to perform data analysis apart from graphical methods there are several statistical techniques applied to test for normality of data in this study the scipy 1 7 0 module was used to compute the kolmogorov smirnov shapiro wilk and anderson darling normality tests table 3 statistical tests conducted using the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk methods show p values for the parameters to be below the 5 significance level meaning that the data do not follow a normal distribution using the anderson darling test the test statistics are well above the critical values at α 0 15 0 10 0 05 0 025 and 0 01 0 574 0 654 0 784 0 915 and 1 088 which also implies that the data do not follow a normal distribution 4 4 data transformation as has been shown in the previous section the dataset is not normally distributed several statistical methods especially time series forecasting techniques are based on the assumption that the data are normally distributed thus building forecasting models with un transformed data often results in inaccurate forecasting results therefore data transformation is taking data that are not normally distributed and transforming it to a close to normal distribution 50 53 data transformation does not change the relationship of the variables for mathematical and statistical purposes so the procedure is a statistically necessary step towards building models that can forecast data with accuracy and precision from the results it can be seen that alkalinity ec and mn have a multi modal distribution and acidity fe ph and so4 show a bi modal distribution temperature shows a close to normal distribution and turbidity has a log normal distribution therefore only turbidity will be transformed there are several ways to transform the data such as log normal square root reciprocal or box cox transformation in this study a natural log normal transformation was used each variable of x was replaced by ln x finally quantile quantile q q and histogram graphs were plotted to test the normality of the transformed turbidity data fig 11 in a q q plot for a normally distributed data observations lie approximately on a straight line therefore the graphs show that turbidity after being transformed is close to a normal distribution slightly showing a bi modal distribution 5 anomaly detection and data interpolation the dataset used for this study contains sample times with missing measurements resulting from equipment malfunctioning or because no sample was taken and has a small percentage of outliers identified by the statistical analysis conducted in the previous sections there are several statistical methods to interpolate missing values and detect anomalies for time series data some of which have been discussed earlier in this study predictive confidence level approach with gradient boosting regression tree algorithm was used to detect anomalies in this approach python s scikit learn 0 24 2 library was used to build the gradient boosting regression model this model was fitted on the data with three prediction bands of α 0 10 0 50 and 0 90 fig 12 the α 0 10 prediction band represents the lower bound of the data real observations plotting below this band are considered possible anomalies while the α 0 90 prediction band represents the upper bound of the data real observations plotting above this band are considered possible anomalies for the mid prediction alpha was set to 0 50 and this predicts the median of the original data therefore values plotting on the α 0 50 prediction band were used to replace the possible anomalies for the build up of gradient boosting regression model for each target output all other parameters were used as input variables e g when acidity was set as the target output alkalinity ec fe mn ph so4 temperature and turbidity were set as input variables this model used 100 trees a maximum tree depth of 2 and learning rate of 0 05 to perform predictions and the data were split into training 80 and testing 20 sets gradient boosting model s objective was to predict the values of the parameters that will possibly be used to build the forecasting models there are several hidden features some of which are not included in the data which affect each parameter therefore the uncertainty in the estimates was shown by predicting the lower α 0 10 middle α 0 50 and upper α 0 90 bands of the observations the loss function of the gradient boosting model was changed to quantiles with selected prediction intervals alphas this configuration ensures that the model performs predictions which correspond to percentiles numerical analysis modelling was applied to interpolate the missing measurements numerical analysis assumes that time series data trend and pattern represent an unknown function 14 the main task when applying this technique is to find a suitable function for the data so it can be used to interpolate the missing values for reasons described above b spline interpolation technique using python s scipy library was used in this study b spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where a continuous curve has various piecewise polynomials whose gradients match up at the measured data interpolation in this form takes place between two points that have missing values i e a function is derived between the points and interpolation takes place the polynomials are continuous up to their second derivative and this process occurs for every paired point that has missing values between them 24 54 finally the interpolated values fitted well into the known population and these interpolated values did not change the trends and patterns of the original data fig 13 this implies that b spline interpolation is an accurate technique for non stationary time series data 6 modelling data data analytics approaches were conducted to detect anomalies and interpolate the missing observations by robust statistical techniques described above which provided a clean dataset that could be used for modelling a correlation chart of nine parameters all with 1955 observations was computed using r 4 1 2 on rstudio 1 1 456 and this produced a chart with cross plots distribution plots and pearson correlation coefficients r fig 14 parameters of concern at the westrand mine water treatment plant are acidity and fe therefore their relationships with other parameters were thoroughly examined the statistical analyses show that both acidity and fe have high correlations with alkalinity ec mn ph and so4 additionally alkalinity ph and so4 have good relationships with acidity and fe with r above 0 8 therefore alkalinity ph and so4 were used as input parameters for final forecasting with acidity and fe being the target outputs fig 2 turbidity and temperature were not used to build the forecasting models because they have poor relationships with the rest of the parameters as displayed by the correlation coefficients in total seven parameters from the available nine were used to develop the models 7 model development and evaluation all the models were trained and tested independently and only the best performing model was used in the project to create the final forecasting evaluation metrics used for the models include the mean squared error mse and mean absolute error mae by statistical definition mse is a measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values in a dataset while mae refers to the measure of the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values 55 the forecasted concentrations and values of alkalinity ph and so4 by the lstm model were supplied to the best performing model to forecast fe and acidity concentrations for the lstm model three structures were developed with different numbers of the lookback period which explains the number of previous time steps the model needs to use to predict the subsequent time step epochs and validation split table 4 a single hidden layer multivariate lstm model with 32 memory units based on the structure variations explained was compiled and a relu activation function was used throughout for all the structure variations the models were fitted with a batch size of 32 the adaptive moment estimation adam optimiser and mse loss function were used in this model and the low validation and training loss implies good model fitting on the new and training data table 5 different techniques were applied to tune the hyper parameters for the neural network models including grid search optimisation technique keras tuner and trial and error method for the ann model the configuration that yielded better results was a model with input layers that consisted of three neurons of alkalinity ph and so4 while fe and acidity were used in the output layer with a relu activation function the model had one hidden layer of four neurons and a relu activation function the dnn architecture consisted of two hidden layers the first one with four neurons and another with two neurons both with a relu activation function like ann input parameters were alkalinity ph and so4 with target outputs being fe and acidity both the neural network models used a test size of 20 and the models were compiled using the adam optimiser they were then fitted for 500 epochs with a batch size of 64 the model performances were tested using the mse and mae accuracy metrics table 5 a random forest regression tree model was built using 150 trees and a maximum depth of 8 with a test split of 20 a gradient boosting regression tree model was compiled using 100 trees maximum depth of 5 and learning rate of 0 05 with a test size of 20 regression tree model performances were also evaluated using mse and mae table 5 8 results and discussions machine learning models developed in this study consisted of a multivariate lstm model which was used to forecast alkalinity ph and so4 for 60 days using three different structure variations fig 15 furthermore ann dnn random forest and gradient boosting models were trained and tested using historical data random forest displayed the overall best performance and was used to forecast fe and acidity concentrations for the same period as the lstm model fig 16 the multivariate lstm forecasting has three different forecasted concentrations for alkalinity and so4 as well as the ph values which then resulted in the random forest model also forecasting three different concentrations for fe and acidity with random forest using alkalinity ph and so4 as input parameters the forecasted concentrations and values by the lstm model were fed to the trained random forest model therefore the random forest model showed good performance and forecasted fe and acidity concentrations with accuracy as the values fall within the population and follows the trend in addition the results suggest that ml models can be widely applied in mine water time series forecasting analysis the models were evaluated using mse and mae and in all occasions the error was substantially low however the neural network models training loss was always greater than the validation loss which meant that there is data leaking in the training process hyper parameters were rigorously tuned using grid search keras tuner and trial and error approach but training loss continued to be slightly greater than the validation loss therefore the final decision was that the models cannot be used for final forecasting analysis regression tree models displayed better performance with random forest performing better than the gradient boosting thus random forest was used to perform final forecasting analysis random forest showed superior performance because it is good at handling nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables it also has built in mechanisms to prevent overfitting such as bagging and random feature selection making it more reliable than other models in situations where overfitting is a concern 9 comparing the measured and forecasted data for the final target outputs forecasted concentrations of fe and acidity using random forest model were compared with the measured data by calculating the forecasting error table 6 measured data only contains 23 observations while the forecasting period was for 60 days this is because sampling was not carried out daily for this period thus the forecasting error was only calculated for the available measured data furthermore cross plots of measured and forecasted data with robust regression lines were computed fig 17 computed plots and calculations show both the low coefficients of determinations r 2 and statistical significances however the calculated forecasting errors are relatively low with only four notable higher errors the reason for such differences may be because of the sampling that was not conducted daily at the treatment plant 10 conclusions forecasted concentrations of fe and acidity by the random forest model fall within the historical data population and follow its recent trend and pattern therefore the proposed methodology can be applied with certainty and confidence in forecasting mine water chemistry machine learning forecasting approach proved that the application can use data from several parameters to forecast other parameters i e the model was developed in a way that the computer learns the trends patterns and seasonality of input data to forecast the target outputs parameters in a time series are related to each other and influence the outcomes in each parameter s dataset therefore focusing only on one parameter to perform forecasting analysis would be inaccurate traditional statistical forecasting techniques such as arima or box jenkins which forecast data of a parameter by learning its structure without relating it to other parameters should be avoided in future applications thus the forecasting technique proposed here will be a useful tool for water treatment plants because it will help in understanding changes in the mine water chemistry and volumes in advance it can be concluded that forecasting mine water chemistry by applying ml models is a relevant contribution in and addition to mine water treatment plants comparing the neural network and regression tree models the results show that random forest regression tree model performed better than the other models finally the results obtained in this study indicate that regression tree algorithms are powerful and important mechanisms to model and forecast the complex mine water time series data or nonlinear systems these approaches were able to analyse the hidden patterns trends and seasonality among the historical mine water dataset in a much better and accurate approach compared to traditional time series analysis and statistical techniques lastly the findings of this study have revealed that transforming time series data before using it for modelling is sometimes necessary to achieve more accurate forecasting results credit author contribution statement conceptualisation kagiso samuel more funding acquisition christian wolkersdorfer software kagiso samuel more supervision

8741,various techniques have been researched and introduced in water treatment plants to optimise treatment and management processes this paper presents a solution that can help treatment plants to work more effectively and reach their mine water management goals using python 3 7 1 programming language within an anaconda 4 11 0 platform neural networks and regression tree algorithms were compared to find the best performing model after the data had undergone robust data pre processing and exploratory data analysis statistical techniques the main aim was to use this best performing model to forecast mining influenced water miw parameters this approach will help the treatment plant operators in knowing the future miw chemistry and they can eventually plan ahead of time what chemicals and methods to use to treat and manage polluted miw westrand mine pool water near randfontein south africa is used as a case study in which historical data 2016 2021 from shaft 9 is used to train and test the algorithms these algorithms included the artificial neural network ann deep neural network dnn gradient boosting and random forest regression trees while the multivariate long short term memory lstm was used to generate new data for the best performing algorithm different data pre processing approaches were explored including data interpolation and anomaly detection these processes were carried out to highlight the most important part of completing a machine learning related project which is data analytics finally the random forest regression tree algorithm showed the overall best performance and was used to forecast fe and acidity concentrations of miw for 60 days it could be shown that artificial intelligence techniques are capable to optimise and forecast mine water treatment plant parameters and it is imperative to perform robust statistical analysis on the data before attempting to build forecasting models graphical abstract image 1 keywords mining influenced water python programming language forecasting models data analytics south africa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction and background mining influenced water miw especially acid mine drainage amd but also circum neutral and alkaline drainage is a threat to the former mining areas in south africa and worldwide 1 it is therefore imperative that any mine water is treated before it can enter local water courses due to the temporal changes and the longevity of the mine water quality 2 3 mine or treatment plant operators have to make provisions for the variability in the discharge qualities if these changes can be quantified before they are about to occur chemical stock electricity or employee planning could be optimised to avoid over or under stocking or having too many personnel on site several mining companies are introducing advanced digital technologies in the treatment plants to treat and manage miw effectively 4 this study therefore applied machine learning ml techniques to forecast miw parameters for 60 days using fe and acidity exemplified by the former randfontein estates gold mine located in randfontein south africa westrand mine pool this kind of approach has never been tested on mine water dataset except for when more and wolkersdorfer 5 only used regression tree models to forecast ph and ec values of mine water the approach in this study is different due to the robust statistical techniques applied and multiple algorithms compared before deciding on the final model to use for forecasting analysis algorithms tested include the multi layer perceptron artificial neural network ann deep neural network dnn random forest and gradient boosting tree multivariate long short term memory lstm was used to generate new data for the best performing algorithm to forecast acidity and fe of miw in the westrand mine pool miw is pumped from shafts 8 and 9 to the treatment plant and the main aim here is to forecast the mine water chemistry so that the plant operators can be prepared for changing water qualities ahead of time for optimal chemical dosing usually the traditional models fail to use all available parameters to forecast other parameters these traditional models such as auto regressive integrated moving average arima or box jenkins assume that time series data are linear processes 6 7 additionally they forecast data of an individual time series by analysing the underlying data structure and using its patterns and trends in many cases real world scenarios are nonlinear 8 and thus relying only on the traditional time series forecasting techniques is highly disadvantageous and would be inappropriate for time series datasets of miw mine water parameters produce a nonlinear dataset thus ml models were applied in this study ml models such as the neural networks have gained overwhelming attention over the past years in nonlinear time series forecasting e g refs 9 10 and have yielded positive results these techniques including regression tree models use the whole dataset s structure and analyse the relationships between the data of the parameters in the whole dataset to forecast the future patterns and trends in addition to applying ml models thorough data pre processing and exploratory data analysis need to be practiced to produce models that can forecast the data with accuracy and precision missing data and anomalies are frequently encountered while collecting miw data as this was the case with the data used for this study missing data compromise the statistical power of the study while anomalies result in over fitting or under fitting of the models therefore it is advantageous to apply suitable data interpolation and anomaly detection techniques on time series data before attempting to build forecasting models missing data in time series can occur due to several problems known as the missingness mechanism the missingness mechanism can be in three different forms missing completely at random mcar missing at random mar or missing not at random mnar fig 1 11 13 a variable is mcar if the probability of missingness is the same for all units and it is mar if the probability of missingness is depending only on available information additionally missing data in mnar are incomplete data that cannot be verified or predicted in this study the data used consists of missing data that cannot be ignored because doing so would lead to biased results meaning that the type of missing data are mnar therefore numerical statistical modelling was investigated and suitable techniques used to interpolate the missing data approaches investigated include the basis spline b spline curves non uniform rational basis spline nurbs curves and wavelet transform however only b splines were suitable to be applied in this study numerical modelling assumes that the time series data corresponds to an unknown function and the main aim is to fit the function and use it to interpolate the missing values 14 in case of anomalies statistical profiling and predictive confidence level used for the data in this study approaches were investigated in this study statistical profiling involves calculating measures of central tendency of the historical data and examining them while the predictive confidence level approach uses the historical data to build a predictive model to get the overall trend seasonality or cyclic pattern of the data and ultimately detect the anomalies 2 study design 2 1 introduction machine learning models in this study were developed in a three step process i e initial forecasting using the multivariate lstm model choosing the best performing model by comparing the ann dnn random forest and gradient boosting tree models and finally performing the final forecasting analysis fig 2 an lstm model was used to forecast the values of alkalinity ph and so4 and these forecasted values were supplied to the trained and tested best performing model to give the final concentrations of fe and acidity for 60 days 2 2 multivariate long short term memory lstm multivariate long short term memory systems lstms are a special type of recurrent neural network rnn and are mostly favoured because of the disadvantages that normal rnns have normal rnns have no long term memory cannot use information from distant past and cannot learn patterns with long dependencies 16 a way to overcome these issues is by introducing an lstm which has memory cells that enable them to learn long term patterns 16 17 lstm s default behaviour is remembering patterns and trends for a long period they have a chain like structure similar to rnns however the structure of the repeating module differs for rnn the repeating module is made up of a simple structure such as a single tanh hyperbolic tangent layer while lstm s repeating module consist of four neural network layers interacting in a unique way fig 3 2 3 artificial neural network ann and deep neural network dnn artificial neural networks ann and deep neural networks dnn are from the same group of algorithms but only differ by the number of hidden layers a typical neural network is made up of the input layer hidden layer and output layer fig 4 and if the network has one hidden layer then it is an ann structure a neural network that consists of two or more hidden layers is referred to as a dnn model a fully connected layer in the neural network structure is practically composed of the weights and the bias of each neuron and the input size controls the number of weights each neuron has its own activation function 6 9 18 20 an input layer introduces values into the network and it has no activation function hidden layer s perform the network s computations furthermore the number of neurons in the input layer depends on the parameters that will be used in the network as inputs an output layer makes final prediction for the network and its neurons depend on the parameters that need to be predicted while hidden layers can have any number of neurons stacked together hidden and output layer neurons have an activation function such as the sigmoid rectified linear unit relu or softmax normalised exponential function 2 4 regression tree algorithms regression trees are one of the key algorithms used in complex structures such as mine water dataset they are useful when the data has no obvious linear relationship between the input and output parameters in this study random forest and gradient boosting regression trees were used decision trees make the foundation of both the algorithms regression tree algorithms have a tree like structure which consists of root node branches and leaf nodes fig 5 22 23 a random forest algorithm aims to reduce the variance in complex trees while gradient boosting aims to decrease the bias 3 a review of selected data interpolation and anomaly detection techniques for time series 3 1 basis spline b spline data interpolation basis spline b spline curves are an interpolation technique in which the order chosen for the curve is independent of the control points 24 25 control points are used to determine the shape of a spline curve b splines are unique and more advantageous when compared to other interpolation or approximation techniques such as splines and the bezier curves 26 splines follow the general shape of the curve while the bezier curve generally follows the shape of a defining polygon 24 26 27 in the b spline curve the independency of the order of the curve over the local control points makes it a reliable interpolation technique thus the b spline curve provides the local control through control points in every segment of the curve 25 28 for example a curve may have 40 60 or 100 points and there will still be freedom to fix the curve to any shape e g quadratic cubic or higher order as can be seen a b spline curve is not a single curve but it is made up of a number of curve segments and all have the same continuity requirement depending on the order of the curve 24 29 b splines can be applied for the open and closed curves and changing any of the control points changes only a specific segment of the curve fig 6 while in techniques like bezier the whole curve changes therefore applying b spline interpolation in time series ensures that the missing data are interpolated within the population space and are not distorted or isolated 3 2 non uniform rational basis spline nurbs data interpolation non uniform rational basis spline nurbs curves are a modification or rational version of b spline curves their advantage is that they can create smoother surfaces with fewer control points 30 nurbs are mathematical representations of complex structures be it two or three dimensional objects e g cars buildings cones or simple curves they are the computer graphics design industry standard when it comes to creating or interpolating complex objects 30 32 generally they work exceptionally well in three dimensional modelling enabling the designer to easily manipulate control points and the contours smoothness the non uniform in nurbs refers to the idea that some segments or sections of a defined shape can be easily manipulated relative to other sections of the overall shape with control points being associated with weights positive numbers when these control points all have the same weight the curve is called non rational 28 31 33 and the rationality of nurbs means that the curves have the possibility of being rational i e nurbs have the ability to give more weight to the control points in the overall curve shape 3 3 wavelet transform data interpolation wavelet transform is a technique derived from the fourier transform ft and short time fourier transform stft limitations that arise from the ft and stft techniques gave birth to the wavelet transform 24 34 the ft provides frequency information of a signal that represents frequencies and their magnitude however it does not tell when in time these frequency components exist 35 36 therefore it is ideal for signals that do not change with time i e signals that have a constant frequency throughout consequently ft s disadvantage is that it lacks capability to provide frequency information for a localised signal region in time stft was therefore developed to overcome the poor time resolution of the ft thus stft explains the time frequency representation of the signal and it assumes that a certain portion of the non stationary signal is stationary 37 38 the main limitation of stft is that high frequency components appear as short bursts thus needing higher time resolution 39 40 so the wavelet transform improves on this shortfall i e it results in analysing a signal into different frequencies at different resolutions therefore a wavelet is a rapidly decaying wave like oscillation that has zero mean and exists for a finite duration 24 34 38 41 44 wavelet interpolation is a key factor in time series data due to the data s stationarity properties it is advantageous to apply this technique when the function is not smooth and is oscillating pywavelets an open source wavelet transform software for python can be used to interpolate the missing values for oscillating data 45 pywavelets combines a simple high level interface with low level c and cython performance python consists of different types of wavelet families e g haar morlet gaussian or frequency b spline wavelets therefore for accurate results a wavelet family which fits best with the supplied data must be chosen each wavelet family is useful for a different purpose as they have different smoothness shape and compactness 3 4 statistical profiling approach anomaly detection statistical profiling is a simple and fast process that involves calculating measures of central tendency of the historical data and examining them 14 this can be done by calculating the mean median or the moving average of the data standard deviation can also be calculated and be used to set up the uppermost and lower bounds of the dataset as anomaly thresholds this technique is known as the z score analysis in which the anomaly threshold is set by the three standard deviations above and below the mean e g refs 5 46 values that are outside the three standard deviation thresholds are considered strong anomalies fig 7 simple moving average can also be used for anomaly detection it is applied to capture the pattern in time series the difference between the actual and simple moving average can be computed to determine the tolerance band and identify anomalies 3 5 predictive confidence level approach anomaly detection another way of detecting anomalies in time series data is by using the historical data to build a predictive model to get the overall trend seasonality or cyclic pattern of the data the model error can be analysed between the predicted and actual values and use that to compute a confidence interval fig 8 the values falling beyond the confidence band can be regarded as anomalies for example an arima model can be built and use the mean absolute percentage error mape to come up with a confidence band 47 48 other ml or deep learning based algorithms such as the lstm or lstm autoencoder produce accurate results for time series data and thus can be used to find anomalies 49 this technique is highly dependable on the accuracy and good performance of the predictive model therefore the model must be tuned to ensure that it produces a low error 4 dataset 4 1 background sampling and monitoring of mine water is usually done on a regular basis to carefully examine its chemistry this study uses the south african westrand mine water treatment plant s data gathered between 2016 and 03 07 and 2021 07 13 the data contains nine parameters i e acidity alkalinity electrical conductivity ec fe mn ph so4 temperature and turbidity which were used in the units applied by the plant operators the parameters do not have an equal number of observations i e some of the measurements are missing the highest number of observations of an individual parameter is 1123 table 1 robust data analytics approaches which included data interpolation and anomaly detection were conducted to prepare the data to be used in the machine learning models 4 2 stationarity test stationarity tests are critical as several statistical applications and models are computed based on its results for example numerical models are often applied to time series data when it is non stationary and probabilistic models are sometimes useful and accurate when the dataset is stationary 14 data interpolation and anomaly detection approaches are guided by stationarity tests therefore the augmented dickey fuller adf test was used on the dataset to test the stationarity of the time series table 2 a stationary dataset will have a p value that is highly significant 0 05 additionally scatter plots for the dataset were drawn to visualise the patterns trends and seasonality and identify any stationarity or non stationarity properties of the data fig 9 from the statistical results the p value obtained for temperature is less than 0 05 therefore the null hypothesis is rejected i e temperature time series is stationary however the graphs show that temperature data are oscillating a prominent seasonality can be observed in series for the other parameters the p value for the time series is greater than 0 05 therefore the null hypothesis is accepted i e the dataset for the parameters is non stationary finally the statistical results show that numerical modelling can be used to interpolate missing measurements and detect anomalies 4 3 normality test normality tests identify if the data has been sampled from a normal distribution when data are plotted on a frequency distribution the normal distribution can be explained by a bell curve shape with majority of the observations being around the mean value from the graphs plotted the data are log normally bi modally and multi modally distributed and only temperature shows a close to gaussian distribution fig 10 mining influenced water data are continuous data thus the normality test is a crucial process for deciding statistical methods and measures of central tendency to perform data analysis apart from graphical methods there are several statistical techniques applied to test for normality of data in this study the scipy 1 7 0 module was used to compute the kolmogorov smirnov shapiro wilk and anderson darling normality tests table 3 statistical tests conducted using the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk methods show p values for the parameters to be below the 5 significance level meaning that the data do not follow a normal distribution using the anderson darling test the test statistics are well above the critical values at α 0 15 0 10 0 05 0 025 and 0 01 0 574 0 654 0 784 0 915 and 1 088 which also implies that the data do not follow a normal distribution 4 4 data transformation as has been shown in the previous section the dataset is not normally distributed several statistical methods especially time series forecasting techniques are based on the assumption that the data are normally distributed thus building forecasting models with un transformed data often results in inaccurate forecasting results therefore data transformation is taking data that are not normally distributed and transforming it to a close to normal distribution 50 53 data transformation does not change the relationship of the variables for mathematical and statistical purposes so the procedure is a statistically necessary step towards building models that can forecast data with accuracy and precision from the results it can be seen that alkalinity ec and mn have a multi modal distribution and acidity fe ph and so4 show a bi modal distribution temperature shows a close to normal distribution and turbidity has a log normal distribution therefore only turbidity will be transformed there are several ways to transform the data such as log normal square root reciprocal or box cox transformation in this study a natural log normal transformation was used each variable of x was replaced by ln x finally quantile quantile q q and histogram graphs were plotted to test the normality of the transformed turbidity data fig 11 in a q q plot for a normally distributed data observations lie approximately on a straight line therefore the graphs show that turbidity after being transformed is close to a normal distribution slightly showing a bi modal distribution 5 anomaly detection and data interpolation the dataset used for this study contains sample times with missing measurements resulting from equipment malfunctioning or because no sample was taken and has a small percentage of outliers identified by the statistical analysis conducted in the previous sections there are several statistical methods to interpolate missing values and detect anomalies for time series data some of which have been discussed earlier in this study predictive confidence level approach with gradient boosting regression tree algorithm was used to detect anomalies in this approach python s scikit learn 0 24 2 library was used to build the gradient boosting regression model this model was fitted on the data with three prediction bands of α 0 10 0 50 and 0 90 fig 12 the α 0 10 prediction band represents the lower bound of the data real observations plotting below this band are considered possible anomalies while the α 0 90 prediction band represents the upper bound of the data real observations plotting above this band are considered possible anomalies for the mid prediction alpha was set to 0 50 and this predicts the median of the original data therefore values plotting on the α 0 50 prediction band were used to replace the possible anomalies for the build up of gradient boosting regression model for each target output all other parameters were used as input variables e g when acidity was set as the target output alkalinity ec fe mn ph so4 temperature and turbidity were set as input variables this model used 100 trees a maximum tree depth of 2 and learning rate of 0 05 to perform predictions and the data were split into training 80 and testing 20 sets gradient boosting model s objective was to predict the values of the parameters that will possibly be used to build the forecasting models there are several hidden features some of which are not included in the data which affect each parameter therefore the uncertainty in the estimates was shown by predicting the lower α 0 10 middle α 0 50 and upper α 0 90 bands of the observations the loss function of the gradient boosting model was changed to quantiles with selected prediction intervals alphas this configuration ensures that the model performs predictions which correspond to percentiles numerical analysis modelling was applied to interpolate the missing measurements numerical analysis assumes that time series data trend and pattern represent an unknown function 14 the main task when applying this technique is to find a suitable function for the data so it can be used to interpolate the missing values for reasons described above b spline interpolation technique using python s scipy library was used in this study b spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where a continuous curve has various piecewise polynomials whose gradients match up at the measured data interpolation in this form takes place between two points that have missing values i e a function is derived between the points and interpolation takes place the polynomials are continuous up to their second derivative and this process occurs for every paired point that has missing values between them 24 54 finally the interpolated values fitted well into the known population and these interpolated values did not change the trends and patterns of the original data fig 13 this implies that b spline interpolation is an accurate technique for non stationary time series data 6 modelling data data analytics approaches were conducted to detect anomalies and interpolate the missing observations by robust statistical techniques described above which provided a clean dataset that could be used for modelling a correlation chart of nine parameters all with 1955 observations was computed using r 4 1 2 on rstudio 1 1 456 and this produced a chart with cross plots distribution plots and pearson correlation coefficients r fig 14 parameters of concern at the westrand mine water treatment plant are acidity and fe therefore their relationships with other parameters were thoroughly examined the statistical analyses show that both acidity and fe have high correlations with alkalinity ec mn ph and so4 additionally alkalinity ph and so4 have good relationships with acidity and fe with r above 0 8 therefore alkalinity ph and so4 were used as input parameters for final forecasting with acidity and fe being the target outputs fig 2 turbidity and temperature were not used to build the forecasting models because they have poor relationships with the rest of the parameters as displayed by the correlation coefficients in total seven parameters from the available nine were used to develop the models 7 model development and evaluation all the models were trained and tested independently and only the best performing model was used in the project to create the final forecasting evaluation metrics used for the models include the mean squared error mse and mean absolute error mae by statistical definition mse is a measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values in a dataset while mae refers to the measure of the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values 55 the forecasted concentrations and values of alkalinity ph and so4 by the lstm model were supplied to the best performing model to forecast fe and acidity concentrations for the lstm model three structures were developed with different numbers of the lookback period which explains the number of previous time steps the model needs to use to predict the subsequent time step epochs and validation split table 4 a single hidden layer multivariate lstm model with 32 memory units based on the structure variations explained was compiled and a relu activation function was used throughout for all the structure variations the models were fitted with a batch size of 32 the adaptive moment estimation adam optimiser and mse loss function were used in this model and the low validation and training loss implies good model fitting on the new and training data table 5 different techniques were applied to tune the hyper parameters for the neural network models including grid search optimisation technique keras tuner and trial and error method for the ann model the configuration that yielded better results was a model with input layers that consisted of three neurons of alkalinity ph and so4 while fe and acidity were used in the output layer with a relu activation function the model had one hidden layer of four neurons and a relu activation function the dnn architecture consisted of two hidden layers the first one with four neurons and another with two neurons both with a relu activation function like ann input parameters were alkalinity ph and so4 with target outputs being fe and acidity both the neural network models used a test size of 20 and the models were compiled using the adam optimiser they were then fitted for 500 epochs with a batch size of 64 the model performances were tested using the mse and mae accuracy metrics table 5 a random forest regression tree model was built using 150 trees and a maximum depth of 8 with a test split of 20 a gradient boosting regression tree model was compiled using 100 trees maximum depth of 5 and learning rate of 0 05 with a test size of 20 regression tree model performances were also evaluated using mse and mae table 5 8 results and discussions machine learning models developed in this study consisted of a multivariate lstm model which was used to forecast alkalinity ph and so4 for 60 days using three different structure variations fig 15 furthermore ann dnn random forest and gradient boosting models were trained and tested using historical data random forest displayed the overall best performance and was used to forecast fe and acidity concentrations for the same period as the lstm model fig 16 the multivariate lstm forecasting has three different forecasted concentrations for alkalinity and so4 as well as the ph values which then resulted in the random forest model also forecasting three different concentrations for fe and acidity with random forest using alkalinity ph and so4 as input parameters the forecasted concentrations and values by the lstm model were fed to the trained random forest model therefore the random forest model showed good performance and forecasted fe and acidity concentrations with accuracy as the values fall within the population and follows the trend in addition the results suggest that ml models can be widely applied in mine water time series forecasting analysis the models were evaluated using mse and mae and in all occasions the error was substantially low however the neural network models training loss was always greater than the validation loss which meant that there is data leaking in the training process hyper parameters were rigorously tuned using grid search keras tuner and trial and error approach but training loss continued to be slightly greater than the validation loss therefore the final decision was that the models cannot be used for final forecasting analysis regression tree models displayed better performance with random forest performing better than the gradient boosting thus random forest was used to perform final forecasting analysis random forest showed superior performance because it is good at handling nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables it also has built in mechanisms to prevent overfitting such as bagging and random feature selection making it more reliable than other models in situations where overfitting is a concern 9 comparing the measured and forecasted data for the final target outputs forecasted concentrations of fe and acidity using random forest model were compared with the measured data by calculating the forecasting error table 6 measured data only contains 23 observations while the forecasting period was for 60 days this is because sampling was not carried out daily for this period thus the forecasting error was only calculated for the available measured data furthermore cross plots of measured and forecasted data with robust regression lines were computed fig 17 computed plots and calculations show both the low coefficients of determinations r 2 and statistical significances however the calculated forecasting errors are relatively low with only four notable higher errors the reason for such differences may be because of the sampling that was not conducted daily at the treatment plant 10 conclusions forecasted concentrations of fe and acidity by the random forest model fall within the historical data population and follow its recent trend and pattern therefore the proposed methodology can be applied with certainty and confidence in forecasting mine water chemistry machine learning forecasting approach proved that the application can use data from several parameters to forecast other parameters i e the model was developed in a way that the computer learns the trends patterns and seasonality of input data to forecast the target outputs parameters in a time series are related to each other and influence the outcomes in each parameter s dataset therefore focusing only on one parameter to perform forecasting analysis would be inaccurate traditional statistical forecasting techniques such as arima or box jenkins which forecast data of a parameter by learning its structure without relating it to other parameters should be avoided in future applications thus the forecasting technique proposed here will be a useful tool for water treatment plants because it will help in understanding changes in the mine water chemistry and volumes in advance it can be concluded that forecasting mine water chemistry by applying ml models is a relevant contribution in and addition to mine water treatment plants comparing the neural network and regression tree models the results show that random forest regression tree model performed better than the other models finally the results obtained in this study indicate that regression tree algorithms are powerful and important mechanisms to model and forecast the complex mine water time series data or nonlinear systems these approaches were able to analyse the hidden patterns trends and seasonality among the historical mine water dataset in a much better and accurate approach compared to traditional time series analysis and statistical techniques lastly the findings of this study have revealed that transforming time series data before using it for modelling is sometimes necessary to achieve more accurate forecasting results credit author contribution statement conceptualisation kagiso samuel more funding acquisition christian wolkersdorfer software kagiso samuel more supervision

process the influence of several factors including sodium percarbonate concentration ozone dose ph and water matrix were investigated a synergetic coefficient of 3 84 was achieved for the combination of sodium percarbonate and ozone confirming the effectiveness of this hybrid process scavenging tests revealed that carbonate radicals hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen contributed to the degradation of bisphenol s at the same operating condition degradation effectiveness values of 99 and 81 were obtained by ozone combined with sodium percarbonate and hydrogen peroxide respectively demonstrating the superiority of sodium percarbonate over hydrogen peroxide in combination with ozone for the degradation of bisphenol s low concentration of inorganic anions had a negligible effect on the degradation while carbonate ions increased the first order degradation rate constant by 56 keywords effluents wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes hybrid processes radicals chemical treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction emerging contaminants constituting a large quantity of new unnaturally occurring substances in water have known or suspected detrimental effects on living organisms 1 3 these pollutants consist of pharmaceutical surfactants personal care products industrial additives and solvents household products and pesticides 4 5 in this group of pollutants synthetic organic compounds known as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs can be regarded as a serious threat to sustainability of many creatures since they cause numerous adverse impacts on animal health especially on their reproduction and development system 6 8 plasticizers are one of the dangerous chemicals included in the category of edcs bisphenol bp is one of the common chemicals used as plasticizers which have different categories such as a b s f af etc and among them bpa were widely used in the plastic production and had many applications 9 11 these compounds are easily leachable and contaminate the aquatic environment and pose environmental hazards bpa can be regarded as a weak estrogen receptor agonist and can cause harmful influence especially on reproduction and development system of human beings 12 13 as a result many countries banned the use of bpa in the industrial application as an alternative to bpa industries started extensively using their structural analogues especially bps the emissions of bps and its concentration in the environment probably will increase as its production and use is extremely growing it is utilized as an additive in pesticides colorfast agents flame retardants dyestuffs baby bottles food packaging material etc 14 15 thus studies on degradation of this pollutant in aqueous conditions fall into the technology oriented studies on wastewater treatment processes however studies have indicated that bps can cause the same genotoxicity and estrogenic activity as bpa intensify lymphocyte proliferation be problematic for physiologic function in both human beings and rodents and even be more environmentally persistent than bpa 16 17 bps is more thermally stable and possesses higher adsorption and permeability towards skin hence the release of effluent from a variety of industries such food industry containing bps into the environment can have high hazardous effects 15 18 a considerable amount of bps usually passes through secondary treatment procedures and subsequently enters the aquatic environment 19 the incorporation of sulfonic group in the molecular structure of bps causes its resistance to biodegradation therefore the biodegradation of this substance is not usually efficient and it is required to develop more efficient method for the removal of this pollutant 20 21 therefore a proper treatment technology must be addressed and considered for bps as well advanced oxidation processes aops are one of the efficient techniques utilized for the degradation of organic pollutants including plasticizers 22 25 in this process reactive oxidizing species are generated in situ which can react with the organics at high rate various aops attempted for the plasticizers degradation are fenton processes 26 cavitation based processes 27 28 persulfate based processes 29 ozonation 30 and photocatalytic oxidation 31 an attracting feature of aops is the transformation and even mineralization of many organic contaminants which are resistant to biological methods and leads to a reduction in their potential danger to the environment and human life 32 33 there are several studies detailing the degradation of bpa but the degradation of bps has been rarely investigated frankowski et al 34 have studied the degradation of bps using photo fenton and reported 100 degradation effectiveness at optimum conditions during 10 20 min mehrabani zeinabad et al 35 have reported that a bps degradation effectiveness above 95 was achieved using ultraviolet combined with ozone cao et al 36 have investigated the effect of a variety of factors on the photodegradation of bps and reported 100 degradation effectiveness at optimized conditions wang et al 37 have reported almost 100 degradation effectiveness of bps by heat activated persulfate at a temperature of 70 c in 120 min ozone o3 is known as a powerful oxidant which has various applications such as disinfection decolorization removal of odor and sludge reduction 38 it is highly selective towards specific functional groups like unsaturated bonds and deprotonated amins 39 the oxidation in o3 based processes takes place through two key oxidation pathways these pathways are the direct oxidation by o3 molecules and indirect oxidation performed by generated oh 40 41 although o3 possesses a high redox potential oxidation through the direct oxidation by sole o3 usually leads to a low degradation efficiency of organic pollutants 42 extensive studies have indicated that the oxidation of a variety of compounds by oh has greater reaction rate and mineralization efficiency compared to oxidation by o3 molecules 43 some researchers have regarded the combination of o3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 called peroxone process as a solution for this problem since it can result in the generation of more hydroxyl radicals oh 44 46 according to a sustainability viewpoint a method is required to be efficient environmentally friendly and easy to be employed to be able to be transferred from lab scales to industrial applications and concentrated h2o2 has the drawbacks of difficult storage and transportation 43 sodium percarbonate spc with formula na2co3 1 5h2o2 can be considered as solid carrier of h2o2 47 one of the superiorities of percarbonate pc over h2o2 are safety in transportation and storage without any risk of spilling splashing and corrosion it costs almost 3 times less than h2o2 which can make it more suitable for industrial scale applications the controlled release of h2o2 can be another advantage of this oxidant 48 49 therefore this safety and convenience has made pc an attractive oxidant employed in wastewater treatment 50 in addition it is more environmentally friendly and safer as its toxicity is lower compared to h2o2 51 moreover compared to some other aops like fenton reagent pc based aops can be applied in a wide range of ph 52 although the low degradation efficiency and mineralization degree induced by direct pc can be regarded as a negative point after its activation the generated reactive species can contribute to the degradation of pollutants and result in high efficiency 53 pc based treatment processes can be applied for the degradation of a variety of contaminants these combined processes have been reported to be effective for the treatment of pesticide laden wastewater 54 dye industry effluent 55 and degradation of chlorinated organic compounds 56 antibiotics 57 aniline 58 etc a variety of factors such as the concentrations of oxidants anions ph etc can positively or negatively influence the effectiveness of pc based ozonation 59 an increase in ph with the addition of spc is an advantage in the ozonation process 60 by considering all the above facts the aim of the current investigation was to 1 study the degradation of bps using a combination of spc and o3 spc o3 2 compare the degradation effectiveness with peroxone process 3 investigate a variety of parameters such as the concentration of oxidants and initial ph of solution 4 identify the major species formed in the medium 5 and study the practicability of the processes in the presence of co existence of inorganic anions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium percarbonate na2co3 1

sodium chloride was purchased from stanlab poland and 1 4 diazabicyclo 2 2 2 octane dabco was purchased from chemat poland all materials were of analytical grade and were utilized without further purification o3 was generated by a tytan 32 ozone generator erem 2 2 procedure aqueous solution of bps was prepared using a magnetic stirrer 700 rpm at the room temperature spc was added to the solution at the beginning of experiments ph was measured by a ph test paper chemland poland experiments were performed in a batch reactor and a reaction temperature of 20 2 c was maintained by circulating cooling water through a cooling coil installed into the reactor the total treatment time for all experiments was 60 min all experiments were conducted in deionized water at an initial bps concentration of 50 ppm o3 was continuously injected from the ozone generator to the reactor through a nozzle throughout the treatment initial samples were taken before the start of the treatment and then samples were taken every 10 min until 60 min to identify the reactive species a selected scavenger with a ratio of 30 1 scavenger spc was used the effect of inorganic anions was studied with the addition of an inorganic anion at a ratio of 100 1 and 1000 1 anion bps the degradation of bps with spc o3 system was performed initially the degradation effectiveness was determined by eq 1 first order degradation rate constant was also calculated using eq 2 1 d e g r a d a t i o n e f f e c t i v e n e s s c 0 c c 0 100 2 k ln c 0 c t where k c0 t and c refer to first order degradation rate constant the initial concentration of bps the time of reaction min and the concentration in time t respectively 2 3 investigation of ozone emission from the reactor the emission of unreacted o3 was determined by potassium iodide wet chemistry test 61 a piece of ptee tube was attached to a dedicated outlet of the reactor the other end of the tube was connected to two scrubbers which contained 400 ml of potassium iodide aqueous solution 2 each the unreacted o3 was absorbed in the scrubbers then the solution in both scrubbers was titrated with na2s2o3 0 01 n to determine how much o3 was emitted from the reactor 2 4 analysis the concentration of bps in the sample was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a c18 column which had a dimension of 4 6 150 mm obtained from agilent technologies usa the mobile phase applied in the determination was a mixture of acetonitrile water 30 70 v v under isocratic conditions with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 the detection wavelength was 260 nm all the determinations were performed twice and the average values of two analyses were reported 3 result and discussion 3 1 degradation study of bps by spc o3 system combined application of spc and o3 spc o3 can result in the formation of reactive radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and carbonate radicals co3 which can attack pollutant molecules and degrade them into less harmful compounds 59 the degradation of bps by sps o3 is attributed to several possible reactions between both chemicals as well as the fact that spc can induce alkaline conditions in the solution the changes made in the initial ph of solution as a result of the addition of different concentrations of spc are shown in fig 1 the alkaline condition can be beneficial for the decomposition of o3 and generation of reactive oh which can happen through three following paths initiated by hydroxyl ions eqs 3 11 29 path 1 3 o3 oh ho2 o2 4 ho2 h o2 5 o3 o2 o3 o2 6 o3 h2o oh oh o2 path 2 7 o3 oh ho2 o2 8 o3 ho2 oh o2 o2 followed by eq 5 and eq 6 path 3 9 o3 oh ho2 o2 10 o3 ho2 o3 ho2 11 ho2 oh o2 h2o followed by eq 5 and eq 6 in addition h2o2 originated from spc can accelerate the decomposition of o3 and consequently the generation of oh according to the eqs 12 and 13 60 12 2na2co3 3h2o2 2na2co3 3h2o2 13 o3 h2o2 2 oh 3o2 furthermore the induced alkaline condition shifts eq 14 towards the production of more ho2 which can lead to the production of more oh according to eq 8 and eq 10 42 14 h2o2 ho2 h carbonate ions can be regarded as a scavenger for reactive oh according eq 15 however generated co3 can selectively oxidize electron rich compounds like bps and contribute to the degradation of the pollutant 15 co3 2 oh co3 oh singlet oxygen 1o2 is a relatively strong oxidant which can be produced through the reaction of oh or ho2 with o2 according to eq 16 and eq 17 62 63 therefore it can also have an effect on the degradation of pollutants using o3 based processes 16 o2 oh 1o2 oh 17 o2 ho2 h 1o2 h2o2 although spc acts as a base increasing the ph of water h2o2 has acidic property decreasing the ph of solution 64 since alkaline ph is the desired condition in o3 based processes the adjustment of ph in h2o2 o3 requires higher cost compared to spc o3 3 1 1 comparison of bps degradation effectiveness by spc o3 and spc h2o2 in order to determine the superiority of spc over h2o2 for the degradation of bps by o3 exclusively by increasing ph experiments were performed using sole o3 spc o3 and h2o2 o3 at a constant ph of 11 adjusted by naoh an o3 flow rate of 0 019 mol h 1 a spc concentration of 1 mol l 1 or a h2o2 concentration of 1 5 mol l 1 the degradation effectiveness and kinetic results are illustrated in fig 2 based on the outcomes spc o3 resulted in a maximum degradation effectiveness of 99 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0755 min 1 while sole o3 led to a degradation effectiveness of 92 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0478 min 1 and h2o2 o3 caused a degradation effectiveness of 81 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0323 min 1 thus it is obvious that the spc o3 is the best solution even despite its positive effect on increasing ph among these three aops for the degradation of bps in aqueous medium in h2o2 o3 the addition of h2o2 all in once to the solution can increase the degradation effectiveness at the beginning of the experiment but after a while its scavenging effect can lead to a reduction in the concentration of available oh required for the degradation of the pollutant while in spc o3 the slow release of h2o2 from spc keeps a sustained supply of h2o2 in the solution 65 the enhancement in the degradation effectiveness made as a result of the presence of spc can be related to the mild release of h2o2 which can suppress its scavenging effect and it can react with o3 and produce reactive oh furthermore pc can virtually act as a buffer and prevent from a considerable reduction in the ph of solutions throughout the experiment 64 the changes in the ph of solution during the experiments are demonstrated in fig 3 as it is observed the decrease in the solution ph in spc o3 is smoother than sole o3 the generation of co3 might be another reason for the promotion of the degradation of bps using spc o3 3 1 2 identification of radical species several species such as hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and carbonate radical co3 could take part in the degradation of bps in spc o3 system radical quenchers are capable to react with a variety of oxidative species but their selectivity is towards a particular radical radical quenching experiments were performed to identify the reactive species which participated in the degradation of this pollutant at a ph of 9 and a rox m o l e s p c o z o n e m o l e b p s of 5 02 the scavengers were used in a high mole ratio of 30 1 s c a v e n g e r s p c 30 to ensure the complete scavenging of radicals the degradation effectiveness and kinetic results are demonstrated in fig 4 methanol is known as a scavenger for oh reacting with it at a second order reaction rate constant of 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and slowly reacts with other radicals 27 since oh usually involves in the degradation of organic compounds using o3 based processes methanol was employed to study the involvement of this radical in the degradation of bps carbonate anion can react with ho and produce co3 according to eq 15 at a second order reaction rate constant of 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 44 therefore phenol was utilized to evaluate the participation of co3 phenol can be regarded as a quencher for both ho and co3 as it reacts with these radicals at high second order reaction rate constants of 6 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 50 66 67 therefore a comparison between the results achieved through the presence of methanol and phenol can show the contribution of co3 para benzoquinone pbq can be used as a quenching agent for o2 since it reacts rapidly with this radical at a high second order reaction rate constants of 0 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 27 68 dabco can scavenge oh and 1o2 at second order reaction rate constant values of 1 25 109 m 1 s 1 and 3 1 108 m 1 s 1 respectively hence the difference between the degradation effectiveness achieved in the presence of methanol and dabco can prove the role of 1o2 in the degradation of bps using spc o3 69 according to the results methanol decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant of the process from 97 to 0 0632 min 1 to 75 and 0 0255 min 1 respectively proving the generation and moderate contribution of oh in the degradation of bps using spc o3 the presence of phenol in the solution decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 28 and 0 005 min 1 respectively the noticeable difference in the degradation efficiencies between methanol and phenol reveals the significant role of co3 as it can selectively oxidize electron rich substances such as bps as it is demonstrated the addition of p bq to the solution caused a drop in the degradation effectiveness to 32 demonstrating the significance of superoxide radical o2 in the degradation of the pollutant the presence of dabco in the solution decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 48 and 0 102 min 1 respectively the difference between the degradation effectiveness of bps in the presence of methanol and dabco can prove the involvement of singlet oxygen 1o2 in the degradation of bps it should be considered that although this scavenging test can be performed to prove the generation of radicals and their participation in the degradation of pollutants it cannot be employed for investigating the exact quantification of contribution of reactive species as it can be overlaid with this fact that scavenging some radicals prohibits the formation of some other radicals 67 3 2 effect of spc concentration a variety of factors can influence the degradation effectiveness of pollutants using aops and the concentration of oxidants is one of those key factors to investigate the effect of this parameter the degradation of bps was performed using different concentrations of spc at a constant o3 flow rate of 0 019 mol h 1 since alkaline ph induced by spc is one of advantages in spc o3 ph was not adjusted in these experiments the degradation effectiveness and kinetics of these experiments are demonstrated in fig 5 as it is observed in fig 5 the combination of o3 with spc enhanced the degradation effectiveness of the pollutant exhibiting the synergistic effect of them based on the results sole o3 led to a degradation effectiveness of 61 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0174 min 1 in 60 min reaction time no degradation was observed using sole spc throughout the experiment an increase in the concentration of spc till an optimum amount of 1 mol l 1 increased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 97 and 0 0669 min 1 respectively and beyond this value they remained almost constant and then underwent a slight decrease the synergetic coefficient sc of combination of o3 and spc was 3 84 which was calculated according to eq 18 18 s c k o 3 s p c k o 3 k s p c since sc higher than 1 generally exhibits the synergy between oxidants a sc of 3 84 indicates a noticeable synergistic effect of combined application of o3 and spc 60 the obtained results are consistent with the outcomes reported by yu et al 43 who investigated the effect of the concentration of spc on the degradation of dichlorvos and indicated that an increase in spc up to an optimum value enhanced the degradation of the pollutant and further increase had an inhabitation effect the enhanced degradation effectiveness through an increase in spc concertation can be attributed to the enhanced generation of reactive species through eqs 3 11 as a result of induced alkaline ph intensified generation of oh through eqs 12 and 13 due to the higher concentration of available h2o2 and enhanced generation of selective carbonate radicals according to eq 15 the decrease observed beyond the optimum value of spc is probably caused by the excess amount of spc that forms excessive h2o2 which is a scavenger for oh and can consume it according to eq 19 19 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o therefore the available oh responsible for the oxidation of the pollutant decreased and caused a drop in the first order degradation rate constant 3 3 effect of o3 concentration the concentration of o3 is another factor impacting the degradation of the pollutant it is important to assess the optimum value of this oxidant especially in order to decrease the cost of the decontamination in o3 based process hence the degradation effectiveness of bpc was investigated under 3 different flow rates of o3 at a constant spc concentration of 1 mol l 1 and a constant ph of 11 in 60 min the degradation effectiveness and kinetic results are demonstrated in fig 6 analysis of results presented on fig 6 confirms that along with an increase in the flow rate of o3 continuously increased the degradation effectiveness of the pollutant the utilization of o3 with flow rates of 0 009 mol h 1 0 015 mol h 1 and 0 019 mol h 1 led to degradation effectiveness values of 16 63 and 99 k 0 0755 min 1 respectively this trend was expected and is in agreement with the data reported by guo et al 60 who studied the influence of concentration of o3 on the degradation of antibiotic sulfamethoxazole using the same aop obviously an increase in o3 concentration can enhance its decomposition and the reaction between o3 and h2o2 and as a result intensify the formation of oh and the degradation of pollutants 70 3 4 effect of ph the ph of solutions plays an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants using o3 based processes since it influences the paths of oxidation of pollutants affecting the effectiveness of decontamination processes 60 in order to study the influence of ph on the degradation of bps the experiments were performed using 4 different ph values of 5 7 9 and 11 at a constant rox of 5 02 due to the fact that o3 is not very effective in acidic conditions lower ph conditions were not studied the degradation effectiveness and kinetic outcomes are illustrated in fig 7 it can be seen that an increase in ph enhanced the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant and the pollutants were almost completely degraded 99 with a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0755 min 1 at a ph value of 11 the degradation effectiveness values of bps systematically decreased from 97 for ph 9 59 and 50 for ph 7 and 5 respectively the results to some extent can be in accordance to the study performed by chen and wang 71 who studied the effect of ph on the degradation of ofloxacin and indicated the agreement of their results with this original view that the degradation of organic compounds using peroxone o3 h2o2 is accelerated at alkaline condition this ascending trend can be attributed to the fact that the decomposition of o3 and consequent generation of oh can be facilitated in alkaline condition in which oh is utilized as an initiator for the formation of oh in this system in fact an increase in ph can shift the degradation pathway from direct oxidation by o3 to indirect oxidation performed by reactive radicals leading to an enhancement in degradation effectiveness furthermore in alkaline condition more ho2 can be generated according to eq 14 resulting in the formation of more oh and as a result the intensification of the degradation 40 it can be again an indication proving that the presence of spc as an agent increasing the ph of solution due to hydrolysis of co3 2 according to fig 1 can result in an enhancement in the degradation of bps by ozonation regardless of other positive effects of spc on the degradation of this pollutant in addition spc is less stable in alkaline condition and can be decomposed faster contributing to the degradation of pollutants 72 3 5 effect of inorganic anions natural water contains a variety of dissolved compounds such as inorganic anions and other organic substances as the content of water matrix can extremely influence the effectiveness of employed treatment methods it is crucial to investigate the impact of common anions existing in natural water on the degradation of pollutants for this aim experiments were done at the presence of nacl na2so4 na2co3 and nano3 at a ratio of 100 a n i o n b p s 100 and a rox of 5 02 in 60 min the kinetic results of this investigation are demonstrated in fig 8 according to the results the degradation effectiveness of the pollutant was almost constant at the presence of low concentration of nacl na2so4 and nano3 however they negligibly decreased the first order degradation rate constant therefore it can be concluded that the presence of low concentration of these three anions did not affect significantly the degradation of bps using spc o3 nevertheless the promotion effect of the presence of na2co3 was obvious the addition of na2co3 to the solution led to an increase in the degradation effectiveness of bps and the complete degradation of this pollutant happened in 50 min at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0985 min 1 na2co3 does not directly react with o3 but it reacts with oh produced by the decomposition of o3 and generates co3 73 the effect of co3 2 on oh based processes depends on the types of pollutants molecules 74 the generated co3 can make a contribution to the degradation of organic pollutants and mainly react with electron rich compounds like phenol and compounds containing s and n with a first order degradation rate constant in a range from 105 to 109 m 1 s 1 27 75 hence in spite of the lower oxidation potential of co3 it can indicate better performance in the degradation of electron rich compounds which can be the result of its longer life time and higher selectivity 76 78 furthermore the buffering capacity of co3 2 prevents a drastic decrease in the ph throughout the process 79 hence it can be another aspect of the positive effect of co3 2 on the degradation effectiveness of bps by spc o3 nacl na2so4 and nano3 were employed at a higher concentration a n i o n b p s 1000 to evaluate the performance of used oxidation system in high salinity conditions and the results are illustrated in fig 9 as it is observed at a higher concentration the effect of nacl was still weak however it slightly increased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 99 and 0 0744 min 1 nacl can have both inhabitation and promotion effects on the degradation of organic pollutants using aops 27 cl can consume oh and produce cl through a series of reactions and the produced cl can participate in the degradation of pollutants since it has a high oxidation potential of 2 4 v 43 it can also react with cl and generate cl2 while these reactions are more significant in acidic conditions 73 the presence of cl can inhibit the degradation of the electron poor compounds because of the consumption of oh nevertheless it can enhance the degradation of electron rich compounds since the generated cl2 can be more selective towards electron rich centers resulting in more focused oxidation on target contaminants 27 hence it can be a possible reason for the slight increase in the degradation of bps in the presence nacl at its high concentration na2so4 decreased first order degradation rate constant to 0 0471 min 1 so4 2 can consume oh and generate so4 which possesses a lower oxidation potential compared to oh 80 also here more selective system can be obtained hence the slight reduction in the degradation of bps caused by the addition of na2so4 can be due the scavenging effect of so4 2 leading to a decrease in the concentration of oh 27 the results show that the impact of high concentration of nano3 on the degradation of bps was much more significant than the effect of so4 2 and cl 1 the no3 anions decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 24 and 0 0057 min 1 it follows from the fact that no3 is a quencher for reactive oh and reduces the amount of oh available for the oxidation of pollutants it reacts with oh to form no3 which has lower oxidation potential rather than oh based on the results this radical was unable to oxidize bps at an appropriate first order degradation rate constant causing a drastic decrease in the degradation effectiveness however it should be taken into account that the presence of both no3 and so4 2 can promote the degradation of some organic pollutants using aops 74 these results are positive in overall as so high concentration of nitrates are not common for industrial effluents nitrites at this concertation could be found only in case of some fertilizer related effluents or in effluents after nitrification process in second case it would be more practical to first perform denitrification stage biological conversion of nitrates to n2 and later apply aop stage for degradation of bps 4 conclusion degradation of bps was effectively performed using the combined process of spc o3 a degradation effectiveness of 99 k 0 0755 min 1 was obtained at optimum conditions ph 11 o3 flow rate 0 019 mol h 1 spc concentration 1 mol l 1 during 60 min while just 81 degradation effectiveness k 0 0323 min 1 was achieved by h2o2 o3 at the same conditions h2o2 concentration 1 5 mol l 1 the in situ induced alkaline conditions and generated carbonate radicals as a result of the presence spc led to a synergetic coefficient of 3 84 for spc o3 proving the efficacy of this hybrid process oh co3 o2 and 1o2 were the reactive species participating in degradation of bps verified by scavenger tests an increase in spc till an optimum value enhanced the degradation of bps and further increase caused a reduction in the degradation effectiveness nevertheless in investigated ranges increasing o3 flow rate and ph continuously increased the degradation effectiveness this aop system were revealed also to be very effective for high salinity conditions expert of nitrates which significantly inhibited the degradation of bpa so high concentration of nitrates is however uncommon and in such scenarios biological denitrification should be preferred as first stage typically occurring anions concentration range applied as a n i o n b p s to bps ratio of 100 except for co3 2 had a negligible effect on the degradation advantageously presence of co3 2 increased the first order degradation rate constant from 0 0632 min 1 to 0 0985 min 1 developed aop system proved its applicability for real case scenario wastewater treatment

process the influence of several factors including sodium percarbonate concentration ozone dose ph and water matrix were investigated a synergetic coefficient of 3 84 was achieved for the combination of sodium percarbonate and ozone confirming the effectiveness of this hybrid process scavenging tests revealed that carbonate radicals hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen contributed to the degradation of bisphenol s at the same operating condition degradation effectiveness values of 99 and 81 were obtained by ozone combined with sodium percarbonate and hydrogen peroxide respectively demonstrating the superiority of sodium percarbonate over hydrogen peroxide in combination with ozone for the degradation of bisphenol s low concentration of inorganic anions had a negligible effect on the degradation while carbonate ions increased the first order degradation rate constant by 56 keywords effluents wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes hybrid processes radicals chemical treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction emerging contaminants constituting a large quantity of new unnaturally occurring substances in water have known or suspected detrimental effects on living organisms 1 3 these pollutants consist of pharmaceutical surfactants personal care products industrial additives and solvents household products and pesticides 4 5 in this group of pollutants synthetic organic compounds known as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs can be regarded as a serious threat to sustainability of many creatures since they cause numerous adverse impacts on animal health especially on their reproduction and development system 6 8 plasticizers are one of the dangerous chemicals included in the category of edcs bisphenol bp is one of the common chemicals used as plasticizers which have different categories such as a b s f af etc and among them bpa were widely used in the plastic production and had many applications 9 11 these compounds are easily leachable and contaminate the aquatic environment and pose environmental hazards bpa can be regarded as a weak estrogen receptor agonist and can cause harmful influence especially on reproduction and development system of human beings 12 13 as a result many countries banned the use of bpa in the industrial application as an alternative to bpa industries started extensively using their structural analogues especially bps the emissions of bps and its concentration in the environment probably will increase as its production and use is extremely growing it is utilized as an additive in pesticides colorfast agents flame retardants dyestuffs baby bottles food packaging material etc 14 15 thus studies on degradation of this pollutant in aqueous conditions fall into the technology oriented studies on wastewater treatment processes however studies have indicated that bps can cause the same genotoxicity and estrogenic activity as bpa intensify lymphocyte proliferation be problematic for physiologic function in both human beings and rodents and even be more environmentally persistent than bpa 16 17 bps is more thermally stable and possesses higher adsorption and permeability towards skin hence the release of effluent from a variety of industries such food industry containing bps into the environment can have high hazardous effects 15 18 a considerable amount of bps usually passes through secondary treatment procedures and subsequently enters the aquatic environment 19 the incorporation of sulfonic group in the molecular structure of bps causes its resistance to biodegradation therefore the biodegradation of this substance is not usually efficient and it is required to develop more efficient method for the removal of this pollutant 20 21 therefore a proper treatment technology must be addressed and considered for bps as well advanced oxidation processes aops are one of the efficient techniques utilized for the degradation of organic pollutants including plasticizers 22 25 in this process reactive oxidizing species are generated in situ which can react with the organics at high rate various aops attempted for the plasticizers degradation are fenton processes 26 cavitation based processes 27 28 persulfate based processes 29 ozonation 30 and photocatalytic oxidation 31 an attracting feature of aops is the transformation and even mineralization of many organic contaminants which are resistant to biological methods and leads to a reduction in their potential danger to the environment and human life 32 33 there are several studies detailing the degradation of bpa but the degradation of bps has been rarely investigated frankowski et al 34 have studied the degradation of bps using photo fenton and reported 100 degradation effectiveness at optimum conditions during 10 20 min mehrabani zeinabad et al 35 have reported that a bps degradation effectiveness above 95 was achieved using ultraviolet combined with ozone cao et al 36 have investigated the effect of a variety of factors on the photodegradation of bps and reported 100 degradation effectiveness at optimized conditions wang et al 37 have reported almost 100 degradation effectiveness of bps by heat activated persulfate at a temperature of 70 c in 120 min ozone o3 is known as a powerful oxidant which has various applications such as disinfection decolorization removal of odor and sludge reduction 38 it is highly selective towards specific functional groups like unsaturated bonds and deprotonated amins 39 the oxidation in o3 based processes takes place through two key oxidation pathways these pathways are the direct oxidation by o3 molecules and indirect oxidation performed by generated oh 40 41 although o3 possesses a high redox potential oxidation through the direct oxidation by sole o3 usually leads to a low degradation efficiency of organic pollutants 42 extensive studies have indicated that the oxidation of a variety of compounds by oh has greater reaction rate and mineralization efficiency compared to oxidation by o3 molecules 43 some researchers have regarded the combination of o3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 called peroxone process as a solution for this problem since it can result in the generation of more hydroxyl radicals oh 44 46 according to a sustainability viewpoint a method is required to be efficient environmentally friendly and easy to be employed to be able to be transferred from lab scales to industrial applications and concentrated h2o2 has the drawbacks of difficult storage and transportation 43 sodium percarbonate spc with formula na2co3 1 5h2o2 can be considered as solid carrier of h2o2 47 one of the superiorities of percarbonate pc over h2o2 are safety in transportation and storage without any risk of spilling splashing and corrosion it costs almost 3 times less than h2o2 which can make it more suitable for industrial scale applications the controlled release of h2o2 can be another advantage of this oxidant 48 49 therefore this safety and convenience has made pc an attractive oxidant employed in wastewater treatment 50 in addition it is more environmentally friendly and safer as its toxicity is lower compared to h2o2 51 moreover compared to some other aops like fenton reagent pc based aops can be applied in a wide range of ph 52 although the low degradation efficiency and mineralization degree induced by direct pc can be regarded as a negative point after its activation the generated reactive species can contribute to the degradation of pollutants and result in high efficiency 53 pc based treatment processes can be applied for the degradation of a variety of contaminants these combined processes have been reported to be effective for the treatment of pesticide laden wastewater 54 dye industry effluent 55 and degradation of chlorinated organic compounds 56 antibiotics 57 aniline 58 etc a variety of factors such as the concentrations of oxidants anions ph etc can positively or negatively influence the effectiveness of pc based ozonation 59 an increase in ph with the addition of spc is an advantage in the ozonation process 60 by considering all the above facts the aim of the current investigation was to 1 study the degradation of bps using a combination of spc and o3 spc o3 2 compare the degradation effectiveness with peroxone process 3 investigate a variety of parameters such as the concentration of oxidants and initial ph of solution 4 identify the major species formed in the medium 5 and study the practicability of the processes in the presence of co existence of inorganic anions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium percarbonate na2co3 1

sodium chloride was purchased from stanlab poland and 1 4 diazabicyclo 2 2 2 octane dabco was purchased from chemat poland all materials were of analytical grade and were utilized without further purification o3 was generated by a tytan 32 ozone generator erem 2 2 procedure aqueous solution of bps was prepared using a magnetic stirrer 700 rpm at the room temperature spc was added to the solution at the beginning of experiments ph was measured by a ph test paper chemland poland experiments were performed in a batch reactor and a reaction temperature of 20 2 c was maintained by circulating cooling water through a cooling coil installed into the reactor the total treatment time for all experiments was 60 min all experiments were conducted in deionized water at an initial bps concentration of 50 ppm o3 was continuously injected from the ozone generator to the reactor through a nozzle throughout the treatment initial samples were taken before the start of the treatment and then samples were taken every 10 min until 60 min to identify the reactive species a selected scavenger with a ratio of 30 1 scavenger spc was used the effect of inorganic anions was studied with the addition of an inorganic anion at a ratio of 100 1 and 1000 1 anion bps the degradation of bps with spc o3 system was performed initially the degradation effectiveness was determined by eq 1 first order degradation rate constant was also calculated using eq 2 1 d e g r a d a t i o n e f f e c t i v e n e s s c 0 c c 0 100 2 k ln c 0 c t where k c0 t and c refer to first order degradation rate constant the initial concentration of bps the time of reaction min and the concentration in time t respectively 2 3 investigation of ozone emission from the reactor the emission of unreacted o3 was determined by potassium iodide wet chemistry test 61 a piece of ptee tube was attached to a dedicated outlet of the reactor the other end of the tube was connected to two scrubbers which contained 400 ml of potassium iodide aqueous solution 2 each the unreacted o3 was absorbed in the scrubbers then the solution in both scrubbers was titrated with na2s2o3 0 01 n to determine how much o3 was emitted from the reactor 2 4 analysis the concentration of bps in the sample was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a c18 column which had a dimension of 4 6 150 mm obtained from agilent technologies usa the mobile phase applied in the determination was a mixture of acetonitrile water 30 70 v v under isocratic conditions with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 the detection wavelength was 260 nm all the determinations were performed twice and the average values of two analyses were reported 3 result and discussion 3 1 degradation study of bps by spc o3 system combined application of spc and o3 spc o3 can result in the formation of reactive radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and carbonate radicals co3 which can attack pollutant molecules and degrade them into less harmful compounds 59 the degradation of bps by sps o3 is attributed to several possible reactions between both chemicals as well as the fact that spc can induce alkaline conditions in the solution the changes made in the initial ph of solution as a result of the addition of different concentrations of spc are shown in fig 1 the alkaline condition can be beneficial for the decomposition of o3 and generation of reactive oh which can happen through three following paths initiated by hydroxyl ions eqs 3 11 29 path 1 3 o3 oh ho2 o2 4 ho2 h o2 5 o3 o2 o3 o2 6 o3 h2o oh oh o2 path 2 7 o3 oh ho2 o2 8 o3 ho2 oh o2 o2 followed by eq 5 and eq 6 path 3 9 o3 oh ho2 o2 10 o3 ho2 o3 ho2 11 ho2 oh o2 h2o followed by eq 5 and eq 6 in addition h2o2 originated from spc can accelerate the decomposition of o3 and consequently the generation of oh according to the eqs 12 and 13 60 12 2na2co3 3h2o2 2na2co3 3h2o2 13 o3 h2o2 2 oh 3o2 furthermore the induced alkaline condition shifts eq 14 towards the production of more ho2 which can lead to the production of more oh according to eq 8 and eq 10 42 14 h2o2 ho2 h carbonate ions can be regarded as a scavenger for reactive oh according eq 15 however generated co3 can selectively oxidize electron rich compounds like bps and contribute to the degradation of the pollutant 15 co3 2 oh co3 oh singlet oxygen 1o2 is a relatively strong oxidant which can be produced through the reaction of oh or ho2 with o2 according to eq 16 and eq 17 62 63 therefore it can also have an effect on the degradation of pollutants using o3 based processes 16 o2 oh 1o2 oh 17 o2 ho2 h 1o2 h2o2 although spc acts as a base increasing the ph of water h2o2 has acidic property decreasing the ph of solution 64 since alkaline ph is the desired condition in o3 based processes the adjustment of ph in h2o2 o3 requires higher cost compared to spc o3 3 1 1 comparison of bps degradation effectiveness by spc o3 and spc h2o2 in order to determine the superiority of spc over h2o2 for the degradation of bps by o3 exclusively by increasing ph experiments were performed using sole o3 spc o3 and h2o2 o3 at a constant ph of 11 adjusted by naoh an o3 flow rate of 0 019 mol h 1 a spc concentration of 1 mol l 1 or a h2o2 concentration of 1 5 mol l 1 the degradation effectiveness and kinetic results are illustrated in fig 2 based on the outcomes spc o3 resulted in a maximum degradation effectiveness of 99 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0755 min 1 while sole o3 led to a degradation effectiveness of 92 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0478 min 1 and h2o2 o3 caused a degradation effectiveness of 81 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0323 min 1 thus it is obvious that the spc o3 is the best solution even despite its positive effect on increasing ph among these three aops for the degradation of bps in aqueous medium in h2o2 o3 the addition of h2o2 all in once to the solution can increase the degradation effectiveness at the beginning of the experiment but after a while its scavenging effect can lead to a reduction in the concentration of available oh required for the degradation of the pollutant while in spc o3 the slow release of h2o2 from spc keeps a sustained supply of h2o2 in the solution 65 the enhancement in the degradation effectiveness made as a result of the presence of spc can be related to the mild release of h2o2 which can suppress its scavenging effect and it can react with o3 and produce reactive oh furthermore pc can virtually act as a buffer and prevent from a considerable reduction in the ph of solutions throughout the experiment 64 the changes in the ph of solution during the experiments are demonstrated in fig 3 as it is observed the decrease in the solution ph in spc o3 is smoother than sole o3 the generation of co3 might be another reason for the promotion of the degradation of bps using spc o3 3 1 2 identification of radical species several species such as hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and carbonate radical co3 could take part in the degradation of bps in spc o3 system radical quenchers are capable to react with a variety of oxidative species but their selectivity is towards a particular radical radical quenching experiments were performed to identify the reactive species which participated in the degradation of this pollutant at a ph of 9 and a rox m o l e s p c o z o n e m o l e b p s of 5 02 the scavengers were used in a high mole ratio of 30 1 s c a v e n g e r s p c 30 to ensure the complete scavenging of radicals the degradation effectiveness and kinetic results are demonstrated in fig 4 methanol is known as a scavenger for oh reacting with it at a second order reaction rate constant of 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and slowly reacts with other radicals 27 since oh usually involves in the degradation of organic compounds using o3 based processes methanol was employed to study the involvement of this radical in the degradation of bps carbonate anion can react with ho and produce co3 according to eq 15 at a second order reaction rate constant of 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 44 therefore phenol was utilized to evaluate the participation of co3 phenol can be regarded as a quencher for both ho and co3 as it reacts with these radicals at high second order reaction rate constants of 6 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 50 66 67 therefore a comparison between the results achieved through the presence of methanol and phenol can show the contribution of co3 para benzoquinone pbq can be used as a quenching agent for o2 since it reacts rapidly with this radical at a high second order reaction rate constants of 0 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 27 68 dabco can scavenge oh and 1o2 at second order reaction rate constant values of 1 25 109 m 1 s 1 and 3 1 108 m 1 s 1 respectively hence the difference between the degradation effectiveness achieved in the presence of methanol and dabco can prove the role of 1o2 in the degradation of bps using spc o3 69 according to the results methanol decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant of the process from 97 to 0 0632 min 1 to 75 and 0 0255 min 1 respectively proving the generation and moderate contribution of oh in the degradation of bps using spc o3 the presence of phenol in the solution decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 28 and 0 005 min 1 respectively the noticeable difference in the degradation efficiencies between methanol and phenol reveals the significant role of co3 as it can selectively oxidize electron rich substances such as bps as it is demonstrated the addition of p bq to the solution caused a drop in the degradation effectiveness to 32 demonstrating the significance of superoxide radical o2 in the degradation of the pollutant the presence of dabco in the solution decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 48 and 0 102 min 1 respectively the difference between the degradation effectiveness of bps in the presence of methanol and dabco can prove the involvement of singlet oxygen 1o2 in the degradation of bps it should be considered that although this scavenging test can be performed to prove the generation of radicals and their participation in the degradation of pollutants it cannot be employed for investigating the exact quantification of contribution of reactive species as it can be overlaid with this fact that scavenging some radicals prohibits the formation of some other radicals 67 3 2 effect of spc concentration a variety of factors can influence the degradation effectiveness of pollutants using aops and the concentration of oxidants is one of those key factors to investigate the effect of this parameter the degradation of bps was performed using different concentrations of spc at a constant o3 flow rate of 0 019 mol h 1 since alkaline ph induced by spc is one of advantages in spc o3 ph was not adjusted in these experiments the degradation effectiveness and kinetics of these experiments are demonstrated in fig 5 as it is observed in fig 5 the combination of o3 with spc enhanced the degradation effectiveness of the pollutant exhibiting the synergistic effect of them based on the results sole o3 led to a degradation effectiveness of 61 at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0174 min 1 in 60 min reaction time no degradation was observed using sole spc throughout the experiment an increase in the concentration of spc till an optimum amount of 1 mol l 1 increased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 97 and 0 0669 min 1 respectively and beyond this value they remained almost constant and then underwent a slight decrease the synergetic coefficient sc of combination of o3 and spc was 3 84 which was calculated according to eq 18 18 s c k o 3 s p c k o 3 k s p c since sc higher than 1 generally exhibits the synergy between oxidants a sc of 3 84 indicates a noticeable synergistic effect of combined application of o3 and spc 60 the obtained results are consistent with the outcomes reported by yu et al 43 who investigated the effect of the concentration of spc on the degradation of dichlorvos and indicated that an increase in spc up to an optimum value enhanced the degradation of the pollutant and further increase had an inhabitation effect the enhanced degradation effectiveness through an increase in spc concertation can be attributed to the enhanced generation of reactive species through eqs 3 11 as a result of induced alkaline ph intensified generation of oh through eqs 12 and 13 due to the higher concentration of available h2o2 and enhanced generation of selective carbonate radicals according to eq 15 the decrease observed beyond the optimum value of spc is probably caused by the excess amount of spc that forms excessive h2o2 which is a scavenger for oh and can consume it according to eq 19 19 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o therefore the available oh responsible for the oxidation of the pollutant decreased and caused a drop in the first order degradation rate constant 3 3 effect of o3 concentration the concentration of o3 is another factor impacting the degradation of the pollutant it is important to assess the optimum value of this oxidant especially in order to decrease the cost of the decontamination in o3 based process hence the degradation effectiveness of bpc was investigated under 3 different flow rates of o3 at a constant spc concentration of 1 mol l 1 and a constant ph of 11 in 60 min the degradation effectiveness and kinetic results are demonstrated in fig 6 analysis of results presented on fig 6 confirms that along with an increase in the flow rate of o3 continuously increased the degradation effectiveness of the pollutant the utilization of o3 with flow rates of 0 009 mol h 1 0 015 mol h 1 and 0 019 mol h 1 led to degradation effectiveness values of 16 63 and 99 k 0 0755 min 1 respectively this trend was expected and is in agreement with the data reported by guo et al 60 who studied the influence of concentration of o3 on the degradation of antibiotic sulfamethoxazole using the same aop obviously an increase in o3 concentration can enhance its decomposition and the reaction between o3 and h2o2 and as a result intensify the formation of oh and the degradation of pollutants 70 3 4 effect of ph the ph of solutions plays an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants using o3 based processes since it influences the paths of oxidation of pollutants affecting the effectiveness of decontamination processes 60 in order to study the influence of ph on the degradation of bps the experiments were performed using 4 different ph values of 5 7 9 and 11 at a constant rox of 5 02 due to the fact that o3 is not very effective in acidic conditions lower ph conditions were not studied the degradation effectiveness and kinetic outcomes are illustrated in fig 7 it can be seen that an increase in ph enhanced the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant and the pollutants were almost completely degraded 99 with a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0755 min 1 at a ph value of 11 the degradation effectiveness values of bps systematically decreased from 97 for ph 9 59 and 50 for ph 7 and 5 respectively the results to some extent can be in accordance to the study performed by chen and wang 71 who studied the effect of ph on the degradation of ofloxacin and indicated the agreement of their results with this original view that the degradation of organic compounds using peroxone o3 h2o2 is accelerated at alkaline condition this ascending trend can be attributed to the fact that the decomposition of o3 and consequent generation of oh can be facilitated in alkaline condition in which oh is utilized as an initiator for the formation of oh in this system in fact an increase in ph can shift the degradation pathway from direct oxidation by o3 to indirect oxidation performed by reactive radicals leading to an enhancement in degradation effectiveness furthermore in alkaline condition more ho2 can be generated according to eq 14 resulting in the formation of more oh and as a result the intensification of the degradation 40 it can be again an indication proving that the presence of spc as an agent increasing the ph of solution due to hydrolysis of co3 2 according to fig 1 can result in an enhancement in the degradation of bps by ozonation regardless of other positive effects of spc on the degradation of this pollutant in addition spc is less stable in alkaline condition and can be decomposed faster contributing to the degradation of pollutants 72 3 5 effect of inorganic anions natural water contains a variety of dissolved compounds such as inorganic anions and other organic substances as the content of water matrix can extremely influence the effectiveness of employed treatment methods it is crucial to investigate the impact of common anions existing in natural water on the degradation of pollutants for this aim experiments were done at the presence of nacl na2so4 na2co3 and nano3 at a ratio of 100 a n i o n b p s 100 and a rox of 5 02 in 60 min the kinetic results of this investigation are demonstrated in fig 8 according to the results the degradation effectiveness of the pollutant was almost constant at the presence of low concentration of nacl na2so4 and nano3 however they negligibly decreased the first order degradation rate constant therefore it can be concluded that the presence of low concentration of these three anions did not affect significantly the degradation of bps using spc o3 nevertheless the promotion effect of the presence of na2co3 was obvious the addition of na2co3 to the solution led to an increase in the degradation effectiveness of bps and the complete degradation of this pollutant happened in 50 min at a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0985 min 1 na2co3 does not directly react with o3 but it reacts with oh produced by the decomposition of o3 and generates co3 73 the effect of co3 2 on oh based processes depends on the types of pollutants molecules 74 the generated co3 can make a contribution to the degradation of organic pollutants and mainly react with electron rich compounds like phenol and compounds containing s and n with a first order degradation rate constant in a range from 105 to 109 m 1 s 1 27 75 hence in spite of the lower oxidation potential of co3 it can indicate better performance in the degradation of electron rich compounds which can be the result of its longer life time and higher selectivity 76 78 furthermore the buffering capacity of co3 2 prevents a drastic decrease in the ph throughout the process 79 hence it can be another aspect of the positive effect of co3 2 on the degradation effectiveness of bps by spc o3 nacl na2so4 and nano3 were employed at a higher concentration a n i o n b p s 1000 to evaluate the performance of used oxidation system in high salinity conditions and the results are illustrated in fig 9 as it is observed at a higher concentration the effect of nacl was still weak however it slightly increased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 99 and 0 0744 min 1 nacl can have both inhabitation and promotion effects on the degradation of organic pollutants using aops 27 cl can consume oh and produce cl through a series of reactions and the produced cl can participate in the degradation of pollutants since it has a high oxidation potential of 2 4 v 43 it can also react with cl and generate cl2 while these reactions are more significant in acidic conditions 73 the presence of cl can inhibit the degradation of the electron poor compounds because of the consumption of oh nevertheless it can enhance the degradation of electron rich compounds since the generated cl2 can be more selective towards electron rich centers resulting in more focused oxidation on target contaminants 27 hence it can be a possible reason for the slight increase in the degradation of bps in the presence nacl at its high concentration na2so4 decreased first order degradation rate constant to 0 0471 min 1 so4 2 can consume oh and generate so4 which possesses a lower oxidation potential compared to oh 80 also here more selective system can be obtained hence the slight reduction in the degradation of bps caused by the addition of na2so4 can be due the scavenging effect of so4 2 leading to a decrease in the concentration of oh 27 the results show that the impact of high concentration of nano3 on the degradation of bps was much more significant than the effect of so4 2 and cl 1 the no3 anions decreased the degradation effectiveness and first order degradation rate constant to 24 and 0 0057 min 1 it follows from the fact that no3 is a quencher for reactive oh and reduces the amount of oh available for the oxidation of pollutants it reacts with oh to form no3 which has lower oxidation potential rather than oh based on the results this radical was unable to oxidize bps at an appropriate first order degradation rate constant causing a drastic decrease in the degradation effectiveness however it should be taken into account that the presence of both no3 and so4 2 can promote the degradation of some organic pollutants using aops 74 these results are positive in overall as so high concentration of nitrates are not common for industrial effluents nitrites at this concertation could be found only in case of some fertilizer related effluents or in effluents after nitrification process in second case it would be more practical to first perform denitrification stage biological conversion of nitrates to n2 and later apply aop stage for degradation of bps 4 conclusion degradation of bps was effectively performed using the combined process of spc o3 a degradation effectiveness of 99 k 0 0755 min 1 was obtained at optimum conditions ph 11 o3 flow rate 0 019 mol h 1 spc concentration 1 mol l 1 during 60 min while just 81 degradation effectiveness k 0 0323 min 1 was achieved by h2o2 o3 at the same conditions h2o2 concentration 1 5 mol l 1 the in situ induced alkaline conditions and generated carbonate radicals as a result of the presence spc led to a synergetic coefficient of 3 84 for spc o3 proving the efficacy of this hybrid process oh co3 o2 and 1o2 were the reactive species participating in degradation of bps verified by scavenger tests an increase in spc till an optimum value enhanced the degradation of bps and further increase caused a reduction in the degradation effectiveness nevertheless in investigated ranges increasing o3 flow rate and ph continuously increased the degradation effectiveness this aop system were revealed also to be very effective for high salinity conditions expert of nitrates which significantly inhibited the degradation of bpa so high concentration of nitrates is however uncommon and in such scenarios biological denitrification should be

extraction as well as other separation processes 41 42 because of the distinct properties dess were selected as green solvents for effective extraction of methyl violet the developed method is easy time saving and greener as compared to other methods the method was validated and applied for methyl violet extraction and analysis in aqueous medium 2 materials and methods 2 1 material and reagents analytical grade methyl violet tetrahydrofurane 99 and choline chloride 98 were obtained from daejung korea tetrahydrofuran thf of analytical grade was used directly without any purification or dilution hydrochloric acid 38 methanol and sodium hydroxide were purchased from sigma aldrich germany hydrochloric acid 0 1 m and ammonium hydroxide 0 1 m were prepared and used for ph adjustment 2 2 instrumentation uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1900i produced by shimadzu burladingen germany was used for absorbance measurements vortex f202a0175 velp scientifica pakistan was used for shaking additional instruments were ultrasonic bath with 30 khz ultrasonic frequency made by ik utsb lahore pakistan and ph meter orion star a329 thermo fisher usa water deionizer millipore merck germany was used for water purification 2 3 des preparation choline chloride chcl was used as a hydrogen bond acceptor hba while ethylene glycol phenol glucose malonic acid and decanoic acid were used as hydrogen bond donor hbd des 1 was obtained by mixing choline chloride with ethylene glycol a molar ratio 1 1 with a gentle stirring a clear solution was obtained des 2 was obtained by mixing choline chloride

the mixture was stirred with magnetic stirrer and heated at mild temperature 50 60 c for 30 min des 4 was obtained by mixing choline chloride and malonic acid with molar ratio 1 2 the mixture was heated at mild temperature 50 60 c until a clear liquid was obtained des 5 was obtained by simple mixing choline chloride and decanoic acid with a molar ratio 1 1 2 4 sample preparation and extraction procedure water samples were collected from mardan river almost 0 5 km from the away from rashakai industrial estate water samples were filtered with whatman filter paper pore size 90 mm and stored in plastic bottles for further laboratory experiments a 20 ml water sample was added to a falcon tube a 2 ml of methyl violet 500 μg l was added to the sample analyte concentration 45 45 μg l a 1 5 ml of des was added to sample followed by sonication for 2 min at room temperature a 0 6 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added to the mixture and the sample was mixed with vortex for 2 min the sample was centrifuged until a clear analyte rich deep eutectic solvent layer was obtained the separation of methyl violet was clearly visible with naked eyes a deep eutectic solvent layer was separated in a separate vial and diluted with methanol up to 3 ml the final sample was analyzed using uv visible spectrophotometer 2 5 validation assays and calculation formulas efficiency of deep eutectic solvent and optimization of parameters were studied as a function of re the recovery was calculated as follows 1 r e c q u a n t c e x p e c t 100 in this equation cquant is the methyl violet concentration experimentally determined in spiked sample and cexcept is the expected concentration calculated concentration according to the association of analytical communities aoac lod is the lowest concentration of analyte that can be detected with equitable precision while loq is the lowest concentration of analyte which can be quantitatively determined with suitable equitable precision 43 in this method lod and loq were calculated using the following equations 2 l o d 3 s d m 3 l o q 10 s d m in this equation sd is the residual standard deviation of linear curve and m is the slope 44 residual standard deviation was calculated using anova statistical analysis in excel the enrichment pre concentration factor is the number of times the analytical signal is enhanced relative to analyte signal without pre concentration 34 45 or in other words it is the ratio of concentration of analyte in extracted des layer and concentration in the starting sample the ef factor was calculated by using the following equation 4 e f c f c i in this equation cf is the final concentrations of analyte in deep eutectic solvent phase and ci is the initial concentration of analyte in the sample before extraction pre concentration the relative standard deviation rsd also sometimes called coefficient of variation cv iswidely used in analytical chemistry to express the precision and repeatability of an assay rsd was calculated using the following formula 5 r s d s d c m 100 where sd is the standard deviation and cm is the mean concentration value in real samples 2 6 analysis of uv vis absorption spectra methyl violet dye has lambda max value 590 nm as pure solution however there could be a possible shift in λ max due to some factors such as ph 46 or des presence 47 therefore λ max was determined for methyl violet in des extracted phase the absorbance was scanned from 400 nm to 750 nm a minor change in the lambda max was observed maximum absorbance was observed at 600 nm therefore this wavelength was selected as λ max the uv vis spectrum is given in fig s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of extraction and sample preparation parameters 3 1 1 selection of suitable extracting solvents deep eutectic solvents as a novel class of environmentally friendly solvents were studied as extractive media for pre concentration of target analyte because they were the least hazardous easy to make highly selective inexpensive and readily available 40 48 49 the extraction efficiency of the analyte is mainly affected by the composition of deep eutectic solvents and the nature of hba and hbd the deep eutectic solvents used for extraction should meet with few requirements such as high affinity for specific analytes liquid state at room temperature no interference in analytical signal different density comparing to matrix media for example to water high stability and low solubility in the matrix in this case in aqueous medium 16 34 35 40 in this study 5 different deep eutectic solvents s were prepared all the deep eutectic solvents were prepared with their eutectic ratio of hba and hbd a re was investigated for each deep eutectic solvent in acidic a neutral n and basic b medium maximum re obtained for each des is given in fig 1 maximum recovery 99 was observed for two deep eutectic solvents s i choline chloride and phenol 1 2 and ii choline chloride and decanoic acid 1 2 toxicity of phenol is questioned so deep eutectic solvents made of choline chloride and decanoic acid 1 2 was selected as suitable for further optimization 3 1 2 effect of ph value the ph value is an important parameter while performing extraction from aqueous medium the electrostatic interactions between chemical species can be enhanced or diminished depending on the ph of the aqueous solution as a result the ph has a direct impact on how much of the analyte is transferred to the des phase 35 37 in addition ph affects the extraction efficiency of dess 34 the effect of ph on the transfer of methyl violet from the aqueous phase to the des phase was studied for detail study of ph effect on the extraction efficiency of des a ph of the medium was adjusted from 2 to 10 using hydrochloric acid for acidic medium and sodium hydroxide for basic medium the ph of the sample was monitored using portable ph meter fig s3 shows results for ph optimization stage maximum re was observed in slightly acidic medium ph 6 ph 6 was selected as optimum ph 3 2 optimization of solvents choline chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt that can act as a phase transfer agent facilitating the transfer of the analyte from the aqueous phase to the des phase decanoic acid is a medium chain fatty acid with a alkane hydrophobic chain that can interact with the hydrophobic regions of the analyte molecule thus promoting its solubility in the organic phase choline chloride and decanoic acid 1 2 m ratio deep eutectic mixture provide a hydrophobic solvent having specific interactions also with polar analytes this results in a solvent with high solvating power for polar analytes like methyl violet while also being easily separated from the aqueous phase the possible interactions involved in choline chloride and decanoic acid based deep eutectic solvent and methyl violet are likely to be a combination of hydrogen bonding ion dipole and van der waals forces choline chloride can form hydrogen bonds with the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the methyl violet molecule while the decanoic acid can interact with the hydrophobic regions of the analyte the polar and non polar interactions can work together in synergy to facilitate the dissolution of the analyte in the deep eutectic solvent furthermore methyl violet is a cationic dye so it can interact with the anionic choline chloride counter ion through ion dipole interactions these interactions can help to solvate the dye and promote its transfer from the aqueous phase to the des phase phase ratio for des was optimized by changing the volume of des from 0 2 ml to 5 ml obtained results are presented on fig 2 maximum recovery was obtained for 1 5 ml des volume for 20 ml of sample tetrahydrofuran is an aprotic solvent which was used in this study to enhance phase separation 16 this aprotic solvent thf tend to interact readily with water than des after interaction with tetrahydrofuran molecules interaction between des and water decreases resulting in their self aggregation and separation haq et al suggested a plausible mechanism of dess self aggregation that involves π π overlap followed by hydrogen bonding between functional groups of des and other charge transfer interactions 16 37 50 volume of tetrahydrofuran was also optimized for 20 ml of sample with methyl violet concentration 45 45 μg l the volume of tetrahydrofuran was changed from 0 2 ml to 1 2 ml maximum recovery was achieved for addition of 0 8 ml this volume was selected as optimum volume for further optimization 3 3 optimization of sonication and centrifugation time sonication treatment induces micro circulation effect that significantly enhances the mass transfer between both phases 51 additionally sonication treatment has been reported to improve the solvents extractability of materials at low temperatures 52 53 this positive effect in respect to extraction based on des was also reported in previous study 16 sonication is an essential step in this des based extraction method time for sonication was optimized for maximum re time for sonication was changed from 0 2 min to 4 min with 2 min sonication time maximum recovery was achieved therefore 2 min time was selected as optimum time for sonication results for time optimization for sonication are given in fig 3 after sonication the mixture spontaneously started to separate to des phase and aqueous phase the phase separation process was enhanced by centrifugation 2 min 4000 rpm was found sufficient for complete phase separation 3 4 analytical performance of the developed method this new method was validated in terms of limit of detection limit of quantification linearity precision and re limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were 2 20 μg l and 7 34 μg l respectively relative standard deviation rsd was calculated as 1 35 based on residual standard deviation for standard curve while rsd for real sample was 2 35 3 67 n 3 for 20 30 μg l inter day precision rsd was 0 45 0 54 linearity of method was investigated in a concentration range 10 400 μg l enrichment factor was calculated as 20 fig 4 reveals results for calibration curve 3 5 effect of external ions this method is based on spectrophotometric determination which can be affected by interference from a complex matter des based extraction not only increases the sensitivity but also minimize the effect of possible interferences dess are considered as a highly selective extraction media however effect of external ions was still investigated to evaluate this possibility theselectivity was investigated under optimized conditions by evaluating interference effect for na ca2 al3 zn2 fe3 pb2 cu2 cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 ions table s1 illustrates results for interference study it was observed that the external ions are not affecting the interference in extraction or spectrophotometric determination final findings from this experiment reveal that this method is highly selective 3 6 application of the method contaminated water from industrial estate was selected to evaluate the validity and applicability of the method water samples were collected from mardan river approximately 0 5 km away from rashakai industrial estate a map for sample location is given in fig s1 water samples were filtered and stored in plastic bottles for laboratory experiments standard addition is the recommended method to evaluate the recovery for analysis of analyte in real samples therefore standard addition method was followed for this experiment the samples were spiked with 10 μg l 20 μg l and 30 μg l of the standard solution the results of this study are presented in table 1 the rsd was calculated for each sample with n 3 this part of the studies revealed that the recovery for real samples was between 98 6 and 100 07 in river water no mv was found however in contaminated river water where industrial effluents were included a 3 83 μg l of methyl violet was determined 3 7 comparison with existing methods the developed method has been compared with recently reported methods in literature for methyl violet dye determination extraction procedure instrumentation limit of detection relative standard deviation linearity range and sample applications were compared see table 2 estimated time was calculated for extraction procedure excluding the time for analysis and solution preparation this new method required least time 10 mints for extraction procedure zhang et al reported dispersive liquid liquid micro extraction method for methyl violet 24 the reported method is simple and rapid however the use of toxic and expensive chemicals 1 octyl 3 methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate c8mim pf6 is the major disadvantage xie et al developed method for methyl violet detection in fish using hplc vis 25 the method is effective at low concentration in biological samples disadvantage of the method is the longer time consumption for sample preparation 50 min furthermore 2 3 dichloro 5 6 dicyano 1 4 benzoquinone ddq poses modest toxicity concerns 54 hakami et al developed an uplc ms method for methyl violet analysis in environmental samples 26 a hydrogen peroxide is used in the method for modification of biomass the method involves advanced instrumentation uhplc mass spectrometry which is not frequently available in routine analysis labs furthermore this required a very long time for extraction procedure 90 min wei et al have reported a des based method in which the extraction time was 2 h 27 this method involves the synthesis of functionalized magnetic mof composites which is complicated and time consuming as compare to des synthesis furthermore the use of mof nanoparticles may cause toxicity for humans and environment 55 liang et al developed ionic liquid based microextraction method combined with functionalized mnps solid phase extraction for analysis of methly violet 28 the method is effective at low concentrations and required moderate time for extraction 20 min however the use of toxic chemical in this method is questionable secondly the use of nanoparticle mnps fe3o4 sio2 hpy ntf2 is making the extraction process more complicated currently described new method is based on green natural deep eutectic solvents having no negative impact on environment or human deep eutectic solvents are not only green but are very easy to prepare by simply mixing two components method required no heating and was performed at room temperature this method required least time for extraction 10 min among all the reported methods in literature furthermore the method required no complicated instrumentation 4 conclusions this work presents a des based method for extraction of methyl violet dye from aqueous matrix followed by spectrophotometric detection and quantification among tested dess the one made of choline chloride and decanoic acid 1 2 was selected as optimal green solvent for sample preparation it was concluded that choline chloride and decanoic acid based des can be successfully used for extraction of methyl violet dye from aqueous medium for its spectrophotometric analysis the re for this approach was 99 with linearity range 10 400 μg l the method is highly sensitive with limit of detection lod 2 20 μg l ppb level with relative standard deviation of 2 35 3 21 method was tested for real water samples no significant interference in respect to existing ions was observed the advantage of developed method relates to shortened extraction time and robustness as no heating or sophisticated instrumentation are required the use of green solvents is a big advantage of this method over the other methods reported in literature to the best of our knowledge this is a 1st ever reported des based direct method for the analysis of methyl violet dye the method can be used for methyl violet detection and quantification in contaminated water samples at μg l level

45 μg l the volume of tetrahydrofuran was changed from 0 2 ml to 1 2 ml maximum recovery was achieved for addition of 0 8 ml this volume was selected as optimum volume for further optimization 3 3 optimization of sonication and centrifugation time sonication treatment induces micro circulation effect that significantly enhances the mass transfer between both phases 51 additionally sonication treatment has been reported to improve the solvents extractability of materials at low temperatures 52 53 this positive effect in respect to extraction based on des was also reported in previous study 16 sonication is an essential step in this des based extraction method time for sonication was optimized for maximum re time for sonication was changed from 0 2 min to 4 min with 2 min sonication time maximum recovery was achieved therefore 2 min time was selected as optimum time for sonication results for time optimization for sonication are given in fig 3 after sonication the mixture spontaneously started to separate to des phase and aqueous phase the phase separation process was enhanced by centrifugation 2 min 4000 rpm was found sufficient for complete phase separation 3 4 analytical performance of the developed method this new method was validated in terms of limit of detection limit of quantification linearity precision and re limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were 2 20 μg l and 7 34 μg l respectively relative standard deviation rsd was calculated as 1 35 based on residual standard deviation for standard curve while rsd for real sample was 2 35 3 67 n 3 for 20 30 μg l inter day precision rsd was 0 45 0 54 linearity of method was investigated in a concentration range 10 400 μg l enrichment factor was calculated as 20 fig 4 reveals results for calibration curve 3 5 effect of external ions this method is based on spectrophotometric determination which can be affected by interference from a complex matter des based extraction not only increases the sensitivity but also minimize the effect of possible interferences dess are considered as a highly selective extraction media however effect of external ions was still investigated to evaluate this possibility theselectivity was investigated under optimized conditions by evaluating interference effect for na ca2 al3 zn2 fe3 pb2 cu2 cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 ions table s1 illustrates results for interference study it was observed that the external ions are not affecting the interference in extraction or spectrophotometric determination final findings from this experiment reveal that this method is highly selective 3 6 application of the method contaminated water from industrial estate was selected to evaluate the validity and applicability of the method water samples were collected from mardan river approximately 0 5 km away from rashakai industrial estate a map for sample location is given in fig s1 water samples were filtered and stored in plastic bottles for laboratory experiments standard addition is the recommended method to evaluate the recovery for analysis of analyte in real samples therefore standard addition method was followed for this experiment the samples were spiked with 10 μg l 20 μg l and 30 μg l of the standard solution the results of this study are presented in table 1 the rsd was calculated for each sample with n 3 this part of the studies revealed that the recovery for real samples was between 98 6 and 100 07 in river water no mv was found however in contaminated river water where industrial effluents were included a 3 83 μg l of methyl violet was determined 3 7 comparison with existing methods the developed method has been compared with recently reported methods in literature for methyl violet dye determination extraction procedure instrumentation limit of detection relative standard deviation linearity range and sample applications were compared see table 2 estimated time was calculated for extraction procedure excluding the time for analysis and solution preparation this new method required least time 10 mints for extraction procedure zhang et al reported dispersive liquid liquid micro extraction method for methyl violet 24 the reported method is simple and rapid however the use of toxic and expensive chemicals 1 octyl 3 methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate c8mim pf6 is the major disadvantage xie et al developed method for methyl violet detection in fish using hplc vis 25 the method is effective at low concentration in biological samples disadvantage of the method is the longer time consumption for sample preparation 50 min furthermore 2 3 dichloro 5 6 dicyano 1 4 benzoquinone ddq poses modest toxicity concerns 54 hakami et al developed an uplc ms method for methyl violet analysis in environmental samples 26 a hydrogen peroxide is used in the method for modification of biomass the method involves advanced instrumentation uhplc mass spectrometry which is not frequently available in routine analysis labs furthermore this required a very long time for extraction procedure 90 min wei et al have reported a des based method in which the extraction time was 2 h 27 this method involves the synthesis of functionalized magnetic mof composites which is complicated and time consuming as compare to des synthesis furthermore the use of mof nanoparticles may cause toxicity for humans and environment 55 liang et al developed ionic liquid based microextraction method combined with functionalized mnps solid phase extraction for analysis of methly violet 28 the method is effective at low concentrations and required moderate time for extraction 20 min however the use of toxic chemical in this method is questionable secondly the use of nanoparticle mnps fe3o4 sio2 hpy ntf2 is making the extraction process more complicated currently described new method is based on green natural deep eutectic solvents having no negative impact on environment or human deep eutectic solvents are not only green but are very easy to prepare by simply mixing two components method required no heating and was performed at room temperature this method required least time for extraction 10 min among all the reported methods in literature furthermore the method required no complicated instrumentation 4 conclusions this work presents a des based method for extraction of methyl violet dye from aqueous matrix followed by spectrophotometric detection and quantification among tested dess the one made of choline chloride and decanoic acid 1 2 was selected as optimal green solvent for sample preparation it was concluded that choline chloride and decanoic acid based des can be successfully used for extraction of methyl violet dye from aqueous medium for its spectrophotometric analysis the re for this approach was 99 with linearity range 10 400 μg l the method is highly sensitive with limit of detection lod 2 20 μg l ppb level with relative standard deviation of 2 35 3 21 method was tested for real water samples no significant interference in respect to existing ions was observed the advantage of developed method relates to shortened extraction time and robustness as no heating or sophisticated instrumentation are required the use of green solvents is a big advantage of this method over the other methods reported in literature to the best of our knowledge this is a 1st ever reported des based direct method for the analysis of methyl violet dye the method can be used for methyl violet detection and quantification in contaminated water samples at μg l level

8744,water quality in cooling towers of thermal power plants cttpp has a critical role in the operation and maintenance of cttpp and the need for an index which represents well the quality of water used in cttpp in this study municipal wastewater effluent mwe as a source of water for use in the cttpp was evaluated by determining the water quality index 22 mwe quality parameters were considered in terms of their potential effects on cooling towers the relative weight of the parameters is calculated by the analytical hierarchical process ahp the analysis of water classification was done by using the fuzzy inference system fis in the fuzzy logic approach the trapezoidal and triangular membership functions and the mamdani inference system were used and the final rules consist of 240 rules the center of gravity method is used for the defuzzification of the results the values obtained from the cooling tower effluent quality index cteqi based on the fis were generally more stable than the values from cteqi based on the traditional system the outcomes of this study established that the quality of effluent entering the cooling towers in a shahid moftteh power plant in the hamadan effluent sampling site is moderate to good condition annual fuzzy index 50 90 average annual traditional index 79 52 95 99 this research result reveals that cteqi can be counted as a general tool for evaluating the quality of effluent that use in the cttpp and can be used with confidence for this purpose keywords analytic hierarchy process wastewater fuzzy logic cooling tower power plant data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction thermal power plants are among the largest consumers of water in industrial processes in which cooling towers are the primary water consumers and account for about 60 70 of the total water consumption of thermal power plants 1 therefore the supply of water to cooling towers is one of the essential priorities in thermal power plants in addition to the amount of water required by cooling towers water quality is also essential concerns about the availability of freshwater have led to increased interest in using alternative sources to cooling tower water in recent years treated municipal wastewater mww as an alternative source toward thermal power plant s cooling water systems has increased mww can be used as compensatory water 2 7 for a cooling tower to work effectively its water quality must be controlled depending on the quality of the available water supply problems arise in cooling systems such as sedimentation corrosion and biological growth each of these or usually a combination of these leads to costly breakdowns reduced capacity increased water consumption increased cost of repairing and replacing expensive parts and acid cleaning operations which shortens the life of the cooling system bhatia 2003 8 9 sedimentation and corrosion in addition to physically clogging the pipes and equipment of the cooling tower also reduces heat transfer and increases energy consumption sibiya et al 10 13 microbially induced corrosion mic is a recurring problem in cooling towers mic leads to the formation of biological deposits on the surface of metals which reduces the temperature of the entire system and thus reduces the efficiency of the cooling system 14 r 15 microbial growth can cause erosion and corrosion of some alloys sediment gradually begins to interfere with the evacuation of pipes heat transfer and water pressure causing microbiological corrosion caused by acid or corrosive products 16 therefore microbial growth in industrial cooling water systems also leads to problems related to deposition damage to equipment through corrosion 17 the most common indices used to predict sedimentation and corrosion are the puckorius scaling index psi ryznar stability index rsi and langelier saturation index lsi however these indicators are only designed to predict calcium carbonate deposition 18 van niekerk 2011 a water quality index wqi is a means by which water quality information is consistently summarized for public reporting the traditional horton water index horton 1965 is considered the forerunner of modern water quality indicators wqis the horton index wqi ranges from 0 to 100 19 22 vicente et al 2011 23 25 in recent years many drinking water quality indicators are codified by numerous worldwide organizations such as weight arithmetic water quality index wawqi national sanitation foundation water quality index nfswqi canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccmewqi oregon water q owqi etc 26 therefore existing indicators are unlikely to adequately address environmental and experimental uncertainties 20 to cover such a shortcoming some new methods for developing water quality indicators based on artificial intelligence ai computational methods have been introduced among the methods of artificial intelligence fuzzy logic fl has been used in wqi development because of its capacity to reveal human ideas and expertise in the face of nonlinear and uncertain information according to studies fuzzy set theory can provide more flexibility in decision making for complex situations where uncertainties increase 19 27 29 water quality uncertainties can be reduced by using fuzzy membership functions with rates of 0 1 rather than the traditional scale of 0 100 in wqi it has been demonstrated that techniques like fuzzy zone systems artificial neural networks radial functions etc are useful for lessening computational load and raising prediction accuracy fuzzy logic was suggested as a tool for creating systems that are much more like human thinking than earlier analytical methods 19 21 30 thus human expertise performs an essential role in the modeling process kumara et al fuzzy logic which was created to represent complex systems under uncertain and imprecise settings connects the two fields of qualitative and quantitative modeling fuzzy logic is a successful approach for modeling nonlinear functions based on natural language and is conceptually simple to understand furthermore fuzzy logic uses an individual s knowledge and experience as information may not be considered by other methods systems that have been developed based on the fuzzy logic are proficient of dealing with complex environmental problems such as the effects of water quality indicators on the water quality where large numbers of indicators effect the result 25 consequently our investigation aimed to evaluate the reuse of treated municipal wastewater as a water source in thermal power plant and determine the quality index for treated municipal wastewater a case study of shahid moftteh thermal power plant in hamadan in iran compares the outputs of the wastewater quality index with those of the national sanitation foundation nsf water quality index wqi two methods were used for the assessment of the effluent quality index the first method is the classification of effluent specimens using the water quality index in which the related weight of the effluent quality parameter is calculated according to an analytical hierarchical process ahp the second approach involved the analysis of effluent classification using fis 2 materials and methods 2 1 parameters selection this section provides detailed information on why the parameters in the water quality index cteqi were selected effluent quality parameters such as physicochemical parameters minerals and heavy metals in the effluent were selected based on the existing literature that describes the side effects of these parameters on cooling towers table 1 it also includes parameters such as nitrite and nitrate and temperature that do not directly affect the cooling towers this is essential because although these additional parameters cannot directly affect the cooling towers their presence is vital to provide a more reliable view of the effluent s overall quality however when setting the rules these parameters were given less priority because they have no direct side effects table 1 summarizes the reasons for choosing the parameter along with the relevant sources 2 2 water quality index wqi water quality index wqi is measured by determining the weight wi to the parameters based on its relevant interest in the overall water quality the relative weight wi along with the standards for each parameter is presented in table 2 which reviews the data obtained from the various effluent quality parameters into a singular output amount in this study 22 effluent quality parameters have been used to calculate wqi to evaluate wqi a multi step computational method is required 31 in the first step weights are assigned to each parameter on a sliding scale of 9 to 1 based on their contribution to water quality from most important 9 to the least 1 32 33 then relative weight is calculated using the following eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i w i is the relative weight of the parameter w i is the parameter s weight table 2 the following step is to calculate the quality rating scale qi which is measured according to eq 2 2 q i c i s i 100 where s i is the standard value for each parameter which is reported in mg l except for ph which is dimensionless and the s i is maximum allowable limit for each parameter in mg l and c i is the calculated value of each parameter in each sample to calculate wqi first sub index sl i can be resolved for each parameter as shown in eq 3 3 s l i w i q i where sl i is the sub index of the parameter finally wqi is evaluated as follows wqi classifies water samples into the five categories shown in table 3 31 34 4 w q i s l i 2 3 fuzzy logic fuzzy logic was developed by zadeh 35 36 to describe the information to solve complex problems that have made it possible to use human knowledge and experience in modeling membership functions inference rules and defuzzification are three parts of fuzzy inference systems fis briefly described below fuzzification is used to express the observed actual data in linguistic phrases utilizing membership function as a suitable method for developing complex and ambiguous systems 19 kumara et al 37 individual input or variable in a fuzzy inference system possesses a range called the universe of discussion and each set in this space is represented with a linguistic term such as low medium and high if then rules define relationships between variables several methods have been developed to find the best crisp value including the mean of maxima method the center of gravity method cog the weighted average method and the max method the methods most widely used for defuzzification are the mean of maxima and cog the former computes the mean of the maxima of the output membership functions while the latter points out the geometrical center of the fuzzy variable 27 36 37 in this research the cog method is used to get adequately explicit and numerical values 2 3 1 membership function fuzzy sets are defined as membership functions in fuzzy systems a function assigns a domain of interest to the distance 0 1 membership functions are defined to link each point in the universe of discourse to a membership grade between 0 and 1 let the elements of universe of discourse x be x then the fuzzy set a x is denoted by the following nomenclature 5 a x μ a x x x 0 μ a x 1 where μ a x is a membership grade between 0 and 1 in linguistic terms x is a member of a and also is associated with μ a x as illustrates in fig 1 a triangular fuzzy number a is identified with a triplet a1 a2 a3 38 zimmermann 2001 applying a triangular fuzzy number due to its simplicity in comparison with trapezoid fuzzy number is intuitively easy for decision makers to utilize furthermore because of the subjective conceptual and vigorous nature of the available information modeling according to triangular fuzzy numbers is an efficient approach for organizing the decision making problems kahraman 2008 39 membership functions have different shapes such as triangular trapezoidal and gaussian different methods have been used to determine membership functions such as using the expert s knowledge fuzzy clustering neural networks and genetic algorithm 40 42 2 3 2 inference rules a fuzzy rule contains mathematical if then rules which in the fuzzy inference system are based on expert judgments expressed in linguistic terms that represent the relationship between input and output a standard rule is done as if then and consists of two parts the first part with if and the next part with then where a b and c are linguistic values determined with fuzzy sets in which the universe of discussion a b and c are defined respectively 23 24 48 50 52 if a is a then c is c if b is b then c is c fuzzy set operators are applied to determine the relationship between factors in a fuzzy set fuzzy set operators create a new group during the process which varies depending on the type of operator used fuzzy operators are not or and sharing of fuzzy based systems is widely used as shown in the following equations 6 a n d μ a b μ a μ b min μ a μ b kind mentioned above of fuzzy set and fuzzy function creates the subscription of sets a and b 7 o r μ a u b μ a u μ b max μ a μ b x this or action produces the union of these two sets 8 n o t μ ā 1 μ a the negative not operator creates the complete set of sets below operators can get various modes but the min max and not functions are the most basic forms and are usually enough 36 ross 2004 ross 2013 43 2 3 3 defuzzification in processing fis defuzzification is the latest step during defuzzification the outcomes received in the form of fuzzy sets are converted into numbers a fuzzy based system produces the final fuzzy variable as the output consequently the fuzzy variable is converted to a definite and numerical value through defuzzification multiple methods have been developed to obtain the proper explicit value including the maximum the mean method and the center of gravity cog methods the former calculates the average of the maximum output membership functions while the latter represents the geometric center of the fuzzy variable complete knowledge about the cog method can be seen in section 2 4 19 20 36 43 44 ross 2004 2 4 developing fuzzy logic for determining cooling tower effluent quality index based on fuzzy inference system cteqif taking into account the priority of different parameters for effluent quality of municipal wastewater treatment discussed in section 2 3 twenty two parameters were chosen to develop the effluent quality index these parameters are calcium ca biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds temperature ph hardness th alkalinity alk heavy metals such as iron fe manganese mn copper cu aluminum al and finally minerals such as chloride cl nitrite no2 nitrate no sodium na potassium k silica so2 ammonia nh3 sulfate so4 phosphate po4 five fuzzy sets were defined in expressions of membership functions for each input index each membership function connects the elements in the universe of discussion to the range 0 1 membership functions used in this research are two types of membership functions according to proficient information assigned for each parameter with trapezoidal and triangular shapes for the same twenty two parameters each set of the universe of discussion x is introduced with a linguistic term in this study very low vl low l medium m high h and very high vh fuzzy sets have been used as linguistic terms table 4 exhibits the data applied to create fuzzy sets according to the next equations 9 t r i a n g u l a f x a b c 0 x a o r c x a x a b a x b c x c b b x c 10 t r a p e z o i d a l f x a b c d 0 x a o r c x a x a b a x b 1 b x c c x c b b x c performance parameters of membership functions where a b c and d exist and x represents each point on the x axis according to the selected ranges for each variable it should be noted that the standard value is set as the cut off point which means that the values below the standard value for each parameter are categorized into two classes very low and low values above the standard value were grouped into three categories medium high and very high in this study the parameters were normalized and grouped into four stages due to the range of output variables the most popular scoring system for evaluating water quality values are in the 0 100 range where values approaching 100 indicate higher water quality the developed algorithm for the water quality index based on fuzzy logic is manifested in fig 2 these rules were created based on expert experience and it was assumed that the human mind could not manage this kind of high data therefore to reduce the possible uncertainty in the first stage 22 parameters were treated by inference systems and then arranged and normalized between 0 and 100 in 11 groups in the second stage ten groups were processed by new inference systems and normalized between 0 and 100 in five groups the remaining five groups were processed by two new inference systems which in turn were processed by the last inference system and ultimately the last two groups were processed by the new inference system to create the cooling tower water quality index based on the fuzzy inference system cteqif the significant benefit of the particular type of classification used in creating the list is that it simplifies specialists work in making rules this is mainly because considering and manipulating more than two parameters at the same time may confuse the expert and cause errors and lead to a decrease in the confidence of the index 36 40 45 it is noteworthy that the rules obtained for cteqif were based on the knowledge and experience of several experts in the field of cooling towers here is a personal expert who specializes in both fuzzy fields and effluent quality in the present study the expertise of 5 experts with the mentioned specifications has been used to formulate rules to gain knowledge specialists the structure of the index is explained to them in full detail they were asked to complete each rule and form a separate set of rules which resulted in 5 different sets of rules after that this set of rules was discussed in the meetings and the agreement of all experts on each rule was considered as the final rule and formed the final greed set of rules however a sensitivity analysis was presented to show the effects of these changes on the regulation of rule sets by various experts and to be aware of these changes effect on the index outputs which shows the effects of the percentage change on the rule in each step the final index is set on the outputs unlike conventional methods which use tables curves and weighting factors to normalize parameters this process uses inference systems to normalize parameters in this investigation the mamdani inference system was employed facilitating the mastery of experts knowledge ross 2004 besides the fuzzy inference system makes it feasible to mimic the knowledge of experts like human behavior and thought the number and quality of rules restrict the performance and robustness of the system two hundred forty rules based on expert knowledge were used for calculation cteqif through fuzzy inference systems using the twenty two parameters mentioned the rules cover various possible conditions in water quality here are some examples of rules image 1 in this study the center of gravity cog method was employed to defuzzification the outputs it is believed that this method is the most conventional and physically useable in the fuzzy method defuzzification values were obtained using eq 11 36 ross 2004 39 40 46 11 z μ z z d z μ z d z where z is the defuzzified value denotes an algebraic integration μ z is membership function of z and z is the centroid of each symmetric membership function ross 2004 finally fig 3 shows the relationships between two parameters in the index e g cod and bod plus their 40 impact above the final index number all calculations were performed using the fuzzy logic toolbox in version b of the 2016 matlab r ross 2004 2 5 case study the shahid mofateh hamadan combined cycle power plant is located in central iran this is one of the thermal power plants of iran with a production capacity of 1000 mw which includes four steam units of 250 mw on a land area of 270 ha and its cooling towers are of wet type wet cooling towers are those buildings where the water that was heated by industrial or power generation processes is cooled again in this power plant the treated wastewater of hamadan city is used for the water consumption of cooling towers twenty two effluent parameters as mentioned in section 2 4 for developing cooling tower effluent quality index cteqi and other select items were selected in this study each month selected parameters are sampled according to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater awwa 1995 samples were taken from the effluent of the hamadan wastewater treatment plant 3 result and discussion 3 1 analysis cteqit and lsi rsi and psi the cooling tower effluent quality index based on the traditional system cteqit is calculated using the gravimetric index method the effluent quality index can be employed effectively in the implementation of effluent quality improvement programs this is one of the general indicators that has been accepted as a step by step indication of the combined effect on the overall quality of the exact quality numbers of the effluent 31 a higher water quality index shows poor water quality and a lower value indicates better water quality maximum weight seven is assigned to parameters such as total hardness calcium and alkalinity due to its significant influence in evaluating water quality weight 6 is assigned to ph tds and tss silica sulfate and phosphate are assigned a weight of 5 weight 4 is reserved for cod bod chloride and ammonia and weight 3 is for heavy metals iron manganese aluminum and copper with a minimum weight of 2 for nitrite nitrate sodium and potassium in fig 4 the monthly average of the values of the traditional index cteqit in the sampling station during the one year 2020 2019 of the study by the method of hierarchical analysis 79 52 95 99 is shown the status of effluent quality is low for one year according to the classification table 2 which indicates the excellent effluent conditions for the cooling towers of the power plant in may due to alkalinity chloride phosphate nitrite copper less sodium and potassium and in march due to less sulfate nitrate sodium and potassium it has better quality than other months of the year according to the results of the analysis in the sampling and analysis of variance anova station the quality of the effluent has not changed significantly and no significant difference has been observed between seasonal and monthly samples p 0 05 this is due to the proper control of the municipal wastewater treatment plant s parameters to enhance the effluent s quality for the consumption of cooling towers the potential for sediment formation and corrosion depends on ph calcium alkalinity soluble salt concentration temperature chloride and sulfate according to the langelier and puckorius index fig 5 a and c the effluent entering the cooling towers have a slight tendency to sediment the reason for sedimentation is higher than the standard due to calcium according to the ryznar index fig 5b the effluent entering the cooling towers has little corrosion except in august when the effluent quality was in equilibrium 18 van niekerk 2011 therefore out of the three indicators studied the incoming effluent to the power plant has a slight tendency to sediment which is desirable and appropriate 3 2 analysis cteqif the results of sampling 22 quality parameters of effluent for 1year fig 6 are shown as the monthly average of the fuzzy index as shown on that the figure the quality of the effluent entering the power plant for the cooling towers of monthly values cteqif in the one year period is moderate to good range 50 90 out of a maximum of 100 based on qualitative data the values mentioned above are lower than the standard due to the presence of calcium ammonia and phosphate in general the fuzzy inference system rules study the connections between multiple parameters based on expert recommendations accordingly the concluding outcome is not influenced by alterations in a parameter 46 47 this is why in fuzzy logic the data are closer to each other than to the definitive index hence that can conclude that the fis model could appropriately describe the detected situation according to the results of the analysis in the sampling and analysis of variance anova station the quality of effluent in this index has not changed significantly and no significant difference has been observed between seasonal and monthly samples p 0 05 for comparison in fig 7 the mean values for the definite and fuzzy index cteqi for the same period are shown the values obtained from the traditional index cteqit are generally less stable than the fuzzy index cteqif which indicates that the fuzzy index cteqif presented by the present study is more accurate than the traditional index cteqit which is quite in line with prospects the contrast between the fuzzy and traditional quality indices is due to their different weighting methods since cteqit does not include the interaction of the parameters with each other it makes the value of this index less stable almost constant values cteqif can match the specificity of the type of arrangement employed in the fuzzy method and its remarkable capacity to overwhelm uncertainties and insensitivity nearby effluent quality issues 45 since the endings of these two indicators were not significantly different but from the advantages of the current index compared to the traditional index you can experience from expert knowledge and through inference rules 40 the results of different investigations which have evaluated water quality using fuzzy based indicators for example the water quality index based on the fuzzy logic developed by gharibi et al and akampo et al 36 48 it is noteworthy that they produced results more accurately than wqi other investigations have reported similar findings 36 47 48 all of those pieces of knowledge show fuzzy indicators for water quality the criteria and standard levels used are considerably distinct from those applied in this stage of research so this study is only based on the fuzzy approach and is comparable to conventional procedures the substantive conclusions of this investigation should not be compared 3 3 validation of cteqif the cteqif has been extended to determine whether the effluent is of good quality for cooling towers due to the physicochemical properties of effluent quality and the presence of minerals and heavy metals in the effluent cteqif based on the fuzzy region one of the most common and efficient computational methods is artificial intelligence ai the best way to approve the suggested index is to justify the listed parameters and address the methodology s strength as discussed in section 2 3 extraordinary evidence indicates that all parameters in cteqif affect water quality and besides have severe and adverse effects on the performance of cooling towers this index is very accurate to show water quality 36 40 fuzzy logic is frequently based on words rather than equations therefore it can overcome the analysis of water quality issues and uncertainties 48 another advantage of the step by step method used for cteqi based on fuzzy logic is that no weighting factor is assigned to it and all parameters are considered with the same weight weight 1 while in the hierarchical analysis index the weight factor is assigned due to this study s frequency only 240 complex rules were applied in this index body a much smaller number than other education in the study 47 although only nine parameters are included more than 3000 rules are employed in this index significantly increasing the system s complexity as explained in section 2 4 the information and experience of 10 experts were employed to formulate the last set of rules for this goal each expert formulated a separate rule based on his understanding and experience and the final set of rules was formed by agreement between various experts for example if in a rule set by an expert the total number of 50 rules were different from the agreed final rules the percentage change in the ruleset was 10 to perform a sensitivity analysis to measure the robustness of the system cteqif by assessing the impact of changes in the regulated rule on the index outputs the final agreed set of rules was considered as the basis and deviation or change from this set of rules by the title of change percentage or change which was measured in the set of rules for each step it is noteworthy that these changes are due to the different rules developed by different experts in each set developed by an expert several different rules were calculated from the set of basic rules as the percentage of changes in the rules as mentioned in section 2 4 since the weighting factor included in the rules changes the rules performing a sensitivity analysis assesses changing the weighting factor and rules on the index outputs the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 8 a d the change in the rules at different stages of the phase is presented in fig 7 as shown in fig 8a b c d changes in the rules at different fuzzy stages of the index do not significantly affect the final value of feqi for example a 50 change in the rules governing the third stage changed the feqi values to only 5 and the 80 change in the rules in the last stage changed the index returns by almost 20 4 conclusion the key purpose of this paper is to provide a fuzzy index to evaluate the quality of inlet effluent to the cooling towers of thermal power plants in addition the present study focuses on accepted parameters for comparing fuzzy wqis developed with traditional wqis results of quality evaluation of 22 parameters all of which are essential for assessment of wastewater quality and all 22 parameters need to wqis develop showed that the quality of the incoming effluent is good for the power plant and has little tendency to scale furthermore the values of various parameters show high effluent quality according to the results of the present study cteqi is based on fuzzy logic and hierarchical analysis the proposed index from

8744,water quality in cooling towers of thermal power plants cttpp has a critical role in the operation and maintenance of cttpp and the need for an index which represents well the quality of water used in cttpp in this study municipal wastewater effluent mwe as a source of water for use in the cttpp was evaluated by determining the water quality index 22 mwe quality parameters were considered in terms of their potential effects on cooling towers the relative weight of the parameters is calculated by the analytical hierarchical process ahp the analysis of water classification was done by using the fuzzy inference system fis in the fuzzy logic approach the trapezoidal and triangular membership functions and the mamdani inference system were used and the final rules consist of 240 rules the center of gravity method is used for the defuzzification of the results the values obtained from the cooling tower effluent quality index cteqi based on the fis were generally more stable than the values from cteqi based on the traditional system the outcomes of this study established that the quality of effluent entering the cooling towers in a shahid moftteh power plant in the hamadan effluent sampling site is moderate to good condition annual fuzzy index 50 90 average annual traditional index 79 52 95 99 this research result reveals that cteqi can be counted as a general tool for evaluating the quality of effluent that use in the cttpp and can be used with confidence for this purpose keywords analytic hierarchy process wastewater fuzzy logic cooling tower power plant data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction thermal power plants are among the largest consumers of water in industrial processes in which cooling towers are the primary water consumers and account for about 60 70 of the total water consumption of thermal power plants 1 therefore the supply of water to cooling towers is one of the essential priorities in thermal power plants in addition to the amount of water required by cooling towers water quality is also essential concerns about the availability of freshwater have led to increased interest in using alternative sources to cooling tower water in recent years treated municipal wastewater mww as an alternative source toward thermal power plant s cooling water systems has increased mww can be used as compensatory water 2 7 for a cooling tower to work effectively its water quality must be controlled depending on the quality of the available water supply problems arise in cooling systems such as sedimentation corrosion and biological growth each of these or usually a combination of these leads to costly breakdowns reduced capacity increased water consumption increased cost of repairing and replacing expensive parts and acid cleaning operations which shortens the life of the cooling system bhatia 2003 8 9 sedimentation and corrosion in addition to physically clogging the pipes and equipment of the cooling tower also reduces heat transfer and increases energy consumption sibiya et al 10 13 microbially induced corrosion mic is a recurring problem in cooling towers mic leads to the formation of biological deposits on the surface of metals which reduces the temperature of the entire system and thus reduces the efficiency of the cooling system 14 r 15 microbial growth can cause erosion and corrosion of some alloys sediment gradually begins to interfere with the evacuation of pipes heat transfer and water pressure causing microbiological corrosion caused by acid or corrosive products 16 therefore microbial growth in industrial cooling water systems also leads to problems related to deposition damage to equipment through corrosion 17 the most common indices used to predict sedimentation and corrosion are the puckorius scaling index psi ryznar stability index rsi and langelier saturation index lsi however these indicators are only designed to predict calcium carbonate deposition 18 van niekerk 2011 a water quality index wqi is a means by which water quality information is consistently summarized for public reporting the traditional horton water index horton 1965 is considered the forerunner of modern water quality indicators wqis the horton index wqi ranges from 0 to 100 19 22 vicente et al 2011 23 25 in recent years many drinking water quality indicators are codified by numerous worldwide organizations such as weight arithmetic water quality index wawqi national sanitation foundation water quality index nfswqi canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccmewqi oregon water q owqi etc 26 therefore existing indicators are unlikely to adequately address environmental and experimental uncertainties 20 to cover such a shortcoming some new methods for developing water quality indicators based on artificial intelligence ai computational methods have been introduced among the methods of artificial intelligence fuzzy logic fl has been used in wqi development because of its capacity to reveal human ideas and expertise in the face of nonlinear and uncertain information according to studies fuzzy set theory can provide more flexibility in decision making for complex situations where uncertainties increase 19 27 29 water quality uncertainties can be reduced by using fuzzy membership functions with rates of 0 1 rather than the traditional scale of 0 100 in wqi it has been demonstrated that techniques like fuzzy zone systems artificial neural networks radial functions etc are useful for lessening computational load and raising prediction accuracy fuzzy logic was suggested as a tool for creating systems that are much more like human thinking than earlier analytical methods 19 21 30 thus human expertise performs an essential role in the modeling process kumara et al fuzzy logic which was created to represent complex systems under uncertain and imprecise settings connects the two fields of qualitative and quantitative modeling fuzzy logic is a successful approach for modeling nonlinear functions based on natural language and is conceptually simple to understand furthermore fuzzy logic uses an individual s knowledge and experience as information may not be considered by other methods systems that have been developed based on the fuzzy logic are proficient of dealing with complex environmental problems such as the effects of water quality indicators on the water quality where large numbers of indicators effect the result 25 consequently our investigation aimed to evaluate the reuse of treated municipal wastewater as a water source in thermal power plant and determine the quality index for treated municipal wastewater a case study of shahid moftteh thermal power plant in hamadan in iran compares the outputs of the wastewater quality index with those of the national sanitation foundation nsf water quality index wqi two methods were used for the assessment of the effluent quality index the first method is the classification of effluent specimens using the water quality index in which the related weight of the effluent quality parameter is calculated according to an analytical hierarchical process ahp the second approach involved the analysis of effluent classification using fis 2 materials and methods 2 1 parameters selection this section provides detailed information on why the parameters in the water quality index cteqi were selected effluent quality parameters such as physicochemical parameters minerals and heavy metals in the effluent were selected based on the existing literature that describes the side effects of these parameters on cooling towers table 1 it also includes parameters such as nitrite and nitrate and temperature that do not directly affect the cooling towers this is essential because although these additional parameters cannot directly affect the cooling towers their presence is vital to provide a more reliable view of the effluent s overall quality however when setting the rules these parameters were given less priority because they have no direct side effects table 1 summarizes the reasons for choosing the parameter along with the relevant sources 2 2 water quality index wqi water quality index wqi is measured by determining the weight wi to the parameters based on its relevant interest in the overall water quality the relative weight wi along with the standards for each parameter is presented in table 2 which reviews the data obtained from the various effluent quality parameters into a singular output amount in this study 22 effluent quality parameters have been used to calculate wqi to evaluate wqi a multi step computational method is required 31 in the first step weights are assigned to each parameter on a sliding scale of 9 to 1 based on their contribution to water quality from most important 9 to the least 1 32 33 then relative weight is calculated using the following eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i w i is the relative weight of the parameter w i is the parameter s weight table 2 the following step is to calculate the quality rating scale qi which is measured according to eq 2 2 q i c i s i 100 where s i is the standard value for each parameter which is reported in mg l except for ph which is dimensionless and the s i is maximum allowable limit for each parameter in mg l and c i is the calculated value of each parameter in each sample to calculate wqi first sub index sl i can be resolved for each parameter as shown in eq 3 3 s l i w i q i where sl i is the sub index of the parameter finally wqi is evaluated as follows wqi classifies water samples into the five categories shown in table 3 31 34 4 w q i s l i 2 3 fuzzy logic fuzzy logic was developed by zadeh 35 36 to describe the information to solve complex problems that have made it possible to use human knowledge and experience in modeling membership functions inference rules and defuzzification are three parts of fuzzy inference systems fis briefly described below fuzzification is used to express the observed actual data in linguistic phrases utilizing membership function as a suitable method for developing complex and ambiguous systems 19 kumara et al 37 individual input or variable in a fuzzy inference system possesses a range called the universe of discussion and each set in this space is represented with a linguistic term such as low medium and high if then rules define relationships between variables several methods have been developed to find the best crisp value including the mean of maxima method the center of gravity method cog the weighted average method and the max method the methods most widely used for defuzzification are the mean of maxima and cog the former computes the mean of the maxima of the output membership functions while the latter points out the geometrical center of the fuzzy variable 27 36 37 in this research the cog method is used to get adequately explicit and numerical values 2 3 1 membership function fuzzy sets are defined as membership functions in fuzzy systems a function assigns a domain of interest to the distance 0 1 membership functions are defined to link each point in the universe of discourse to a membership grade between 0 and 1 let the elements of universe of discourse x be x then the fuzzy set a x is denoted by the following nomenclature 5 a x μ a x x x 0 μ a x 1 where μ a x is a membership grade between 0 and 1 in linguistic terms x is a member of a and also is associated with μ a x as illustrates in fig 1 a triangular fuzzy number a is identified with a triplet a1 a2 a3 38 zimmermann 2001 applying a triangular fuzzy number due to its simplicity in comparison with trapezoid fuzzy number is intuitively easy for decision makers to utilize furthermore because of the subjective conceptual and vigorous nature of the available information modeling according to triangular fuzzy numbers is an efficient approach for organizing the decision making problems kahraman 2008 39 membership functions have different shapes such as triangular trapezoidal and gaussian different methods have been used to determine membership functions such as using the expert s knowledge fuzzy clustering neural networks and genetic algorithm 40 42 2 3 2 inference rules a fuzzy rule contains mathematical if then rules which in the fuzzy inference system are based on expert judgments expressed in linguistic terms that represent the relationship between input and output a standard rule is done as if then and consists of two parts the first part with if and the next part with then where a b and c are linguistic values determined with fuzzy sets in which the universe of discussion a b and c are defined respectively 23 24 48 50 52 if a is a then c is c if b is b then c is c fuzzy set operators are applied to determine the relationship between factors in a fuzzy set fuzzy set operators create a new group during the process which varies depending on the type of operator used fuzzy operators are not or and sharing of fuzzy based systems is widely used as shown in the following equations 6 a n d μ a b μ a μ b min μ a μ b kind mentioned above of fuzzy set and fuzzy function creates the subscription of sets a and b 7 o r μ a u b μ a u μ b max μ a μ b x this or action produces the union of these two sets 8 n o t μ ā 1 μ a the negative not operator creates the complete set of sets below operators can get various modes but the min max and not functions are the most basic forms and are usually enough 36 ross 2004 ross 2013 43 2 3 3 defuzzification in processing fis defuzzification is the latest step during defuzzification the outcomes received in the form of fuzzy sets are converted into numbers a fuzzy based system produces the final fuzzy variable as the output consequently the fuzzy variable is converted to a definite and numerical value through defuzzification multiple methods have been developed to obtain the proper explicit value including the maximum the mean method and the center of gravity cog methods the former calculates the average of the maximum output membership functions while the latter represents the geometric center of the fuzzy variable complete knowledge about the cog method can be seen in section 2 4 19 20 36 43 44 ross 2004 2 4 developing fuzzy logic for determining cooling tower effluent quality index based on fuzzy inference system cteqif taking into account the priority of different parameters for effluent quality of municipal wastewater treatment discussed in section 2 3 twenty two parameters were chosen to develop the effluent quality index these parameters are calcium ca biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds temperature ph hardness th alkalinity alk heavy metals such as iron fe manganese mn copper cu aluminum al and finally minerals such as chloride cl nitrite no2 nitrate no sodium na potassium k silica so2 ammonia nh3 sulfate so4 phosphate po4 five fuzzy sets were defined in expressions of membership functions for each input index each membership function connects the elements in the universe of discussion to the range 0 1 membership functions used in this research are two types of membership functions according to proficient information assigned for each parameter with trapezoidal and triangular shapes for the same twenty two parameters each set of the universe of discussion x is introduced with a linguistic term in this study very low vl low l medium m high h and very high vh fuzzy sets have been used as linguistic terms table 4 exhibits the data applied to create fuzzy sets according to the next equations 9 t r i a n g u l a f x a b c 0 x a o r c x a x a b a x b c x c b b x c 10 t r a p e z o i d a l f x a b c d 0 x a o r c x a x a b a x b 1 b x c c x c b b x c performance parameters of membership functions where a b c and d exist and x represents each point on the x axis according to the selected ranges for each variable it should be noted that the standard value is set as the cut off point which means that the values below the standard value for each parameter are categorized into two classes very low and low values above the standard value were grouped into three categories medium high and very high in this study the parameters were normalized and grouped into four stages due to the range of output variables the most popular scoring system for evaluating water quality values are in the 0 100 range where values approaching 100 indicate higher water quality the developed algorithm for the water quality index based on fuzzy logic is manifested in fig 2 these rules were created based on expert experience and it was assumed that the human mind could not manage this kind of high data therefore to reduce the possible uncertainty in the first stage 22 parameters were treated by inference systems and then arranged and normalized between 0 and 100 in 11 groups in the second stage ten groups were processed by new inference systems and normalized between 0 and 100 in five groups the remaining five groups were processed by two new inference systems which in turn were processed by the last inference system and ultimately the last two groups were processed by the new inference system to create the cooling tower water quality index based on the fuzzy inference system cteqif the significant benefit of the particular type of classification used in creating the list is that it simplifies specialists work in making rules this is mainly because considering and manipulating more than two parameters at the same time may confuse the expert and cause errors and lead to a decrease in the confidence of the index 36 40 45 it is noteworthy that the rules obtained for cteqif were based on the knowledge and experience of several experts in the field of cooling towers here is a personal expert who specializes in both fuzzy fields and effluent quality in the present study the expertise of 5 experts with the mentioned specifications has been used to formulate rules to gain knowledge specialists the structure of the index is explained to them in full detail they were asked to complete each rule and form a separate set of rules which resulted in 5 different sets of rules after that this set of rules was discussed in the meetings and the agreement of all experts on each rule was considered as the final rule and formed the final greed set of rules however a sensitivity analysis was presented to show the effects of these changes on the regulation of rule sets by various experts and to be aware of these changes effect on the index outputs which shows the effects of the percentage change on the rule in each step the final index is set on the outputs unlike conventional methods which use tables curves and weighting factors to normalize parameters this process uses inference systems to normalize parameters in this investigation the mamdani inference system was employed facilitating the mastery of experts knowledge ross 2004 besides the fuzzy inference system makes it feasible to mimic the knowledge of experts like human behavior and thought the number and quality of rules restrict the performance and robustness of the system two hundred forty rules based on expert knowledge were used for calculation cteqif through fuzzy inference systems using the twenty two parameters mentioned the rules cover various possible conditions in water quality here are some examples of rules image 1 in this study the center of gravity cog method was employed to defuzzification the outputs it is believed that this method is the most conventional and physically useable in the fuzzy method defuzzification values were obtained using eq 11 36 ross 2004 39 40 46 11 z μ z z d z μ z d z where z is the defuzzified value denotes an algebraic integration μ z is membership function of z and z is the centroid of each symmetric membership function ross 2004 finally fig 3 shows the relationships between two parameters in the index e g cod and bod plus their 40 impact above the final index number all calculations were performed using the fuzzy logic toolbox in version b of the 2016 matlab r ross 2004 2 5 case study the shahid mofateh hamadan combined cycle power plant is located in central iran this is one of the thermal power plants of iran with a production capacity of 1000 mw which includes four steam units of 250 mw on a land area of 270 ha and its cooling towers are of wet type wet cooling towers are those buildings where the water that was heated by industrial or power generation processes is cooled again in this power plant the treated wastewater of hamadan city is used for the water consumption of cooling towers twenty two effluent parameters as mentioned in section 2 4 for developing cooling tower effluent quality index cteqi and other select items were selected in this study each month selected parameters are sampled according to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater awwa 1995 samples were taken from the effluent of the hamadan wastewater treatment plant 3 result and discussion 3 1 analysis cteqit and lsi rsi and psi the cooling tower effluent quality index based on the traditional system cteqit is calculated using the gravimetric index method the effluent quality index can be employed effectively in the implementation of effluent quality improvement programs this is one of the general indicators that has been accepted as a step by step indication of the combined effect on the overall quality of the exact quality numbers of the effluent 31 a higher water quality index shows poor water quality and a lower value indicates better water quality maximum weight seven is assigned to parameters such as total hardness calcium and alkalinity due to its significant influence in evaluating water quality weight 6 is assigned to ph tds and tss silica sulfate and phosphate are assigned a weight of 5 weight 4 is reserved for cod bod chloride and ammonia and weight 3 is for heavy metals iron manganese aluminum and copper with a minimum weight of 2 for nitrite nitrate sodium and potassium in fig 4 the monthly average of the values of the traditional index cteqit in the sampling station during the one year 2020 2019 of the study by the method of hierarchical analysis 79 52 95 99 is shown the status of effluent quality is low for one year according to the classification table 2 which indicates the excellent effluent conditions for the cooling towers of the power plant in may due to alkalinity chloride phosphate nitrite copper less sodium and potassium and in march due to less sulfate nitrate sodium and potassium it has better quality than other months of the year according to the results of the analysis in the sampling and analysis of variance anova station the quality of the effluent has not changed significantly and no significant difference has been observed between seasonal and monthly samples p 0 05 this is due to the proper control of the municipal wastewater treatment plant s parameters to enhance the effluent s quality for the consumption of cooling towers the potential for sediment formation and corrosion depends on ph calcium alkalinity soluble salt concentration temperature chloride and sulfate according to the langelier and puckorius index fig 5 a and c the effluent entering the cooling towers have a slight tendency to sediment the reason for sedimentation is higher than the standard due to calcium according to the ryznar index fig 5b the effluent entering the cooling towers has little corrosion except in august when the effluent quality was in equilibrium 18 van niekerk 2011 therefore out of the three indicators studied the incoming effluent to the power plant has a slight tendency to sediment which is desirable and appropriate 3 2 analysis cteqif the results of sampling 22 quality parameters of effluent for 1year fig 6 are shown as the monthly average of the fuzzy index as shown on that the figure the quality of the effluent entering the power plant for the cooling towers of monthly values cteqif in the one year period is moderate to good range 50 90 out of a maximum of 100 based on qualitative data the values mentioned above are lower than the standard due to the presence of calcium ammonia and phosphate in general the fuzzy inference system rules study the connections between multiple parameters based on expert recommendations accordingly the concluding outcome is not influenced by alterations in a parameter 46 47 this is why in fuzzy logic the data are closer to each other than to the definitive index hence that can conclude that the fis model could appropriately describe the detected situation according to the results of the analysis in the sampling and analysis of variance anova station the quality of effluent in this index has not changed significantly and no significant difference has been observed between seasonal and monthly samples p 0 05 for comparison in fig 7 the mean values for the definite and fuzzy index cteqi for the same period are shown the values obtained from the traditional index cteqit are generally less stable than the fuzzy index cteqif which indicates that the fuzzy index cteqif presented by the present study is more accurate than the traditional index cteqit which is quite in line with prospects the contrast between the fuzzy and traditional quality indices is due to their different weighting methods since cteqit does not include the interaction of the parameters with each other it makes the value of this index less stable almost constant values cteqif can match the specificity of the type of arrangement employed in the fuzzy method and its remarkable capacity to overwhelm uncertainties and insensitivity nearby effluent quality issues 45 since the endings of these two indicators were not significantly different but from the advantages of the current index compared to the traditional index you can experience from expert knowledge and through inference rules 40 the results of different investigations which have evaluated water quality using fuzzy based indicators for example the water quality index based on the fuzzy logic developed by gharibi et al and akampo et al 36 48 it is noteworthy that they produced results more accurately than wqi other investigations have reported similar findings 36 47 48 all of those pieces of knowledge show fuzzy indicators for water quality the criteria and standard levels used are considerably distinct from those applied in this stage of research so this study is only based on the fuzzy approach and is comparable to conventional procedures the substantive conclusions of this investigation should not be compared 3 3 validation of cteqif the cteqif has been extended to determine whether the effluent is of good quality for cooling towers due to the physicochemical properties of effluent quality and the presence of minerals and heavy metals in the effluent cteqif based on the fuzzy region one of the most common and efficient computational methods is artificial intelligence ai the best way to approve the suggested index is to justify the listed parameters and address the methodology s strength as discussed in section 2 3 extraordinary evidence indicates that all parameters in cteqif affect water quality and besides have severe and adverse effects on the performance of cooling towers this index is very accurate to show water quality 36 40 fuzzy logic is frequently based on words rather than equations therefore it can overcome the analysis of water quality issues and uncertainties 48 another advantage of the step by step method used for cteqi based on fuzzy logic is that no weighting factor is assigned to it and all parameters are considered with the same weight weight 1 while in the hierarchical analysis index the weight factor is assigned due to this study s frequency only 240 complex rules were applied in this index body a much smaller number than other education in the study 47 although only nine parameters are included more than 3000 rules are employed in this index significantly increasing the system s complexity as explained in section 2 4 the information and experience of 10 experts were employed to formulate the last set of rules for this goal each expert formulated a separate rule based on his understanding and experience and the final set of rules was formed by agreement between various experts for example if in a rule set by an expert the total number of 50 rules were different from the agreed final rules the percentage change in the ruleset was 10 to perform a sensitivity analysis to measure the robustness of the system cteqif by assessing the impact of changes in the regulated rule on the index outputs the final agreed set of rules was considered as the basis and deviation or change from this set of rules by the title of change percentage or change which was measured in the set of rules for each step it is noteworthy that these changes are due to the different rules developed by different experts in each set developed by an expert several different rules were calculated from the set of basic rules as the percentage of changes in the rules as mentioned in section 2 4 since the weighting factor included in the rules changes the rules performing a sensitivity analysis assesses changing the weighting factor and rules on the index outputs the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 8 a d the change in the rules at different stages of the phase is presented in fig 7 as shown in fig 8a b c d changes in the rules at different fuzzy stages of the index do not significantly affect the final value of feqi for example a 50 change in the rules governing the third stage changed the feqi values to only 5 and the 80 change in the rules in the last stage changed the index returns by almost 20 4 conclusion the key purpose of this paper is to provide a fuzzy index to evaluate the quality of inlet effluent to the cooling towers of thermal power plants in addition the present study focuses on accepted parameters for comparing fuzzy wqis developed with traditional wqis results of quality evaluation of 22 parameters all of which are essential for assessment of wastewater quality and all 22 parameters need to wqis develop showed that the quality of the incoming effluent is good for the power plant and has little tendency to scale furthermore the values of various parameters show high effluent quality according to the results of the present study cteqi is based on fuzzy logic and hierarchical analysis the proposed index from the present study provides accurate and acceptable outcomes therefore it is suggested that it be utilized as a comprehensive tool to assess wastewater quality according to the results of the analysis in the sampling and analysis of variance anova station the quality of the effluent has not changed significantly and no significant difference has been observed between seasonal and monthly samples p 0 05 this is due to the proper control of the factors in the municipal wastewater treatment plant to improve the quality of the effluent for the consumption of cooling towers declaration of competing
