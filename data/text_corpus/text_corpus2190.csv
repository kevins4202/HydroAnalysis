10950,accurately modeling evapotranspiration et and its components of maize grown for seed production is essential for precision irrigation management in this study a dual crop coefficient method and a multisource model based on radiation interception by adjacent crop varieties were used to estimate et and its components in the arid region of northwest china the dual crop coefficient method and multisource model were validated using observed et etec transpiration t of female tsf and male tsm parents and evaporation es observations were made using the eddy covariance system sap flow measurements and micro lysimeter in 2013 and 2014 results showed that et estimated by the dual crop coefficient method was close to etec at the midseason stage and was higher than etec both at the initial and the development stage due to the constant value of initial basic crop coefficient and linear interpolation at the development stage the estimated t of female and male parents was greater than tsf and tsm in both years soil evaporation estimated by the dual crop coefficient method was greater than measured soil evaporation in the late growth stage while the et t of female and male parents and e predicted by the multisource model were closer to the measurements estimated et was 2 less 2013 and 4 greater 2014 than etec t of male parents was 8 and 3 less than tsm t of female plants was 8 and 6 less than tsm and e was 6 and 3 less than es thus the multisource model based on radiation interception by neighboring species is suitable for estimating et and its components of

soil and transpiration t from plant surfaces its accurate estimation is essential for accurate irrigation water management and improving water productivity because the arid region of northwest china is naturally isolated and receives abundant solar radiation maize for seed production develops rapidly and it has become the primary irrigated crop in that region jiang et al 2014 maize for seed production differs from common field maize because male and female parents differ in canopy and thus t differs between female and male parents as does e a mixture of two or more species in the same field is also widely found in intercropping and agroforestry systems thus the fundamental understanding of water use and the partitioning of et is important to account for the heterogeneous canopy and different irrigation schedules were adopted for different plants to develop a more precise irrigation methodology the single and dual crop coefficient methods proposed by allen et al 1998 have been used to estimate et and its components the dual kc method can better represent the effect of rain or irrigation on soil wetting and can quantify the effects of film mulching which keeps part of the soil dry suppress soil evaporation allen et al 1998 zhang et al 2013 thus the dual kc method can more accurately compute et and its components than the single crop coefficient model allen and pereira 2009 allen et al 2011 rosa et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 the kc and kcb values for many crops have been reported allen et al 1998 2007 many studies have used the single and dual kc method to estimate et for many crops including maize and wheat zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 hou et al 2014 few studies have focused on a heterogeneous canopy when two or more species or varieties are mixed in the same field allen et al 1998 estimated total kcb for a mixture of two or more species in the same field by weighting kc values for the individual crop species according to the area covered by each crop and the height of the crop however the crop parameters for estimating total kcb for a heterogeneous canopy need further study the performance of this method in estimating et for a heterogeneous canopy remains uncertain despite of the practical simplicity the dual kc method was reported to have a drawback i e the adoption of generalized kc curves can lead to relevant difference in the estimation of et and its components allen et al 1998 katerji and rana 2006 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 proposed a two source p m model the s w model to estimate et and apportion et between t and e for a sparse canopy the s w model assumes that crop canopy is uniformly distributed and thus it is not applicable to the canopies of two or more species or varieties in the same field wallace 1997 developed a multisource model from the s w model that estimated t from n crop species and e from the soil surface total et from the canopy is the sum of the different evaporations for the n species the evaporation for each species is calculated by p m type equations which combined corresponding parameters for canopy resistance and aerodynamic resistance the water and heat fluxes in multi species canopies and radiation interception for neighboring species were estimated by developing a simple and useful model wallace 1997 compare to kc method the multisource model is a direct method and need the data measured above the canopy which usually had better performance rana and katerji 2009 the multisource model was now mostly used with theoretical formulation only brenner and incoll 1997 lhomme et al 2012 2013 lhomme et al 2012 2013 developed a simplified formulation considering the effect of stomatal characteristics on evapotranspiration this model rarely used to estimate et and its components because of the complexity in the theoretical formulation and difficulties in obtaining crop parameters for n crop species verhoef and allen 2000 gao et al 2013 verhoef and allen 2000 estimated the et of a dry land savannah that consisted of shrubs forbs grasses and bare soil using the multisource model and the prediction of the model was in good agreement with the measurement of et gao et al 2013 used the multisource model to simulate soil evaporation and plant transpiration in a maize soybean intercropping system the model overestimated plant t for maize and soybean and underestimated e the interactions between crops primarily occur at the intersections between female and male parents and it is necessary to quantify the radiation interception of adjacent species especially at the edge rows canopy resistance and boundary layer resistance for each species in the multisource model the mechanism of using the multisource model to estimate et and its components of maize for seed production should be further studied in this study the dual crop coefficient method for a mixed crop of female and male parents and the multisource model based on the radiation interception of different species were used to estimate daily et t of female and male parents and e the objectives of this study are to validate the dual crop coefficient method and the multisource model using observed et t and e measured by eddy covariance system sap flow and micro lysimeters to determine an accurate model that predicts et and its components for a heterogeneous canopy and to provide a scientific basis for the precision irrigation management of maize for seed production in the arid region of northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and arrangement the

et al 2014 and jiang et al 2016a 2016b 3 models 3 1 the dual crop coefficient method in the dual crop coefficient method the crop coefficient kc is divided into the basal crop coefficient kcb

k c b k e e t 0 where ks is determined by soil water availability in the root zone maize for seed production requires different cultivars of female and male parent plants which we consider as different crops according to allen et al 1998 total kcb should be calculated by weighting the kcb values for the individual crops according to the proportion of land area covered by each crop and by

be used directly from allen et al 1998 since the difference between female and male plants is small we defined kcb ini as 0 15 kcb increases linearly with the increase in days after sowing at the development stage and its slope is determined by the kcb at the initial and midseason stages allen et al 1998 3 1 2 the soil evaporation coefficient ke is determined by the energy available at the soil surface and soil water content and is calculated according to allen et al 1998 as 13 k e min k r k c max k c b f e w k c max where few is the fraction of surface soil evaporation we introduced the ratio of bare soil to the soil surface fs to include the effect of plastic film mulching on soil evaporation and calculated few as 14 f e w min f s 1 f c f w where kc max is the upper limit of the

canopy is simply the sum of each evaporation component λei wallace 1997 and is calculated separately from p m types of equations using the corresponding available energy ai and vapor pressure deficit vpd0 at the mean canopy source height zm lhomme et al 2013 the model considers the canopy and aerodynamic resistances of each maize cultivar and it is assumed that the canopy and aerodynamic resistances interact at the mean canopy height zm and that only aerodynamic resistance ra a between the reference height above the canopy and zm needs to be considered thus total et of the canopy can be calculated as 22 λ e t m l i 1 n 1 λ e i i 1 n 1 c i p m i i 1 n c c i p m c i c s p m s where pmc i and pms are the p m type equations for crop components and soil evaporation and are given by 23

n f i r n g the fi were determined by the method proposed by wallace 1997 which considered the extreme case of two species if the female parent is very much taller than male parent then the fraction

between et as observed by the ec system and e as observed using the micro lysimeters tec the results showed that ts agreed well with tec fig 2 indicating that both sap flow and the micro lysimeters accurately measure transpiration and soil evaporation these results are consistent with previous studies ding et al 2013 bethenod et al 2000 granier et al 1996 hatton et al 1995 ham et al 1990 therefore the data observed by both sap flow and the micro lysimeters can be used to determine the accuracy of our model the crop data required for the crop coefficient method are shown in table 2 according to allen et al 1998 the standard value of the soil water depletion fraction for no stress ptable is 0 5 this value needs to be adjusted for the mean daily et etec that was observed by the ec

for spring maize calculated by the dual kc method was 2 greater than etec jiang et al 2014 found that et for maize for seed production calculated by the dual kc method was 9 greater than etec over all the growth stages etc was close to etec at both the midseason and late season stages while etec was significantly overestimated at the initial and development stages fig 4 jiang et al 2014 also found that et for maize for seed production calculated by the dual kc method overestimated etec at the initial and development stages the principal reason for this result is that the basic crop coefficient kcb at the initial stage was a constant value and thus it fails to reflect crop growth kcb at the development stage is determined by linear regression between kcb at the initial stage and kcb at the midseason stage the regression does not account for the nonlinear dynamic behavior of kcb due to variation in crop canopy coverage raes et al 2009 ding et al 2013 using the multisource model better agreement was found between etml and etec fig 4 with greater e 1 and r 2 and lower mae and rmse in 2013 etml was only 2 less than etec etml was 4 greater than etec in 2014 fig 3 and table 3 over all the growth stages etml slightly underestimated etec at the initial stage this was because the canopy resistance rc is determined by lai and low lai resulted in overestimating rc however a few etc and etml values deviated significantly from etec these differences occurred mainly after irrigation or on rainy days such as on 2013 06 06 the first irrigation and 2013 08 23 rain and on 2014 06 02 rain and 2014 08 24 the fourth irrigation fig 4 these values were observed because of measurement errors in the ec system after irrigation and on rainy days etc and etml overestimated etec in the late season stage in 2013 fig 4 mainly because of severe damage to the leaves caused by insect pests the observed values of lai and canopy coverage were higher than the actual values causing the overestimation of crop transpiration 4 2 comparison of maize transpiration estimated by the dual crop coefficient method and multisources model fig 5 shows that the dual kc method overestimated t for male parents tcm compared to the sap flow method tsm tcm was 17 and 27 greater than tsm in 2013 and 2014 with lower r 2 and e 1 values and greater mae and rmse table 3 for female plants tcf t estimated by the dual kc method in 2013 was similar to that measured by sap flow tsf in 2014 tcf was greater than tsf with lower r 2 and e 1 values and greater mae and rmse table 3 over all the whole growth stages tcm was overestimated when compared to tsm in both years in 2013 tcf was close to tsf at the midseason stage and greater than tsf at the late growth stage in 2014 tcf was significantly overestimated when compared to tsf fig 6 the main reason is that the dual kc method overestimated the kcb of female and male parents during the midseason stage for full vegetation kcbfulli ringersma and sikking 2001 also found that the dual kc method overestimated kcbfulli even after they introduced a resistance correction factor the multisource model accurately calculated t for female tmf and male tmm parents both tmf and tcf were close to the observed values of t in 2014 tmf was closer than tcf to tsf in 2014 fig 6 the multisource model gave more accurate predictions of t for male plants tmm was only 8 2013 and 3 2014 less than tsm with greater r 2 and e 1 values and lower mae and rmse fig 5 table 3 fig 5 shows that the multisource model only slightly overestimated tsf and tsm in the late season stage in 2013 this was because of the large lai measurement error caused by plant diseases and insect pests gao et al 2013 used the multisource model to estimate t for maize and soybean in maize soybean intercropping system their results showed that the model agreed well with observation estimated t for maize was 7 greater than observed values with r 2 0 83 and estimated t for soybean was 8 greater than observed values with r 2 0 83 4 3 comparison of soil evaporation estimated by the dual crop coefficient method and multisource model fig 7 shows that soil evaporation e calculated by the dual kc method ecs significantly exceeded that measured by the micro lysimeter es in both seasons ec s was 16 greater than es with r 2 0 30 mae 0 21 mm d 1 rmse 0 24 mm d 1 and e 1 0 08 in 2013 ec s was 3 greater than es in 2014 with low values of r 2 and e 1 and higher mae and rmse values the maximum difference between ecs and es was after the last irrigation in the late season stage fig 8 er raki et al 2010 also found a large difference between e predicted by the dual kc method and the observed value for grapevines estimated e was significantly less than the observed values in the midseason stage and significantly greater than the observed values in the late season stage zhao et al 2013 used the dual kc method to calculate e in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation systems their calculated e for winter wheat was significantly greater than the observed value in september the slope of the regression line between predicted and observed e for summer maize was close to 1 and predicted e was also greater than the observed values in the late season stage the multisource model performed better than the kc method in 2013 the estimated e by the multisource model ems was closer to es fig 8 and was only 6 less than es in 2014 ems was only 3 less than es fig 7 and table 3 gao et al 2013 also found good agreement between e calculated by the multisource model and e measured by micro lysimeters for maize soybean intercropping system with estimated e 3 greater than the observed values with r 2 0 90 5 conclusions in this study the dual crop coefficient kc method and the multisource model based on radiation interception by neighboring species were both used to predict daily evapotranspiration et and its components of maize for seed production both et estimated by the dual kc method etc and et estimated by the multisource model etml were close to observed et as measured by the eddy covariance system etec etml was closer than etc to etec while etc was higher etec at the initial and development stage due to the constant value of initial basic crop coefficient and its interpolation during the development stage transpiration of male plants calculated by the dual kc method was significantly higher than transpiration measured by sap flow in both seasons t for female plants calculated by kc method was greater than observed t in 2014 and close to observed t in 2013 the multisource model predicted t values for female and male parents that were closer to observed t than those predicted by the dual crop coefficient model with greater r 2 and e 1 and lower mae and rmse evaporation predicted by the dual kc method was greater than observed e as measured by micro lysimeters es and was 16 2013 and 3 2014 greater than es e calculated by the multisource model was closer to es and was 6 2013 and 3 2014 less than es with higher values of r 2 and e 1 and lower mae and rmse the multisource model can be used to accurately predict et and its components from the

10950,accurately modeling evapotranspiration et and its components of maize grown for seed production is essential for precision irrigation management in this study a dual crop coefficient method and a multisource model based on radiation interception by adjacent crop varieties were used to estimate et and its components in the arid region of northwest china the dual crop coefficient method and multisource model were validated using observed et etec transpiration t of female tsf and male tsm parents and evaporation es observations were made using the eddy covariance system sap flow measurements and micro lysimeter in 2013 and 2014 results showed that et estimated by the dual crop coefficient method was close to etec at the midseason stage and was higher than etec both at the initial and the development stage due to the constant value of initial basic crop coefficient and linear interpolation at the development stage the estimated t of female and male parents was greater than tsf and tsm in both years soil evaporation estimated by the dual crop coefficient method was greater than measured soil evaporation in the late growth stage while the et t of female and male parents and e predicted by the multisource model were closer to the measurements estimated et was 2 less 2013 and 4 greater 2014 than etec t of male parents was 8 and 3 less than tsm t of female plants was 8 and 6 less than tsm and e was 6 and 3 less than es thus the multisource model based on radiation interception by neighboring species is suitable for estimating et and its components of

soil and transpiration t from plant surfaces its accurate estimation is essential for accurate irrigation water management and improving water productivity because the arid region of northwest china is naturally isolated and receives abundant solar radiation maize for seed production develops rapidly and it has become the primary irrigated crop in that region jiang et al 2014 maize for seed production differs from common field maize because male and female parents differ in canopy and thus t differs between female and male parents as does e a mixture of two or more species in the same field is also widely found in intercropping and agroforestry systems thus the fundamental understanding of water use and the partitioning of et is important to account for the heterogeneous canopy and different irrigation schedules were adopted for different plants to develop a more precise irrigation methodology the single and dual crop coefficient methods proposed by allen et al 1998 have been used to estimate et and its components the dual kc method can better represent the effect of rain or irrigation on soil wetting and can quantify the effects of film mulching which keeps part of the soil dry suppress soil evaporation allen et al 1998 zhang et al 2013 thus the dual kc method can more accurately compute et and its components than the single crop coefficient model allen and pereira 2009 allen et al 2011 rosa et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 the kc and kcb values for many crops have been reported allen et al 1998 2007 many studies have used the single and dual kc method to estimate et for many crops including maize and wheat zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 hou et al 2014 few studies have focused on a heterogeneous canopy when two or more species or varieties are mixed in the same field allen et al 1998 estimated total kcb for a mixture of two or more species in the same field by weighting kc values for the individual crop species according to the area covered by each crop and the height of the crop however the crop parameters for estimating total kcb for a heterogeneous canopy need further study the performance of this method in estimating et for a heterogeneous canopy remains uncertain despite of the practical simplicity the dual kc method was reported to have a drawback i e the adoption of generalized kc curves can lead to relevant difference in the estimation of et and its components allen et al 1998 katerji and rana 2006 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 proposed a two source p m model the s w model to estimate et and apportion et between t and e for a sparse canopy the s w model assumes that crop canopy is uniformly distributed and thus it is not applicable to the canopies of two or more species or varieties in the same field wallace 1997 developed a multisource model from the s w model that estimated t from n crop species and e from the soil surface total et from the canopy is the sum of the different evaporations for the n species the evaporation for each species is calculated by p m type equations which combined corresponding parameters for canopy resistance and aerodynamic resistance the water and heat fluxes in multi species canopies and radiation interception for neighboring species were estimated by developing a simple and useful model wallace 1997 compare to kc method the multisource model is a direct method and need the data measured above the canopy which usually had better performance rana and katerji 2009 the multisource model was now mostly used with theoretical formulation only brenner and incoll 1997 lhomme et al 2012 2013 lhomme et al 2012 2013 developed a simplified formulation considering the effect of stomatal characteristics on evapotranspiration this model rarely used to estimate et and its components because of the complexity in the theoretical formulation and difficulties in obtaining crop parameters for n crop species verhoef and allen 2000 gao et al 2013 verhoef and allen 2000 estimated the et of a dry land savannah that consisted of shrubs forbs grasses and bare soil using the multisource model and the prediction of the model was in good agreement with the measurement of et gao et al 2013 used the multisource model to simulate soil evaporation and plant transpiration in a maize soybean intercropping system the model overestimated plant t for maize and soybean and underestimated e the interactions between crops primarily occur at the intersections between female and male parents and it is necessary to quantify the radiation interception of adjacent species especially at the edge rows canopy resistance and boundary layer resistance for each species in the multisource model the mechanism of using the multisource model to estimate et and its components of maize for seed production should be further studied in this study the dual crop coefficient method for a mixed crop of female and male parents and the multisource model based on the radiation interception of different species were used to estimate daily et t of female and male parents and e the objectives of this study are to validate the dual crop coefficient method and the multisource model using observed et t and e measured by eddy covariance system sap flow and micro lysimeters to determine an accurate model that predicts et and its components for a heterogeneous canopy and to provide a scientific basis for the precision irrigation management of maize for seed production in the arid region of northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and arrangement the

development stage and its slope is determined by the kcb at the initial and midseason stages allen et al 1998 3 1 2 the soil evaporation coefficient ke is determined by the energy available at the

vpd0 at the mean canopy source height zm lhomme et al 2013 the model considers the canopy and aerodynamic resistances of each maize cultivar and it is assumed that the canopy and aerodynamic resistances interact at the mean canopy height zm and that only aerodynamic resistance ra a between the reference height above the canopy and zm needs to be considered thus total et of the canopy can be calculated as 22 λ e t m l i 1 n 1 λ e i i 1 n 1 c i p m i i 1 n c c i p m c i c s p m s where pmc i and pms are the p m type equations for crop components and soil evaporation and are given by 23

between et as observed by the ec system and e as observed using the micro lysimeters tec the results showed that ts agreed well with tec fig 2 indicating that both sap flow and the micro lysimeters accurately measure transpiration and soil evaporation these results are consistent with previous studies ding et al 2013 bethenod et al 2000 granier et al 1996 hatton et al 1995 ham et al 1990 therefore the data observed by both sap flow and the micro lysimeters can be used to determine the accuracy of our model the crop data required for the crop coefficient method are shown in table 2 according to allen et al 1998 the standard value of the soil water depletion fraction for no stress ptable is 0 5 this value needs to be adjusted for the mean daily et etec that was observed by the ec system in 2013 allen et al 1998 48 p p t a b l e 0 04 5 e t e c the soil rew tew raw and taw and irrigation fw parameters were determined according to allen et al 1998 table 2 the model is evaluated by linear regression between estimated ei and observed value qi the statistical parameters include the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute bias error mae root mean square error rmse and the modified coefficient of efficiency e 1 they are calculated as follows 49 m a e 1 n i 1 n q i e i 50 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q i e i 2 1 2 51 e 1 1 0 i 1 n q i e i i 1 n q i q where q is the mean of the observed value 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of maize evapotranspiration estimated by the dual crop coefficient method and multisource model daily evapotranspiration et was calculated by the dual crop coefficient kc method etc and the multisource model based on radiation interception by neighboring species etml when compared to daily et observed by the ec system etec etc was greater than etec in 2014 fig 3 in 2013 etc was close to etec it was only 5 greater than etec with a coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute bias error mae and modified coefficient of efficiency e1 of 0 76 0 80 mm d 1 0 67 mm d 1 and 0 58 respectively however in 2014 etc was 11 greater than etec with r 2 0 60 rmse 1 05 mm d 1 mae 0 86 mm d 1 and e 1 0 45 table 3 similar results have been obtained by other authors for example zhang et al 2013 found that et for summer maize calculated by the dual kc method was 7 greater than etec ding et al 2013 found that et for spring maize calculated by the dual kc method was 2 greater than etec jiang et al 2014 found that et for maize for seed production calculated by the dual kc method was 9 greater than etec over all the growth stages etc was close to etec at both the midseason and late season stages while etec was significantly overestimated at the initial and development stages fig 4 jiang et al 2014 also found that et for maize for seed production calculated by the dual kc method overestimated etec at the initial and development stages the principal reason for this result is that the basic crop coefficient kcb at the initial stage was a constant value and thus it fails to reflect crop growth kcb at the development stage is determined by linear regression between kcb at the initial stage and kcb at the midseason stage the regression does not account for the nonlinear dynamic behavior of kcb due to variation in crop canopy coverage raes et al 2009 ding et al 2013 using the multisource model better agreement was found between etml and etec fig 4 with greater e 1 and r 2 and lower mae and rmse in 2013 etml was only 2 less than etec etml was 4 greater than etec in 2014 fig 3 and table 3 over all the growth stages etml slightly underestimated etec at the initial stage this was because the canopy resistance rc is determined by lai and low lai resulted in overestimating rc however a few etc and etml values deviated significantly from etec these differences occurred mainly after irrigation or on rainy days such as on 2013 06 06 the first irrigation and 2013 08 23 rain and on 2014 06 02 rain and 2014 08 24 the fourth irrigation fig 4 these values were observed because of measurement errors in the ec system after irrigation and on rainy days etc and etml overestimated etec in the late season stage in 2013 fig 4 mainly because of severe damage to the leaves caused by insect pests the observed values of lai and canopy coverage were higher than the actual values causing the overestimation of crop transpiration 4 2 comparison of maize transpiration estimated by the dual crop coefficient method and multisources model fig 5 shows that the dual kc method overestimated t for male parents tcm compared to the sap flow method tsm tcm was 17 and 27 greater than tsm in 2013 and 2014 with lower r 2 and e 1 values and greater mae and rmse table 3 for female plants tcf t estimated by the dual kc method in 2013 was similar to that measured by sap flow tsf in 2014 tcf was greater than tsf with lower r 2 and e 1 values and greater mae and rmse table 3 over all the whole growth stages tcm was overestimated when compared to tsm in both years in 2013 tcf was close to tsf at the midseason stage and greater than tsf at the late growth stage in 2014 tcf was significantly overestimated when compared to tsf fig 6 the main reason is that the dual kc method overestimated the kcb of female and male parents during the midseason stage for full vegetation kcbfulli ringersma and sikking 2001 also found that the dual kc method overestimated kcbfulli even after they introduced a resistance correction factor the multisource model accurately calculated t for female tmf and male tmm parents both tmf and tcf were close to the observed values of t in 2014 tmf was closer than tcf to tsf in 2014 fig 6 the multisource model gave more accurate predictions of t for male plants tmm was only 8 2013 and 3 2014 less than tsm with greater r 2 and e 1 values and lower mae and rmse fig 5 table 3 fig 5 shows that the multisource model only slightly overestimated tsf and tsm in the late season stage in 2013 this was because of the large lai measurement error caused by plant diseases and insect pests gao et al 2013 used the multisource model to estimate t for maize and soybean in maize soybean intercropping system their results showed that the model agreed well with observation estimated t for maize was 7 greater than observed values with r 2 0 83 and estimated t for soybean was 8 greater than observed values with r 2 0 83 4 3 comparison of soil evaporation estimated by the dual crop coefficient method and multisource model fig 7 shows that soil evaporation e calculated by the dual kc method ecs significantly exceeded that measured by the micro lysimeter es in both seasons ec s was 16 greater than es with r 2 0 30 mae 0 21 mm d 1 rmse 0 24 mm d 1 and e 1 0 08 in 2013 ec s was 3 greater than es in 2014 with low values of r 2 and e 1 and higher mae and rmse values the maximum difference between ecs and es was after the last irrigation in the late season stage fig 8 er raki et al 2010 also found a large difference between e predicted by the dual kc method and the observed value for grapevines estimated e was significantly less than the observed values in the midseason stage and significantly greater than the observed values in the late season stage zhao et al 2013 used the dual kc method to calculate e in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation systems their calculated e for winter wheat was significantly greater than the observed value in september the slope of the regression line between predicted and observed e for summer maize was close to 1 and predicted e was also greater than the observed values in the late season stage the multisource model performed better than the kc method in 2013 the estimated e by the multisource model ems was closer to es fig 8 and was only 6 less than es in 2014 ems was only 3 less than es fig 7 and table 3 gao et al 2013 also found good agreement between e calculated by the multisource model and e measured by micro lysimeters for maize soybean intercropping system with estimated e 3 greater than the observed values with r 2 0 90 5 conclusions in this study the dual crop coefficient kc method and the multisource model based on radiation interception by neighboring species were both used to predict daily evapotranspiration et and its components of maize for seed production both et estimated by the dual kc method etc and et estimated by the multisource model etml were close to observed et as measured by the eddy covariance system etec etml was closer than etc to etec while etc was higher etec at the initial and development stage due to the constant value of initial basic crop coefficient and its interpolation during the development stage transpiration of male plants calculated by the dual kc method was significantly higher than transpiration measured by sap flow in both seasons t for female plants calculated by kc method was greater than observed t in 2014 and close to observed t in 2013 the multisource model predicted t values for female and male parents that were closer to observed t than those predicted by the dual crop coefficient model with greater r 2 and e 1 and lower mae and rmse evaporation predicted by the dual kc method was greater than observed e as measured by micro lysimeters es and was 16 2013 and 3 2014 greater than es e calculated by the multisource model was closer to es and was 6 2013 and 3 2014 less than es with higher values of r 2 and e 1 and lower mae and rmse the multisource model can be used to accurately predict et and its components from the

10951,maize is a crop with high irrigation needs in italy in many cultivated areas of the world the water used for irrigation has a high salinity to limit the damage caused by the salts provided by irrigation suitable irrigation strategies can be adopted in relation to the crop soil characteristics and rainfall regime therefore in order to evaluate the most appropriate irrigation strategy to be used in the cultivation of maize on a clay loam red soil subject to salinity a research on a four year crop rotation was carried out in southern italy maize grain yield and yield characteristics irrigated by furrow with two water salinity levels and five different irrigation regimes were compared grain yield was reduced by 34 in the third crop rotation year when the soil salinity on average raised from 3 8 to 7 4 ds m 1 higher yield occurred restoring 100 of maximum crop evapotranspiration instead of leaching requirement application which did not affect yield soil salinity improved grain protein content and reduced grain moisture content rainfall was not sufficient to leach all salts supplied by irrigation the leaching requirements did not reduce the soil salinity and the harmful effect of salinity on maize yield because of more salts supplied by higher irrigation volumes keywords maize yield brackish water furrow irrigation wue 1 introduction irrigation is a very important agronomic practice in agriculture today the accelerated growth of urbanization industry and activities performed during leisure time compete for good water quality and this is leading to the reduction of disponibility of good quality water for irrigation bergez and nolleau 2003 qadir and oster 2004 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 so an alternative could be the use of large salt water resources in the world mantell et al 1985 maize zea mays l is classified a crop moderately sensitive to salinity flagella et al 2002 it is one of the world s leading crops because of its excellent starch composition that is becoming a major raw material for the food textiles paper and feed industry fan et al 2008 kang et al 2010 tian et al 2009 most studies on this crop have shown that salinity is one of the main causes of plant stress acosta motos et al 2017 the intraspecific variability of corn to salinity is high schubert et al 2009 the resistance to salinity can be improved by implementing strategies to avoid sodium toxicity in the second stage of the crop cycle and to overcome osmotic problems in the first stage of saline stress in general maize in salinity conditions shows stunted growth during the first phase with dark green leaves but without symptoms of toxicity farooq et al 2015 it is feasible to use salt water for irrigation but only for particular crops and soils and with appropriate water management oster 1994 dong et al 2018 drip irrigation with its low release volume and frequent applications can maintain a high matrix potential of the soil in the root zone and thus offset the decrease in osmotic potential caused by saline water while maintaining high total water potential for plant growth kang et al 2010 wan et al 2007 studied the effects of drip irrigation with saline water on tomato licopersicum esculeuntum mill and pointed out that the variation of the electrical conductivity of water ecw from 1 1 to 4 9 ds m 1 has little effect on yield but the water use efficiency increases with the increase in water salinity besides the salinity of the soil along the 0 0 90 m profile did not increase after three years of irrigation several studies have been carried out on the application of different irrigation practices to maize crops in respect to salinity schneekloth et al 2006 found that reducing water supply during vegetative growth has little effect on yield significant yield reductions can be attributed to water shortages during the reproduction phases schneekloth et al 1991 çakir 2004 aguilar et al 2007 abdelraouf and ragab 2018 it is well known that furrow irrigation is a less efficient method of irrigation respect to a pivot system but the irregular form of some fields prevents the use of the latter method so if the soil is clayey furrow irrigation may be an alternative method jiru and van ranst 2010 nelson and al kaisi 2011 chen and feng 2013 compared to the border irrigation methods furrow irrigation can improve water use efficiency wu et al 2015 in this case deep percolation occurs primarily below the furrows saggu and kaushal 1991 and salts accumulate in the surface soil layers below the ridges furrow is an irrigation method with low irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity specific practices that have been shown to increase irrigation efficiencies include the adoption of shorter furrow lengths better timing of irrigation cut off selection of appropriate water application rates and narrow furrow shapes kang et al 2000 ampas and baltas 2009 as a strategy for improving irrigation efficiency sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 1997 golzardi et al 2017 dong et al 2018 and yarami and sepaskhah 2018 have used an every other furrow irrigation method for reducing the amount of water applied they have found that this method of irrigation decreases the evaporation of water from the surface of the soil and allows the soil to retain more water after a rainy event other studies have shown a reduction in both water leakage for deep percolation sepaskhah and parand 2006 dong et al 2016 and nitrate leaching lehrsch et al 2000 with an irrigation with every other furrow with respect to the single furrow method in order to make a further contribution to this problem the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of two irrigation water salinity levels and different irrigation regimes on maize grown on a shallow clay loam soil formed on limestone rock irrigated by furrow method in southern italy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic conditions the research was carried out at the

for the rest of the growing season table 4 a split plot experimental design with four replicates was used the quality water types fresh and brackish were assigned to the main plots and the five irrigation regimes to the sub plots of 5 x 4 9 m irrigation was performed whenever in the treatment irc100 the soil water matrix potential of the layer explored by roots reached 0 1 mpa 240 g kg 1 moisture content on dry weight soil providing the irrigation volume required to bring the matrix potential to 0 03 mpa 310 g kg 1 moisture content on dry weight soil the relationship between soil moisture and matrix potential soil water retention curve was determined with the richards pressure apparatus dane and hopmans 2002 based on these limits the irrigation interval was determined by the

maize seeds of two commercial hybrids f1 class fao 400 pr35a52 and dkc5143 in the first and third year of the crop rotation respectively were sowed on april 28 and 26 in the 1st and 3rd year respectively on previously fertilized soil with 75 kg ha 1 of n and 150 kg ha 1 of p205 a different maize hybrid was used in the second crop cycle third year of the crop rotation because seeds of pr35a52 were not available the sowing was performed in rows 70 cm apart and at 25 cm distance along the rows at the beginning of the second crop cycle of maize the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract ece was on average 1 2 and 3 1 ds m 1 for the previously watered soils with fresh water and brackish water respectively in both years chemical weeding was carried out while during the crop cycle pest control was performed against slugs and pyralide 2 3 plant materials and measurements at end of the rainfall march and irrigation seasons september soil salinity was measured by taking soil samples in each plot through a cylindrical probe 2 5 cm as described cucci et al 2016 the main morphological plant height ear length and productive parameters kernel per row yield ear weight of 1000 kernel yield were measured at harvest september 15 and 14 in the 1st and 3rd year respectively the grain moisture content at threshing was determined in the laboratory after drying for 48 h at 65 c yield was expressed at 13 5 of moisture the yield water use efficiency ywue of maize was calculated as follows wang et al 2011 2 y w u e k g m 3 y e t a where y is the marketable grain yield kg ha 1 eta m3 ha 1 is the total actual evapotranspiration water consumption over the maize growing season calculated using the simplified soil water balance equation as follows dong et al 2018 3 e t a p i δ w where p is the precipitation during the maize growing period i is the irrigation amount δw m3 ha 1 is the soil water content at sowing minus the soil water content at harvesting for the rooting zone depth the surface runoff and vertical water exchange have been neglected due to the low rainfall events occurred during the crop cycle that did not caused either runoff or deep percolation in the treatments in which the lr was foreseen it was assumed that the leaching fraction was lost by deep percolation irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated as the ratio between marketable yield and seasonal irrigation volume 4 i w u e y i where y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 i is seasonal irrigation volume m3 ha 1 wang et al 2015 ali et al 2018 kernel protein fat and starch content were determined by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy nirs using infratec 1241 grain analyzer foss tecator sweden and expressed as percentage dry matter of grain 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova and the differences between means were analyzed following the duncan test data were analysed with sas software using the glm procedure sas institute 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation regimes and salinity levels the seasonal irrigation volumes applied during the two maize crop cycles amounted to 2275 and 3024 m3 ha 1 in the first year and to 3135 and 3976 m3 ha 1 in the third year of crop rotation respectively in irc75 and irc100 treatments the same irrigation volumes were applied in both salinity treatments in irc100 lr50 and irc100 lr100 treatments the seasonal irrigation volume was different between salinity levels in fact in the first year the values of this parameter were equal to 3174 and 3330 m3 ha 1 fresh water and to 4038 and 5050 m3 ha 1 brackish water respectively in irc100 lr50 and irc100 lr100 in the third year on the other hand they amounted to 4142 and 4300 m3 ha 1 fresh water and 5091 and 6200 m3 ha 1 brackish water respectively for the two irrigation regimes table 4 the yield results were different in the two years both because the cultivars were different and mainly due to the negative effect on soil fertility of the solutes accumulated in plots irrigated with brackish water during the previous irrigation seasons the amount of salt brought to the soil with the irrigation water during the three irrigated seasons related to the three crops in succession of our study maize sunflower maize has been ranged in respect to irrigation regimes and salinity levels in particular between fresh and brackish water it varied from 6 54 to 28 42 mg ha 1 for the lowest seasonal irrigation volume irc75 and iri75 and from 8 99 to 59 36 mg ha 1 for the highest irrigation volume table 4 the salts supplied during irrigation have led to an increase in ece of the soil up to the highest values at the end of the irrigation seasons and the lowest values at the end of the rainy seasons table 5 most likely the addition of saline sodium leaching water to the shallow clay soil resting on cracked limestone rock favored the formation of transient salinity rengasamy 2002 responsible for soil ece increase at the end of the irrigation season subsequently removed with the rainwater falling during the winter it is interesting to note that autumn winter precipitation rates of 394 and 250 mm occurred respectively in the first and third year of crop rotation have leached salts supplied by irrigation reducing the ece of 68 and 39 when watered with fresh water and of 71 and 43 when irrigated with brackish water table 5 in both years no significant effects of saline treatments and irrigation regimes on seed germination and on seed emergence are highlighted such results are similar to those observed by maas et al 1983 which found a good germination and emergence of maize under saline conditions the analysis of variance showed significant effects both of the water salinity and of the irrigation regimes on some morphological and productive parameters of maize table 6 there were no significant effects of the interactions between salinity and irrigation systems the plant height in the first year was not influenced by salinity levels while in third year it varied on average from 2 59 to 1 97 m respectively in fresh and brackish water treatments fig 2 the average length of the ears was higher in third year than in the first one 20 5 cm vs 19 3 cm probably because of the different characteristics of cultivars used fig 3 in the first year the length of the fertile part of the spikes on average was higher in irc100 lr50 16 8 cm and irc100 lr100 16 7 cm treatments using fresh water in the third year on the other hand using brackish water the lowest values were recorded in irc75 when fresh water was used however no significant differences were observed between irrigation regimes table 6 water quality and irrigation regime did not affect the number of rows of kernels per ear this parameter is most influenced by genetic factors and not by agronomic techniques sadeghi and rahimi 2015 also kang et al 2010 did not find differences in the number of kernel rows per ear related to the water quality and irrigation regime according to other studies the number of kernels per row varied according to the length of the fertile part of the ear baghdadi et al 2012 sarlangue et al 2007 turgut et al 2005 table 6 echarte et al 2000 argued that increased maize plant density reduced the number of kernels in the rows in the first year the average amount of grain per ear on average was not affected by water quality whereas in the third year it was significantly higher when fresh water was used in respect to brackish water 228 vs 166 g ear 1 consequently in the first year the use of brackish water has shown low reduction in grain yield compared with fresh water treatment the reduction in grain yield due to the salinity was lower than that foreseen by the maas and hoffman 1977 equation for a ece value of 3 ds m 1 in fact the mass and hoffman s equation estimated a 16 reduction in maize grain yield while in our research the reduction was only 1 3 in the second crop cycle of maize grain yield on average ranged from 10 2 to 6 8 mg ha 1 respectively with fresh and brackish water fig 4 this was most likely due to the accumulation of solutes in the soil during the three irrigation seasons despite rainfall and leaching water requirement supply cucci et al 2016 although the use of brackish water for irrigation is traditionally based on the application of excess water leaching requirements in order to maintain low the salinity in the root zone to minimize yield loss caused by salinity ayers and westcot 1985 the increasing amount of water used also increases the salts added to the soil so the addition of more water does not necessarily correspond it optimal use amer 2010 russo and bakker 1987 moving from the less abundant irrigation regime irc75 to the more intense irc100 lr100 in the first year the quantity of grain per ear increased from 163 to 229 g and from 145 3 to 218 4 g whereas in the third year it increased from 195 8 to 269 1 g and from 144 6 to 204 4 g irrigating with fresh water and brackish water respectively table 6 as a result passing from the less abundant irrigation regime to the more intense one in first year grain yield increased by 34 8 and 33 8 and in the third year by 30 3 and 21 9 by irrigating with fresh and brackish water respectively table 6 in both years the yield obtained in iri75 did not deviate from that obtained in irc75 according to sadeghi and rahimi 2015 also ellsworth et al 1992 found in the maize plant the ability to deepen the roots in the soil to use the stored water reserve keeping a water content in the plant tissues high and stable 3 2 water use efficiency ywue for the different treatments is reported in fig 5 in the first year no difference was observed either between the irrigation regimes or between saline treatments with an average value of 1 67 kg m 3 instead in the third year higher values were observed under irrigation with fresh water 1 64 kg m 3 in comparison to brackish water supply 1 10 kg m 3 as a consequence of salt accumulation in the soil as observed also by irfan et al 2014 in maize anyway the highest value of ywue was recorded for irc100

areas dehghanisanij et al 2009 igbadun et al 2006 qureshi et al 2010 wang et al 2015 in first year iwue was not affected by treatments and averaged 2 34 kg m 3 in the third year instead the values were higher when the crop was irrigated with fresh water with respect to the brackish one on average 2 99 kg m 3 vs 2 01 kg m 3 3 3 maize grain quality in the first year no difference was observed in the composition of the kernels in respect to the quality of irrigation water table 7 in the third year instead by irrigating with brackish water the grain protein content increased by 6 9 and the moisture content decreased of 9 3 compared to the grain obtained by irrigating with fresh water this latter aspect could be an advantage as low humidity of grain maize makes it less susceptible to fungal pathogens with consequent reduction of mycotoxins contamination risk weinberg et al 2008 some authors have found that soluble proteins increase with salinity in many plants and decrease in others agastian et al 2000 parida et al 2004 goudarzi and pakniyat 2009 also reported that under saline conditions protein accumulation was generally higher in stress tolerant maize than susceptible ones in both years no significant effects of irrigation regimes and of the interaction between salinity level and irrigation regimes were observed on grain composition average values of grain moisture

characterized by an average annual rainfall of 450 500 mm within maize sunflower maize crop rotation on shallow 0 30 m clay loam soil irrigated by furrows with two salinity levels of irrigation water and five irrigation regimes of which two with contribution of leaching requirements lead to the several concluding remarks grain yield obtained in the first year was not influenced by salinity while declined by 34 in the third year of crop rotation when ece as average increased up to 7 4 ds m 1 for both irrigation water salinity levels the best production results were obtained by supplying 100 of etc brackish water increased grain protein content and reduced grain moisture content in second crop cycle of maize the rainfall that occurred during the three year trial period did not leach sufficiently the salts supplied by irrigation from which a different response of maize to salinity in the two years was achieved in both years there were no changes in grain composition related to watering regimes while significant effects of interactions between salinity level and irrigation regime were observed contrary to the literature the supply of more water as leaching requirement did not reduce the soil salinity and the harmful effect of salinity on maize yield because of more salts supplied by a greater irrigation volume therefore in the irrigation management with brackish water to avoid the excessive soil salt accumulation or the consumption of too much water it is necessary to take into consideration soil water holding characteristics and related climate conditions and to regularity monitor soil chemical properties 
10951,maize is a crop with high irrigation needs in italy in many cultivated areas of the world the water used for irrigation has a high salinity to limit the damage caused by the salts provided by irrigation suitable irrigation strategies can be adopted in relation to the crop soil characteristics and rainfall regime therefore in order to evaluate the most appropriate irrigation strategy to be used in the cultivation of maize on a clay loam red soil subject to salinity a research on a four year crop rotation was carried out in southern italy maize grain yield and yield characteristics irrigated by furrow with two water salinity levels and five different irrigation regimes were compared grain yield was reduced by 34 in the third crop rotation year when the soil salinity on average raised from 3 8 to 7 4 ds m 1 higher yield occurred restoring 100 of maximum crop evapotranspiration instead of leaching requirement application which did not affect yield soil salinity improved grain protein content and reduced grain moisture content rainfall was not sufficient to leach all salts supplied by irrigation the leaching requirements did not reduce the soil salinity and the harmful effect of salinity on maize yield because of more salts supplied by higher irrigation volumes keywords maize yield brackish water furrow irrigation wue 1 introduction irrigation is a very important agronomic practice in agriculture today the accelerated growth of urbanization industry and activities performed during leisure time compete for good water quality and this is leading to the reduction of disponibility of good quality water for irrigation bergez and nolleau 2003 qadir and oster 2004 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 so an alternative could be the use of large salt water resources in the world mantell et al 1985 maize zea mays l is classified a crop moderately sensitive to salinity flagella et al 2002 it is one of the world s leading crops because of its excellent starch composition that is becoming a major raw material for the food textiles paper and feed industry fan et al 2008 kang et al 2010 tian et al 2009 most studies on this crop have shown that salinity is one of the main causes of plant stress acosta motos et al 2017 the intraspecific variability of corn to salinity is high schubert et al 2009 the resistance to salinity can be improved by implementing strategies to avoid sodium toxicity in the second stage of the crop cycle and to overcome osmotic problems in the first stage of saline stress in general maize in salinity conditions shows stunted growth during the first phase with dark green leaves but without symptoms of toxicity farooq et al 2015 it is feasible to use salt water for irrigation but only for particular crops and soils and with appropriate water management oster 1994 dong et al 2018 drip irrigation with its low release volume and frequent applications can maintain a high matrix potential of the soil in the root zone and thus offset the decrease in osmotic potential caused by saline water while maintaining high total water potential for plant growth kang et al 2010 wan et al 2007 studied the effects of drip irrigation with saline water on tomato licopersicum esculeuntum mill and pointed out that the variation of the electrical conductivity of water ecw from 1 1 to 4 9 ds m 1 has little effect on yield but the water use efficiency increases with the increase in water salinity besides the salinity of the soil along the 0 0 90 m profile did not increase after three years of irrigation several studies have been carried out on the application of different irrigation practices to maize crops in respect to salinity schneekloth et al 2006 found that reducing water supply during vegetative growth has little effect on yield significant yield reductions can be attributed to water shortages during the reproduction phases schneekloth et al 1991 çakir 2004 aguilar et al 2007 abdelraouf and ragab 2018 it is well known that furrow irrigation is a less efficient method of irrigation respect to a pivot system but the irregular form of some fields prevents the use of the latter method so if the soil is clayey furrow irrigation may be an alternative method jiru and van ranst 2010 nelson and al kaisi 2011 chen and feng 2013 compared to the border irrigation methods furrow irrigation can improve water use efficiency wu et al 2015 in this case deep percolation occurs primarily below the furrows saggu and kaushal 1991 and salts accumulate in the surface soil layers below the ridges furrow is an irrigation method with low irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity specific practices that have been shown to increase irrigation efficiencies include the adoption of shorter furrow lengths better timing of irrigation cut off selection of appropriate water application rates and narrow furrow shapes kang et al 2000 ampas and baltas 2009 as a strategy for improving irrigation efficiency sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 1997 golzardi et al 2017 dong et al 2018 and yarami and sepaskhah 2018 have used an every other furrow irrigation method for reducing the amount of water applied they have found that this method of irrigation decreases the evaporation of water from the surface of the soil and allows the soil to retain more water after a rainy event other studies have shown a reduction in both water leakage for deep percolation sepaskhah and parand 2006 dong et al 2016 and nitrate leaching lehrsch et al 2000 with an irrigation with every other furrow with respect to the single furrow method in order to make a further contribution to this problem the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of two irrigation water salinity levels and different irrigation regimes on maize grown on a shallow clay loam soil formed on limestone rock irrigated by furrow method in southern italy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic conditions the research was carried out at the

for the rest of the growing season table 4 a split plot experimental design with four replicates was used the quality water types fresh and brackish were assigned to the main plots and the five irrigation regimes to the sub plots of 5 x 4 9 m irrigation was performed whenever in the treatment irc100 the soil water matrix potential of the layer explored by roots reached 0 1 mpa 240 g kg 1

maize seeds of two commercial hybrids f1 class fao 400 pr35a52 and dkc5143 in the first and third year of the crop rotation respectively were sowed on april 28 and 26 in the 1st and 3rd year respectively on previously fertilized soil with 75 kg ha 1 of n and 150 kg ha 1 of p205 a different maize hybrid was used in the second crop cycle third year of the crop rotation because seeds of pr35a52 were not available the sowing was performed in rows 70 cm apart and at 25 cm distance along the rows at the beginning of the second crop cycle of maize the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract ece was on average 1 2 and 3 1 ds m 1 for the previously watered soils with fresh water and brackish water respectively in both years chemical weeding was carried out while during the crop cycle pest control was performed against slugs and pyralide 2 3 plant materials and measurements at end of the rainfall march and irrigation seasons september soil salinity was measured by taking soil samples in each plot through a cylindrical probe 2 5 cm as described cucci et al 2016 the main morphological plant height ear length and productive parameters kernel per row yield ear weight of 1000 kernel yield were measured at harvest september 15 and 14 in the 1st and 3rd year respectively the grain moisture content at threshing was determined in the laboratory after drying for 48 h at 65 c yield was expressed at 13 5 of moisture the yield water use efficiency ywue of maize was calculated as follows wang et al 2011 2 y w u e k g m 3 y e t a where y is the marketable grain yield kg ha 1 eta m3 ha 1 is the total actual evapotranspiration water consumption over the maize growing season calculated using the simplified soil water balance equation as follows dong et al 2018 3 e t a p i δ w where p is the precipitation during the maize growing period i is the irrigation amount δw m3 ha 1 is the soil water content at sowing minus the soil water content at harvesting for the rooting zone depth the surface runoff and vertical water exchange have been neglected due to the low rainfall events occurred during the crop cycle that did not caused either runoff or deep percolation in the treatments in which the lr was foreseen it was assumed that the leaching fraction was lost by deep percolation irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated as the ratio between marketable yield and seasonal irrigation volume 4 i w u e y i where y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 i is seasonal irrigation volume m3 ha 1 wang et al 2015 ali et al 2018 kernel protein fat and starch content were determined by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy nirs using infratec 1241 grain analyzer foss tecator sweden and expressed as percentage dry matter of grain 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova and the differences between means were analyzed following the duncan test data were analysed with sas software using the glm procedure sas institute 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation regimes and salinity levels the seasonal irrigation volumes applied during the two maize crop cycles amounted to 2275 and 3024 m3 ha 1 in the first year and to 3135 and 3976 m3 ha 1 in the third year of crop rotation respectively in irc75 and irc100 treatments the same irrigation volumes were applied in both salinity treatments in irc100 lr50 and irc100 lr100 treatments the seasonal irrigation volume was different between salinity levels in fact in the first year the values of this parameter were equal to 3174 and 3330 m3 ha 1 fresh water and to 4038 and 5050 m3 ha 1 brackish water respectively in irc100 lr50 and irc100 lr100 in the third year on the other hand they amounted to 4142 and 4300 m3 ha 1 fresh water and 5091 and 6200 m3 ha 1 brackish water respectively for the two irrigation regimes table 4 the yield results were different in the two years both because the cultivars were different and mainly due to the negative effect on soil fertility of the solutes accumulated in plots irrigated with brackish water during the previous irrigation seasons the amount of salt brought to the soil with the irrigation water during the three irrigated seasons related to the three crops in succession of our study maize sunflower maize has been ranged in respect to irrigation regimes and salinity levels in particular between fresh and brackish water it varied from 6 54 to 28 42 mg ha 1 for the lowest seasonal irrigation volume irc75 and iri75 and from 8 99 to 59 36 mg ha 1 for the highest irrigation volume table 4 the salts supplied during irrigation have led to an increase in ece of the soil up to the highest values at the end of the irrigation seasons and the lowest values at the end of the rainy seasons table 5 most likely the addition of saline sodium leaching water to the shallow clay soil resting on cracked limestone rock favored the formation of transient salinity rengasamy 2002 responsible for soil ece increase at the end of the irrigation season subsequently removed with the rainwater falling during the winter it is interesting to note that autumn winter precipitation rates of 394 and 250 mm occurred respectively in the first and third year of crop rotation have leached salts supplied by irrigation reducing the ece of 68 and 39 when watered with fresh water and of 71 and 43 when irrigated with brackish water table 5 in both years no significant effects of saline treatments and irrigation regimes on seed germination and on seed emergence are highlighted such results are similar to those observed by maas et al 1983 which found a good germination and emergence of maize under saline conditions the analysis of variance showed significant effects both of the water salinity and of the irrigation regimes on some morphological and productive parameters of maize table 6 there were no significant effects of the interactions between salinity and irrigation systems the plant height in the first year was not influenced by salinity levels while in third year it varied on average from 2 59 to 1 97 m respectively in fresh and brackish water treatments fig 2 the average length of the ears was higher in third year than in the first one 20 5 cm vs 19 3 cm probably because of the different characteristics of cultivars used fig 3 in the first year the length of the fertile part of the spikes on average was higher in irc100 lr50 16 8 cm and irc100 lr100 16 7 cm treatments using fresh water in the third year on the other hand using brackish water the lowest values were recorded in irc75 when fresh water was used however no significant differences were observed between irrigation regimes table 6 water quality and irrigation regime did not affect the number of rows of kernels per ear this parameter is most influenced by genetic factors and not by agronomic techniques sadeghi and rahimi 2015 also kang et al 2010 did not find differences in the number of kernel rows per ear related to the water quality and irrigation regime according to other studies the number of kernels per row varied according to the length of the fertile part of the ear baghdadi et al 2012 sarlangue et al 2007 turgut et al 2005 table 6 echarte et al 2000 argued that increased maize plant density reduced the number of kernels in the rows in the first year the average amount of grain per ear on average was not affected by water quality whereas in the third year it was significantly higher when fresh water was used in respect to brackish water 228 vs 166 g ear 1 consequently in the first year the use of brackish water has shown low reduction in grain yield compared with fresh water treatment the reduction in grain yield due to the salinity was lower than that

10952,most research on drought assessment adopted historical in situ observations however there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years this study utilizes the two sources of data in drought assessment using the historical in situ observations the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought were firstly investigated by calculating the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at 1 3 6 month time scales in northeast china using remote sensing data the combined deficit index cdi for agricultural drought assessment was computed based on tri monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly ndvi at land cover type and sub type levels in the same region in the end the agricultural drought calculated by the cdi was evaluated against the deficit in crop yield as well as deficit in land surface temperature lst and evapotranspiration et in order to verify the applicability of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment in the study region the results showed that the cdi has better correlations with the spei r2 0 48 than the spi r2 0 05 at 3 month scales with weight factor a 0 5 in dry farming areas the spatial pattern of the cdi showed that the area of agricultural drought increased from july to october in addition a significant linear correlation was found between the cdi and anomaly in annual agricultural yield r2 0 55 and anomaly in monthly land surface temperature r2 0 42 the results prove that the cdi calculated by remote sensing data is not only a reliable indicator for agricultural drought assessment in northeast china but also provides useful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention and mitigation and water management improvement keywords agricultural drought cdi spi spei remote sensing northeast china 1 introduction drought is a quickly increasing risk that can lead to hardly repairable or unrepairable damages to our nature as well as socio economy ozelkan et al 2016 especially for arid and semi arid regions severe droughts have a great influence on millions of people each year which pose a long term threat to human livelihoods and result in huge economic loss below et al 2007 found that more than 50 of all deaths associated with natural hazards in the world were caused by drought related famine keshavarz et al 2013 addressed that 33 of the damages around the world was contributed by drought in 2009 less precipitation led to severe agricultural drought and 53 million food insecure people in sub saharan africa husak et al 2013 drought severity or magnitude can be illustrated by drought indices steinemann 2003 numerous indices have been developed for identifying the characteristic of meteorological droughts over the past decades the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are common meteorological drought indices shahabfar and eitzinger 2013 used six meteorological drought indices to evaluate and compare the spatial and temporal dynamics of drought in six climatic regions in iran liu et al 2013 employed the pdsi for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of dryness conditions across qinghai province in northwest china rayne and forest 2016 found that there was a substantial increase in drought variability at short time scales based on the pdsi in the united states since 1895 though the pdsi has several shortcomings because of its simplicity wells et al 2004 yu et al 2013 calculated a composite index ci in yunnan province of china during 1950 2010 and found that the spatial pattern of drought showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast while drought decreased from southeast to southwest the spi is widely applied to characterize the dryness wetness conditions and has been reported by an increasing number of publications because of its good performance compared to other drought indicators asadi zarch et al 2015 belayneh et al 2014 sierra soler et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 zuo et al 2018 chen and sun 2015 found that droughts calculated based on the spei were becoming more frequent and severe across china especially in the regions of northern china since the late 1990s agricultural drought assessment is mainly with the aid of monitoring soil water balance and subsequent deficit in the event of a drought crop specific drought index csdi meyer et al 1993 soil moisture deficit index smdi evapotranspiration deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and agricultural drought index dtx matera et al 2007 are typical in situ observation based agricultural drought indices remote sensing based vegetation indices such as vegetation health index vhi van hoolst et al 2016 enhanced vegetation index evi liu and huete 1995 as well as vegetation condition index vci kogan 1990 are also widely used to assess drought condition by monitoring vegetation state china is a vital food production country around the world accounting for 20 of global cereal production in 2011 fao 2014 however the area of farmland with 21 56 million ha accounting for about 16 of the total crop land in china are frequently affected by drought xie et al 2014 northeast china comprising three provinces of heilongjiang jilin and liaoning is a vital food production base of china a significant warming and drying trend has been detected in northeast china since the 1950s guo et al 2017 a number of droughts occurred in the 2000s across northeast china especially for prolonged drought events sheffield et al 2012 the drought induced absolute grain loss is in the range of 200 450 104 t yr in northeast china zhang et al 2015 zuo et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to investigating the causes and occurrence of drought in northeast china especially for agricultural drought several meteorological droughts related issues have been discussed in the study area during the past few years li et al 2009 found that northeast china demonstrated a significant decreasing trend in moisture availability based on the pdsi zhang et al 2013 used precipitation extreme indices to detect a drying tendency in northern china wang et al 2015a analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in northeast china transect nect during the period 1950 2012 using the mann kendall test and theil sen s slope estimator and found that a significant negative trend mostly occurred in the eastern part of the nect however a comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural drought in northeast china is still lacking most research on drought assessment adopted historical in situ observations however there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years as we all know the major shortcoming of the in situ observation data is that it cannot be effectively used to monitor and assess the drought events over a large area however remote sensing approach provide a better solution for monitoring drought conditions over a large scale at early stages because of its wide coverage high spatial resolution easy access and relatively lower expense dorjsuren et al 2016 the calculation of the spei and spi are based on meteorological variables which are often defined as meteorological indices to assess meteorological drought although the meteorological indices can reflect the characteristics of drought to some extent the agricultural drought often has a lag of 3 6 months after meteorological drought mishra and singh 2011 therefore an agricultural drought index is needed to assess the agricultural drought conditions in northeast china in this study we develop a combined deficit index cdi for agricultural drought assessment which was computed based on tri monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly ndvi at land cover type and sub type levels using the remote sensing data the meteorological and agricultural droughts in northeast china were assessed with the spi spei and cdi respectively the main objectives are as follows 1 to identify the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought estimated by using the spi and spei with historical in situ observations 2 to assess the agricultural drought calculated by the cdi based on ndvi and precipitation with remote sensing data 3 to evaluate the cdi against agricultural yield data as well as other drought related remote sensing data lst and et analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern of meteorological and agricultural droughts could provide a better understanding of drought characteristics in northeast china the results and experiences obtained in this study could also be extended to other similar arid and semi arid regions in china as well as other countries 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the study

west to east liu et al 2016a the long winter and cool summer in northeast china leads to short thermal growing season that only allows single cropping wheat soybean and maize are primary and large scale cultivated crops in this region the total maize growing area in the study area is about 6 million hectares taking up more than one fourth of the total maize growing area in china and the average yield is about 5000 kg ha wang et al 2014a 2 2 data description drought frequently occurs in crop growth season across northern china liu et al 2016b in this study the period from april to october is

distribution of the 69 meteorological stations adopted in this study are shown in fig 1 2 2 2 rainfall raster data rainfall data used in most studies were originally collected from station gauging measurements recently more and more researches have applied rainfall data estimates based on raster data which well reflects the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall over a large scale region and is closer to the actual rainfall condition in this study the rainfall raster data is provided by the cold and arid region of science data center of china covering the growing season from april to september during the period 2000 2010 this dataset is available at the interval of every three hours and has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 the rainfall raster data was synthesized into monthly

projection of the rainfall raster data 2 2 4 land cover data the land cover data is provided by the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure which is divided into primary land cover types and secondary land cover types the dataset includes six primary land cover types i e farmland grassland forest settlement wetland and desert and twenty fifty secondary land cover types for example evergreen conifer forest meadow grassland paddy field and dry land the land cover dataset in 2005 adopted in this study has a spatial resolution of 100 100 m 2 2 5 crop yield and crop failure data the crop yield data is provided by the china statistical yearbook during the period 2006 2010 in northeast china national bureau of statistics in china 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 wheat corn and rice are the primary crop types the unit of crop production is measured as ton in this study the data of crop failure during the period 2006 2010 is acquired from the ministry of water resources of china the statistics of the dataset contain annual loss caused by flood and drought 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi based on the probability distribution of long term time series of precipitation the standardized precipitation index spi was proposed by mckee et al 1993 as a meteorological drought index the procedure of the spi calculation is described as follows an incomplete gamma probability density function is firstly fitted to a given frequency distribution of precipitation series 1 g x 1 β α γ a x α 1 e x β x 0 where α is a parameter about shape β is a parameter about scale x is the amount of precipitation and the gamma function is presented as 2 γ α 0 x α 1 e x d x the best values of α and β are estimated by the maximum likelihood method thom 1966 3 α ˆ 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 4 β ˆ x α ˆ 5 a ln x ln x n where n is the number of precipitation series the cumulative probability for a given month then can be obtained by the following equation 6 g x 0 x g x d x 1 β ˆ α ˆ γ α ˆ 0 x x α ˆ 1 e x β ˆ d x the spi can be calculated as follows 7 spi s t c 2 t c 1 0 c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 8 t ln 1 g x 2 where x is the amount of precipitation when g x 0 5 s 1 when g x 0 5 s 1 c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 the spi values are symmetrical and can be used for identifying both drought and wetness conditions classification of drought calculated by the spi are defined and listed in table 1 spi can be estimated for observed precipitation records over any time scales such as three six or even more months take the time scale of three months for instance the spi value in the month in question is estimated based on the cumulative probability of precipitation in three months current and the previous two months 3 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei calculation follows the below three procedures 1 the following equation calculates potential evapotranspiration pet thornthwaite 1948 9 p e t 16 k 10 t i m 10 i i 1 12 t 5 1 514 where k is a coefficient calculated by latitude and month t is average air temperature for each month c i is the sum of monthly heat index within a year and m is a coefficient calculated by i m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 79 10 2 i 0 492 2 for a given month i the difference between precipitation p and pet represents surplus or deficit accumulation of water balance which can be derived from the following equation 11 d i p i p e t i x i j k is the difference between p and pet in month j year i at time scale k for instance the accumulated difference in month l year i at 12 month time scale can be calculated as x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i l if j k and 12 x i j k l j k 1 j d i j if j k where d i l means the difference between p and pet in month l year i 3 in order to estimate the value of spei the difference of the water balance is normalized as a log logistic probability distribution the following equation expresses the probability density function 13 f x β α x γ α 1 x γ α 2 where parameters α β and γ represent scale shape and origin respectively therefore the probability distribution function can be expressed as 14 f x 1 α x γ β 1 the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 can be calculated as the standardized f x with the approximation of 15 s p e i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w is calculated as w 2 ln p when p 0 5 p 1 f x represents the probability of exceeding d when p 0 5 the value of spei will be reversed while p will be replaced by 1 p c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 020328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 table 2 is the categorization of drought wet classified by the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 3 3 combined deficit index cdi agricultural drought occurs when crop vigor is below normal due to prolonged soil moisture deficit in the root zone caused by rainfall deficit from normal vyas et al 2015 it indicated that agricultural drought was characterized by a 3 month scale potop et al 2015 wu et al 2016 also it showed that ndvi does not respond immediately after rainfall the time lag in arid and semiarid areas however is approximately 1 month chandrasekar et al 2006 wu et al 2015 therefore two remote sensing products ndvi and rainfall rain were adopted in this study representing vegetation vigor and major water supply to soil in growing season respectively the procedure of the cdi calculation as follows vyas et al 2015 1 the percent deficits of monthly ndvi composite n d v i d and the percent deficits of the sum of antecedent tri monthly rain r a i n d from their mean values of the normal years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 are used to define the cdi the equation of the cdi calculation as follows 16 cdi α rain d 1 α ndvi d where α is the weight of the percent deficit of the sum of rainfall in preceding three months and 1 α is the weight of the percent deficit of monthly ndvi in this study a ranking method drobne and lisec 2009 is used for identifying the weight to the respective parameters 2 the monthly ndvi data from modis 13a3 are extracted from april to october the calculation of the percent deficit of ndvi n d v i d as follows 17 n d v i d n d v i n n d v i c n d v i n 100 where n d v i c and n d v i n are mean monthly ndvi from current and normal years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 respectively 3 three hour rainfall raster data are adopted to estimate monthly rainfall data from april to september tri monthly rainfall sliding sums of april may june amj may june july mjj june july august jja and july august september jas are further computed based on the monthly rainfall data moreover mean values of the tri monthly rainfall sums are computed for amj mjj jja and jas for the normal years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 and drought year 2009 the percent deficit of antecedent tri monthly rainfall r a i n d is computed using the following expression 18 r a i n d r a i n n r a i n c r a i n n 100 where r a i n n and r a i n c are mean tri monthly antecedent rainfall sums in normal years and current year respectively table 3 shows the categorization of drought classified by the cdi vyas et al 2015 and the flow chart of the calculation of the cdi is described in fig 2 4 results and analysis 4 1 spatiotemporal variation of meteorological drought the spi is the most widely used index for drought assessment tan et al 2015 which uses only precipitation data and can be obtained for flexible time scales furthermore vicente serrano et al 2010 developed the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which has not only the simplicity of estimation and the multiple time scales of the spi but also the sensitivity to changes in evaporation of the pdsi and the spei is considered to have great promise as a drought index for drought assessment stagge et al 2015 drought at different time scales is relevant for meteorological 1 month agricultural 3 6 month hydrological 12 month and socioeconomic 24 month impacts potop et al 2013 therefore the spi spei values at 1 3 and 6 month scales were used in this study to explore the variation of drought in northeast china 4 1 1 spatiotemporal variations of the spi at various time scales in order to firstly investigate the percentage of drought and wet occurrences at a long term scale the frequencies of the spi values at 1 3 and 6 months were calculated at each station during 1960 2009 in the study area fig 3 the percentage of extreme drought decreased with the increase of the spi time scales in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s while the maximum percentage of extreme drought was 2 54 at 3 month in the 1960s and the minimum percentage of extreme drought was 2 62 at 3 month in the 2000s in addition the percentage of severe drought increased and then decreased with the increase of the spi time scales in the 1960s 1980s and 1990s however the percentage of severe drought increased with the increase of the time scales in the 1970s and 2000s furthermore the percentage of moderate drought increased and then decreased with the increase of the spi time scales in all decades except 2000s in the 2000s the percentage of moderate drought increased with the increase of time scales the spatial distribution of seasonal drought frequency in northeast china is shown in fig 4 during 1960 2014 the frequency of spring drought decreased as the time scale increased the frequency of spring drought occurrence was between 10 and 20 and the frequency of spring drought in the western part of northeast china was lower than that in the eastern region as the time scale increased lower drought occurrence frequency and large affected area were found in the summer at 3 month scale in the northwest corner of heilongjiang and at 6 month scale in the middle of heilongjiang the drought frequencies reached at 20 or above the frequency of drought in autumn was relatively large at 3 month time scale the frequency of drought in almost the entire study area was between 15 and 20 the frequency of drought in winter was relatively lower at 1 month time scale lower wetting frequency occurred in western liaoning 4 1 2 spatiotemporal variations of the spei at various time scales the inter annual variation of the spei values at 1 3 and 6 months time scale during the period 1960 2014 are given in fig 5 drought and flood events have alternated during the past 55 years in which drought events were characterized with low frequency low intensity and short duration before 2000 however the intensity of drought was relatively high during the periods 2000 2002 and 2007 2009 the spatial distribution of drought frequency at various time scales in northeast china fig 6 during 1960 2014 clearly shows that the scope of extreme drought had gradually expanded with the increase of time scale especially for the west part of northeast china the area affected by severe drought also enlarged with the increase of time scale especially for the northern part and southwest corner of the study area the frequency of moderate drought was generally higher than that of extreme and severe drought and the frequency of drought at 1 month scale was larger than 6 month scale and 3 month scale generally speaking both of the spi and spei detected a similar significant drying trend in northeast china during the period 1960 2014 especially after 2000 moreover the drought frequency and intensity of spei were generally higher than those of spi it s probably because that the spei takes both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet into account in determining drought thus unlike the spi the spei captures the main impact of increased temperatures on water demand 4 2 evaluation of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment the combined deficit index cdi is adopted in this study to assess the agricultural drought condition in northeast china using the ranking method to list all the possibilities of weight combinations then the best optimal weight combination was obtained by comparing and analyzing the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and two drought indices based on the primary land cover type of farmland and sub type of dry land in this section 4 2 1 identification of drought year according to the consistency and availability of various types of data adopted in this study the period 2006 2010 was selected for agricultural drought assessment the identified drought year was illustrated in fig 7 based on annual precipitation series at 69 meteorological stations and crop failure area of the study area during the period 2006 2010 it can be concluded that precipitation slightly decreased from 2006 to 2009 and then reached at the maximum value in 2010 the lowest annual rainfall with 374 6 mm was found in 2009 while the maximum value was 588 1 mm in 2010 in northeast china on the other hand it has been suffered from drought disaster every year among the period 2006 2010 while the area of crop failure in 2009 was 1 20 106 hectares which was the largest value during the period 2006 2010 considering the above mentioned drought condition the year of 2009 is preliminarily identified as the relative drought year during the period 2006 2010 for the following assessment of spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural drought based on the cdi in northeast china and the other years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 were identified as the normal years 4 2 2 evaluation of the cdi under farmland the land cover of northeast china can be categorized into six primary types such as farmland grassland forest settlement wetland and desert among the six primary land cover types farmland is the main land cover types related to agricultural production which was involved in the cdi estimation for agricultural drought assessment over northeast china table 4 lists the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and the other two meteorological drought indices spi and spei in the drought year 2009 it is clearly showed that the coefficient of determination r2 obtained by the spei were almost all higher than the spi the maximum values of r2 were found to be 0 10 and 0 09 for the spi while 0 28 and 0 16 for the spei at time scales of 3 and 6 months respectively as the weight factor of rainfall increased the r2 calculated for the spi and spei firstly increased and then decreased however different turning points existed at different time scales for the spi when the weight factors of rainfall were between 0 1 and 0 7 the r2 at 3 months scale obtained the greatest value followed by 6 months while the weight factors of rainfall were between 0 8 and 0 9 the correlation coefficients at 6 months scales reached at the greatest value followed by 3 months for the spei for all the weight factors of rainfall the r2 at 3 months scales were greater than that at 6 months the land cover type of farmland contains three sub types i e dry land paddy field and irrigable land numerous irrigation and water conservancy projects in northeast china were developed for protecting food security in paddy and irrigable land therefore the sub type of land cover i e dry land is more suitable for agricultural drought assessment under natural climate condition 4 2 3 evaluation of the cdi under dry land the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and the other two meteorological drought indices spi and spei at different time scales under land cover sub type of dry land in the drought year 2009 are summarized in table 5 as the weight factor of rainfall increased almost all the coefficient of determination r2 initially increased and then decreased for the spi and spei for the spi the r2 at 3 and 6 month scales had very low values for the spei for all the weight factors of rainfall the r2 at 3 months scales were greater than that at 6 months according to the abovementioned results it can be concluded that the combination of weights with a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 for rainfall and ndvi deficits tends to produce the highest correlation coefficient for most of the cases which can be adopted for further agricultural drought assessment by the cdi in this study 4 3 agricultural drought assessment based on the cdi the weight factor combination a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 was used for exploring the spatial pattern of agricultural drought based on the cdi the spatial patterns of cdi in drought year 2009 are shown in fig 8 drought had occurred in almost all areas of northeast china especially for moderate and mild drought southwestern and southern heilongjiang province and southwestern region of liaoning province suffered from severe drought the spatial patterns of the cdi in growing season i e july august september and october of 2009 in northeast china are shown in fig 9 respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that only northeastern region of the study area showed mild drought and moderate drought in july in august southwestern liaoning province and southwestern jilin province showed mild drought in contrast to july and august the area of mild drought in september gradually increased in southwestern jilin province and expanded in western and eastern liaoning province the areas of mild drought in october swept over almost the whole jilin and liaoning province while the southwestern liaoning province and southwestern jilin province experienced moderate drought 4 4 verification of the applicability of the cdi in order to verify the applicability of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment the average cdi during the growing season of drought year 2009 was compared with percent deficit agricultural yield dcy in the region with the land cover type of dry land table 6 when a 0 7 1 a 0 3 the r2 reaches the maximum value r2 0 56 p 0 01 when a 0 5 1 a 0 5 the r2 reaches the second maximum value r2 0 55 p 0 01 however the two r2 values are not much different and the gap could almost be ignored considering the r2 with the meteorological drought indices previous it still can be concluded that the combination of weights with a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 for rainfall and ndvi deficits which can be adopted for further agricultural drought assessment by the cdi in this study scatter diagram of the cdi and dcy at a 0 5 in 2009 are shown in fig 10 the correlation between the cdi and dcy was detected with r2 value of 0 55 when the cdi reaches at the maximum value of 69 2 the dcy reaches a maximum value of 45 7 which indicates that the region has experienced severe drought and the crop yield in this region nearly half less than normal years the result showed that the cdi had a promising potential for quantifying the agricultural yield reduction caused by agricultural drought in northeast china the points above the horizontal axis in fig 10 mostly fell within the cdi range below 25 representing no occurrence of agricultural drought happened the data points showed that there was a distinct difference in the response of agricultural yield deficit to the same range of the cdi value across different regions 5 discussion in order to better show the impact of cumulative rainfall on crop yield table 7 showed the coefficient of determination r2 between the combined deficit index cdi and percent deficit agricultural yield dcy at different time scales across land cover sub type of dry land region in 2009 cdi1 means that 1 month time scale was adopted in the calculation of rainfall using the mean value of rainfall from april to september respectively cdi2 indicates the mean of bi monthly sliding sums of rainfall for april and may am may and june mj june and july jj july and august ja august and september as cdi3 shows the mean of tri month sliding sums of rainfall for april may june amj may june july mjj june july august jja july august september jas among the three time scales the r2 of cdi3 was found to show higher value 0 55 as compared to lower values of r2 for cdi2 0 44 and cdi1 0 26 this result verified that the cdi at time scale of 3 months i e cdi3 is capable of characterizing the drought severity in the northeast china the reports of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc revealed that the globally warm days and nights would increase in the whole 21 st century field et al 2012 that means that more drought events caused by increasing evapotranspiration will follow the higher temperature in the future sheffield et al 2012 agricultural drought condition has a close relationship with land surface features therefore the cdi was also compared with other related remote sensing data lst and et in the discussion section in order to further evaluate the applicability of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment in northeast china lst is a good indicator of the energy balance at the earth s surface which is one of the key parameters in the physics of land surface processes on regional and global scales lst is also an indicator that provides information on the condition of the surface soil moisture content which is the key supply of crop growth sayago et al 2017 to further verify the rationality of the cdi developed in this study the calculated average cdi across northeast china were firstly performed correlation analysis with percent deficit of monthly lst dlst in 2009 which is shown in fig 11 the average cdi showed a good relationship with the dlst under the land cover type of dry land when the cdi reaches at the maximum value of 69 2 the dlst reaches at a maximum value of 4 6 which indicates that the region has experienced severe drought and the lst in this region in 2009 is 4 6 less than that of normal years the coefficient of determination r2 reached to 0 42 for the 13 stations located in dry land which indicated that the cdi has a good capability for agricultural drought assessment under the land cover type of dry land agricultural production is closely related to crop evapotranspiration which is usually monitored by the water balance of the whole crop growing cycle wang et al 2014a therefore a drought index which closely describes temporal and spatial variations of crop water use status is suitable for drought monitoring et reflects atmospheric moisture demand and thus affects water availability on land surfaces and could then significantly affect the duration severity and spatial extent of drought dai 2011 evapotranspiration was also used to analysis drought severity combined with ndvi in north china zhang et al 2016 which illustrates that evapotranspiration is a representative variable for agricultural drought assessment to further verify the rationality of the cdi developed in this study the calculated average cdi across northeast china were then performed correlation analysis with percent deficit of monthly et det in 2009 which is shown in fig 12 when the cdi reaches at the maximum value of 69 2 the det reaches at a maximum value of 45 8 which indicates that the region has experienced severe drought and the et in this region is nearly half less than that of normal years the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and det under the land cover type of dry land was relatively lower than dlst which indicates that agricultural drought in the study area is more sensitive to land surface temperature than evapotranspiration some previous studies on agricultural drought monitoring and assessment were mainly based on data from gauging stations quiring and papakryiakou 2003 bonaccorso et al 2003 wang et al 2014b although it could well reflect the agricultural drought conditions around the gauging stations the distribution and density of the gauging stations are insufficient for the detection of spatial heterogeneity information required however satellite based remote sensing data can overcome these shortcomings of gauging station observation which can be used for consistently and continuously agricultural drought monitoring and assessment in space zhang and jia 2013 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the first and the most frequently used remote sensing based product for monitoring agricultural drought tucker 1989 gu et al 2007 liu and qin 2007 wang et al 2015a b ndvi can be used to separate vegetation from soil background and provide a measure of general vegetation health which has directly impact on agricultural drought condition karnieli et al 2010 ma et al 2001 found r2 values ranged from 0 44 to 0 80 between soybean yield and ndvi at field scale in canada lopresti mariano et al 2015 found that the coefficient of determination r2 between ndvi and crop yield presented by simple regression were from 0 16 to 0 52 under different lag times furthermore a great many of indices based on ndvi were proposed for drought assessment dutta et al 2015 showed that vci had a good relationship with rain fed crop yield r2 0 55 which proved that the vci is suitable for identifying drought related water stress in crops li et al 2014 shown that the coefficient of determination r2 between the standardized precipitation index spi the crop moisture index cmi the normalized difference vegetation index anomaly ndvia and crop yield were 0 538 0 602 and 0 205 respectively from may to september during 2000 2010 in hailar county based on multi dekad average of indices rhee et al 2010 proved that the scaled drought condition index sdci which combined the land surface temperature lst the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm has a well r2 value with crop yield under arid and humid area with different trmm time scales such as the r2 between the sdci and corn in july in arid area used trmm 12 was 0 64 numerous studies have suggested that a combination of land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index could provide valuable information on vegetation stress and moisture conditions on land surface sandholt et al 2002 suggested an index called the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi based on an interpretation of the simplified ndvi ts space to assess surface moisture status then lots of studies have employed this index for drought monitoring holzman et al 2014 showed that tvdi data can be used effectively to predict crop yield on the argentine pampas and depending on the agro climatic zone r2 values ranged from 0 68 to 0 79 for soybean crop and 0 76 to 0 81 for wheat this study shows that the cdi which integrates meteorological variables and remote sensing information is an effective agricultural drought assessment index because northeast china is mainly rain fed agriculture the amount of rainfall plays a vital role in crop yield combing rainfall with ndvi products can better reflect the impact of rainfall on agricultural drought in regional scale the rainfall data used in this study has a spatial resolution of 0 1 which can better analyze the spatial characteristics of drought the results obtained in this study could provide valuable information for agricultural water resources management and drought prevention and mitigation in northeast china although the cdi has been successfully used for agricultural drought assessment in this study there are still many works to do for its improvement further research is also needed to assess the possibility of taking other agricultural drought influencing factors such as lst and et as the input variables of the cdi for better performance 6 conclusion in this study the meteorological and agricultural droughts in northeast china were assessed with the spi spei and cdi respectively the results of agricultural drought assessment were then verified by crop yield data as well as the remote sensing data lst and et the main conclusions are listed as follows 1 by computing correlation coefficients between the cdi and the spi as well as the spei under land cover type of farmland and land cover sub type of dry land it was found that the r2 values under dry land showed a better performance the weight factor combination with a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 for rainfall and ndvi deficits produced the greatest r value for most cases and the correlation coefficients were statistically significant at p 0 01 2 the cdi was verified by deficit in crop yield in drought year under dry land regions it shows a good correlation drought had been found in all regions but the drought severity and the drought areas were relatively low in jilin the spatial pattern of the cdi showed that the drought mainly occurred in september and october of 2009 3 the result of the cdi was also verified by deficit in lst and et in drought year under dry land regions it indirectly proved that the cdi could well reflect the severity of agricultural drought in northeast china therefore the cdi is suitable for assessing agricultural drought in northeast china and provide valuable information for drought disaster prevention and mitigation 4 by using 1 2 3 month scales of rainfall the cdi at different time scales cdi1 cdi2 and cdi3 was calculated and compared with crop yield the results showed that the cdi3 was found to show higher r2 value 0 55 as compared to lower value of r2 for cdi2 0 44 and cdi1 0 26 this result verifies that the cdi at time scale of 3 months i e cdi3 is capable of characterizing the drought severity in northeast china acknowledgements this study is jointly supported by the national

10952,most research on drought assessment adopted historical in situ observations however there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years this study utilizes the two sources of data in drought assessment using the historical in situ observations the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought were firstly investigated by calculating the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at 1 3 6 month time scales in northeast china using remote sensing data the combined deficit index cdi for agricultural drought assessment was computed based on tri monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly ndvi at land cover type and sub type levels in the same region in the end the agricultural drought calculated by the cdi was evaluated against the deficit in crop yield as well as deficit in land surface temperature lst and evapotranspiration et in order to verify the applicability of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment in the study region the results showed that the cdi has better correlations with the spei r2 0 48 than the spi r2 0 05 at 3 month scales with weight factor a 0 5 in dry farming areas the spatial pattern of the cdi showed that the area of agricultural drought increased from july to october in addition a significant linear correlation was found between the cdi and anomaly in annual agricultural yield r2 0 55 and anomaly in monthly land surface temperature r2 0 42 the results prove that the cdi calculated by remote sensing data is not only a reliable indicator for agricultural drought assessment in northeast china but also provides useful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention and mitigation and water management improvement keywords agricultural drought cdi spi spei remote sensing northeast china 1 introduction drought is a quickly increasing risk that can lead to hardly repairable or unrepairable damages to our nature as well as socio economy ozelkan et al 2016 especially for arid and semi arid regions severe droughts have a great influence on millions of people each year which pose a long term threat to human livelihoods and result in huge economic loss below et al 2007 found that more than 50 of all deaths associated with natural hazards in the world were caused by drought related famine keshavarz et al 2013 addressed that 33 of the damages around the world was contributed by drought in 2009 less precipitation led to severe agricultural drought and 53 million food insecure people in sub saharan africa husak et al 2013 drought severity or magnitude can be illustrated by drought indices steinemann 2003 numerous indices have been developed for identifying the characteristic of meteorological droughts over the past decades the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are common meteorological drought indices shahabfar and eitzinger 2013 used six meteorological drought indices to evaluate and compare the spatial and temporal dynamics of drought in six climatic regions in iran liu et al 2013 employed the pdsi for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of dryness conditions across qinghai province in northwest china rayne and forest 2016 found that there was a substantial increase in drought variability at short time scales based on the pdsi in the united states since 1895 though the pdsi has several shortcomings because of its simplicity wells et al 2004 yu et al 2013 calculated a composite index ci in yunnan province of china during 1950 2010 and found that the spatial pattern of drought showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast while drought decreased from southeast to southwest the spi is widely applied to characterize the dryness wetness conditions and has been reported by an increasing number of publications because of its good performance compared to other drought indicators asadi zarch et al 2015 belayneh et al 2014 sierra soler et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 zuo et al 2018 chen and sun 2015 found that droughts calculated based on the spei were becoming more frequent and severe across china especially in the regions of northern china since the late 1990s agricultural drought assessment is mainly with the aid of monitoring soil water balance and subsequent deficit in the event of a drought crop specific drought index csdi meyer et al 1993 soil moisture deficit index smdi evapotranspiration deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and agricultural drought index dtx matera et al 2007 are typical in situ observation based agricultural drought indices remote sensing based vegetation indices such as vegetation health index vhi van hoolst et al 2016 enhanced vegetation index evi liu and huete 1995 as well as vegetation condition index vci kogan 1990 are also widely used to assess drought condition by monitoring vegetation state china is a vital food production country around the world accounting for 20 of global cereal production in 2011 fao 2014 however the area of farmland with 21 56 million ha accounting for about 16 of the total crop land in china are frequently affected by drought xie et al 2014 northeast china comprising three provinces of heilongjiang jilin and liaoning is a vital food production base of china a significant warming and drying trend has been detected in northeast china since the 1950s guo et al 2017 a number of droughts occurred in the 2000s across northeast china especially for prolonged drought events sheffield et al 2012 the drought induced absolute grain loss is in the range of 200 450 104 t yr in northeast china zhang et al 2015 zuo et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to investigating the causes and occurrence of drought in northeast china especially for agricultural drought several meteorological droughts related issues have been discussed in the study area during the past few years li et al 2009 found that northeast china demonstrated a significant decreasing trend in moisture availability based on the pdsi zhang et al 2013 used precipitation extreme indices to detect a drying tendency in northern china wang et al 2015a analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in northeast china transect nect during the period 1950 2012 using the mann kendall test and theil sen s slope estimator and found that a significant negative trend mostly occurred in the eastern part of the nect however a comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural drought in northeast china is still lacking most research on drought assessment adopted historical in situ observations however there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years as we all know the major shortcoming of the in situ observation data is that it cannot be effectively used to monitor and assess the drought events over a large area however remote sensing approach provide a better solution for monitoring drought conditions over a large scale at early stages because of its wide coverage high spatial resolution easy access and relatively lower expense dorjsuren et al 2016 the calculation of the spei and spi are based on meteorological variables which are often defined as meteorological indices to assess meteorological drought although the meteorological indices can reflect the characteristics of drought to some extent the agricultural drought often has a lag of 3 6 months after meteorological drought mishra and singh 2011 therefore an agricultural drought index is needed to assess the agricultural drought conditions in northeast china in this study we develop a combined deficit index cdi for agricultural drought assessment which was computed based on tri monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly ndvi at land cover type and sub type levels using the remote sensing data the meteorological and agricultural droughts in northeast china were assessed with the spi spei and cdi respectively the main objectives are as follows 1 to identify the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought estimated by using the spi and spei with historical in situ observations 2 to assess the agricultural drought calculated by the cdi based on ndvi and precipitation with remote sensing data 3 to evaluate the cdi against agricultural yield data as well as other drought related remote sensing data lst and et analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern of meteorological and agricultural droughts could provide a better understanding of drought characteristics in northeast china the results and experiences obtained in this study could also be extended to other similar arid and semi arid regions in china as well as other countries 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the study

china the statistics of the dataset contain annual loss caused by flood and drought 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi based on the probability distribution of long term time series of precipitation the standardized precipitation index spi was proposed by mckee et al 1993 as a meteorological drought index the procedure of the spi calculation is described as follows an incomplete gamma probability density function is firstly fitted to a given frequency distribution of precipitation series 1 g x 1 β α γ a x α 1 e x β x 0 where α is a parameter about shape β is a parameter about scale x is the amount of precipitation and the gamma function is presented as 2 γ α 0 x α 1 e x d x the best values of α and β are estimated by the maximum likelihood method thom 1966 3 α ˆ 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 4 β ˆ x α ˆ 5 a ln x ln x n where n is the number of precipitation series the cumulative probability for a given month then can be obtained by the following equation 6 g x 0 x g x d x 1 β ˆ α ˆ γ α ˆ 0 x x α ˆ 1 e x β ˆ d x the spi can be calculated as follows 7 spi s t c 2 t c 1 0 c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 8 t ln 1 g x 2 where x is the amount of precipitation when g x 0 5 s 1 when g x 0 5 s 1 c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 the spi values are symmetrical and can be used for identifying both drought and wetness conditions classification of drought calculated by the spi are defined and listed in table 1 spi can be estimated for observed precipitation records over any time scales such as three six or even more months take the time scale of three months for instance the spi value in the month in question is estimated based on the cumulative probability of precipitation in three months current and the previous two months 3 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei calculation follows the below three procedures 1 the following equation calculates potential evapotranspiration pet thornthwaite 1948 9 p e t 16 k 10 t i m 10 i i 1 12 t 5 1 514 where k is a coefficient calculated by latitude and month t is average air temperature for each month c i is the sum of monthly heat index within a year and m is a coefficient calculated by i m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 79 10 2 i 0 492 2 for a given month i the difference between precipitation p and pet represents surplus or deficit accumulation of water balance which can be derived from the following equation 11 d i p i p e t i x i j k is the difference between p and pet in month j year i at time scale k for instance the accumulated difference in month l year i at 12 month time scale can be calculated as x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i l if j k and 12 x i j k l j k 1 j d i j if j k where d i l means the difference between p and pet in month l year i 3 in order to estimate the value of spei the difference of the water balance is normalized as a log logistic probability distribution the following equation expresses the probability density function 13 f x β α x γ α 1 x γ α 2 where parameters α β and γ represent scale shape and origin respectively therefore the probability distribution function can be expressed as 14 f x 1 α x γ β 1 the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 can be calculated as the standardized f x with the approximation of 15 s p e i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w is calculated as w 2 ln p when p 0 5 p 1 f x represents the probability of exceeding d when p 0 5 the value of spei will be reversed while p will be replaced by 1 p c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 020328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 table 2 is the categorization of drought wet classified by the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 3 3 combined deficit index cdi agricultural drought occurs when crop vigor is below normal due to prolonged soil moisture deficit in the root zone caused by rainfall deficit from normal vyas et al 2015 it indicated that agricultural drought was characterized by a 3 month scale potop et al 2015 wu et al 2016 also it showed that ndvi does not respond immediately after rainfall the time lag in arid and semiarid areas however is approximately 1 month chandrasekar et al 2006 wu et al 2015 therefore two remote sensing products ndvi and rainfall rain were adopted in this study representing vegetation vigor and major water supply to soil in growing season respectively the procedure of the cdi calculation as follows vyas et al 2015 1 the percent deficits of monthly ndvi composite n d v i d and the percent deficits of the sum of antecedent tri monthly rain r a i n d from their mean values of the normal years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 are used to define the cdi the equation of the cdi calculation as follows 16 cdi α rain d 1 α ndvi d where α is the weight of the percent deficit of the sum of rainfall in preceding three months and 1 α is the weight of the percent deficit of monthly ndvi in this study a ranking method drobne and lisec 2009 is used for identifying the weight to the respective parameters 2 the monthly ndvi data from modis 13a3 are extracted from april to october the calculation of the percent deficit of ndvi n d v i d as follows 17 n d v i d n d v i n n d v i c n d v i n 100 where n d v i c and n d v i n are mean monthly ndvi from current and normal years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 respectively 3 three hour rainfall raster data are adopted to estimate monthly rainfall data from april to september tri monthly rainfall sliding sums of april may june amj may june july mjj june july august jja and july august september jas are further computed based on the monthly rainfall data moreover mean values of the tri monthly rainfall sums are computed for amj mjj jja and jas for the normal years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 and drought year 2009 the percent deficit of antecedent tri monthly rainfall r a i n d is computed using the following expression 18 r a i n d r a i n n r a i n c r a i n n 100 where r a i n n and r a i n c are mean tri monthly antecedent rainfall sums in normal years and current year respectively table 3 shows the categorization of drought classified by the cdi vyas et al 2015 and the flow chart of the calculation of the cdi is described in fig 2 4 results and analysis 4 1 spatiotemporal variation of meteorological drought the spi is the most widely used index for drought assessment tan et al 2015 which uses only precipitation data and can be obtained for flexible time scales furthermore vicente serrano et al 2010 developed the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which has not only the simplicity of estimation and the multiple time scales of the spi but also the sensitivity to changes in evaporation of the pdsi and the spei is considered to have great promise as a drought index for drought assessment stagge et al 2015 drought at different time scales is relevant for meteorological 1 month agricultural 3 6 month hydrological 12 month and socioeconomic 24 month impacts potop et al 2013 therefore the spi spei values at 1 3 and 6 month scales were used in this study to explore the variation of drought in northeast china 4 1 1 spatiotemporal variations of the spi at various time scales in order to firstly investigate the percentage of drought and wet occurrences at a long term scale the frequencies of the spi values at 1 3 and 6 months were calculated at each station during 1960 2009 in the study area fig 3 the percentage of extreme drought decreased with the increase of the spi time scales in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s while the maximum percentage of extreme drought was 2 54 at 3 month in the 1960s and the minimum percentage of extreme drought was 2 62 at 3 month in the 2000s in addition the percentage of severe drought increased and then decreased with the increase of the spi time scales in the 1960s 1980s and 1990s however the percentage of severe drought increased with the increase of the time scales in the 1970s and 2000s furthermore the percentage of moderate drought increased and then decreased with the increase of the spi time scales in all decades except 2000s in the 2000s the percentage of moderate drought increased with the increase of time scales the spatial distribution of seasonal drought frequency in northeast china is shown in fig 4 during 1960 2014 the frequency of spring drought decreased as the time scale increased the frequency of spring drought occurrence was between 10 and 20 and the frequency of spring drought in the western part of northeast china was lower than that in the eastern region as the time scale increased lower drought occurrence frequency and large affected area were found in the summer at 3 month scale in the northwest corner of heilongjiang and at 6 month scale in the middle of heilongjiang the drought frequencies reached at 20 or above the frequency of drought in autumn was relatively large at 3 month time scale the frequency of drought in almost the entire study area was between 15 and 20 the frequency of drought in winter was relatively lower at 1 month time scale lower wetting frequency occurred in western liaoning 4 1 2 spatiotemporal variations of the spei at various time scales the inter annual variation of the spei values at 1 3 and 6 months time scale during the period 1960 2014 are given in fig 5 drought and flood events have alternated during the past 55 years in which drought events were characterized with low frequency low intensity and short duration before 2000 however the intensity of drought was relatively high during the periods 2000 2002 and 2007 2009 the spatial distribution of drought frequency at various time scales in northeast china fig 6 during 1960 2014 clearly shows that the scope of extreme drought had gradually expanded with the increase of time scale especially for the west part of northeast china the area affected by severe drought also enlarged with the increase of time scale especially for the northern part and southwest corner of the study area the frequency of moderate drought was generally higher than that of extreme and severe drought and the frequency of drought at 1 month scale was larger than 6 month scale and 3 month scale generally speaking both of the spi and spei detected a similar significant drying trend in northeast china during the period 1960 2014 especially after 2000 moreover the drought frequency and intensity of spei were generally higher than those of spi it s probably because that the spei takes both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet into account in determining drought thus unlike the spi the spei captures the main impact of increased temperatures on water demand 4 2 evaluation of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment the combined deficit index cdi is adopted in this study to assess the agricultural drought condition in northeast china using the ranking method to list all the possibilities of weight combinations then the best optimal weight combination was obtained by comparing and analyzing the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and two drought indices based on the primary land cover type of farmland and sub type of dry land in this section 4 2 1 identification of drought year according to the consistency and availability of various types of data adopted in this study the period 2006 2010 was selected for agricultural drought assessment the identified drought year was illustrated in fig 7 based on annual precipitation series at 69 meteorological stations and crop failure area of the study area during the period 2006 2010 it can be concluded that precipitation slightly decreased from 2006 to 2009 and then reached at the maximum value in 2010 the lowest annual rainfall with 374 6 mm was found in 2009 while the maximum value was 588 1 mm in 2010 in northeast china on the other hand it has been suffered from drought disaster every year among the period 2006 2010 while the area of crop failure in 2009 was 1 20 106 hectares which was the largest value during the period 2006 2010 considering the above mentioned drought condition the year of 2009 is preliminarily identified as the relative drought year during the period 2006 2010 for the following assessment of spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural drought based on the cdi in northeast china and the other years 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 were identified as the normal years 4 2 2 evaluation of the cdi under farmland the land cover of northeast china can be categorized into six primary types such as farmland grassland forest settlement wetland and desert among the six primary land cover types farmland is the main land cover types related to agricultural production which was involved in the cdi estimation for agricultural drought assessment over northeast china table 4 lists the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and the other two meteorological drought indices spi and spei in the drought year 2009 it is clearly showed that the coefficient of determination r2 obtained by the spei were almost all higher than the spi the maximum values of r2 were found to be 0 10 and 0 09 for the spi while 0 28 and 0 16 for the spei at time scales of 3 and 6 months respectively as the weight factor of rainfall increased the r2 calculated for the spi and spei firstly increased and then decreased however different turning points existed at different time scales for the spi when the weight factors of rainfall were between 0 1 and 0 7 the r2 at 3 months scale obtained the greatest value followed by 6 months while the weight factors of rainfall were between 0 8 and 0 9 the correlation coefficients at 6 months scales reached at the greatest value followed by 3 months for the spei for all the weight factors of rainfall the r2 at 3 months scales were greater than that at 6 months the land cover type of farmland contains three sub types i e dry land paddy field and irrigable land numerous irrigation and water conservancy projects in northeast china were developed for protecting food security in paddy and irrigable land therefore the sub type of land cover i e dry land is more suitable for agricultural drought assessment under natural climate condition 4 2 3 evaluation of the cdi under dry land the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and the other two meteorological drought indices spi and spei at different time scales under land cover sub type of dry land in the drought year 2009 are summarized in table 5 as the weight factor of rainfall increased almost all the coefficient of determination r2 initially increased and then decreased for the spi and spei for the spi the r2 at 3 and 6 month scales had very low values for the spei for all the weight factors of rainfall the r2 at 3 months scales were greater than that at 6 months according to the abovementioned results it can be concluded that the combination of weights with a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 for rainfall and ndvi deficits tends to produce the highest correlation coefficient for most of the cases which can be adopted for further agricultural drought assessment by the cdi in this study 4 3 agricultural drought assessment based on the cdi the weight factor combination a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 was used for exploring the spatial pattern of agricultural drought based on the cdi the spatial patterns of cdi in drought year 2009 are shown in fig 8 drought had occurred in almost all areas of northeast china especially for moderate and mild drought southwestern and southern heilongjiang province and southwestern region of liaoning province suffered from severe drought the spatial patterns of the cdi in growing season i e july august september and october of 2009 in northeast china are shown in fig 9 respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that only northeastern region of the study area showed mild drought and moderate drought in july in august southwestern liaoning province and southwestern jilin province showed mild drought in contrast to july and august the area of mild drought in september gradually increased in southwestern jilin province and expanded in western and eastern liaoning province the areas of mild drought in october swept over almost the whole jilin and liaoning province while the southwestern liaoning province and southwestern jilin province experienced moderate drought 4 4 verification of the applicability of the cdi in order to verify the applicability of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment the average cdi during the growing season of drought year 2009 was compared with percent deficit agricultural yield dcy in the region with the land cover type of dry land table 6 when a 0 7 1 a 0 3 the r2 reaches the maximum value r2 0 56 p 0 01 when a 0 5 1 a 0 5 the r2 reaches the second maximum value r2 0 55 p 0 01 however the two r2 values are not much different and the gap could almost be ignored considering the r2 with the meteorological drought indices previous it still can be concluded that the combination of weights with a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 for rainfall and ndvi deficits which can be adopted for further agricultural drought assessment by the cdi in this study scatter diagram of the cdi and dcy at a 0 5 in 2009 are shown in fig 10 the correlation between the cdi and dcy was detected with r2 value of 0 55 when the cdi reaches at the maximum value of 69 2 the dcy reaches a maximum value of 45 7 which indicates that the region has experienced severe drought and the crop yield in this region nearly half less than normal years the result showed that the cdi had a promising potential for quantifying the agricultural yield reduction caused by agricultural drought in northeast china the points above the horizontal axis in fig 10 mostly fell within the cdi range below 25 representing no occurrence of agricultural drought happened the data points showed that there was a distinct difference in the response of agricultural yield deficit to the same range of the cdi value across different regions 5 discussion in order to better show the impact of cumulative rainfall on crop yield table 7 showed the coefficient of determination r2 between the combined deficit index cdi and percent deficit agricultural yield dcy at different time scales across land cover sub type of dry land region in 2009 cdi1 means that 1 month time scale was adopted in the calculation of rainfall using the mean value of rainfall from april to september respectively cdi2 indicates the mean of bi monthly sliding sums of rainfall for april and may am may and june mj june and july jj july and august ja august and september as cdi3 shows the mean of tri month sliding sums of rainfall for april may june amj may june july mjj june july august jja july august september jas among the three time scales the r2 of cdi3 was found to show higher value 0 55 as compared to lower values of r2 for cdi2 0 44 and cdi1 0 26 this result verified that the cdi at time scale of 3 months i e cdi3 is capable of characterizing the drought severity in the northeast china the reports of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc revealed that the globally warm days and nights would increase in the whole 21 st century field et al 2012 that means that more drought events caused by increasing evapotranspiration will follow the higher temperature in the future sheffield et al 2012 agricultural drought condition has a close relationship with land surface features therefore the cdi was also compared with other related remote sensing data lst and et in the discussion section in order to further evaluate the applicability of the cdi for agricultural drought assessment in northeast china lst is a good indicator of the energy balance at the earth s surface which is one of the key parameters in the physics of land surface processes on regional and global scales lst is also an indicator that provides information on the condition of the surface soil moisture content which is the key supply of crop growth sayago et al 2017 to further verify the rationality of the cdi developed in this study the calculated average cdi across northeast china were firstly performed correlation analysis with percent deficit of monthly lst dlst in 2009 which is shown in fig 11 the average cdi showed a good relationship with the dlst under the land cover type of dry land when the cdi reaches at the maximum value of 69 2 the dlst reaches at a maximum value of 4 6 which indicates that the region has experienced severe drought and the lst in this region in 2009 is 4 6 less than that of normal years the coefficient of determination r2 reached to 0 42 for the 13 stations located in dry land which indicated that the cdi has a good capability for agricultural drought assessment under the land cover type of dry land agricultural production is closely related to crop evapotranspiration which is usually monitored by the water balance of the whole crop growing cycle wang et al 2014a therefore a drought index which closely describes temporal and spatial variations of crop water use status is suitable for drought monitoring et reflects atmospheric moisture demand and thus affects water availability on land surfaces and could then significantly affect the duration severity and spatial extent of drought dai 2011 evapotranspiration was also used to analysis drought severity combined with ndvi in north china zhang et al 2016 which illustrates that evapotranspiration is a representative variable for agricultural drought assessment to further verify the rationality of the cdi developed in this study the calculated average cdi across northeast china were then performed correlation analysis with percent deficit of monthly et det in 2009 which is shown in fig 12 when the cdi reaches at the maximum value of 69 2 the det reaches at a maximum value of 45 8 which indicates that the region has experienced severe drought and the et in this region is nearly half less than that of normal years the coefficient of determination r2 between the cdi and det under the land cover type of dry land was relatively lower than dlst which indicates that agricultural drought in the study area is more sensitive to land surface temperature than evapotranspiration some previous studies on agricultural drought monitoring and assessment were mainly based on data from gauging stations quiring and papakryiakou 2003 bonaccorso et al 2003 wang et al 2014b although it could well reflect the agricultural drought conditions around the gauging stations the distribution and density of the gauging stations are insufficient for the detection of spatial heterogeneity information required however satellite based remote sensing data can overcome these shortcomings of gauging station observation which can be used for consistently and continuously agricultural drought monitoring and assessment in space zhang and jia 2013 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the first and the most frequently used remote sensing based product for monitoring agricultural drought tucker 1989 gu et al 2007 liu and qin 2007 wang et al 2015a b ndvi can be used to separate vegetation from soil background and provide a measure of general vegetation health which has directly impact on agricultural drought condition karnieli et al 2010 ma et al 2001 found r2 values ranged from 0 44 to 0 80 between soybean yield and ndvi at field scale in canada lopresti mariano et al 2015 found that the coefficient of determination r2 between ndvi and crop yield presented by simple regression were from 0 16 to 0 52 under different lag times furthermore a great many of indices based on ndvi were proposed for drought assessment dutta et al 2015 showed that vci had a good relationship with rain fed crop yield r2 0 55 which proved that the vci is suitable for identifying drought related water stress in crops li et al 2014 shown that the coefficient of determination r2 between the standardized precipitation index spi the crop moisture index cmi the normalized difference vegetation index anomaly ndvia and crop yield were 0 538 0 602 and 0 205 respectively from may to september during 2000 2010 in hailar county based on multi dekad average of indices rhee et al 2010 proved that the scaled drought condition index sdci which combined the land surface temperature lst the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm has a well r2 value with crop yield under arid and humid area with different trmm time scales such as the r2 between the sdci and corn in july in arid area used trmm 12 was 0 64 numerous studies have suggested that a combination of land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index could provide valuable information on vegetation stress and moisture conditions on land surface sandholt et al 2002 suggested an index called the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi based on an interpretation of the simplified ndvi ts space to assess surface moisture status then lots of studies have employed this index for drought monitoring holzman et al 2014 showed that tvdi data can be used effectively to predict crop yield on the argentine pampas and depending on the agro climatic zone r2 values ranged from 0 68 to 0 79 for soybean crop and 0 76 to 0 81 for wheat this study shows that the cdi which integrates meteorological variables and remote sensing information is an effective agricultural drought assessment index because northeast china is mainly rain fed agriculture the amount of rainfall plays a vital role in crop yield combing rainfall with ndvi products can better reflect the impact of rainfall on agricultural drought in regional scale the rainfall data used in this study has a spatial resolution of 0 1 which can better analyze the spatial characteristics of drought the results obtained in this study could provide valuable information for agricultural water resources management and drought prevention and mitigation in northeast china although the cdi has been successfully used for agricultural drought assessment in this study there are still many works to do for its improvement further research is also needed to assess the possibility of taking other agricultural drought influencing factors such as lst and et as the input variables of the cdi for better performance 6 conclusion in this study the meteorological and agricultural droughts in northeast china were assessed with the spi spei and cdi respectively the results of agricultural drought assessment were then verified by crop yield data as well as the remote sensing data lst and et the main conclusions are listed as follows 1 by computing correlation coefficients between the cdi and the spi as well as the spei under land cover type of farmland and land cover sub type of dry land it was found that the r2 values under dry land showed a better performance the weight factor combination with a 0 5 and 1 a 0 5 for rainfall and ndvi deficits produced the greatest r value for most cases and the correlation coefficients were statistically significant at p 0 01 2 the cdi was verified by deficit in crop yield in drought year under dry land regions it shows a good correlation drought had been found in all regions but the drought severity and the drought areas were relatively low in jilin the spatial pattern of the cdi showed that the drought mainly occurred in september and october of 2009 3 the result of the cdi was also verified by deficit in lst and et in drought year under dry land regions it indirectly proved that the cdi could well reflect the severity of agricultural drought in northeast china therefore the cdi is suitable for assessing agricultural drought in northeast china and provide valuable information for drought disaster prevention and mitigation 4 by using 1 2 3 month scales of rainfall the cdi at different time scales cdi1 cdi2 and cdi3 was calculated and compared with crop yield the results showed that the cdi3 was found to show higher r2 value 0 55 as compared to lower value of r2 for cdi2 0 44 and cdi1 0 26 this result verifies that the cdi at time scale of 3 months i e cdi3 is capable of characterizing the drought severity in northeast china acknowledgements this study is jointly supported by the national

10953,from 1980 to 2016 the increase in grain production in the songnen plain of northeast china was significant which was caused by a continuous increase in the use of nitrogen fertilizer however the partial fertilizer productivity pfp is gradually decreasing and a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer is lost to the environment leading to a series of environment problems this test combining a field plot test with an in situ micro zone test six treatments were set two irrigation regimens controlled irrigation and flooded irrigation and three n rates 85 110 and 135 kg ha 1 the recovery and loss of nitrogen fertilizer in a rice soil system under controlled irrigation regimen were studied also the basal tillering and panicle fertilizers were marked and the absorption and accumulation of different periods 15n labeled urea under different water and nitrogen control regimens as well as the residual rate of 15n labeled urea in the soil layer of paddy soil in each period were quantitatively analyzed each period nitrogen fertilizer recovery and loss in the rice soil system were quantitative analyzed the results showed that the loss rate of the rice soil system of controlled irrigation was reduced by 15 42 28 64 under the three nitrogen application levels compared to conventional flooded irrigation in the black soil region of the songnen plain the system also maintained the original rice yield and greatly reduced the threat of nitrogen fertilizer loss to the environment in the black soil region the total nitrogen recovery rate in the rice soil system ranged from 69 18 to 74 19 with controlled irrigation regimen under the different nitrogen application levels and the nitrogen recovery rate of the basal fertilizer was 41 46 48 85 the nitrogen recovery rate of the tillering fertilizer was 84 20 95 85 whereas the nitrogen recovery rate of the panicle fertilizer was 89 57 93 80 the total nitrogen recovery rate of the rice plant was 32 05 38 83 the recovery rate of the basal fertilizer was 11 78 16 44 and the recovery rate of the tillering fertilizer was 37 49 39 02 the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer was 54 15 68 38 rice planting under controlled irrigation can effectively reduce n fertilizer losses and also increase the dry matter accumulation of rice plants which was found to be 13 27 27 52 more than that of the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the controlled irrigation regimen not only meets the current requirements for grain yield but also plays a role in saving water increases production and reduces environmental pollution keywords rice field water saving irrigation 15n labeling nitrogen fertilizer recovery efficiency nitrogen loss 1 introduction according to the statistics report of the united states census bureau the total population of the world will exceed seven billion by 2012 and the annual population growth rate in the world is approximately 1 1 people s demand for food is increasing continuously u s census bureau 2009 to cope with this challenge the output of crops must increase which requires more nitrogen input from fertilizers from 1960 to 2000 the use of nitrogen fertilizer in the world increased by 800 to date the total application of nitrogen fertilizer has reached 81 7 106 tons globally of which the total nitrogen fertilizer use on rice wheat and corn accounts for half of the global nitrogen fertilizer application canfield et al 2010 as one of the largest developing countries in the world china has raised 22 of the world s population by 9 of the world s arable land which is dependent on the large scale application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer during the period of 1961 2010 the total grain output of china increased by more than three times reaching 610 million tons per year faostat 2016 over the same time the application of nitrogen fertilizer which is one of the important forms of nitrogen supplementation in soil has increased by nearly 37 fold reaching 30 million tons of pure nitrogen per year this amount of nitrogen fertilizer accounts for approximately 32 of the global total of which approximately 18 is used in rice cultivation heffer 2009 making china the country with the highest nitrogen fertilizer consumption however increasing nitrogen fertilizer input did not continue to help increase crop production after 2000 the output of rice wheat and maize which accounted for more than 50 of the sown area in china did not increase significantly grassini et al 2012 yet during this period the application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer still increased by 3 rate per year 2003 2013 research has shown that the nitrogen utilization rate of these crops is less than 40 and the inadvertent yet significant loss of nitrogen fertilizer has led to a series of environmental problems such as air pollution greenhouse effect soil acidification and water eutrophication galloway et al 2008 gruber and galloway 2008 liu et al 2010 matson et al 1998 xu et al 2012 normally the nitrogen absorption and utilization of fertilizers and their losses are assessed through the apparent nitrogen recovery rate which firstly calculates the difference between the nitrogen accumulation of plant in the nitrogen fertilizer area and the plant nitrogen accumulation in the nitrogen free area then divides it by the amount of nitrogen applied quantity qiao et al 2012 the use of 15n tracer technology can more accurately analyze the nitrogen recovery rate applied to the soil crop research system and its distribution balance in the system which helps to quantitatively analyze the absorption of nitrogen fertilizer and its loss to the environment wang et al 2017 through investigation and analysis there is a clear spatial difference in the recovery of nitrogen fertilizer liu et al 2010 the rate of nitrogen recovery in europe south america and north america is the highest and more than 70 of the nitrogen fertilizer is absorbed and utilized by crops the lower recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer may be due to the large rice planting area in asia nearly 90 of the world s rice is grown in asia and the recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer in rice fields in asia is generally between 20 and 35 hardly any region has exceeded 40 cassman et al 1996 the irrigation regimen have a greater impact on the recovery and loss of nitrogen fertilizer applied in the crop soil system it has been reported that the efficiency of n utilization is notoriously low with flooded irrigation use of flooded irrigation for rice cultivation significantly reduces the rhizo sphere redox potential while enhancing the extractable fe2 concentration and creates an unhealthy environment for root growth and nutrient uptake zhang et al 2012 yang et al 2004 it has been reported that proper management of water application enables plants to have extensive root system through better provision of oxygen and ultimately improve nutrient uptake and reduce the n losses by minimizing the ammonium and tn leaching thus recorded higher nitrogen utilization efficiency liu et al 2013 yang 2015 china is the world s leading rice planting country accounting for 19 of the world s rice planting area and 32 of the world s rice production fao 2019 in the process of rice cultivation not only a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer is lost but also a large amount of water resources are consumed in china the total amount of irrigation water in rice production accounts for more than 60 of the country s total water consumption jiang et al 2017 in some areas rice production is affected by regional and seasonal droughts schewe et al 2014 and the further increase of industrial and urban water consumption has aggravated the problem of an agricultural water resources deficit liu et al 2013 therefore water saving irrigation technology wsi plays a key role in reducing water use during rice cultivation and is considered to be a promising management practice for sustainable rice production zhuang et al 2019 akter et al 2018 aziz et al 2018 several wsi technologies have been developed and popularized in china such as controlled irrigation shallow wet irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation dong et al 2018 towa and guo 2014 xu et al 2015 compared with other wsi technologies controlled irrigation had the highest average water saving rate and the highest average pollutant reducing rate zhuang et al 2019 usually wsi can increase or maintain the same yield as the conventional flooded irrigation regimen linquist et al 2015 however there are relevant studies that have obtained the opposite results this is because the ability to obtain a higher yield of rice after wsi is determined by many factors a suitable wsi regimen should be selected based on rice variety climate factors and soil type linquist et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the songnen plain is located in the middle of northeastern china and is the largest part of the northeast plain there are several rivers such as the songhua river and nenjiang river and 5 59 million hectares of arable land grain yields account for 6 4 more or less in china sun et al 2013 it is a very important zone from both agricultural and socio economic viewpoints and the black earth belt that runs north to south in the songnen plain is one of the world s three major black soil regions it has high organic matter and is china s most fertile soil its physicochemical properties are suitable for planting a variety of crops xu et al 2010 therefore the black soil area of the songnen plain has always been china s most important food production base between 1980 and 2016 the total grain output of the songnen plain had increased from 25 66 104 t to 72 70 105 t and the total fertilization had increased from 18 54 104 t in 1980 to 46 77 104 t in 2016 heilongjiang statistical yearbook 2017 due to the gradual increase of the nitrogen application rate and lack of reasonable management of field water and nitrogen this practice will inevitably lead to a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer entering the paddy field soil and water causing environmental pollution therefore in order to meet the grain demand caused by the growing population we aim to improve the absorption and utilization efficiency of fertilizer and nitrogen in rice by minimizing the water and nitrogen management regimen thus minimizing the negative impact on the environment from rice production it is necessary to systematically analyze the recovery efficiency and loss of nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system so as to provide a reference for the development of a new rice water nitrogen regulation regimen and higher nitrogen fertilizer recovery rate in this experiment the conventional flooded irrigation regimen was used as a control in the long term irrigation trial stations in the songnen plain and heping irrigation area the method of combining field plots with 15n traced micro zones was used to 1 quantify the differences in the partitioning of accumulated basal tillering panicle fertilizers nitrogen to different plant parts under controlled irrigation regimen 2 study the residues of nitrogen fertilizer in various soil layers of paddy soil under controlled irrigation regimen 3 evaluate the risk of various stages fertilizer n loss in rice soil systems of controlled irrigation regimen the research results will provide a reference for the selection of reasonable water and nitrogen control measures in the intensive cultivation system in each irrigation area of the songnen plain and have important significance for achieving food security as well as sustainable development of the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was carried out at the rice irrigation experiment station in heilongjiang province the station 127 40 45 e 46 57 28 n is located in the heping irrigation district in qing an county northeastern china as shown in fig 1 in spite of efforts to popularize the wsi regimen in paddy fields most of the farmers have obtained high yields by increasing the amount of fertilizers mostly nitrogen and the maximum amount of nitrogen fertilizers has reached 200 kg ha 1 which was found after a survey of 100 famers on over 200 ha rice field unreasonable rice irrigation and fertilization measures has led to the loss of soil organic matter and the imbalance of the ratio of n p and k eventually leading to the degradation of the black soil excessively high levels of nitrogen make a large amount of unutilized nitrogen remain in the form of nitrate in the soil be lost to the air in gaseous form or drain back into the songhua river and nenjiang river causing a greenhouse effect or water pollution respectively the average annual surface water evaporation in this area is 750 mm the hydrothermal growth period of the crop is 156 171 d and the frost free period is 128 d throughout the year the area has a cold temperate continental monsoon climate the soil type is black soil which is classified as a soft soil usda classification soil survey staff 1999 it is the main soil type in the songnen plain and rice has been planted in the experimental area for more than 20 years the soil is fertile and the soil nutrient content is stable the soil tillage thickness was 11 3 cm and the thickness of the plough base layer was 10 5 cm before transplanting and fertilizing the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers of the experimental plot were sampled the main soil physical and chemical properties of the soil were analyzed and are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and sample collection in the black soil region different experiments on water and fertilizer began in 2012 according to the factors such as the agronomic characteristics and yield of rice the optimal nitrogen application rate was 110 kg ha 1 in the paddy field of the black soil region based on which we focused on the effect of optimal nitrogen application on the ecological environment of rice fields from 2016 wang and zhang 2016 zheng et al 2018 the quantitative analysis of nitrogen transfer under the optimum nitrogen application rate was carried out by the 15n tracer method the experiment was conducted following a randomized block design and two irrigation regimens were used table 2 controlled irrigation c and conventional flooded irrigation f the nitrogen application rate was set at three levels pure nitrogen n1 85 kg ha 1 n2 110 kg ha 1 n3 135 kg ha 1 the experiment design details are shown in table 3 each treatment was repeated three times for a total of 18 test plots each cell has an area of 100 m2 10 m 10 m a 40 cm deep plastic plate was embedded between the plots to prevent underground water nitrogen exchange in each plot controlled irrigation of rice had no water layer in the rest of the growing stages except for the shallow water layer in the seeding stage of rice which was maintained at 0 30 mm and the natural dryness in the yellow mature stage the irrigation time and irrigation quota were determined by the root soil moisture content as the control index the upper limit of irrigation was the soil saturated moisture content the lower limit of soil moisture at each growth stage was the percentage of saturated moisture content and the tpime pico64 32 soil moisture analyzer was used to determine the soil moisture content at 7 00 a m and 18 00 p m respectively when the soil moisture content was close to or lower than the lower limit of irrigation artificial irrigation occurred until the upper irrigation limit was reached the soil moisture content was maintained between the upper irrigation limit and the lower irrigation limit of the corresponding fertility stage and the corresponding irrigation volume of each treatment was recorded in the conventional flooded irrigation regimen except that in order to control the invalid tillering of rice the appropriate drainage in the later stage of the tillage and the natural drying in the yellow ripe stage the rest of the paddy rice was maintained with a 3 5 cm water layer in the field and the surface water depth of the test plot was read through a pre embedded vertical ruler every day at 8 00 a m to determine if irrigation is needed a 15n traced micro zone was set up in the above test cell and one micro zone was set in each test cell three micro zone experiments three sub treatments were set under a single treatment table 3 shows the details of the trial processing settings sub plot 1 m1 was 15n urea only for the basal application and unlabeled common urea for tillering and panicle fertilizer sub plot 2 m2 was 15n urea only for tillering fertilizer and the basal and panicle fertilizers were not labeled urea sub plot 3 m3 15n urea only was applied for panicle fertilizer with unlabeled normal urea for basal and tillering a bottomless pvc rectangular box 1 m in length 1 m in width and 0 5 m in height was embedded in each plot before the rice field was prepared and urea application of basal fertilizer and the micro zone buried deep 30 cm the labeled fertilizer is a 15n labeled urea with an abundance of 10 22 produced by shanghai research institute of chemical industry shanghai china the nitrogen fertilizers phosphate fertilizers potash fertilizers and irrigation methods were the same as those used in the test plots in the pilot micro zone a small agricultural submersible pump was used to independently irrigate and drain micro zone and the rest of the field management was the same as that of the experimental plot nitrogenous fertilizers were applied to the test plots and micro area according to the basal fertilizer tillering fertilizer panicle fertilizer ratio of 4 5 2 3 5 the basal fertilizer was applied 1 day before rice was transplanted the tillering fertilizer was applied 24 days after transplanting and the panicle fertilizer was applied after 72 days of planting the amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were the same for all treatments p2o5 45 kg ha 1 and k2o 80 kg ha 1 were used phosphate fertilizer was applied before transplanting and potassium fertilizer was applied two times before transplanting and 8 5 leaf age the ratio before and after was 1 1 the trial used local rice variety longqingdao 3 to grow pre germinated seeds into seedlings in soil filled trays one week after the application of basal fertilizer the same rice seedlings were transplanted at a plant spacing of 16 67 cm and row spacing of 30 cm three plants per hole weeding was performed in all stages of rice growth to prevent and control pests and diseases so as not to affect rice nutrient absorption in both years 6 hills of plants were sampled randomly from each plot and micro zone at the maturity stage all plants were divided into leaf blade leaf stem plus sheath stem and panicle above ground and 0 60 cm underground roots first the sample was rinsed with running water then an agricultural compression atomizer was used to load fresh samples and roots of rice into sample bags the samples were taken to the laboratory and placed in a 105 c oven for 30 min and then dried at 70 c to constant weight afterwards the dried matter of rice shoots and roots was weighed the weighed samples were crushed using a ball mill according to their 15n abundance to prevent cross contamination between samples after smashing and 80 mesh screening the sample was placed in a sample bag and sealed at the same time soil samples were collected separately at 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm section soil samples from each plot and micro zone were collected using a two cm diameter hand operated core sample sample collection and processing always began with the control and low abundance samples and then followed by treated and high abundance samples in order to avoid 15n mixing the soil samples for the elemental analysis of each treatment were brought back to the laboratory stones roots and stems as well as various new bodies and intrusions were carefully removed from the soil soil samples from each layer of soil profile were weighed and mixed thoroughly then each sample was divided into two sets one for later analysis after air dried and ground into fine powder the total n content of soil and plants were determined using the kjeldahl determination method the other one for subsequent isotope measurement 2 3 laboratory analysis and data analysis 2 3 1 determination and calculation of 15n atomic percentile of rice plant samples the sealed and preserved rice plants roots and layers of soil samples were brought back to the laboratory for isotope determination the stable isotope test was completed at the key laboratory of agricultural water resources use ministry of agriculture and rural affairs northeast agricultural university using an elemental analyzer flash 2000ht thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and isotope mass spectrometry delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific to determine the 15n atom of the sample a standard sample was added every 10 samples as a test quality control and the measurement error was less than 0 1 the 15n percentage ndff absorbed

cycling within the system the isotopic fractionation effect occurs during the soil n metabolism and movement resulting in variation of soil n isotopic abundance under different treatment therefore in the process of collecting soil samples the soil samples from the same treatment field and micro area were collected at the same time and the measured values after mass spectrometry analysis were

irrigation 3 1 1 effect of wsi on nitrogen accumulation in various rice parts according to table 4 the amount of dry matter accumulation and nitrogen accumulation in the upper and underground parts of rice increased with the increase of nitrogen application under the two irrigation regimens compared with the nitrogen application rate of 85 kg ha 1 the nitrogen application rates of 110 kg ha 1 and 135 kg ha 1 for the rice under the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 13 27 and 27 52 the amount of nitrogen accumulation increased by 49 27 and 92 44 root dry weight increased by 5 09 and 6 83 and the amount of nitrogen accumulation increased by 5 60 and 7 34 respectively during the mature period of rice the comparison between treatments of different irrigation regimens showed that dry matter accumulation at the rice mature stage under the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 1 60 7 09 and 5 87 respectively the amount of nitrogen accumulation increased by 7 34 10 82 and 6 82 under the same nitrogen application respectively analysis of variance showed that the interaction of the irrigation regimen nitrogen application amount and nitrogen fertilizers significantly affected the accumulation of dry matter in the above ground part of rice but had no significant effect on the dry matter accumulation in roots for the amount of nitrogen applied to nitrogen accumulation in the aboveground organs of rice the effect of quantity was significant irrigation regimen only had a significant effect on nitrogen accumulation in the rice panicle but had no significant effect on nitrogen accumulation in other organs there was no interaction between irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer the results showed that the controlled irrigation regimen was more conducive to the accumulation of dry matter in aboveground rice and the uptake of nitrogen nutrients by rice plants resulting in water saving and high yield effects in addition to nitrogen fixing crops the nitrogen in other crops mainly comes from nitrogen fertilizer and soil under the two irrigation regimens the amount of nitrogen absorbed by rice from fertilizers and soil increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and the stimulating effect of soil was clear at the same time in the controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application rate the nitrogen absorbed by the rice from fertilizer and soil was higher than under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen when the amount of nitrogen application gradually increased the proportion of nitrogen in fertilizers gradually increased in the nitrogen accumulation of rice under both irrigation regimens and the proportion of soil nitrogen accumulation decreased fig 2 the distribution of fertilizer 15n in various organs of rice at maturity is shown in table 4 the accumulation of 15n fertilizer in various organs of rice increased with the increase of n application rate under the controlled irrigation regimen of rice the total accumulation of fertilizer 15n of rice at the same n application rate compared with conventional flooded irrigation increased by 38 49 3 30 and 1 06 and the accumulation of fertilizer 15n in various organs of rice under different water and nitrogen conditions showed panicle stems and sheaths leaves and roots from high to low according to the analysis of variance the interactions of the irrigation regimens nitrogen application rates and nitrogen fertilizers significantly affected the uptake of 15n in rice and the most significant effect was on the 15n accumulation in the panicles the amount of fertilizer 15n accumulation in the panicle increased by 1 60 7 09 and 5 87 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation at the same nitrogen application rate fig 3 3 1 2 different stages fertilizer 15n absorption and distribution of rice under water saving irrigation when 15n urea was only applied to the basal fertilizer 10 96 20 05 of the basal nitrogen applied under different water and nitrogen control was absorbed and utilized by rice plants including underground rice roots in addition to the low nitrogen application rate 85 kg ha 1 the recovery rate of the rice basal fertilizer under the two irrigation regimens was not significantly different in the 110 kg ha 1and 135 kg ha 1 n application rate of rice controlled irrigation regimen the nitrogen uptake and utilization of basal fertilizer were all lower compared with conventional flooded irrigation the recovery rate of basal fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen was reduced by 10 32 and 23 41 respectively under the controlled irrigation regimen 9 57 11 80 of nitrogen was absorbed in leaves 17 50 24 23 in stems and sheaths 63 97 72 93 in panicles and 6 38 7 90 in roots the proportions of basal nitrogen absorbed in the same nitrogen application amount in the two irrigation regimens were not significantly different in the leaves and root systems under the controlled irrigation regimen the proportion of nitrogen absorbed in the rice basal fertilizer was greater at the panicle than in the conventional flooded irrigation with an increase of 8 19 17 95 while under conventional flooded irrigation the accumulation of basal nitrogen in rice stem and sheath is higher when 15n urea was only applied as a tillering fertilizer 23 83 36 90 of tillering nitrogen fertilizers applied under different water and nitrogen conditions were absorbed and utilized by rice plants including underground rice roots the recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate under the controlled irrigation regimen the recovery rate of tillering fertilizer increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen but the absorption and utilization of tiller fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen was significantly better than that of the conventional flooded irrigation under the different nitrogen application rates compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the recovery rates of tillering nitrogen under the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 54 82 17 16 and 10 20 respectively under the controlled irrigation regimen 9 19 10 85 of tillering nitrogen was distributed in leaves 17 15 22 22 were distributed in stems and sheaths 60 66 67 73 were distributed in panicles and 5 43 7 07 were distributed in roots under the different nitrogen application rates the distribution of tillering nitrogen fertilizers absorbed by rice in the two irrigation regimens had no significant difference in the distribution of plant organs when 15n urea was only applied as a panicle fertilizer 33 78 63 54 of panicle nitrogen applied under different water and nitrogen conditions was absorbed and utilized by rice plants including underground rice roots the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer under both irrigation regimens increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and the nitrogen uptake and utilization of panicle fertilizer by rice under different nitrogen application rates under controlled irrigation regimen were significantly better than that of conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 48 81 4 22 and 8 99 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the controlled irrigation regimen 9 04 11 94 of panicle fertilizers nitrogen were distributed in leaves 19 95 33 51 were distributed in stems and sheaths 47 96 63 85 were distributed in panicles and 6 89 7 16 were distributed in rice roots under the different nitrogen application rates the distribution of panicle fertilizers nitrogen for the rice absorbed by the two irrigation regimens had no significant difference among the organs 3 2 residues of different stages nitrogen fertilizer in soil under wsi in the two irrigation regimens the total residual amount of fertilizer 15n in soil increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate from analysis of variance the total residual amount of fertilizer 15n in soil was significantly affected by the irrigation regimen and nitrogen application rate table 5 in the same n application amount the controlled irrigation regimen had higher residual levels of fertilizer 15n in paddy field soil after rice harvest under the three nitrogen application levels compared with conventional flooded irrigation and they increased by 10 29 10 79 and 18 30 moreover 36 36 37 12 of the total n fertilizer applied under the controlled irrigation regimen remained in the paddy soil which increased by 10 28 10 79 and 18 30 compared with conventional flooded irrigation although the total residual nitrogen in the soil under the two irrigation regimens increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate the total residual rate of each stage 15n fertilizer in the soil decreased with the amount of nitrogen applied the gradual reduction means that more nitrogen is lost to the paddy field through other channels which causes environmental problems by comparing and analyzing the nitrogen fertilizer residue in different soil layers under the two irrigation regimens we can see that fertilizer 15n has the highest residue in the soil surface 0 20 cm under different nitrogen application rates for the two different irrigation regimens under the controlled irrigation regimen the residue of fertilizer n in the 0 20 cm soil layers increased by 41 50 53 95 and 53 88 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the nitrogen residue in the 20 40 cm soil layer decreased by 9 64 20 48 and 4 00 respectively the residual volume in the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased by 12 69 21 91 and 17 39 respectively the results showed that the residue of fertilizer 15n in rice was mainly concentrated in the topsoil of paddy fields under the controlled irrigation regimen of paddy rice while under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the fertilizer 15n had moved to the lower layer of soil with water which is a threat to the safety of groundwater resources for the residual status of 15n fertilizer in soil under different nitrogen application rates for the two irrigation regimens it was found that residues were highest in the topsoil 0 20 cm and the amount of residual fertilizer in the soil surface increased with the increase of n application rate in each stage with the increase in soil depth 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm fertilizer residue gradually decreased when only 15n urea was applied as the basal fertilizer 29 68 32 72 of the total nitrogen application of the basal fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen with different nitrogen application rates remained in the paddy soil and increased by 12 28 16 63 and 24 84 under the same nitrogen application rate compared to conventional flooded irrigation fig 4 comparing the residual amounts of basal 15n in different soil layers under the same nitrogen application level it was observed that the basal 15n of rice in the controlled irrigation regimen of rice has a higher residue at 0 20 cm under the controlled irrigation regimen the residue of basal 15n in the 0 20 cm soil layers increased by 52 10 66 69 and 67 36 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate residues in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers were lower under the controlled irrigation regimen the residue of basal 15n in the 20 40 cm soil layers decreased by 52 10 66 69 and 67 36 40 60 cm soil layers decreased by 18 93 13 40 and 16 60 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate when 15n urea was only applied as the tillering fertilizer the total residual amount of tillering fertilizer nitrogen in the soil layers accounted for 54 88 57 33 of the total amount of tillering nitrogen fertilizer applied fig 4 compared with conventional flooded irrigation regimens the total residual nitrogen content of rice tillering fertilizer in paddy soil increased by 9 19 11 11 and 23 84 with controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application level with the increase in nitrogen application rate the increase of tillering nitrogen residue in rice under the controlled irrigation regimen was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation and the residual tillering nitrogen in rice was controlled at 0 20 cm in the same nitrogen application level compared with conventional flooded irrigation regimens the residual nitrogen content of rice tillering fertilizer in 0 20 cm paddy soil increased by 40 77 46 95 and 62 51 with controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application level while the residual nitrogen of tillering nitrogen was higher in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the tillering nitrogen fertilizer residue in the 20 40 cm soil layer increased by 18 33 30 19 and 4 41 the nitrogen content of tillering nitrogen in the 40 60 cm soil layer increased by 14 50 25 74 and 28 28 compared with the controlled irrigation regimen when only 15n urea was applied as the panicle fertilizer the total panicle nitrogen residue in the soil layer under the different nitrogen application levels was 29 37 35 42 of the total panicle nitrogen fertilizer application fig 4 compared with the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the total residual nitrogen of the panicle fertilizer in the paddy field soil increased by 9 21 3 38 and 6 52 under the same nitrogen application level with controlled irrigation regimen the residual nitrogen of panicle fertilizer in 0 20 cm soil layer were increased by 30 74 45 54 and 29 93 compared with conventional flooded irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application rate while under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the residual nitrogen in panicle fertilizers was higher in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers the residual panicle nitrogen fertilizers in 20 40 cm soil layer were increased by 3 64 17 92 and 9 95 while the panicle nitrogen fertilizers in 40 60 cm soil layer increased by 6 06 44 86 and 16 55 compared with controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application rate 3 3 recovery and loss rate of fertilizer 15n in the rice soil system in paddy rice under wsi under the rice controlled irrigation regimen the nitrogen recovery rate of fertilizers increased with the increase of the nitrogen application rate but the residual rate of nitrogen fertilizer in soil decreased with the increase of the nitrogen application rate fig 4 the recoveries of nitrogen fertilizers in rice soil systems at different n rates were 69 18 74 19 which increased with the increase of nitrogen application within a certain range fig 5 compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the recovery rates of nitrogen fertilizer in rice soil under the controlled irrigation regimen of rice increased by 21 78 6 89 and 8 72 respectively the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system was reduced by 28 64 15 42 and 18 73 respectively the loss of nitrogen was reduced by 16 96 to 25 29 kg ha 1 in the amount of nitrogen applied in this experiment studies have shown that the controlled irrigation regimen of rice in the songnen plain can effectively reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer and the effect of reducing nitrogen loss and increasing nitrogen use efficiency at a low nitrogen application rate 85 kg ha 1 is more significant when 15n urea was only applied as the basal fertilizer the recovery rate of basal fertilizer in the rice soil system was 41 46 48 85 with controlled irrigation regimen under different nitrogen application rates compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the rice controlled irrigation regimen the absorption and utilization of nitrogen on the basal fertilizer was lower but the basal nitrogen content in the soil was higher in this irrigation regimen therefore the recovery rate of basal fertilizer with controlled irrigation regimen in rice soil system is higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation the recoveries of tillering nitrogen in rice soil systems were the highest among basal tillering and panicle fertilizers under the controlled irrigation regimen and only 4 15 15 80 of the tillering nitrogen was lost to the environment the loss rate of conventional flooded irrigated fertilizer decreased by 81 42 70 61 and 27 24 under the same nitrogen application rate which effectively reduced the loss of nitrogen fertilizer when only 15n urea was applied as the panicle fertilizer the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer in rice soil system was 89 57 93 80 and only 6 20 10 43 of the panicle fertilizer had nitrogen loss under the same nitrogen application rate the rice soil loss rate of conventional flooded irrigation panicle fertilizer decreased by 65 97 39 76 and 33 60 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation rice controlled irrigation can effectively reduce the loss of nitrogen in fertilizers furthermore by further studying the reduction of basal nitrogen n losses controlled irrigation regimen can further improve the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer in rice and reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer 4 discussion the changes in rice planting area grain yield and nitrogen fertilizer input in the songnen plain from 1980 to 2016 are shown in fig 6 the grain yield of the songnen plain increased from 25 66 104 t to 72 70 105 t and the yield increased by 70 13 105 t the growth trend of grain production from 1980 to 2016 was fitted by the logistic function r2 0 66 the planting area of rice increased from 75 400 ha in 1980 to 13 73 105 ha in 2016 the change in the trend of the rice planting area from 1980 to 2016 also met the logistic function r2 0 67 the increase in grain production between 1980 and 2016 was not only due to the increase in rice planting area but also to the increase in productivity in 1980 the yield per hectare of arable land was only 3403 kg in 2016 the output per hectare of cultivated land increased to 5295 kg in order to increase production the application of nitrogen fertilizer has increased significantly since the 1980s the application of nitrogen fertilizer is mainly based on urea the total amount of fertilizers has increased from 18 54 104 t in 1980 to 46 77 104 t in 2016 the rate of fertilizer n application remained high at the end of the year and the growth trend was consistent with the logistic function r2 0 75 it can be seen that the application of nitrogen fertilizer has a significant impact on the agricultural production of the songnen plain and the application rate of nitrogen fertilizer still shows a relatively high growth rate as shown in fig 7 the nitrogen application rate per hectare in the songnen plain has remained at a relatively high level since 2007 and then due to the optimization of nitrogen application methods and the popularization of scientific and rational fertilization techniques the application rate of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare is decreasing year by year although the application amount of nitrogen fertilizer is decreasing year by year the fluctuation of grain yield per hectare is small and increases slightly in 2016 the nitrogen fertilizer application amount in rice fields in the songnen plain was 141 36 kg ha 1 which was significantly lower than the national average nitrogen application rate of 189 20 kg ha 1 the partial fertilizer productivity pfp per hectare yield n application rate per hectare of the songnen plain between 1980 and 2016 was analyzed and compared it can be seen that the pfp is decreasing year by year and the higher application of nitrogen fertilizer from 1980 to 2007 has led to lower pfp and pfp still remains at a low level after the nitrogen fertilizer application amount after 2007 was reduced a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer is not absorbed and utilized by plants resulting in a series of environmental problems therefore research and development of scientific and reasonable water and nitrogen management measures are necessary it is of great significance to achieve food security and sustainable development of the environment the 15n tracer technique was used in this experiment the application of basal fertilizer 15n tillering fertilizer 15n and panicle fertilizer 15n separately was used to overcome the traditional fertilizer utilization which can only represent the utilization of the total nitrogen fertilizer in rice growing process based on the determination of plant and soil samples the application of basal fertilizer tillering fertilizer and panicle nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system and the total recovery and loss rate of nitrogen fertilizer in rice soil system were estimated the results showed that the total recovery rate of rice to fertilizer 15n was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation under controlled irrigation regimen and the total nitrogen accumulation in rice was 16 62 23 89 from fertilizer 15n and the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer 54 15 68 38 was the highest in the controlled irrigation regimen it was significantly higher than the recovery rate of basal fertilizer 11 78 16 4 and the recovery rate of tiller fertilizer 37 49 39 02 which was similar to the results reported by lin lin et al 2014 studies have shown that under normal conditions the uptake of nitrogen in the basal fertilizer is less than 10 wang et al 2011 the recovery rate of rice to basal fertilizer is slightly higher than 10 in the two irrigation regimens but the no water layer field management regimen is used after the seeding period of rice in the controlled irrigation regimen in this period the management of wsi will inhibit the growth of rice to a certain extent so that the uptake of nitrogen by rice is lower than that of the conventional flooded irrigation regimen xue et al 2013 observed that site specific nitrogen management and alternate wetting and moderate drying increase the grain yield by 14 4 and nitrogen agronomic utilization by 64 1 when compared with the local farmers practice indicating that good root morphology and increased root metabolism contributed to high grain yield and high nitrogen use efficiency through the appropriate regulation of water interaction with nitrogen application in rice xu et al 2018 in this study under the controlled irrigation regimen the utilization ratio of tiller fertilizer and the utilization ratio of panicle fertilizer increased by 10 34 52 28 and 5 15 46 69 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate this is due to the clear compensatory effect of wsi on the growth of rice in later stage yin et al 2017 yan et al 2018 the root morphology of rice was improved in the main growth period under proper management of water application root physiological activity was strengthened xu et al 2018 and the damage degree of the reducing substance such as fe2 h2s to the cells was decreased yang et al 2004 ju et al 2015 which is beneficial to the absorption and utilization of nitrogen in the later period of rice islam et al 2018 yin et al 2017 although the total recovery rate of rice to fertilizer 15n is higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation under controlled irrigation there is still a problem of low fertilizer 15n absorption of basal fertilizer which awaits further study and the rate of fertilizer 15n recovery under wsi is further increased by rational field management the fertilizer 15n had a higher recovery rate and higher residue in the soil under the controlled irrigation regimen the fertilizer 15n of total fertilizer applied under the controlled irrigation regimen was 35 36 37 12 residue in paddy soil and the soil residue rate of fertilizer in this experiment was higher than that in other parts of china because the black soil had strong water retention and fertilizer ability therefore the residue of nitrogen fertilizer in soil is higher under the controlled irrigation regimen the soil residue of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation this may be due to good soil permeability and high oxygen content under water saving irrigation which improves soil microbial and enzyme activities is conducive to the conversion of fertilizer nitrogen enhances soil nitrogen fixation capacity and increases fertilizer nitrogen residue hu et al 2017 under normal circumstances nearly 30 of the nitrogen fertilizer in the form of inorganic nitrogen residues in the soil nh4 n is the predominant and preferred form of n in flooded soils george et al 1992 it adsorbs on soil colloids stays longer and leads to lower percolation loss cassman et al 1998 while the controlled irrigation regimen nitrogen fertilizer more than the form of nitrate nitrogen residue in the rice after harvesting the residue of a large number of nitrate nitrogen very easily leaches deep into the soil causing pollution of groundwater resources studies have shown that controlled irrigation has the benefit of reducing n2o emissions especially important for poorly draining black soils lower soil water contents will also reduce denitrification losses of no3 reducing an agronomic loss of n vogeler et al 2019 more frequent irrigation did have a benefit of reducing nh3 emissions thus the recoveries of tillering nitrogen in rice soil systems were the highest among basal tillering and panicle fertilizers under the controlled irrigation regimen the results of our study show that compared with conventional flooded irrigation the application of rice as a controlled irrigation regimen in the black soil area of songnen plain is characterized by high recovery and low loss but there are also some problems of higher nitrogen fertilizer soil residue rate and lower basal nitrogen recovery rate of rice it is necessary to adjust the water management measures of the irrigation regimen and the corresponding nitrogenous fertilizer management methods to improve the nitrogen recovery rate of the fertilizer and reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in different periods 5 conclusions the use of controlled irrigation regimen on rice in the black soil region of the songnen plain in china can effectively increase the absorption and utilization of nitrogen fertilizer reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system and play a role in saving water and reducing emissions the total recovery rate of rice in the rice soil system was 69 18 74 19 under the different nitrogen application rates and the nitrogen recovery rate of the basal fertilizer was 41 46 48 85 the nitrogen recovery rate of the nitrogen fertilizer was 84 20 95 85 nitrogen recovery rate of panicle fertilizer was 89 57 93 80 the total recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer in rice plants was 32 05 38 83 the recovery rate of basal fertilizer was 11 78 16 44 the recovery rate tillering fertilizer was 37 49 39 02 and the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer was 54 15 68 38 because black soil has a strong ability to maintain water and nutrients nitrogen fertilizer has a large residual amount in the paddy soil and 35 36 37 12 of the total nitrogen fertilizer applied remains in the paddy soil higher than conventional flooded irrigation regimen therefore it is necessary to fully consider the implementation of a rice controlled irrigation regimen and optimize nitrogen application in the black soil area of songnen plain which can meet the increasing demand of grain and reduce the threat to the environment caused by nitrogen fertilizer loss in this experiment the total recovery rate of fertilizer in rice soil system with controlled irrigation regimen was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation which played the role of saving water and reducing emission but the rate of nitrogen recovery of rice to basal fertilizer was only 11 78 16 44 significantly lower than that of conventional flooded irrigation regimen future work includes adjusting the water nitrogen regulation regimen or fertilization method in the rice field at the early growth stage in order to improve the nitrogen recovery rate of the basal fertilizer under the controlled irrigation regimen improving the uptake and utilization rate of nitrogen in rice under the controlled irrigation regimen of rice and reducing the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in rice soil system acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation project of china the project no 51779046 
10953,from 1980 to 2016 the increase in grain production in the songnen plain of northeast china was significant which was caused by a continuous increase in the use of nitrogen fertilizer however the partial fertilizer productivity pfp is gradually decreasing and a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer is lost to the environment leading to a series of environment problems this test combining a field plot test with an in situ micro zone test six treatments were set two irrigation regimens controlled irrigation and flooded irrigation and three n rates 85 110 and 135 kg ha 1 the recovery and loss of nitrogen fertilizer in a rice soil system under controlled irrigation regimen were studied also the basal tillering and panicle fertilizers were marked and the absorption and accumulation of different periods 15n labeled urea under different water and nitrogen control regimens as well as the residual rate of 15n labeled urea in the soil layer of paddy soil in each period were quantitatively analyzed each period nitrogen fertilizer recovery and loss in the rice soil system were quantitative analyzed the results showed that the loss rate of the rice soil system of controlled irrigation was reduced by 15 42 28 64 under the three nitrogen application levels compared to conventional flooded irrigation in the black soil region of the songnen plain the system also maintained the original rice yield and greatly reduced the threat of nitrogen fertilizer loss to the environment in the black soil region the total nitrogen recovery rate in the rice soil system ranged from 69 18 to 74 19 with controlled irrigation regimen under the different nitrogen application levels and the nitrogen recovery rate of the basal fertilizer was 41 46 48 85 the nitrogen recovery rate of the tillering fertilizer was 84 20 95 85 whereas the nitrogen recovery rate of the panicle fertilizer was 89 57 93 80 the total nitrogen recovery rate of the rice plant was 32 05 38 83 the recovery rate of the basal fertilizer was 11 78 16 44 and the recovery rate of the tillering fertilizer was 37 49 39 02 the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer was 54 15 68 38 rice planting under controlled irrigation can effectively reduce n fertilizer losses and also increase the dry matter accumulation of rice plants which was found to be 13 27 27 52 more than that of the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the controlled irrigation regimen not only meets the current requirements for grain yield but also plays a role in saving water increases production and reduces environmental pollution keywords rice field water saving irrigation 15n labeling nitrogen fertilizer recovery efficiency nitrogen loss 1 introduction according to the statistics report of the united states census bureau the total population of the world will exceed seven billion by 2012 and the annual population growth rate in the world is approximately 1 1 people s demand for food is increasing continuously u s census bureau 2009 to cope with this challenge the output of crops must increase which requires more nitrogen input from fertilizers from 1960 to 2000 the use of nitrogen fertilizer in the world increased by 800 to date the total application of nitrogen fertilizer has reached 81 7 106 tons globally of which the total nitrogen fertilizer use on rice wheat and corn accounts for half of the global nitrogen fertilizer application canfield et al 2010 as one of the largest developing countries in the world china has raised 22 of the world s population by 9 of the world s arable land which is dependent on the large scale application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer during the period of 1961 2010 the total grain output of china increased by more than three times reaching 610 million tons per year faostat 2016 over the same time the application of nitrogen fertilizer which is one of the important forms of nitrogen supplementation in soil has increased by nearly 37 fold reaching 30 million tons of pure nitrogen per year this amount of nitrogen fertilizer accounts for approximately 32 of the global total of which approximately 18 is used in rice cultivation heffer 2009 making china the country with the highest nitrogen fertilizer consumption however increasing nitrogen fertilizer input did not continue to help increase crop production after 2000 the output of rice wheat and maize which accounted for more than 50 of the sown area in china did not increase significantly grassini et al 2012 yet during this period the application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer still increased by 3 rate per year 2003 2013 research has shown that the nitrogen utilization rate of these crops is less than 40 and the inadvertent yet significant loss of nitrogen fertilizer has led to a series of environmental problems such as air pollution greenhouse effect soil acidification and water eutrophication galloway et al 2008 gruber and galloway 2008 liu et al 2010 matson et al 1998 xu et al 2012 normally the nitrogen absorption and utilization of fertilizers and their losses are assessed through the apparent nitrogen recovery rate which firstly calculates the difference between the nitrogen accumulation of plant in the nitrogen fertilizer area and the plant nitrogen accumulation in the nitrogen free area then divides it by the amount of nitrogen applied quantity qiao et al 2012 the use of 15n tracer technology can more accurately analyze the nitrogen recovery rate applied to the soil crop research system and its distribution balance in the system which helps to quantitatively analyze the absorption of nitrogen fertilizer and its loss to the environment wang et al 2017 through investigation and analysis there is a clear spatial difference in the recovery of nitrogen fertilizer liu et al 2010 the rate of nitrogen recovery in europe south america and north america is the highest and more than 70 of the nitrogen fertilizer is absorbed and utilized by crops the lower recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer may be due to the large rice planting area in asia nearly 90 of the world s rice is grown in asia and the recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer in rice fields in asia is generally between 20 and 35 hardly any region has exceeded 40 cassman et al 1996 the irrigation regimen have a greater impact on the recovery and loss of nitrogen fertilizer applied in the crop soil system it has been reported that the efficiency of n utilization is notoriously low with flooded irrigation use of flooded irrigation for rice cultivation significantly reduces the rhizo sphere redox potential while enhancing the extractable fe2 concentration and creates an unhealthy environment for root growth and nutrient uptake zhang et al 2012 yang et al 2004 it has been reported that proper management of water application enables plants to have extensive root system through better provision of oxygen and ultimately improve nutrient uptake and reduce the n losses by minimizing the ammonium and tn leaching thus recorded higher nitrogen utilization efficiency liu et al 2013 yang 2015 china is the world s leading rice planting country accounting for 19 of the world s rice planting area and 32 of the world s rice production fao 2019 in the process of rice cultivation not only a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer is lost but also a large amount of water resources are consumed in china the total amount of irrigation water in rice production accounts for more than 60 of the country s total water consumption jiang et al 2017 in some areas rice production is affected by regional and seasonal droughts schewe et al 2014 and the further increase of industrial and urban water consumption has aggravated the problem of an agricultural water resources deficit liu et al 2013 therefore water saving irrigation technology wsi plays a key role in reducing water use during rice cultivation and is considered to be a promising management practice for sustainable rice production zhuang et al 2019 akter et al 2018 aziz et al 2018 several wsi technologies have been developed and popularized in china such as controlled irrigation shallow wet irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation dong et al 2018 towa and guo 2014 xu et al 2015 compared with other wsi technologies controlled irrigation had the highest average water saving rate and the highest average pollutant reducing rate zhuang et al 2019 usually wsi can increase or maintain the same yield as the conventional flooded irrigation regimen linquist et al 2015 however there are relevant studies that have obtained the opposite results this is because the ability to obtain a higher yield of rice after wsi is determined by many factors a suitable wsi regimen should be selected based on rice variety climate factors and soil type linquist et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the songnen plain is located in the middle of northeastern china and is the largest part of the northeast plain there are several rivers such as the songhua river and nenjiang river and 5 59 million hectares of arable land grain yields account for 6 4 more or less in china sun et al 2013 it is a very important zone from both agricultural and socio economic viewpoints and the black earth belt that runs north to south in the songnen plain is one of the world s three major black soil regions it has high organic matter and is china s most fertile soil its physicochemical properties are suitable for planting a variety of crops xu et al 2010 therefore the black soil area of the songnen plain has always been china s most important food production base between 1980 and 2016 the total grain output of the songnen plain had increased from 25 66 104 t to 72 70 105 t and the total fertilization had increased from 18 54 104 t in 1980 to 46 77 104 t in 2016 heilongjiang statistical yearbook 2017 due to the gradual increase of the nitrogen application rate and lack of reasonable management of field water and nitrogen this practice will inevitably lead to a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer entering the paddy field soil and water causing environmental pollution therefore in order to meet the grain demand caused by the growing population we aim to improve the absorption and utilization efficiency of fertilizer and nitrogen in rice by minimizing the water and nitrogen management regimen thus minimizing the negative impact on the environment from rice production it is necessary to systematically analyze the recovery efficiency and loss of nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system so as to provide a reference for the development of a new rice water nitrogen regulation regimen and higher nitrogen fertilizer recovery rate in this experiment the conventional flooded irrigation regimen was used as a control in the long term irrigation trial stations in the songnen plain and heping irrigation area the method of combining field plots with 15n traced micro zones was used to 1 quantify the differences in the partitioning of accumulated basal tillering panicle fertilizers nitrogen to different plant parts under controlled irrigation regimen 2 study the residues of nitrogen fertilizer in various soil layers of paddy soil under controlled irrigation regimen 3 evaluate the risk of various stages fertilizer n loss in rice soil systems of controlled irrigation regimen the research results will provide a reference for the selection of reasonable water and nitrogen control measures in the intensive cultivation system in each irrigation area of the songnen plain and have important significance for achieving food security as well as sustainable development of the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was carried out at the rice irrigation experiment station in heilongjiang province the station 127 40 45 e 46 57 28 n is located in the heping irrigation district in qing an county northeastern china as shown in fig 1 in spite of efforts to popularize the wsi regimen in paddy fields most of the farmers have obtained high yields by increasing the amount of fertilizers mostly nitrogen and the maximum amount of nitrogen fertilizers has reached 200 kg ha 1 which was found after a survey of 100 famers on over 200 ha rice field unreasonable rice irrigation and fertilization measures has led to the loss of soil organic matter and the imbalance of the ratio of n p and k eventually leading to the degradation of the black soil excessively high levels of nitrogen make a large amount of unutilized nitrogen remain in the form of nitrate in the soil be lost to the air in gaseous form or drain back into the songhua river and nenjiang river causing a greenhouse effect or water pollution respectively the average annual surface water evaporation in this area is 750 mm the hydrothermal growth period of the crop is 156 171 d and the frost free period is 128 d throughout the year the area has a cold temperate continental monsoon climate the soil type is black soil which is classified as a soft soil usda classification soil survey staff 1999 it is the main soil type in the songnen plain and rice has been planted in the experimental area for more than 20 years the soil is fertile and the soil nutrient content is stable the soil tillage thickness was 11 3 cm and the thickness of the plough base layer was 10 5 cm before transplanting and fertilizing the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers of the experimental plot were sampled the main soil physical and chemical properties of the soil were analyzed and are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and sample collection in the black soil region different experiments on water and fertilizer began in 2012 according to the factors such as the agronomic characteristics and yield of rice the optimal nitrogen application rate was 110 kg ha 1 in the paddy field of the black soil region based on which we focused on the effect of optimal nitrogen application on the ecological environment of rice fields from 2016 wang and zhang 2016 zheng et al 2018 the quantitative analysis of nitrogen transfer under the optimum nitrogen application rate was carried out by the 15n tracer method the experiment was conducted following a randomized block design and two irrigation regimens were used table 2 controlled irrigation c and conventional flooded irrigation f the nitrogen application rate was set at three levels pure nitrogen n1 85 kg ha 1 n2 110 kg ha 1 n3 135 kg ha 1 the experiment design details are shown in table 3 each treatment was repeated three times for a total of 18 test plots each cell has an area of 100 m2 10 m 10 m a 40 cm deep plastic plate was embedded between the plots to prevent underground water nitrogen exchange in each plot controlled irrigation of rice had no water layer in the rest of the growing stages except for the shallow water layer in the seeding stage of rice which was maintained at 0 30 mm and the natural dryness in the yellow mature stage the irrigation time and irrigation quota were determined by the root soil moisture content as the control index the upper limit of irrigation was the soil saturated moisture content the lower limit of soil moisture at each growth stage was the percentage of saturated moisture content and the tpime pico64 32 soil moisture analyzer was used to determine the soil moisture content at 7 00 a m and 18 00 p m respectively when the soil moisture content was close to or lower than the lower limit of irrigation artificial irrigation occurred until the upper irrigation limit was reached the soil moisture content was maintained between the upper irrigation limit and the lower irrigation limit of the corresponding fertility stage and the corresponding irrigation volume of each treatment was recorded in the conventional flooded irrigation regimen except that in order to control the invalid tillering of rice the appropriate drainage in the later stage of the tillage and the natural drying in the yellow ripe stage the rest of the paddy rice was maintained with a 3 5 cm water layer in the field and the surface water depth of the test plot was read through a pre embedded vertical ruler every day at 8 00 a m to determine if irrigation is needed a 15n traced micro zone was set up in the above test cell and one micro zone was set in each test cell three micro zone experiments three sub treatments were set under a single treatment table 3 shows the details of the trial processing settings sub plot 1 m1 was 15n urea only for the basal application and unlabeled common urea for tillering and panicle fertilizer sub plot 2 m2 was 15n urea only for tillering fertilizer and the basal and panicle fertilizers were not labeled urea sub plot 3 m3 15n urea only was applied for panicle fertilizer with unlabeled normal urea for basal and tillering a bottomless pvc rectangular box 1 m in length 1 m in width and 0 5 m in height was embedded in

produced by shanghai research institute of chemical industry shanghai china the nitrogen fertilizers phosphate fertilizers potash fertilizers and irrigation methods were the same as those used in the test plots in the pilot micro zone a small agricultural submersible pump was used to independently irrigate and drain micro zone and the rest of the field management was the same as that of the experimental plot nitrogenous fertilizers were applied to the test plots and micro area according to the basal fertilizer tillering fertilizer panicle fertilizer ratio of 4 5 2 3 5 the basal fertilizer was applied 1 day before rice was transplanted the tillering fertilizer was applied 24 days after transplanting and the panicle fertilizer was applied after 72 days of planting the amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were the same for all treatments p2o5 45 kg ha 1 and k2o 80 kg ha 1 were used phosphate fertilizer was applied before transplanting and potassium fertilizer was applied two times before transplanting and 8 5 leaf age the ratio before and after was 1 1 the trial used local rice variety longqingdao 3 to grow pre germinated seeds into seedlings in soil filled trays one week after the application of basal fertilizer the same rice seedlings were transplanted at a plant spacing of 16 67 cm and row spacing of 30 cm three plants per hole weeding was performed in all stages of rice growth to prevent and control pests and diseases so as not to affect rice nutrient absorption in both years 6 hills of plants were sampled randomly from each plot and micro zone at the maturity stage all plants were divided into leaf blade leaf stem plus sheath stem and panicle above ground and 0 60 cm underground roots first the sample was rinsed with running water then an agricultural compression atomizer was used to load fresh samples and roots of rice into sample bags the samples were taken to the laboratory and placed in a 105 c oven for 30 min and then dried at 70 c to constant weight afterwards the dried matter of rice shoots and roots was weighed the weighed samples were crushed using a ball mill according to their 15n abundance to prevent cross contamination between samples after smashing and 80 mesh screening the sample was placed in a sample bag and sealed at the same time soil samples were collected separately at 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm section soil samples from each plot and micro zone were collected using a two cm diameter hand operated core sample sample collection and processing always began with the control and low abundance samples and then followed by treated and high abundance samples in order to avoid 15n mixing the soil samples for the elemental analysis of each treatment were brought back to the laboratory stones roots and stems as well as various new bodies and intrusions were carefully removed from the soil soil samples from each layer of soil profile were weighed and mixed thoroughly then each sample was divided into two sets one for later analysis after air dried and ground into fine powder the total n content of soil and plants were determined using the kjeldahl determination method the other one for subsequent isotope measurement 2 3 laboratory analysis and data analysis 2 3 1 determination and calculation of 15n atomic percentile of rice plant samples the sealed and preserved rice plants roots and layers

irrigation 3 1 1 effect of wsi on nitrogen accumulation in various rice parts according to table 4 the amount of dry matter accumulation and nitrogen accumulation in the upper and underground parts of rice increased with the increase of nitrogen application under the two irrigation regimens compared with the nitrogen application rate of 85 kg ha 1 the nitrogen application rates of 110 kg ha 1 and 135 kg ha 1 for the rice under the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 13 27 and 27 52 the amount of nitrogen accumulation increased by 49 27 and 92 44 root dry weight increased by 5 09 and 6 83 and the amount of nitrogen accumulation increased by 5 60 and 7 34 respectively during the mature period of rice the comparison between treatments of different irrigation regimens showed that dry matter accumulation at the rice mature stage under the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 1 60 7 09 and 5 87 respectively the amount of nitrogen accumulation increased by 7 34 10 82 and 6 82 under the same nitrogen application respectively analysis of variance showed that the interaction of the irrigation regimen nitrogen application amount and nitrogen fertilizers significantly affected the accumulation of dry matter in the above ground part of rice but had no significant effect on the dry matter accumulation in roots for the amount of nitrogen applied to nitrogen accumulation in the aboveground organs of rice the effect of quantity was significant irrigation regimen only had a significant effect on nitrogen accumulation in the rice panicle but had no significant effect on nitrogen accumulation in other organs there was no interaction between irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer the results showed that the controlled irrigation regimen was more conducive to the accumulation of dry matter in aboveground rice and the uptake of nitrogen nutrients by rice plants resulting in water saving and high yield effects in addition to nitrogen fixing crops the nitrogen in other crops mainly comes from nitrogen fertilizer and soil under the two irrigation regimens the amount of nitrogen absorbed by rice from fertilizers and soil increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and the stimulating effect of soil was clear at the same time in the controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application rate the nitrogen absorbed by the rice from fertilizer and soil was higher than under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen when the amount of nitrogen application gradually increased the proportion of nitrogen in fertilizers gradually increased in the nitrogen accumulation of rice under both irrigation regimens and the proportion of soil nitrogen accumulation decreased fig 2 the distribution of fertilizer 15n in various organs of rice at maturity is shown in table 4 the accumulation of 15n fertilizer in various organs of rice increased with the increase of n application rate under the controlled irrigation regimen of rice the total accumulation of fertilizer 15n of rice at the same n application rate compared with conventional flooded irrigation increased by 38 49 3 30 and 1 06 and the accumulation of fertilizer 15n in various organs of rice under different water and nitrogen conditions showed panicle stems and sheaths leaves and roots from high to low according to the analysis of variance the interactions of the irrigation regimens nitrogen application rates and nitrogen fertilizers significantly affected the uptake of 15n in rice and the most significant effect was on the 15n accumulation in the panicles the amount of fertilizer 15n accumulation in the panicle increased by 1 60 7 09 and 5 87 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation at the same nitrogen application rate fig 3 3 1 2 different stages fertilizer 15n absorption and distribution of rice under water saving irrigation when 15n urea was only applied to the basal fertilizer 10 96 20 05 of the basal nitrogen applied under different water and nitrogen control was absorbed and utilized by rice plants including underground rice roots in addition to the low nitrogen application rate 85 kg ha 1 the recovery rate of the rice basal fertilizer under the two irrigation regimens was not significantly different in the 110 kg ha 1and 135 kg ha 1 n application rate of rice controlled irrigation regimen the nitrogen uptake and utilization of basal fertilizer were all lower compared with conventional flooded irrigation the recovery rate of basal fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen was reduced by 10 32 and 23 41 respectively under the controlled irrigation regimen 9 57 11 80 of nitrogen was absorbed in leaves 17 50 24 23 in stems and sheaths 63 97 72 93 in panicles and 6 38 7 90 in roots the proportions of basal nitrogen absorbed in the same nitrogen application amount in the two irrigation regimens were not significantly different in the leaves and root systems under the controlled irrigation regimen the proportion of nitrogen absorbed in the rice basal fertilizer was greater at the panicle than in the conventional flooded irrigation with an increase of 8 19 17 95 while under conventional flooded irrigation the accumulation of basal nitrogen in rice stem and sheath is higher when 15n urea was only applied as a tillering fertilizer 23 83 36 90 of tillering nitrogen fertilizers applied under different water and nitrogen conditions were absorbed and utilized by rice plants including underground rice roots the recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate under the controlled irrigation regimen the recovery rate of tillering fertilizer increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen but the absorption and utilization of tiller fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen was significantly better than that of the conventional flooded irrigation under the different nitrogen application rates compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the recovery rates of tillering nitrogen under the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 54 82 17 16 and 10 20 respectively under the controlled irrigation regimen 9 19 10 85 of tillering nitrogen was distributed in leaves 17 15 22 22 were distributed in stems and sheaths 60 66 67 73 were distributed in panicles and 5 43 7 07 were distributed in roots under the different nitrogen application rates the distribution of tillering nitrogen fertilizers absorbed by rice in the two irrigation regimens had no significant difference in the distribution of plant organs when 15n urea was only applied as a panicle fertilizer 33 78 63 54 of panicle nitrogen applied under different water and nitrogen conditions was absorbed and utilized by rice plants including underground rice roots the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer under both irrigation regimens increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and the nitrogen uptake and utilization of panicle fertilizer by rice under different nitrogen application rates under controlled irrigation regimen were significantly better than that of conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen increased by 48 81 4 22 and 8 99 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the controlled irrigation regimen 9 04 11 94 of panicle fertilizers nitrogen were distributed in leaves 19 95 33 51 were distributed in stems and sheaths 47 96 63 85 were distributed in panicles and 6 89 7 16 were distributed in rice roots under the different nitrogen application rates the distribution of panicle fertilizers nitrogen for the rice absorbed by the two irrigation regimens had no significant difference among the organs 3 2 residues of different stages nitrogen fertilizer in soil under wsi in the two irrigation regimens the total residual amount of fertilizer 15n in soil increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate from analysis of variance the total residual amount of fertilizer 15n in soil was significantly affected by the irrigation regimen and nitrogen application rate table 5 in the same n application amount the controlled irrigation regimen had higher residual levels of fertilizer 15n in paddy field soil after rice harvest under the three nitrogen application levels compared with conventional flooded irrigation and they increased by 10 29 10 79 and 18 30 moreover 36 36 37 12 of the total n fertilizer applied under the controlled irrigation regimen remained in the paddy soil which increased by 10 28 10 79 and 18 30 compared with conventional flooded irrigation although the total residual nitrogen in the soil under the two irrigation regimens increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate the total residual rate of each stage 15n fertilizer in the soil decreased with the amount of nitrogen applied the gradual reduction means that more nitrogen is lost to the paddy field through other channels which causes environmental problems by comparing and analyzing the nitrogen fertilizer residue in different soil layers under the two irrigation regimens we can see that fertilizer 15n has the highest residue in the soil surface 0 20 cm under different nitrogen application rates for the two different irrigation regimens under the controlled irrigation regimen the residue of fertilizer n in the 0 20 cm soil layers increased by 41 50 53 95 and 53 88 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the nitrogen residue in the 20 40 cm soil layer decreased by 9 64 20 48 and 4 00 respectively the residual volume in the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased by 12 69 21 91 and 17 39 respectively the results showed that the residue of fertilizer 15n in rice was mainly concentrated in the topsoil of paddy fields under the controlled irrigation regimen of paddy rice while under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the fertilizer 15n had moved to the lower layer of soil with water which is a threat to the safety of groundwater resources for the residual status of 15n fertilizer in soil under different nitrogen application rates for the two irrigation regimens it was found that residues were highest in the topsoil 0 20 cm and the amount of residual fertilizer in the soil surface increased with the increase of n application rate in each stage with the increase in soil depth 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm fertilizer residue gradually decreased when only 15n urea was applied as the basal fertilizer 29 68 32 72 of the total nitrogen application of the basal fertilizer in the controlled irrigation regimen with different nitrogen application rates remained in the paddy soil and increased by 12 28 16 63 and 24 84 under the same nitrogen application rate compared to conventional flooded irrigation fig 4 comparing the residual amounts of basal 15n in different soil layers under the same nitrogen application level it was observed that the basal 15n of rice in the controlled irrigation regimen of rice has a higher residue at 0 20 cm under the controlled irrigation regimen the residue of basal 15n in the 0 20 cm soil layers increased by 52 10 66 69 and 67 36 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate residues in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers were lower under the controlled irrigation regimen the residue of basal 15n in the 20 40 cm soil layers decreased by 52 10 66 69 and 67 36 40 60 cm soil layers decreased by 18 93 13 40 and 16 60 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate when 15n urea was only applied as the tillering fertilizer the total residual amount of tillering fertilizer nitrogen in the soil layers accounted for 54 88 57 33 of the total amount of tillering nitrogen fertilizer applied fig 4 compared with conventional flooded irrigation regimens the total residual nitrogen content of rice tillering fertilizer in paddy soil increased by 9 19 11 11 and 23 84 with controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application level with the increase in nitrogen application rate the increase of tillering nitrogen residue in rice under the controlled irrigation regimen was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation and the residual tillering nitrogen in rice was controlled at 0 20 cm in the same nitrogen application level compared with conventional flooded irrigation regimens the residual nitrogen content of rice tillering fertilizer in 0 20 cm paddy soil increased by 40 77 46 95 and 62 51 with controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application level while the residual nitrogen of tillering nitrogen was higher in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the tillering nitrogen fertilizer residue in the 20 40 cm soil layer increased by 18 33 30 19 and 4 41 the nitrogen content of tillering nitrogen in the 40 60 cm soil layer increased by 14 50 25 74 and 28 28 compared with the controlled irrigation regimen when only 15n urea was applied as the panicle fertilizer the total panicle nitrogen residue in the soil layer under the different nitrogen application levels was 29 37 35 42 of the total panicle nitrogen fertilizer application fig 4 compared with the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the total residual nitrogen of the panicle fertilizer in the paddy field soil increased by 9 21 3 38 and 6 52 under the same nitrogen application level with controlled irrigation regimen the residual nitrogen of panicle fertilizer in 0 20 cm soil layer were increased by 30 74 45 54 and 29 93 compared with conventional flooded irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application rate while under the conventional flooded irrigation regimen the residual nitrogen in panicle fertilizers was higher in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers the residual panicle nitrogen fertilizers in 20 40 cm soil layer were increased by 3 64 17 92 and 9 95 while the panicle nitrogen fertilizers in 40 60 cm soil layer increased by 6 06 44 86 and 16 55 compared with controlled irrigation regimen under the same nitrogen application rate 3 3 recovery and loss rate of fertilizer 15n in the rice soil system in paddy rice under wsi under the rice controlled irrigation regimen the nitrogen recovery rate of fertilizers increased with the increase of the nitrogen application rate but the residual rate of nitrogen fertilizer in soil decreased with the increase of the nitrogen application rate fig 4 the recoveries of nitrogen fertilizers in rice soil systems at different n rates were 69 18 74 19 which increased with the increase of nitrogen application within a certain range fig 5 compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate the recovery rates of nitrogen fertilizer in rice soil under the controlled irrigation regimen of rice increased by 21 78 6 89 and 8 72 respectively the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system was reduced by 28 64 15 42 and 18 73 respectively the loss of nitrogen was reduced by 16 96 to 25 29 kg ha 1 in the amount of nitrogen applied in this experiment studies have shown that the controlled irrigation regimen of rice in the songnen plain can effectively reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer and the effect of reducing nitrogen loss and increasing nitrogen use efficiency at a low nitrogen application rate 85 kg ha 1 is more significant when 15n urea was only applied as the basal fertilizer the recovery rate of basal fertilizer in the rice soil system was 41 46 48 85 with controlled irrigation regimen under different nitrogen application rates compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the rice controlled irrigation regimen the absorption and utilization of nitrogen on the basal fertilizer was lower but the basal nitrogen content in the soil was higher in this irrigation regimen therefore the recovery rate of basal fertilizer with controlled irrigation regimen in rice soil system is higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation the recoveries of tillering nitrogen in rice soil systems were the highest among basal tillering and panicle fertilizers under the controlled irrigation regimen and only 4 15 15 80 of the tillering nitrogen was lost to the environment the loss rate of conventional flooded irrigated fertilizer decreased by 81 42 70 61 and 27 24 under the same nitrogen application rate which effectively reduced the loss of nitrogen fertilizer when only 15n urea was applied as the panicle fertilizer the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer in rice soil system was 89 57 93 80 and only 6 20 10 43 of the panicle fertilizer had nitrogen loss under the same nitrogen application rate the rice soil loss rate of conventional flooded irrigation panicle fertilizer decreased by 65 97 39 76 and 33 60 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation rice controlled irrigation can effectively reduce the loss of nitrogen in fertilizers furthermore by further studying the reduction of basal nitrogen n losses controlled irrigation regimen can further improve the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer in rice and reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer 4 discussion the changes in rice planting area grain yield and nitrogen fertilizer input in the songnen plain from 1980 to 2016 are shown in fig 6 the grain yield of the songnen plain increased from 25 66 104 t to 72 70 105 t and the yield increased by 70 13 105 t the growth trend of grain production from 1980 to 2016 was fitted by the logistic function r2 0 66 the planting area of rice increased from 75 400 ha in 1980 to 13 73 105 ha in 2016 the change in the trend of the rice planting area from 1980 to 2016 also met the logistic function r2 0 67 the increase in grain production between 1980 and 2016 was not only due to the increase in rice planting area but also to the increase in productivity in 1980 the yield per hectare of arable land was only 3403 kg in 2016 the output per hectare of cultivated land increased to 5295 kg in order to increase production the application of nitrogen fertilizer has increased significantly since the 1980s the application of nitrogen fertilizer is mainly based on urea the total amount of fertilizers has increased from 18 54 104 t in 1980 to 46 77 104 t in 2016 the rate of fertilizer n application remained high at the end of the year and the growth trend was consistent with the logistic function r2 0 75 it can be seen that the application of nitrogen fertilizer has a significant impact on the agricultural production of the songnen plain and the application rate of nitrogen fertilizer still shows a relatively high growth rate as shown in fig 7 the nitrogen application rate per hectare in the songnen plain has remained at a relatively high level since 2007 and then due to the optimization of nitrogen application methods and the popularization of scientific and rational fertilization techniques the application rate of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare is decreasing year by year although the application amount of nitrogen fertilizer is decreasing year by year the fluctuation of grain yield per hectare is small and increases slightly in 2016 the nitrogen fertilizer application amount in rice fields in the songnen plain was 141 36 kg ha 1 which was significantly lower than the national average nitrogen application rate of 189 20 kg ha 1 the partial fertilizer productivity pfp per hectare yield n application rate per hectare of the songnen plain between 1980 and 2016 was analyzed and compared it can be seen that the pfp is decreasing year by year and the higher application of nitrogen fertilizer from 1980 to 2007 has led to lower pfp and pfp still remains at a low level after the nitrogen fertilizer application amount after 2007 was reduced a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer is not absorbed and utilized by plants resulting in a series of environmental problems therefore research and development of scientific and reasonable water and nitrogen management measures are necessary it is of great significance to achieve food security and sustainable development of the environment the 15n tracer technique was used in this experiment the application of basal fertilizer 15n tillering fertilizer 15n and panicle fertilizer 15n separately was used to overcome the traditional fertilizer utilization which can only represent the utilization of the total nitrogen fertilizer in rice growing process based on the determination of plant and soil samples the application of basal fertilizer tillering fertilizer and panicle nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system and the total recovery and loss rate of nitrogen fertilizer in rice soil system were estimated the results showed that the total recovery rate of rice to fertilizer 15n was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation under controlled irrigation regimen and the total nitrogen accumulation in rice was 16 62 23 89 from fertilizer 15n and the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer 54 15 68 38 was the highest in the controlled irrigation regimen it was significantly higher than the recovery rate of basal fertilizer 11 78 16 4 and the recovery rate of tiller fertilizer 37 49 39 02 which was similar to the results reported by lin lin et al 2014 studies have shown that under normal conditions the uptake of nitrogen in the basal fertilizer is less than 10 wang et al 2011 the recovery rate of rice to basal fertilizer is slightly higher than 10 in the two irrigation regimens but the no water layer field management regimen is used after the seeding period of rice in the controlled irrigation regimen in this period the management of wsi will inhibit the growth of rice to a certain extent so that the uptake of nitrogen by rice is lower than that of the conventional flooded irrigation regimen xue et al 2013 observed that site specific nitrogen management and alternate wetting and moderate drying increase the grain yield by 14 4 and nitrogen agronomic utilization by 64 1 when compared with the local farmers practice indicating that good root morphology and increased root metabolism contributed to high grain yield and high nitrogen use efficiency through the appropriate regulation of water interaction with nitrogen application in rice xu et al 2018 in this study under the controlled irrigation regimen the utilization ratio of tiller fertilizer and the utilization ratio of panicle fertilizer increased by 10 34 52 28 and 5 15 46 69 respectively compared with conventional flooded irrigation under the same nitrogen application rate this is due to the clear compensatory effect of wsi on the growth of rice in later stage yin et al 2017 yan et al 2018 the root morphology of rice was improved in the main growth period under proper management of water application root physiological activity was strengthened xu et al 2018 and the damage degree of the reducing substance such as fe2 h2s to the cells was decreased yang et al 2004 ju et al 2015 which is beneficial to the absorption and utilization of nitrogen in the later period of rice islam et al 2018 yin et al 2017 although the total recovery rate of rice to fertilizer 15n is higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation under controlled irrigation there is still a problem of low fertilizer 15n absorption of basal fertilizer which awaits further study and the rate of fertilizer 15n recovery under wsi is further increased by rational field management the fertilizer 15n had a higher recovery rate and higher residue in the soil under the controlled irrigation regimen the fertilizer 15n of total fertilizer applied under the controlled irrigation regimen was 35 36 37 12 residue in paddy soil and the soil residue rate of fertilizer in this experiment was higher than that in other parts of china because the black soil had strong water retention and fertilizer ability therefore the residue of nitrogen fertilizer in soil is higher under the controlled irrigation regimen the soil residue of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation this may be due to good soil permeability and high oxygen content under water saving irrigation which improves soil microbial and enzyme activities is conducive to the conversion of fertilizer nitrogen enhances soil nitrogen fixation capacity and increases fertilizer nitrogen residue hu et al 2017 under normal circumstances nearly 30 of the nitrogen fertilizer in the form of inorganic nitrogen residues in the soil nh4 n is the predominant and preferred form of n in flooded soils george et al 1992 it adsorbs on soil colloids stays longer and leads to lower percolation loss cassman et al 1998 while the controlled irrigation regimen nitrogen fertilizer more than the form of nitrate nitrogen residue in the rice after harvesting the residue of a large number of nitrate nitrogen very easily leaches deep into the soil causing pollution of groundwater resources studies have shown that controlled irrigation has the benefit of reducing n2o emissions especially important for poorly draining black soils lower soil water contents will also reduce denitrification losses of no3 reducing an agronomic loss of n vogeler et al 2019 more frequent irrigation did have a benefit of reducing nh3 emissions thus the recoveries of tillering nitrogen in rice soil systems were the highest among basal tillering and panicle fertilizers under the controlled irrigation regimen the results of our study show that compared with conventional flooded irrigation the application of rice as a controlled irrigation regimen in the black soil area of songnen plain is characterized by high recovery and low loss but there are also some problems of higher nitrogen fertilizer soil residue rate and lower basal nitrogen recovery rate of rice it is necessary to adjust the water management measures of the irrigation regimen and the corresponding nitrogenous fertilizer management methods to improve the nitrogen recovery rate of the fertilizer and reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in different periods 5 conclusions the use of controlled irrigation regimen on rice in the black soil region of the songnen plain in china can effectively increase the absorption and utilization of nitrogen fertilizer reduce the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in the rice soil system and play a role in saving water and reducing emissions the total recovery rate of rice in the rice soil system was 69 18 74 19 under the different nitrogen application rates and the nitrogen recovery rate of the basal fertilizer was 41 46 48 85 the nitrogen recovery rate of the nitrogen fertilizer was 84 20 95 85 nitrogen recovery rate of panicle fertilizer was 89 57 93 80 the total recovery rate of nitrogen fertilizer in rice plants was 32 05 38 83 the recovery rate of basal fertilizer was 11 78 16 44 the recovery rate tillering fertilizer was 37 49 39 02 and the recovery rate of panicle fertilizer was 54 15 68 38 because black soil has a strong ability to maintain water and nutrients nitrogen fertilizer has a large residual amount in the paddy soil and 35 36 37 12 of the total nitrogen fertilizer applied remains in the paddy soil higher than conventional flooded irrigation regimen therefore it is necessary to fully consider the implementation of a rice controlled irrigation regimen and optimize nitrogen application in the black soil area of songnen plain which can meet the increasing demand of grain and reduce the threat to the environment caused by nitrogen fertilizer loss in this experiment the total recovery rate of fertilizer in rice soil system with controlled irrigation regimen was higher than that of conventional flooded irrigation which played the role of saving water and reducing emission but the rate of nitrogen recovery of rice to basal fertilizer was only 11 78 16 44 significantly lower than that of conventional flooded irrigation regimen future work includes adjusting the water nitrogen regulation regimen or fertilization method in the rice field at the early growth stage in order to improve the nitrogen recovery rate of the basal fertilizer under the controlled irrigation regimen improving the uptake and utilization rate of nitrogen in rice under the controlled irrigation regimen of rice and reducing the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in rice soil system acknowledgment this work was supported

10954,an experimental trial of 45 days was conducted with different nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus to spinach spinacia oleracea ratios in a recirculating aquaponics system using inland saline groundwater of salinity 3 g l 1 different fish to plant ratios t1 1 0 7 t2 1 1 t3 1 1 3 and c1 aquaponics without plants c2 without hydroponic component were assigned as treatments and control groups respectively total yield of o niloticus 4 69 0 04 kg m 3 spinach yield 1 42 0 02 kg bed and percentage removal of nitrate 50 43 0 11 phosphate 47 62 2 20 and potassium 54 26 1 23 from the effluent was found to be higher in t3 the daily water requirement of t1 t2 t3 and c1 1 16 1 29 was significantly lower compared to c2 17 67 findings of the experiment suggest that aquaponics is feasible with low saline underground water and a ratio of 1 1 3 nile tilapia spinach is the best among tested ratios for balancing nutrient generation and removal as well as fish and plant production however further studies using higher fish to plant ratio could be carried out for optimisation of such systems keywords spinach nile tilapia saline underground water aquaponics 1 introduction salinization and water scarcity are the most severe constraints confronting sustainable agriculture production systems in semi arid and arid regions its intensity has expanded in past decades due to poor management of land and water resources unprecedented regional as well as global climate change and variability wong et al 2010 and led to an increased pressure on freshwater resources as the shortage of freshwater is becoming an important issue in the arid and semi arid zones concerns about the utilization of poor quality saline underground water has been amplified the optimal and multiple use of water is the key to resource sustainability in arid and semi arid regions in many countries saline ground water is used as an option for irrigation of saline tolerant agriculture crops rhoades 1984 grattan and oster 2003 sharma and minhas 2005 and also for aquaculture purposes boyd and thunjai 2003 allan et al 2009 aquaculture in arid and semi arid regions has increased economic and social impact through production of food livelihood security and income generation but confronted with the issue of environment protection chithambaran 2016 however aquaculture is the only way to satisfy the increasing seafood demand in the context of declining ocean fish stock considering stringent government regulations and increased awareness of the impact of aquaculture wastewater on receiving waters there is a need for the development of new technologies and innovations to make the aquaculture industry more sustainable and economically viable boyd et al 1998 aquaponics is one such technology developed to achieve more efficient use of water maximizing farm production without increasing water consumption avoiding deposition of aquaculture effluents and supplementing additional fertilizer to the agricultural crops mariscal lagarda et al 2012 aquaponics is a recirculating aquaculture system that incorporates the production of plants without soil in aquaponics the nutrient rich effluent from the fish tank which contains waste products of the fish metabolism and uneaten feed is used to fertigate hydroponic plant bed where the nutrients are sequestrated by plants which in turn is transformed into a valuable resource the effluent is treated through the process of nitrification and nutrient uptake in the plant component and returned to the fish rearing tanks rakocy et al 2006 aquaponics forms a closed loop system where fish plant bacteria live and work together to form a mini ecosystem current aquaponics research has mostly focused on integrating freshwater fish and plant species rakocy et al 2004 enduta et al 2011 shete et al 2013 hussain et al 2015 nuwansi et al 2016 but freshwater resource for food production agriculture and aquaculture is becoming increasingly limited and at the same time salinisation is progressively increasing in many parts of the world turcios and papenbrock 2014 this has led us to an interest in the use of saline underground water for aquaponics by replacing freshwater and stocking with euryhaline or saltwater fish and salt tolerant plants developing a suitable saline aquaponics with salt tolerant plants and fishes can help in sustainable food production in arid and semi arid lands where the underground water is saline the selection of compatible plant and fish species and an optimum fish to plant ratio to maintain nutrient balance is of critical importance regarding suitability for aquaponics production tilapia which belongs to the family cichlidae is the world s second most important farmed food fish after carps and is also the most preferred fish for experimental as well as commercial aquaponics based production systems maucieri et al 2018 love et al 2014 among tilapia species oreochromis niloticus commonly known as nile tilapia is the most preferred and widely cultured species owing to its faster growth ability to survive in poor water quality tolerance to high stocking densities and adaptability to tank based culture systems and ease of handling popma and lovshin 1995 nile tilapia is also known to have wide range of salinity tolerance and has the maximum biomass gain in the salinity range of 0 10 g l 1 villegas 1990 spinach spinacia oleracea which belongs to the family amaranthaceae is one of the perennial leafy vegetable grown throughout the world in greenhouses polyhouses and hydroponic systems as well spinach has an excellent nutritional value and health benefits spinach contains high levels of vitamins and minerals viz vitamin a vitamin b vitamin k vitamin c vitamin b2 and b6 phosphorus iron potassium folate betaine copper protein manganese zinc niacin selenium and omega 3 avsar 2011 spinach is one of the main vegetables cultured in aquaponics systems because it grows rapidly in response to the high levels of nutrients in aquaculture water petrea et al 2013 the objective of the present study is to find out the feasibility of bio integration of nile tilapia and spinach in inland saline groundwater and to determine the best ratio for such system in terms of production performance and nutrient balancing 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a 45 days study was conducted at icar central institute of fisheries education regional centre lahli rohtak india 28 86 n 76 47 e small scale aquaponic systems consisting of 15 individual identical aquaponics unit were installed in a greenhouse 6 10 m 4 57 m with polyethylene roofing sheet and knitted shade net of hdpe fabric as side walls supported by gi frames fig 1 the aquaponic system was harboured in a two floor structure with each individual unit containing a circular fish tanks of 100 l water volume 75 l capacity which were placed 0 3 m below the ground level and plant grow bed of 0 52 m2 0 93 m 0 56 m area placed 0 2 m above the ground level hydroponic plant grow beds were filled with cleaned gravels having a size of 1 5 2 0 cm to a thickness of 25 27 cm siphon bells were used to create a flood and drain system in plant grow beds the effluent from the fish tank was pumped to the plant grow bed using 15 w submersible pump t kango tk 380 pumping frequency was controlled by automatic timer saia burgess controls and a flow rate of 250 l hour 1 was maintained the water from the grow bed returned to the fish tank by gravity through a 20 mm pvc drain pipe which was connected to the bell siphon the aquaponics bed took 7 min for complete drainage and 3 min for filling continuous aeration was provided to each fish tank the rearing tanks were covered with 15 mm plastic net to prevent the fish from jumping out of the tank inland saline water with a salinity of 3 g l 1 used in the experiment has been made by diluting 10 g l 1 borewell water pumped from high saline zone with freshwater the experimental fish were acclimatized to 3 g l 1 by progressively increasing the salinity at the rate of 0 5 g l 1 day 1 for 6 days the experimental design consisted of 3 treatments each having three assigned replicates each treatment was allotted with different fish to plant ratio viz t1 t2 t3 in the ratio 1 0 7 1 1 1 1 3 respectively and compared with controls c1 aquaponics without plants and c2 fish without aquaponics in all treatments and controls the fingerlings were provided with commercial floating feed 32 protein at a constant feeding rate of 5 of body weight equally divided in two dosages twice a day in the morning 10 00 am and evening 5 00 pm hours siphoning and water replacement was done on daily basis in c2 the water replacement in c2 and water addition to compensate for evaporative losses in c1 t1 t2 and t3 was done with the water of salinity 3 g l 1 2 2 stocking initially the system was operated for 12 days with 10 numbers of fish averaging 5 gm weight and fed at 5 of body weight to enhance the ammonia level in the system to promote growth of nitrifying bacteria thereafter the fishes were removed and the tanks were stocked with fingerlings of tilapia 200 fishes m 3 the mean weight and length of fish at the time of stocking was 5 89 0 04 g and 7 49 0 06 cm respectively the stocking density of fish remained the same for all treatments and controls seeds of spinach were sown in nursery trays 50 25 cm made of plastic having 120 cavities and filled with coconut husk medium plantlets were allowed to grow for 20 days before transplanting to hydroponics tank at varying density 20 30 40 m 2 the size of plants at the time of transplanting was 9 60 0 06 cm 2 3 sampling sampling of fishes was carried out at 15 days interval for assessment of growth length and weight and health the length was measured with the help of a graduated ruler while the weight was recorded with the aid of an electronic balance growth of plants was observed by measuring height of plants length and width of leaves by the end of experiment spinach was harvested 2 4 water quality analysis water quality parameters were analyzed at an interval of 10 days the water temperature was measured by thermometer and ph was measured by using hand held ph meter hanna hi98130 salinity was measured using hand held refractometer atago s mill e japan other parameters such as dissolved oxygen total hardness alkalinity total dissolved solids ammonia nitrite nitrate and phosphorus were analyzed using the standard methods apha 2005 the na and k levels were analyzed using flame photometry microprocessor flame photometer model 1382 esico haryana india calcium and magnesium content of the water was estimated titrimetrically following the standard methods apha 2005 2 5 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using statistical package spss version 22 where one way anova and tukey s honest significant difference test tukey s hsd were applied at a significance level of p 0 05 95 confidence limit to know the significant difference between the treatments and control means for different parameters 3 result and discussion 3 1 fish growth parameters choice of different fish to plant ratio had significant bearing on the growth rates in nile tilapia overall growth performance of nile tilapia in different treatments is shown in table 1 the initial mean body weight had insignificant difference among treatments but at the end of experimental trial it was observed that some of the treatment groups registered a significant difference p 0 05 in mean body weight gain by administering the optimal feeding rate 5 of body weight for tilapia as recommended by deyab and hussein 2015 the yield in t3 4 69 0 04 kg m 3 t2 4 57 0 02 kg m 3 and t1 4 43 0 04 kg m 3 were significantly higher than those in c1 4 26 0 03 kg m 3 and c2 3 94 0 03 kg m 3 the lowest yield observed in control c2 3 94 0 03 kg m 3 can be due to the higher level of ammonia present in the culture water indicating that nitrification was negligible or absent nitrifying bacteria require surface for adhesion and prolifeartion which was relatively lesser in c2 than compared to c1 and other treatments gravels used in the aquaponics bed provide larger surface for colonisation of nitrifying bacterial population crab et al 2007 the fish growth was found to increase with higher plant density as more number of plant provided better biofiltration and improved the water quality atle et al 2003 sten et al 2004 and lemarie et al 2004 reported that growth rate of fish decreased when concentrations of ammonia increased increased ammonia levels in culture system is known to manifest its effect by lowering feed intake and also by reducing feed conversion efficiency schram et al 2010 at the end of the experiment highest percentage weight gain was observed in t3 292 88 1 52 which did not differ significantly from the values observed in t2 284 61 3 42 but did differ significantly from that of t1 273 62 3 34 a similar trend was observed in specific growth rate sgr with values in t3 t2 and t1 being 3 04 0 01 day 1 2 99 0 02 day 1 and 2 92 0 02 day 1 respectively both sgr and percentage weight gain found in various treatments varied significantly from control groups by the end of experiment the survival rate of 100 observed in all the treatments indicates that different fish to plant ratio had no influence on survival of fishes the mean length of fish also did not vary significantly p 0 05 among any of treatments fcr of t3 1 37 0 01 t2 1 41 0 01 and t1 1 47 0 02 differed significantly p 0 05 from c1 1 56 0 02 and c2 1 74 0 01 the feed efficiency ratio fer values were significantly similar in t3 0 72 0 01 and t2 0 70 0 01 but varied significantly from t1 0 67 0 01 c1 0 63 0 01 and c2 0 57 0 01 protein efficiency ratio per also exhibited a similar trend as that of fer with higher values in t3 and t2 2 27 0 02 and 2 20 0 01 and lowest in c2 1 78 0 01 which varied significantly fcr of the present study ranged from 1 37 t3 to 1 7 c2 which is in accordance with the result of al hafedh et al 2008 where fcr for nile tilapia ranged from 1 0 to 1 7 in the present study the variation in fcr may be attributed to the variation in ammonia concentration in the culture water and also to the non consumption of feed supplied to the fish tank completely in c1 and c2 one of the common behavioural responses to stress in fish is the reduced feed intake and or disruption of the feeding behaviour el shafai et al 2004 found that mean feed conversion ratio of oreochromis niloticus decreased as ammonia concentrations increased the sgr was found to decrease with increase in ammonia concentration the same was reported by harris et al 1998 and atle et al 2003 who found that sgr decreases with the increasing concentration of ammonia and it is primarily due to reduced food intake 3 2 plant growth parameters plant growth is another important criterion to correlate the suitability or efficiency of aquaponic system plant plays an important role in nutrient dynamics of aquaponics system as the biofilter component spinach spinacia oleracea was seen to grow well with the nutrients from tilapia fish culture water without the addition of extra nutrients at the end of the growth period 45 days the plants reached the market size with average height of 38 43 cm table 2 lenard and lennard 2006 while comparing different systems for growing spinach in an aquaponics system recommended gravel bed or floating raft over the nutrient film technique good growth of spinach even with water of higher salinity and ec value is an interesting observation gravel bed technique allows for intermittent submergence and exposure of plant root system to water as compared to the continuous submergence of the roots in nutrient film technique intermittent exposure and submergence will reduce the osmotic stress to the plant root and that might have been the reason for the luxurious growth of spinach even in water with high salt content salinity of 3 g l 1 and ec value of 4 4 to 5 ds cm 1 owing to these reasons gravel bed system was used in the present study at the time of harvest the overall height percentage height gain leaf length and leaf width of spinach did not show any significant difference p 0 05 in any of the treatment groups similar growth performance of spinach in all the treatments can be due to the presence of excess nutrients in the system it will not contribute extra to the productivity and quality of the crop when absorption of nutrients exceeds a threshold luxury absorption hansen 1977 but the yield of spinach varied significantly p 0 05 with increasing number of plant densities and highest yield was recorded in t3 1 42 0 02 kg bed followed by t2 1 07 0 02 kg bed and t1 0 85 0 01 kg bed the results of present study is comparable with results of the hussain et al 2014 where fish to plant ratio of 1 1 4 was found to be optimum for spinach koi carp aquaponics system however as the plant growth was luxurious even at the highest fish to plant ratio chosen in this experiment it would be interesting to carry out further trials with higher fish to plant ratios 3 3 water quality parameters and nutrient dynamics all the water quality parameters measured are presented in table 3 water temperature is one of the important factors responsible for optimum fish growth plant growth and performance of nitrifying bacteria in biofilter the water temperature was found to be influenced by seasonal changes with higher values at the start of experiment and comparatively lower values by the end of experiment varied from 25 5 32 00c with an average of 28 30c but no marked variation was observed in any of the treatment groups optimum growth for tilapia is achieved at 27 to 29 c rakocy and brunson 1989 ndakidemi et al 2009 studied the effect of regulated irrigation water temperature on hydroponics production of spinach spinacia oleracea and optimum growth was recorded at 28 c the mean value of salinity of water did not show any significant difference p 0 05 among treatments and control ph of the water from different tanks ranged from 7 4 to 7 8 during the study period but no marked variation among the treatments and control and these levels are within the optimum range of 6 9 for the bacteria in the nitrification filter wheaton et al 1994 and within the tolerance range of 5 11 for tilapia chervinski 1982 maintenance of adequate dissolved oxygen d o in culture water is important for fish health and biofilter performance hussain et al 2015 delong et al 2009 recommended dissolved oxygen d o levels between 5 0 and 7 5 mg l 1 for acceptable growth in tilapia and masser et al 1999 recommended 2 mg l 1 for efficient performance of nitrifying bacteria the mean dissolved oxygen content of the present study falls within the recommended limits and ranged between 5 74 5 33 mg l 1 with no significant difference in any of the treatments the alkalinity and hardness of the culture water was high throughout the experiment since the water used for the study was saline underground water higher level of hardness as observed in this case could be explained by high level of calcium and magnesium in the borewell water used for the experiment total alkalinity values was found significantly similar p 0 05 in all the treatment groups lawson 1995 reported a permissible limit of 50 500 mg l 1 as caco3 alkalinity in an aquaponic system the mean value of alkalinity of different treatment groups ranged from 124 20 to 138 73 mg l 1 as caco3 and was found within the permissible limit the total hardness was also observed to be significantly similar p 0 05 in all the groups although it was slightly higher in c1 854 21 1 48 mg l 1 followed by t1 848 93 2 59 mg l 1 c2 847 87 2 67 mg l 1 and t2 838 27 2 58 mg l 1 due to the accumulation of nutrients whereas lower hardness was recorded in t3 831 93 2 42 mg l 1 ammonia is the principal nitrogenous waste product of fishes and is normally oxidized first to nitrite and then to nitrate it is also the main nitrogenous waste material excreted by gills beside urea and amines the suggested value of ammonia in a recirculating aquaculture system ras should be less than 1 00 mg l 1 van rijn and rivera 1990 nijhof and bovendeur 1990 in the present study total ammonia nitrogen tan was significantly higher in c2 0 61 0 01 mg l l but tan concentration was found to be similar in c1 0 30 0 01 mg l l t1 0 25 0 02 mg l l t2 0 23 0 01 mg l l while t3 0 18 0 02 mg l l had significantly lower concentration of the same all the values recorded were found within the optimum limit recommended for ras lower levels of tan in the treatments with more number of plants indicated the efficiency of spinach plants to uptake ammonium ion from the culture wastewater in the aquaponics system ammonium nh4 is one of the major sources of inorganic nitrogen taken up by the roots of higher plants vaillant et al 2004 as plants take up nh4 some of the nh3 is converted to nh4 to maintain equilibrium the net result is that the amount of nh3 decreases tyson et al 2011 during the experiment nitrite nitrogen did not show any significant difference between treatments and control eissa et al 2015 found optimum range of nitrite 0 02 1 23 mg l 1 for aquaponic and nitrite level of the present study was found to be within the limit the mean nitrate nitrogen concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 among treatments the higher nitrate nitrogen level was observed in c1 47 76 1 79 mg l 1 followed by t1 33 29 0 39 mg l 1 t2 27 68 0 26 mg l 1 t3 23 87 0 29 mg l 1 whereas lowest nitrate nitrogen level was observed in c2 1 65 1 89 mg l 1 the nitrate in culture water was found to increase with decreasing plant density results of this study coincide with nair et al 1985 rakocy and hargreaves 1993 and seawright et al 1998 who found that no3 2 accumulated the most in waste water from the fish according to watson and hill 2006 no3 2 should be maintained below 100 mg l 1 in aquaponics and the nitrate level in the present study was within the recommended range as the plant density increased the nitrate level in culture water decreased this shows that spinach plants effectively removed nitrates in treatments nitrate n is relatively harmless and is the preferred form of nitrogen for growing higher plants rakocy et al 2006 except calcium all other nutrients like phosphate potassium magnesium and sodium showed significantly higher values in c1 compared to other treatments clearly indicates the efficiency of spinach to uptake nutrients the mean phosphate concentration during the study varied significantly p 0 05 among all the treatments and control these nutrients were found to accumulate in control group without plants and decreased with increase in plant density adler et al 1996 found that differences in nutrient removal rates were dependent on plant number and effluent flow rate da silva cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016 recorded a phosphorus availability of less than 2 mg l 1 in aquaponic system similarly in the present study the po4 p level ranged between 0 15 1 15 mg l 1 lower phosphorus level could be due to high calcium level in the culture water sheikh et al 1989 reported a greater avidity of ca2 towards phosphorus and its consequent precipitation hussain et al 2015 noted a potassium level of 14 2 19 6 mg l 1 in aquaponic water without any potassium supplementation whereas in the present study potassium level in t3 was found to be below the reported range with 5 38 mg l 1 which could be due to the low level of potassium in inland saline groundwater in addition to active absorption by plants the mean concentration of magnesium and sodium varied significantly p 0 05 between treatments and controls with highest accumulation in c1 similar results was reported by shete et al 2015 where a significantly lower level of potassium calcium sodium magnesium iron and zinc was found with higher plant to fish component ratio in common carp mint aquaponics system percentage nutrient removal of nitrate phosphate and potassium is depicted in fig 2 the result shows that all the treatments t1 t2 and t3 effectively removed the nutrients with highest nutrient removal in t3 with maximum plant density in the present study nitrate removal was in the range of 42 02 50 43 lennard and leonard 2006 reported 90 9 nitrate removal using gravel bed media in lettuce production ghaly et al 2005 examined the use of hydroponically grown barley for removal of no3 n from aquaculture wastewater and reported no3 n reductions ranging from 54 7 to 91 0 rana et al 2011 identified that more than 75 nitrate removal by tomato plants in aquaponics the lower nitrate removal in the present study could be due to the antagonist nature of cl ion with no3 in the nutrient absorption process as reported by fageria et al 2010 percentage removal of phosphate was observed to be in the range from 25 09 to 47 62 with maximum removal in t3 lin et al 2002 reported that construction of wetlands system receiving aquaculture effluent effectively removed 32 to 71 phosphate ghaly et al 2005 examined the use of hydroponically grown barley for removal of po4 p from aquaculture wastewater and reported 91 8 to 93 6 po4 p removal clarkson and lane 1991 evaluated the use of the nutrient film technique for po4 p removal from aquarium wastewater and observed reduction the po4 3 p from 4 4 to 0 3 mg l 1 using barley in a period of 4 weeks as tilapia is a fast growing species the nutrient input into the system in the form of feed is higher and hence further higher number of plants would be required to improve the nitrate and phosphate removal efficiency of the system the percentage removal of potassium by the end of the experiment was from 36 39 to 54 26 dontje and clanton 1999 reported 25 to 71 potassium removal in recirculating aquaculture systems using cattails reed canary grass and tomatoes grown in sand beds mant et al 2003 achieved 24 9 potassium removal using salix viminalis grown in gravel hydroponic system to treat primary settled sewage in the present study potassium was not supplemented from outside source to the aquaponic system ground water used for the study contained low level of potassium 3 8 4 mg l 1 3 4 daily water requirement the daily water requirement and total water consumption for the entire experimental period is represented in table 4 the daily water requirement in c2 was 17 67 1 45 followed by t1 1 25 0 03 t3 1 29 0 02 t2 1 22 0 05 and c1 1 16 0 03 the daily water requirement of c2 was significantly higher p 0 05 due to daily water replenishment after siphoning to maintain the water quality whereas in all other treatments the daily water requirement was in the range 1 16 1 29 to compensate evaporation losses hence the total water consumption for entire experimental period was highest in c2 596 25 49 03 l followed by t3 43 54 0 78 l t1 42 30 0 89 l t2 41 28 1 81 l and c1 39 26 1 07 l this was similar to the results of al hafedh et al 2008 where daily water requirement of 1 4 of the total system water was reported in aquaponics to compensate the evaporation and transpiration losses daily water loss in an aquaponics systems is caused by fish sludge removal evaporation plant evapotranspiration and fish splashing during feeding these losses range from 0 05 goda et al 2015 to 5 endut et al 2014 2016 of total water the results showed efficiency of aquaponic system in maintaining water quality for rearing fish without any water exchange daily water loss in the aquaponics systems is also influenced by hydroponic surface fish tank volume ratio and by the plant species used in the hydroponic section maucieri et al 2018 4 conclusion from the study it is concluded that among the fish to plant ratios chosen ratio of 1 1 3 performed best for integration of nile tilapia and spinach using inland saline groundwater however this study can only be considered as a pilot study and the authors are interested in further research on optimisation of fish to plant ratio for the same system with wider range of ratios multiple crop cycle and sufficient fattening period for tilapia nile tilapia and spinach was found to tolerate the low saline groundwater used in the experiment the water quality and nutrient removal was found to be better in treatment with maximum number of plants the daily water requirement for aquaponic system was found to be extremely low which clearly indicates aquaponics as a water efficient technology acknowledgement the author would like to thank to director icar central institute of fisheries education mumbai india for supporting this study technically and financially 
10954,an experimental trial of 45 days was conducted with different nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus to spinach spinacia oleracea ratios in a recirculating aquaponics system using inland saline groundwater of salinity 3 g l 1 different fish to plant ratios t1 1 0 7 t2 1 1 t3 1 1 3 and c1 aquaponics without plants c2 without hydroponic component were assigned as treatments and control groups respectively total yield of o niloticus 4 69 0 04 kg m 3 spinach yield 1 42 0 02 kg bed and percentage removal of nitrate 50 43 0 11 phosphate 47 62 2 20 and potassium 54 26 1 23 from the effluent was found to be higher in t3 the daily water requirement of t1 t2 t3 and c1 1 16 1 29 was significantly lower compared to c2 17 67 findings of the experiment suggest that aquaponics is feasible with low saline underground water and a ratio of 1 1 3 nile tilapia spinach is the best among tested ratios for balancing nutrient generation and removal as well as fish and plant production however further studies using higher fish to plant ratio could be carried out for optimisation of such systems keywords spinach nile tilapia saline underground water aquaponics 1 introduction salinization and water scarcity are the most severe constraints confronting sustainable agriculture production systems in semi arid and arid regions its intensity has expanded in past decades due to poor management of land and water resources unprecedented regional as well as global climate change and variability wong et al 2010 and led to an increased pressure on freshwater resources as the shortage of freshwater is becoming an important issue in the arid and semi arid zones concerns about the utilization of poor quality saline underground water has been amplified the optimal and multiple use of water is the key to resource sustainability in arid and semi arid regions in many countries saline ground water is used as an option for irrigation of saline tolerant agriculture crops rhoades 1984 grattan and oster 2003 sharma and minhas 2005 and also for aquaculture purposes boyd and thunjai 2003 allan et al 2009 aquaculture in arid and semi arid regions has increased economic and social impact through production of food livelihood security and income generation but confronted with the issue of environment protection chithambaran 2016 however aquaculture is the only way to satisfy the increasing seafood demand in the context of declining ocean fish stock considering stringent government regulations and increased awareness of the impact of aquaculture wastewater on receiving waters there is a need for the development of new technologies and innovations to make the aquaculture industry more sustainable and economically viable boyd et al 1998 aquaponics is one such technology developed to achieve more efficient use of water maximizing farm production without increasing water consumption avoiding deposition of aquaculture effluents and supplementing additional fertilizer to the agricultural crops mariscal lagarda et al 2012 aquaponics is a recirculating aquaculture system that incorporates the production of plants without soil in aquaponics the nutrient rich effluent from the fish tank which contains waste products of the fish metabolism and uneaten feed is used to fertigate hydroponic plant bed where the nutrients are sequestrated by plants which in turn is transformed into a valuable resource the effluent is treated through the process of nitrification and nutrient uptake in the plant component and returned to the fish rearing tanks rakocy et al 2006 aquaponics forms a closed loop system where fish plant bacteria live and work together to form a mini ecosystem current aquaponics research has mostly focused on integrating freshwater fish and plant species rakocy et al 2004 enduta et al 2011 shete et al 2013 hussain et al 2015 nuwansi et al 2016 but freshwater resource for food production agriculture and aquaculture is becoming increasingly limited and at the same time salinisation is progressively increasing in many parts of the world turcios and papenbrock 2014 this has led us to an interest in the use of saline underground water for aquaponics by replacing freshwater and stocking with euryhaline or saltwater fish and salt tolerant plants developing a suitable saline aquaponics with salt tolerant plants and fishes can help in sustainable food production in arid and semi arid lands where the underground water is saline the selection of compatible plant and fish species and an optimum fish to plant ratio to maintain nutrient balance is of critical importance regarding suitability for aquaponics production tilapia which belongs to the family cichlidae is the world s second most important farmed food fish after carps and is also the most preferred fish for experimental as well as commercial aquaponics based production systems maucieri et al 2018 love et al 2014 among tilapia species oreochromis niloticus commonly known as nile tilapia is the most preferred and widely cultured species owing to its faster growth ability to survive in poor water quality tolerance to high stocking densities and adaptability to tank based culture systems and ease of handling popma and lovshin 1995 nile tilapia is also known to have wide range of salinity tolerance and has the maximum biomass gain in the salinity range of 0 10 g l 1 villegas 1990 spinach spinacia oleracea which belongs to the family amaranthaceae is one of the perennial leafy vegetable grown throughout the world in greenhouses polyhouses and hydroponic systems as well spinach has an excellent nutritional value and health benefits spinach contains high levels of vitamins and minerals viz vitamin a vitamin b vitamin k vitamin c vitamin b2 and b6 phosphorus iron potassium folate betaine copper protein manganese zinc niacin selenium and omega 3 avsar 2011 spinach is one of the main vegetables cultured in aquaponics systems because it grows rapidly in response to the high levels of nutrients in aquaculture water petrea et al 2013 the objective of the present study is to find out the feasibility of bio integration of nile tilapia and spinach in inland saline groundwater and to determine the best ratio for such system in terms of production performance and nutrient balancing 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a 45 days study was conducted at icar central institute of fisheries education regional centre lahli rohtak india 28 86 n 76 47 e small scale aquaponic systems consisting of 15 individual identical aquaponics unit were installed in a greenhouse 6 10 m 4 57 m with polyethylene roofing sheet and knitted shade net of hdpe fabric as side walls supported by gi frames fig 1 the aquaponic system was harboured in a two floor structure with each individual unit containing a circular fish tanks of 100 l water volume 75 l capacity which were placed 0 3 m below the ground level and plant grow bed of 0 52 m2 0 93 m 0 56 m area placed 0 2 m above the ground level hydroponic plant grow beds were filled with cleaned gravels having a size of 1 5 2 0 cm to a thickness of 25 27 cm siphon bells were used to create a flood and drain system in plant grow beds the effluent from the fish tank was pumped to the plant grow bed using 15 w submersible pump t kango tk 380 pumping frequency was controlled by automatic timer saia burgess controls and a flow rate of 250 l hour 1 was maintained the water from the grow bed returned to the fish tank by gravity through a 20 mm pvc drain pipe which was connected to the bell siphon the aquaponics bed took 7 min for complete drainage and 3 min for filling continuous aeration was provided to each fish tank the rearing tanks were covered with 15 mm plastic net to prevent the fish from jumping out of the tank inland saline water with a salinity of 3 g l 1 used in the experiment has been made by diluting 10 g l 1 borewell water pumped from high saline zone with freshwater the experimental fish were acclimatized to 3 g l 1 by progressively increasing the salinity at the rate of 0 5 g l 1 day 1 for 6 days the experimental design consisted of 3 treatments each having three assigned replicates each treatment was allotted with different fish to plant ratio viz t1 t2 t3 in the ratio 1 0 7 1 1 1 1 3 respectively and compared with controls c1 aquaponics without plants and c2 fish without aquaponics in all treatments and controls the fingerlings were provided with commercial floating feed 32 protein at a constant feeding rate of 5 of body weight equally divided in two dosages twice a day in the morning 10 00 am and evening 5 00 pm hours siphoning and water replacement was done on daily basis in c2 the water replacement in c2 and water addition to compensate for evaporative losses in c1 t1 t2 and t3 was done with the water of salinity 3 g l 1 2 2 stocking initially the system was operated for 12 days with 10 numbers of fish averaging 5 gm weight and fed at 5 of body weight to enhance the ammonia level in the system to promote growth of nitrifying bacteria thereafter the fishes were removed and the tanks were stocked with fingerlings of tilapia 200 fishes m 3 the mean weight and length of fish at the time of stocking was 5 89 0 04 g and 7 49 0 06 cm respectively the stocking density of fish remained the same for all treatments and controls seeds of spinach were sown in nursery trays 50 25 cm made of plastic having 120 cavities and filled with coconut husk medium plantlets were allowed to grow for 20 days before transplanting to hydroponics tank at varying density 20 30 40 m 2 the size of plants at the time of transplanting was 9 60 0 06 cm 2 3 sampling sampling of fishes was carried out at 15 days interval for assessment of growth length and weight and health the length was measured with the help of a graduated ruler while the weight was recorded with the aid of an electronic balance growth of plants was observed by measuring height of plants length and width of leaves by the end of experiment spinach was harvested 2 4 water quality analysis water quality parameters were analyzed at an interval of 10 days the water temperature was measured by thermometer and ph was measured by using hand held ph meter hanna hi98130 salinity was measured using hand held refractometer atago s mill e japan other parameters such as dissolved oxygen total hardness alkalinity total dissolved solids ammonia nitrite nitrate and phosphorus were analyzed using the standard methods apha 2005 the na and k levels were analyzed using flame photometry microprocessor flame photometer model 1382 esico haryana india calcium and magnesium content of the water was estimated titrimetrically following the standard methods apha 2005 2 5 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using statistical package spss version 22 where one way anova and tukey s honest significant difference test tukey s hsd were applied at a significance level of p 0 05 95 confidence limit to know the significant difference between the treatments and control means for different parameters 3 result and discussion 3 1 fish growth parameters choice of different fish to plant ratio had significant bearing on the growth rates in nile tilapia overall growth performance of nile tilapia in different treatments is shown in table 1 the initial mean body weight had insignificant difference among treatments but at the end of experimental trial it was observed that some of the treatment groups registered a significant difference p 0 05 in mean body weight gain by administering the optimal feeding rate 5 of body weight for tilapia as recommended by deyab and hussein 2015 the yield in t3 4 69 0 04 kg m 3 t2 4 57 0 02 kg m 3 and t1 4 43 0 04 kg m 3 were significantly higher than those in c1 4 26 0 03 kg m 3 and c2 3 94 0 03 kg m 3 the lowest yield observed in control c2 3 94 0 03 kg m 3 can be due to the higher level of ammonia present in the culture water indicating that nitrification was negligible or absent nitrifying bacteria require surface for adhesion and prolifeartion which was relatively lesser in c2 than compared to c1 and other treatments gravels used in the aquaponics bed provide larger surface for colonisation of nitrifying bacterial population crab et al 2007 the fish growth was found to increase with higher plant density as more number of plant provided better biofiltration and improved the water quality atle et al 2003 sten et al 2004 and lemarie et al 2004 reported that growth rate of fish decreased when concentrations of ammonia increased increased ammonia levels in culture system is known to manifest its effect by lowering feed intake and also by reducing feed conversion efficiency schram et al 2010 at the end of the experiment highest percentage weight gain was observed in t3 292 88 1 52 which did not differ significantly from the values observed in t2 284 61 3 42 but did differ significantly from that of t1 273 62 3 34 a similar trend was observed in specific growth rate sgr with values in t3 t2 and t1 being 3 04 0 01 day 1 2 99 0 02 day 1 and 2 92 0 02 day 1 respectively both sgr and percentage weight gain found in various treatments varied significantly from control groups by the end of experiment the survival rate of 100 observed in all the treatments indicates that different fish to plant ratio had no influence on survival of fishes the mean length of fish also did not vary significantly p 0 05 among any of treatments fcr of t3 1 37 0 01 t2 1 41 0 01 and t1 1 47 0 02 differed significantly p 0 05 from c1 1 56 0 02 and c2 1 74 0 01 the feed efficiency ratio fer values were significantly similar in t3 0 72 0 01 and t2 0 70 0 01 but varied significantly from t1 0 67 0 01 c1 0 63 0 01 and c2 0 57 0 01 protein efficiency ratio per also exhibited a similar trend as that of fer with higher values in t3 and t2 2 27 0 02 and 2 20 0 01 and lowest in c2 1 78 0 01 which varied significantly fcr of the present study ranged from 1 37 t3 to 1 7 c2 which is in accordance with the result of al hafedh et al 2008 where fcr for nile tilapia ranged from 1 0 to 1 7 in the present study the variation in fcr may be attributed to the variation in ammonia concentration in the culture water and also to the non consumption of feed supplied to the fish tank completely in c1 and c2 one of the common behavioural responses to stress in fish is the reduced feed intake and or disruption of the feeding behaviour el shafai et al 2004 found that mean feed conversion ratio of oreochromis niloticus decreased as ammonia concentrations increased the sgr was found to decrease with increase in ammonia concentration the same was reported by harris et al 1998 and atle et al 2003 who found that sgr decreases with the increasing concentration of ammonia and it is primarily due to reduced food intake 3 2 plant growth parameters plant growth is another important criterion to correlate the suitability or efficiency of aquaponic system plant plays an important role in nutrient dynamics of aquaponics system as the biofilter component spinach spinacia oleracea was seen to grow well with the nutrients from tilapia fish culture water without the addition of extra nutrients at the end of the growth period 45 days the plants reached the market size with average height of 38 43 cm table 2 lenard and lennard 2006 while comparing different systems for growing spinach in an aquaponics system recommended gravel bed or floating raft over the nutrient film technique good growth of spinach even with water of higher salinity and ec value is an interesting observation gravel bed technique allows for intermittent submergence and exposure of plant root system to water as compared to the continuous submergence of the roots in nutrient film technique intermittent exposure and submergence will reduce the osmotic stress to the plant root and that might have been the reason for the luxurious growth of spinach even in water with high salt content salinity of 3 g l 1 and ec value of 4 4 to 5 ds cm 1 owing to these reasons gravel bed system was used in the present study at the time of harvest the overall height percentage height gain leaf length and leaf width of spinach did not show any significant difference p 0 05 in any of the treatment groups similar growth performance of spinach in all the treatments can be due to the presence of excess nutrients in the system it will not contribute extra to the productivity and quality of the crop when absorption of nutrients exceeds a threshold luxury absorption hansen 1977 but the yield of spinach varied significantly p 0 05 with increasing number of plant densities and highest yield was recorded in t3 1 42 0 02 kg bed followed by t2 1 07 0 02 kg bed and t1 0 85 0 01 kg bed the results of present study is comparable with results of the hussain et al 2014 where fish to plant ratio of 1 1 4 was found to be optimum for spinach koi carp aquaponics system however as the plant growth was luxurious even at the highest fish to plant ratio chosen in this experiment it would be interesting to carry out further trials with higher fish to plant ratios 3 3 water quality parameters and nutrient dynamics all the water quality parameters measured are presented in table 3 water temperature is one of the important factors responsible for optimum fish growth plant growth and performance of nitrifying bacteria in biofilter the water temperature was found to be influenced by seasonal changes with higher values at the start of experiment and comparatively lower values by the end of experiment varied from 25 5 32 00c with an average of 28 30c but no marked variation was observed in any of the treatment groups optimum growth for tilapia is achieved at 27 to 29 c rakocy and brunson 1989 ndakidemi et al 2009 studied the effect of regulated irrigation water temperature on hydroponics production of spinach spinacia oleracea and optimum growth was recorded at 28 c the mean value of salinity of water did not show any significant difference p 0 05 among treatments and control ph of the water from different tanks ranged from 7 4 to 7 8 during the study period but no marked variation among the treatments and control and these levels are within the optimum range of 6 9 for the bacteria in the nitrification filter wheaton et al 1994 and within the tolerance range of 5 11 for tilapia chervinski 1982 maintenance of adequate dissolved oxygen d o in culture water is important for fish health and biofilter performance hussain et al 2015 delong et al 2009 recommended dissolved oxygen d o levels between 5 0 and 7 5 mg l 1 for acceptable growth in tilapia and masser et al 1999 recommended 2 mg l 1 for efficient performance of nitrifying bacteria the mean dissolved oxygen content of the present study falls within the recommended limits and ranged between 5 74 5 33 mg l 1 with no significant difference in any of the treatments the alkalinity and hardness of the culture water was high throughout the experiment since the water used for the study was saline underground water higher level of hardness as observed in this case could be explained by high level of calcium and magnesium in the borewell water used for the experiment total alkalinity values was found significantly similar p 0 05 in all the treatment groups lawson 1995 reported a permissible limit of 50 500 mg l 1 as caco3 alkalinity in an aquaponic system the mean value of alkalinity of different treatment groups ranged from 124 20 to 138 73 mg l 1 as caco3 and was found within the permissible limit the total hardness was also observed to be significantly similar p 0 05 in all the groups although it was slightly higher in c1 854 21 1 48 mg l 1 followed by t1 848 93 2 59 mg l 1 c2 847 87 2 67 mg l 1 and t2 838 27 2 58 mg l 1 due to the accumulation of nutrients whereas lower hardness was recorded in t3 831 93 2 42 mg l 1 ammonia is the principal nitrogenous waste product of fishes and is normally oxidized first to nitrite and then to nitrate it is also the main nitrogenous waste material excreted by gills beside urea and amines the suggested value of ammonia in a recirculating aquaculture system ras should be less than 1 00 mg l 1 van rijn and rivera 1990 nijhof and bovendeur 1990 in the present study total ammonia nitrogen tan was significantly higher in c2 0 61 0 01 mg l l but tan concentration was found to be similar in c1 0 30 0 01 mg l l t1 0 25 0 02 mg l l t2 0 23 0 01 mg l l while t3 0 18 0 02 mg l l had significantly lower concentration of the same all the values recorded were found within the optimum limit recommended for ras lower levels of tan in the treatments with more number of plants indicated the efficiency of spinach plants to uptake ammonium ion from the culture wastewater in the aquaponics system ammonium nh4 is one of the major sources of inorganic nitrogen taken up by the roots of higher plants vaillant et al 2004 as plants take up nh4 some of the nh3 is converted to nh4 to maintain equilibrium the net result is that the amount of nh3 decreases tyson et al 2011 during the experiment nitrite nitrogen did not show any significant difference between treatments and control eissa et al 2015 found optimum range of nitrite 0 02 1 23 mg l 1 for aquaponic and nitrite level of the present study was found to be within the limit the mean nitrate nitrogen concentration showed significant variation p 0 05 among treatments the higher nitrate nitrogen level was observed in c1 47 76 1 79 mg l 1 followed by t1 33 29 0 39 mg l 1 t2 27 68 0 26 mg l 1 t3 23 87 0 29 mg l 1 whereas lowest nitrate nitrogen level was observed in c2 1 65 1 89 mg l 1 the nitrate in culture water was found to increase with decreasing plant density results of this study coincide with nair et al 1985 rakocy and hargreaves 1993 and seawright et al 1998 who found that no3 2 accumulated the most in waste water from the fish according to watson and hill 2006 no3 2 should be maintained below 100 mg l 1 in aquaponics and the nitrate level in the present study was within the recommended range as the plant density increased the nitrate level in culture water decreased this shows that spinach plants effectively removed nitrates in treatments nitrate n is relatively harmless and is the preferred form of nitrogen for growing higher plants rakocy et al 2006 except calcium all other nutrients like phosphate potassium magnesium and sodium showed significantly higher values in c1 compared to other treatments clearly indicates the efficiency of spinach to uptake nutrients the mean phosphate concentration during the study varied significantly p 0 05 among all the treatments and control these nutrients were found to accumulate in control group without plants and decreased with increase in plant density adler et al 1996 found that differences in nutrient removal rates were dependent on plant number and effluent flow rate da silva cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016 recorded a phosphorus availability of less than 2 mg l 1 in aquaponic system similarly in the present study the po4 p level ranged between 0 15 1 15 mg l 1 lower phosphorus level could be due to high calcium level in the culture water sheikh et al 1989 reported a greater avidity of ca2 towards phosphorus and its consequent precipitation hussain et al 2015 noted a potassium level of 14 2 19 6 mg l 1 in aquaponic water without any potassium supplementation whereas in the present study potassium level in t3 was found to be below the reported range with 5 38 mg l 1 which could be due to the low level of potassium in inland saline groundwater in addition to active absorption by plants the mean concentration of magnesium and sodium varied significantly p 0 05 between treatments and controls with highest accumulation in c1 similar results was reported by shete et al 2015 where a significantly lower level of potassium calcium sodium magnesium iron and zinc was found with higher plant to fish component ratio in common carp mint aquaponics system percentage nutrient removal of nitrate phosphate and potassium is depicted in fig 2 the result shows that all the treatments t1 t2 and t3 effectively removed the nutrients with highest nutrient removal in t3 with maximum plant density in the present study nitrate removal was in the range of 42 02 50 43 lennard and leonard 2006 reported 90 9 nitrate removal using gravel bed media in lettuce production ghaly et al 2005 examined the use of hydroponically grown barley for removal of no3 n from aquaculture wastewater and reported no3 n reductions ranging from 54 7 to 91 0 rana et al 2011 identified that more than 75 nitrate removal by tomato plants in aquaponics the lower nitrate removal in the present study could be due to the antagonist nature of cl ion with no3 in the nutrient absorption process as reported by fageria et al 2010 percentage removal of phosphate was observed to be in the range from 25 09 to 47 62 with maximum removal in t3 lin et al 2002 reported that construction of wetlands system receiving aquaculture effluent effectively removed 32 to 71 phosphate ghaly et al 2005 examined the use of hydroponically grown barley for removal of po4 p from aquaculture wastewater and reported 91 8 to 93 6 po4 p removal clarkson and lane 1991 evaluated the use of the nutrient film technique for po4 p removal from aquarium wastewater and observed reduction the po4 3 p from 4 4 to 0 3 mg l 1 using barley in a period of 4 weeks as tilapia is a fast growing species the nutrient input into the system in the form of feed is higher and hence further higher number of plants would be required to improve the nitrate and phosphate removal efficiency of the system the percentage removal of potassium by the end of the experiment was from 36 39 to 54 26 dontje and clanton 1999 reported 25 to 71 potassium removal in recirculating aquaculture systems using cattails reed canary grass and tomatoes grown in sand beds mant et al 2003 achieved 24 9 potassium removal using salix viminalis grown in gravel hydroponic system to treat primary settled sewage in the present study potassium was not supplemented from outside source to the aquaponic system ground water used for the study contained low level of potassium 3 8 4 mg l 1 3 4 daily water requirement the daily water requirement and total water consumption for the entire experimental period is represented in table 4 the daily water requirement in c2 was 17 67 1 45 followed by t1 1 25 0 03 t3 1 29 0 02 t2 1 22 0 05 and c1 1 16 0 03 the daily water requirement of c2 was significantly higher p 0 05 due to daily water replenishment after siphoning to maintain the water quality whereas in all other treatments the daily water requirement was in the range 1 16 1 29 to compensate evaporation losses hence the total water consumption for entire experimental period was highest in c2 596 25 49 03 l followed by t3 43 54 0 78 l t1 42 30 0 89 l t2 41 28 1 81 l and c1 39 26 1 07 l this was similar to the results of al hafedh et al 2008 where daily water requirement of 1 4 of the total system water was reported in aquaponics to compensate the evaporation and transpiration losses daily water loss in an aquaponics systems is caused by fish sludge removal evaporation plant evapotranspiration and fish splashing during feeding these losses range from 0 05 goda et al 2015 to 5 endut et al 2014 2016 of total water the results showed efficiency of aquaponic system in maintaining water quality for rearing fish without any water exchange daily water loss in the aquaponics systems is also influenced by hydroponic surface fish tank volume ratio and by the plant species used in the hydroponic section maucieri et al 2018 4 conclusion from the study it is concluded that among the fish to plant ratios chosen ratio of 1 1 3 performed best for integration of nile tilapia and spinach using inland saline groundwater however this study can only be considered as a pilot study and the authors are interested in further research on optimisation of fish to plant ratio for the same system with wider range of ratios multiple crop cycle and sufficient fattening period for tilapia nile tilapia and spinach was found to tolerate the low saline groundwater used in the experiment the water quality and nutrient removal was found to be better in treatment with maximum number of plants the daily water requirement for aquaponic system was found to be extremely low which clearly indicates aquaponics as a water efficient technology acknowledgement the author would like to thank to director icar central institute of
