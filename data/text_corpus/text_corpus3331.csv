16655,both biological sulfate reduction process and sulfur reduction process are attractive technologies for metal laden wastewater treatment however the acidity stress of metal laden wastewater could affect the sulfidogenic performance and the microbial community weaken the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of the biological sulfidogenic processes bsp in this study long term lab scale trials were conducted with a sulfate reducing bioreactor and a sulfur reducing bioreactor to evaluate the effects of acidity on sulfidogenic activities and the microbial community of the bsp in the 300 day trial the sulfate reducing bacteria srb driven bsp was stable in terms of sulfidogenic performance and microbial community with the decline of ph while the sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb driven bsp achieved high rate and low cost sulfide production under neutral conditions but unstable under acidic conditions with the decline of ph the sulfide production rate spr of the srb driven bsp stably increased from 30 to 83 mg s l h while it decreased from 56 to 37 mg s l h in the s0rb driven bsp with high fluctuation the results of estimation were consistent with the thermodynamical calculations in which the sulfur reduction process showed a better performance at ph 5 7 while the sulfate reduction process might gain more energy when ph 5 the stable sulfidogenic performance and microbial community diversity of the srb driven bsp could be attributed to the alkalinity produced in sulfate reduction to buffer the acidic stress in comparison the microbial community in the s0rb driven bsp was significantly re shaped by acidity stress and the predominant sulfidogenic bacterium changed from desulfovibrio at neutral condition to desulfurella at ph 5 4 the stability of the microbial community significantly affected the spr and the operational cost nevertheless the organic consumption for sulfide production of the s0rb driven bsp was still less than the srb driven bsp even in acidic conditions collectively the s0rb driven bsp was recommended under neutral or mild acid conditions while the srb driven bsp was more suitable under fluctuating ph conditions especially at low ph overall this study presented the long term performance of srb and s0rb driven bsp under varying ph conditions and provided guidance to determine the suitable bsp and operational cost for different metal laden wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological sulfidogenic processes metal laden wastewater treatment sulfate reducing bacteria sulfur reducing bacteria microbial diversity 1 introduction biological sulfidogenic process bsp including the sulfate reduction process and sulfur reduction process is a promising approach for metal laden wastewater treatment kaksonen and puhakka 2007 sun et al 2020a bsp based on sulfate reduction have been widely employed for the treatment of metal laden wastewater muyzer and stams 2008 rambabu et al 2020 however the high costs of external organic substrates addition limit the application of the sulfate reduction process in the treatment of organics deficient metal laden wastewater neculita et al 2007 sánchez andrea et al 2014 compared to the sulfate reduction process the sulfur reduction process only consumes one fourth of organics for high rate sulfide production eq 1 and eq 2 florentino et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a 1 c h 3 co o s o 4 2 2 hc o 3 h s 2 1 4 c h 3 co o s 0 1 2 h 2 o 1 2 c o 2 h s 3 4 h since the characteristics of metal laden wastewater vary from source to source it could seriously affect the performance of the bsp process acid mine drainage characteristics as highly acidity and contains high strength sulfate akcil and koldas 2006 while alkaline mine drainage from mine flotation characteristics as alkaline ph liu et al 2018 the electroplating wastewater contains extremely high levels of copper ions up to 5600 mg cu l with ph lower than 4 0 li et al 2021 while the wastewater from the chlor alkali and battery industries with various high levels of heavy metal ions was near neutral condition huang et al 2015 furthermore the ph of the metal laden wastewater may fluctuate by the process flow retka et al 2020 here comes the question that which type of the sulfidogenic process is of more applicability when treating the metal laden wastewater under varying ph conditions in terms of the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness it is essential to evaluate and compare the sulfate reducing bacteria srb driven bsp and the sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb driven bsp under declining ph conditions in terms of sulfidogenic performance organic consumption and microbial community adaptability under similar operational conditions srb and s0rb are found to survive in a wide range of ph florentino et al 2016b hao et al 1996 koschorreck 2008 the existence of acid tolerant and acidophilic sulfidogenic bacteria strengthen the adaptability of the bsp florentino et al 2015 sánchez andrea et al 2014 however the abundance and activities of the sulfidogenic bacteria would be suppressed under extremely acidic condition which affects the stability of the process kushkevych et al 2019 sun et al 2019a sun et al 2020b furthermore the symbiosis of sulfidogenic bacteria and other microorganisms e g fermentation bacteria could affect the community stability and the activity of the system under extremely acid conditions guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 the variation of microbial community under varying ph conditions could probably result in the fluctuation of sulfidogenic performance however the chemical and biological behaviors in sulfate reducing or sulfur reducing microbial communities under varying ph conditions have not be well investigated and discussed the system performance and cost effectiveness of sulfide production are essential to select and operate a biological sulfidogenic system under different ph levels to achieve stable and cost efficient sulfide production for metal removal both srb and s0rb driven bsp perform well under neutral conditions but the activities of both srb and s0rb were suppressed under extremely acidic conditions leading to the lower sulfide production efficiency luo et al 2017 sánchez andrea et al 2014 sun et al 2020b however the alkalinity produced in sulfate reduction process eq 1 can buffer the acidness and alleviate the impact of acidic condition on the srb elliott et al 1998 kaksonen and puhakka 2007 it suggests that the efficiency of srb driven bsp and s0rb driven bsp may have different responses to acidic conditions to our best knowledge the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of the s0rb driven bsp and srb driven bsp under varying ph conditions have not been investigated yet especially in the similar reactor design and operational parameters various ph conditions that exist in metal laden wastewaters might affect the growth of sulfidogenic bacteria and significantly change the microbial community structure which will further affect the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the bsp sun et al 2020b thus the feeding of influent with different ph condition poses challenges to the sulfidogenic treatment system in terms of sustainability and operation stability on sulfide production efficiency and cost effectiveness therefore the effects of ph condition on the sulfidogenic and microbial activities in the srb driven bsp and the s0rb driven bsp should be considered and evaluated in this study to determine the applicability of bsp for metal laden wastewater treatment the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of a srb driven bsp and a s0rb driven bsp were evaluated under different ph conditions a laboratory scale srb driven bsp and a laboratory scale s0rb driven bsp were established to investigate its long term performance on sulfide generation with different ph in the feeding solution the ph variation of the effluent and the efficiency of organic consumption were also evaluated additionally the effects of the acidity stress on the sulfidogenic bacterial community were discussed by applying illumina miseq sequencing the findings of this study could extend the knowledge of the microbial community evolution of sulfidogenic processes at different acidity stress and provide a strategy of sulfidogenic process for metal laden wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale sulfidogenic bioreactor setup and operation the simplified diagram of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 plexiglass column reactors

the seeding sludge was collected from the sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong and pre cultivated with synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater has been validated to be suitable for the growth of srb and s0rb guo et al 2019 jiang et al 2013 lau et al 2006 wang et al 2009 the preparation of synthetic wastewater and the composition of stock solution were detailed in text s1 and table s1 according to the stoichiometric equation the total organic carbon toc concentration of the influent for the sulfur reducing bioreactor was lower than that for the sulfate reducing bioreactor during the experiment notably additional sodium sulfate 400 mg so4 2 s l was provided for the sulfate reducing bioreactor to enrich the sulfate reducer each sulfidogenic bioreactor was operated for 300 days nonstop in four stages from stage 1 to stage 4 based on different influent ph the synthetic wastewater was continually fed into the sulfidogenic bioreactor at a flow rate of 0 13 l h and the actual hydraulic retention time hrt of the sulfidogenic reactor throughout the experiment was calculated to be 4 4 h throughout the experiment the detailed operational parameters including the concentration of toc in influent hrt and influent ph are listed in table s2 the bioreactor was placed in a temperature controlled chamber 25 2 influent and effluent samples were collected regularly for studying the variation of water qualities the sludge samples were taken from the bioreactor at the end of each stage to reveal the evolution in the microbial community compositions 2 2 analytical methods the influent and effluent water samples of the sulfidogenic reactors were collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm membranes millipore and then analyzed for toc dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 ph sulfate and thiosulfate the toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a and dissolved sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 the ph was

usa with an ionpac analytical column as19 4 250 mm qiu et al 2020 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification sequencing and analysis the sludge samples were collected from the sulfidogenic reactors at the end of each stage to investigate the effects of different ph levels on functional groups using illumina miseq sequencing the genomic dna was extracted using the mo bio powersoil dna isolation kit carlsbad ca usa per the manufacturer s instructions a primer set 341f 806r was used for the v4 hypervariable regions of 16s rrna gene amplification the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego

coordinates analysis pcoa based on the unweighted unifrac distance matrix in qiime was performed to determine the beta diversity of the bacterial communities lozupone et al 2011 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis was performed to predict the metabolic functions of the microbial community in the sulfidogenic reactors during the

at l1 l2 and l3 levels were calculated the genes related to biological sulfur cycling were further visualized and a heatmap analysis was conducted using the pheatmap package of r programme http www r project org 3 results 3 1 performance of the sulfidogenic bioreactor the sulfidogenic bioreactors showed different regulating capacity for the influent ph the effluent ph values of the srb driven bsp kept stably throughout the four stages fig 2 a indicating that the srb driven bsp showed an excellent ability to relieve acidness in comparison the effluent ph values of the s0rb driven bsp did not change significantly fig 2b the different regulating capacity of srb driven bsp and s0rb driven bsp was consistent with the stoichiometric equation of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction eqs 1 and 2 which shows that alkalinity was produced by sulfate reduction but not sulfur reduction the sulfidogenic process driven by srb had a strong adaptability to acidic environments as shown in fig 2c the concentrations of sulfide produced in the srb driven bsp were 129 55 238 51 307 39 and 363 29 mg s l with the influent ph decreased from stage 1 to stage 4 respectively and the sulfide production rates sprs of the sulfidogenic process were 30 12 51 13 70 9 and 83 7 mg s l h from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3 a the results demonstrated that the efficient sulfide production by srb under acidic conditions in the meanwhile 43 9 67 14 80 8 and 86 5 of sulfate was utilized by srb in stage 1 to stage 4 fig 2c the percentage of sulfur conversion i e the weight ratio of sulfide production to sulfate consumption was calculated to be 102 12 during the long term operation the sulfide production in the s0rb driven bsp was weakened under acidic conditions as depicted in fig 2d the effluent sulfide concentrations in stage 1 and stage 4 were 238 36 224 37 165 53 and 165 32 mg s l respectively for which the sprs were calculated to be 56 8 53 6 37 12 and 37 8 mg s l h from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3b respectively the sprs were remarkably decreased with the decline of ph in the s0rb driven bsp accordingly compared to the high rate sulfide production under near neutral conditions the sulfide production by s0rb was significantly weakened under acidic conditions e g ph 5 0 the c s ratios is an indicator of the organic substrate consumption for sulfide production zhang et al 2018b as showed in fig 3c the measured c s ratios of the s0rb driven bsp gradually decreased from stage 1 to stage 4 this implies that the ratio of the organic substrate consumption through sulfate reduction by srb for sulfide production was increased even though the influent ph was decreased in contrast to the srb driven bsp the measured c s ratios of the s0rb driven bsp gradually increased by 40 i e from 0 25 0 07 to 0 35 0 10 mg c mg s from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3d the organic utilization efficiency of the sulfidogenic processes showed different trends as the ph dropped from stage 1 to stage 4 as shown in fig 3e the organic substrates efficiency of the srb driven bsp was maintained at 70 9 during the long term experiment in comparison though the microbial sulfur reduction consumed fewer organic substrates the average organic utilization efficiencies of the s0rb driven bsp were 59 12 51 11 32 11 and 27 13 from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3f indicating that nearly 70 of the organic matter were not utilized for sulfide production in acidic condition 3 2 effect of different acidity stress on microbial competition in the sulfidogenic bioreactor 3 2 1 microbial community richness and diversity to study the effects of different acidity stress on the microbial communities in the sulfidogenic processes 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted for sludge samples collected from the end of each stage the diversity of the microbial community was sufficiently represented by the sequencing depth of the sludge samples with rarefaction analysis based on otus at 3 dissimilarity fig s1 with the decrease of influent ph from 6 4 stage 1 to 5 4 stage 2 the number of otus at the plateau stage significantly increased from 248 to 482 in the srb driven bsp then the otus number slightly decreased to 452 with the further decrease of ph to 3 2 stage 4 the larger otus numbers in stages 3 and 4 indicate that the bacterial diversity in the srb driven bsp increased with the decreasing ph value of the influent diversity indices including chao index shannon index and simpson index were further calculated and the results confirmed the increase trend for the bacterial diversity in the srb driven bsp fig s1 the bacterial diversity in the s0rb driven bsp showed a different trend for the variation of ph the results demonstrated that the bacterial diversity of the s0rb driven bsp significantly decreased with the decrease of influent ph from 6 4 stage 1 to 5 1 stage 2 but slightly increased with the further decrease of ph in stage 3 and stage 4 furthermore the microbial communities in sulfidogenic processes at different stages were compared using pcoa based on unweighted unifrac distance fig 4 and the result suggests that the microbial community structures of the s0rb driven bsp were significantly re shaped after each change of the influent ph while the microbial community structures of the srb driven bsp were kept steady throughout the 4 stages 3 2 2 microbial community evolution to further analyze the core communities and the main functional bacteria in the sulfidogenic processes bacterial taxonomic identification was performed figs s2 and 5 show the taxonomic composition of the microbial community at different stages revealed by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing at phylum level and genus level respectively at illustrated in fig 5a the microbial community of the srb driven bsp kept stable during the gradually decline of ph levels in stage 1 t78 20 3 and kosmotage 17 1 were the main fermentation genera and five sulfidogenic genera namely desulfomicrobium 7 2 desulfococcus 7 1 desulfobulbus 2 0 desulfobacca 0 6 and desulfuromonas 0 1 were identified in the srb driven bsp fig 5a with decreasing ph desulfococcus became the dominant sulfidogenic genera in stage 2 to stage 4 the relative abundance of desulfobacca increased to 2 1 and 4 5 in stage 2 and stage 3 respectively followed by a gradual decline to 1 7 in stage 4 the relative abundances of dominant sulfidogenic genera in the srb driven bsp from stage 1 to stage 4 were shown in table 1 after 4 stages of cultivation with the decreased of the influent ph the other three sulfidogenic genera geobacter desulfovibrio and desulfomonile were found at the relative abundances of 1 3 0 7 and 0 3 respectively while the abundances of desulfobulbus and desulfuromonas decreased to an undetectable level the results of the microbial community analysis demonstrated that multiple srb were inhabited in sulfate reducing bioreactor throughout the 300 day trial as for the s0rb driven bsp the decrease of influent ph induced the significant changes in the microbial community compositions fig 5b paludibactre 14 5 treponema 13 4 and t78 9 3 were the main fermentation genera in the end of stage 1 paludibactre was the main fermentation genera in stage 2 41 3 and stage 4 48 8 while lactococcus was dominant in stage 3 18 5 the relative abundances of dominant sulfidogenic genera in the s0rb driven bsp from stage 1 to stage 4 were shown in table 1 desulfovibrio 7 8 desulfurella 2 4 and clostridium 1 2 were the main sulfidogenic genera in stage 1 and their abundance varied differentially with decreasing ph the abundance of desulfovibrio decreased to an undetectable level in stage 2 and stage 3 conversely the abundances of desulfurella increased to 48 6 and 46 2 in stage 2 and stage 3 while it decreased to 10 8 as the influent ph further decreased in stage 4 the relative abundance of clostridium was increased to 1 4 10 5 in stage 2 and stage 3 followed by a gradual decline to 5 7 in stage 4 the present results indicate that sulfur reducers exhibited different tolerance to different acidity 3 2 3 predicted metabolic functions in the sulfidogenic bioreactor to investigate the effects of dynamic acidic conditions on metagenomic functions in particular sulfur metabolic functions in the srb driven bsp and the s0rb driven bsp picrust analysis based on kegg database was employed as presented in fig s3 the gene sequences in the collected samples mostly involved in metabolism followed by genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular processes the functional genes involved in sulfur metabolism in the energy metabolism category were further analyzed as shown in fig 6 the relative abundances of the predicted functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism in the srb driven bsp maintained stable with gradually decreasing ph from 6 4 to 3 2 which is consistent with the high rate sulfide production under varying acidic conditions the stable relative abundance of sulfur metabolism may be ascribed to the high abundance of srb the results indicated that the decreasing ph from neutral to acidic did not have a significant influence on sulfate reduction as for the s0rb driven bsp high abundance of the predicted functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism was found in stage 1 0 84 but it decreased in subsequent stages 0 82 in stage 2 and 0 70 in stage 3 the decreased relative abundance of sulfur metabolism may be ascribed to the combined results of a decrease in microbial diversity and a decrease in sulfur reducer abundance fig 5 the results were consistent with the suppressed sulfide production under acidic conditions fig 3b however it should be noted that the genes related to the sulfur metabolism have increased slightly in stage 4 0 79 indicating that the sulfur reducer may adapt to acidic conditions after long term cultivation 4 discussion when the biological sulfide production processes were applied to an actual metal laden wastewater treatment ph is a vital factor for the performance of the s0rb driven bsp and srb driven bsp therefore the selection of sulfidogenic process should be carefully weighed under varying ph conditions based on the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of the sulfidogenic system 4 1 the stability of the bsp under different ph conditions different chemical and biological behaviors were found in sulfate reducing and sulfur reducing microbial communities with the declining ph the alkalinity produced in the sulfate reduction process benefit the stability of the srb driven bsp in acidic condition the srb driven bsp in our research showed an excellent ability to neutralize the influent and maintained the diversity of microbial community in the sulfate reducing bioreactor the results are consistent with the previous studies montoya et al 2013 sánchez andrea et al 2014 the abundance of fermentation genera such as t78 and kosmotage did not change significantly during the four stages which maintained the ability to decompose organic matter and provided electron for sulfidogenic bacteria by contrast low ph in s0rb driven bsp limited the active of fermentation bacteria which resulted to the decrease of carbon utilization rate and thus limited the production of sulfide the ph tolerance of srb for the wide ph range play an important role in the stability of the srb driven bsp srb were ancient microorganisms that widely exist in a variety of habitats such as lakes paddy fields underground pipelines and some industry wastewater shen et al 2001 more than 40 srb species including desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium desulfobacter and desulfotomaculum have been reported in previous researches hussain et al 2016 li et al 2018 the results of the microbial community analysis in this study demonstrated that more than five sulfidogenic genera were inhabit in the srb driven bsp fig 5a a variety of srb e g desulfomicrobium desulfococcus desulfobacca geobacter desulfovibrio and desulfomonile in the srb driven bsp have been identified to survive in a wide ph range church et al 2007 lee et al 2009 the relative high diversity of srb promised the stability of the srb driven bsp process under acid condition as for the s0rb driven bsp only a few s0rb were reported under extremely acidic condition florentino et al 2015 the microbial community analysis in this study was consistent with previous studies in which desulfovibrio geobacter and clostridium were found to be the main sulfidogenic genera in neutral conditions qiu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 while desulfurella was dominant in acidic conditions florentino et al 2016a sun et al 2019a 2020b lower microbial community diversity was found in the sulfur reducing bioreactor leading to the fluctuation of microbial community and sulfide production efficiency with the dropping ph in the s0rb driven bsp 4 2 the performance of the bsp under different ph conditions to achieved high rate sulfide production the bsps should be designed to efficiently reduce sulfate or sulfur to sulfide in this study we demonstrated that high rate sulfide production was achieved in s0rb driven bsp under nearly neutral condition the polysulfide involved indirect sulfur reduction i e hs n 1 8 s8 sn 2 h ensured the high rate sulfide production in the s0rb driven bsp under neutral or weak alkaline conditions sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b previous researches demonstrated that compared to sulfate reduction sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb in neutral conditions could be more efficiency for the treatment of organics deficient metal laden wastewater guo et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 however the sulfur reduction was weakened under extremely acidic ph condition the polysulfide is unstable and easily decomposes to form elemental sulfur and sulfide under acidic condition boyd and druschel 2013 suggesting that the sulfur reduction pathway at such conditions may be different from that under circumneutral condition sun et al 2019a in addition as illustrated above s0rb was more sensitive to the decline of ph which weaken the spr under acidic condition florentino et al 2016b however sun et al found that desulfrella was more active at ph 3 5 after long term cultivation so the spr of the s0rb driven bsp may be recovered under highly acidic conditions furthermore hydrogen sulfide gas can easily escape from the effluent of the sulfidogenic systems especially at lower ph level in the s0rb driven bsp which might reduce the removal efficiency of heavy metals and lead to a serious potential odor problem chen et al 2016 therefore the effect of the effluent recirculation percentage on metal removal efficiency should be one key parameter and need to be considered sun et al 2019b 2020a comparatively benefit from the acidic tolerance srb the spr of the srb driven bsp maintained efficient during ph fluctuations even though in acidic condition in this study the spr of the srb driven bsp increased with the dropped of influent ph high rate sulfide production was achieved under acidic condition fig 3a the results indicated that the sulfidogenic system driven by srb was a potential technology to achieve stable and efficient sulfide production for metal removal under acidic conditions 4 3 the cost effectiveness of the bsp under different ph conditions the c s ratios of the s0rb driven bsp was always lower than sulfate reduction in the test theoretically the c s ratio of sulfur reduction and sulfate reduction can be estimated at 0 19 mg c mg s and 0 75 mg c mg s based on the electron balance as described in eqs 1 and 2 zhang et al 2018b in this study the c s ratio of the s0rb driven bsp was always lower than that of the srb driven bsp throughout the 4 stages fig 2c d the results implied that the organic substrates consumption through sulfur reduction by s0rb for sulfide production was lower than that through sulfate reduction by srb especially under neutral conditions although the extra sulfur might lead to an increase of the chemical cost of the proposed sulfidogenic system with sulfur reduction previous studies also found that sulfur reduction process could reduce the chemical costs by 25 6 78 9 in terms of electron donor supply than those reported in the sulfate reduction processes employed in the treatment of metal laden wastewater in neutral conditions qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2020a recently a pilot scale s0rb driven bsp for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater was developed and remarkably reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 for cu2 removal li et al 2021 however the c s ratio in the s0rb driven bsp slightly increased with the decrease of influent ph while it gradually decreased in the srb driven bsp the thermodynamical calculation was conducted to compare the gibbs free energy of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction text s2 reactions of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction under different ph range from 2 0 to 8 0 was described in tables s3 and s4 a higher gibbs free energy means more energy were gained bijmans et al 2009 as shown in fig 7 the gibbs free energy of sulfur reduction was higher at neutral ph ph 5 2 8 0 while the gibbs free energy of sulfate reduction was higher at a lower ph ph 2 0 5 2 moreover srb would better outcompete methanogens at low ph because methanogens are more sensitive to low ph stefanie et al 1994 weijma et al 2002 as a result less of the costly electron donor was lost in acetogenesis methanogenesis or other processes than that in sulfate reduction which decreases the c s ratio of the overall process fig 3d furthermore the carbon utilization efficiency of the s0rb driven bsp was significantly lower than that of the srb driven bsp especially under acidic conditions fig 2e f low ph implies more energy investment in proton pumping across the cytoplasmic membrane bracey et al 1998 though the c s ratio of the s0rb driven bsp was lower than that of srb driven bsp through the whole 300 day operation fig 2c d high level of organic substrate dosage was necessary to maintain the efficient sulfide production in acidic condition fig 1f contrarily the ability of elevating ph by srb maintained a stable carbon utilization efficiency in srb driven bsp the alkali produced in sulfate reduction process neutralized the acidity resulting the decrease in the energy for the maintain of intracellular h balance under acidic conditions sánchez andrea et al 2014 5 conclusions in this study a laboratory scale srb driven bsp and a laboratory scale s0rb driven bsp were established to investigate their long term performance under different ph conditions during 300 days of operation the stability performance and cost effectiveness of the sulfidogenic processes were evaluated the main findings are 1 the srb driven bsp showed higher stability than the s0rb driven bsp during the gradually decline of ph levels the alkali produced in sulfate reduction process neutralized the acidity and a higher diversity of microbial community was observed in the srb driven bsp by contrast the microbial diversity and richness of sulfidogenic bacteria in the s0rb driven bsp showed significant variations owing to the acidity stress 2 the spr of srb driven bsp gradually increased with the decline of ph level achieving maximum spr 83 7 mg s l at the ph 3 2 4 4 while the s0rb driven bsp achieved high spr 56 8 mg s l h under near neutral and mild acidic conditions ph 5 1 6 4 but significantly fluctuated and declined under acidic condition 3 compared to srb driven bsp the s0rb driven bsp remarkable reduced the total carbon cost for the sulfide production under circumneutral condition but the cost effectiveness weakened under acidic condition the extra organic substrate dosage in acidic condition led to the increase of the cost of the s0rb driven bsp 4 collectively to treat metal laden wastewater with different ph conditions the bsp driven by s0rb has higher performance and cost effectiveness under neutral or mild acid conditions 5 0 ph 7 0 while srb driven bsp was more stable and applicable under acidic condition 3 0 ph 5 0 this study demonstrated the long term performance of sulfate and sulfur reducing processes under varying ph

16655,both biological sulfate reduction process and sulfur reduction process are attractive technologies for metal laden wastewater treatment however the acidity stress of metal laden wastewater could affect the sulfidogenic performance and the microbial community weaken the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of the biological sulfidogenic processes bsp in this study long term lab scale trials were conducted with a sulfate reducing bioreactor and a sulfur reducing bioreactor to evaluate the effects of acidity on sulfidogenic activities and the microbial community of the bsp in the 300 day trial the sulfate reducing bacteria srb driven bsp was stable in terms of sulfidogenic performance and microbial community with the decline of ph while the sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb driven bsp achieved high rate and low cost sulfide production under neutral conditions but unstable under acidic conditions with the decline of ph the sulfide production rate spr of the srb driven bsp stably increased from 30 to 83 mg s l h while it decreased from 56 to 37 mg s l h in the s0rb driven bsp with high fluctuation the results of estimation were consistent with the thermodynamical calculations in which the sulfur reduction process showed a better performance at ph 5 7 while the sulfate reduction process might gain more energy when ph 5 the stable sulfidogenic performance and microbial community diversity of the srb driven bsp could be attributed to the alkalinity produced in sulfate reduction to buffer the acidic stress in comparison the microbial community in the s0rb driven bsp was significantly re shaped by acidity stress and the predominant sulfidogenic bacterium changed from desulfovibrio at neutral condition to desulfurella at ph 5 4 the stability of the microbial community significantly affected the spr and the operational cost nevertheless the organic consumption for sulfide production of the s0rb driven bsp was still less than the srb driven bsp even in acidic conditions collectively the s0rb driven bsp was recommended under neutral or mild acid conditions while the srb driven bsp was more suitable under fluctuating ph conditions especially at low ph

kaksonen and puhakka 2007 sun et al 2020a bsp based on sulfate reduction have been widely employed for the treatment of metal laden wastewater muyzer and stams 2008 rambabu et al 2020 however the high costs of external organic substrates addition limit the application of the sulfate reduction process in the treatment of organics deficient metal laden wastewater neculita et al 2007 sánchez andrea et al 2014 compared to the sulfate reduction process the sulfur reduction process only consumes one fourth of organics for high rate sulfide production eq 1 and eq 2 florentino et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a 1 c h 3 co o s o 4 2 2 hc o 3 h s 2 1 4 c h 3 co o s 0 1 2 h 2 o 1 2 c o 2 h s 3 4 h since the characteristics of metal laden wastewater vary from source to source it could seriously affect the performance of the bsp process acid mine drainage characteristics as highly acidity and contains high strength sulfate akcil and koldas 2006 while alkaline mine drainage from mine flotation characteristics as alkaline ph liu et al 2018 the electroplating wastewater contains extremely high levels of copper ions up to 5600 mg cu l with ph lower than 4 0 li et al 2021 while the wastewater from the chlor alkali and battery industries with various high levels of heavy metal ions was near neutral condition huang et al 2015 furthermore the ph of the metal laden wastewater may fluctuate by the process flow retka et al 2020 here comes the question that which type of the sulfidogenic process is of more applicability when treating the metal laden wastewater under varying ph conditions in terms of the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness it is essential to evaluate and compare the sulfate reducing bacteria srb driven bsp and the sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb driven bsp under declining ph conditions in terms of sulfidogenic performance organic consumption and microbial community adaptability under similar operational conditions srb and s0rb are found to survive in a wide range of ph florentino et al 2016b hao et al 1996 koschorreck 2008 the existence of acid tolerant and acidophilic sulfidogenic bacteria strengthen the adaptability of the bsp florentino et al 2015 sánchez andrea et al 2014 however the abundance and activities of the sulfidogenic bacteria would be suppressed under extremely acidic condition which affects the stability of the process kushkevych et al 2019 sun et al 2019a sun et al 2020b furthermore the symbiosis of sulfidogenic bacteria and other microorganisms e g fermentation bacteria could affect the community stability and the activity of the system under extremely acid conditions guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 the variation of microbial community under varying ph conditions could probably result in the fluctuation of sulfidogenic performance however the chemical and biological behaviors in sulfate reducing or sulfur reducing microbial communities under varying ph conditions have not be well investigated and discussed the system performance and cost effectiveness of sulfide production are essential to select and operate a biological sulfidogenic system under different ph levels to achieve stable and cost efficient sulfide production for metal removal both srb and s0rb driven bsp perform well under neutral conditions but the activities of both srb and s0rb were suppressed under extremely acidic conditions leading to the lower sulfide production efficiency luo et al 2017 sánchez andrea et al 2014 sun et al 2020b however the alkalinity produced in sulfate reduction process eq 1 can buffer the acidness and alleviate the impact of acidic condition on the srb elliott et al 1998 kaksonen and puhakka 2007 it suggests that the efficiency of srb driven bsp and s0rb driven bsp may have different responses to acidic conditions to our best knowledge the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of the s0rb driven bsp and srb driven bsp under varying ph conditions have not been investigated yet especially in the similar reactor design and operational parameters various ph conditions that exist in metal laden wastewaters might affect the growth of sulfidogenic bacteria and significantly change the microbial community structure which will further affect the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the bsp sun et al 2020b thus the feeding of influent with different ph condition poses challenges to the sulfidogenic treatment system in terms of sustainability and operation stability on sulfide production efficiency and cost effectiveness therefore the effects of ph condition on the sulfidogenic and microbial activities in the srb driven bsp and the s0rb driven bsp should be considered and evaluated in this study to determine the applicability of bsp for metal laden wastewater treatment the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of a srb driven bsp and a s0rb driven bsp were evaluated under different ph conditions a laboratory scale srb driven bsp and a laboratory scale s0rb driven bsp were established to investigate its long term performance on sulfide generation with different ph in the feeding solution the ph variation of the effluent and the efficiency of organic consumption were also evaluated additionally the effects of the acidity stress on the sulfidogenic bacterial community were discussed by applying illumina miseq sequencing the findings of this study could extend the knowledge of the microbial community evolution of sulfidogenic processes at different acidity stress and provide a strategy of sulfidogenic process for metal laden wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale sulfidogenic bioreactor setup and operation the simplified diagram of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 plexiglass column reactors

the seeding sludge was collected from the sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong and pre cultivated with synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater has been validated to be suitable for the growth of srb and s0rb guo et al 2019 jiang et al 2013 lau et al 2006 wang et al 2009 the preparation of synthetic wastewater and the composition of stock solution were detailed in text s1 and table s1 according to the stoichiometric equation the total organic carbon toc concentration of the influent for the sulfur reducing bioreactor was lower than that for the sulfate reducing bioreactor during the experiment notably additional sodium sulfate 400 mg so4 2 s l was provided for the sulfate reducing bioreactor to enrich the sulfate reducer each sulfidogenic bioreactor was operated for 300 days nonstop in four stages from stage 1 to stage 4 based on different influent ph the synthetic wastewater was continually fed into the sulfidogenic bioreactor at a flow rate of 0 13 l h and the actual hydraulic retention time hrt of the sulfidogenic reactor throughout the experiment was calculated to be 4 4 h throughout the experiment the detailed operational parameters including the concentration of toc in influent hrt and influent ph are listed in table s2 the bioreactor was placed in a temperature controlled chamber 25 2 influent and effluent samples were collected regularly for studying the variation of water qualities the sludge samples were taken from the bioreactor at the end of each stage to reveal the evolution in the microbial community compositions 2 2 analytical methods the influent and effluent water samples of the sulfidogenic reactors were collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm membranes millipore and then analyzed for toc dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 ph sulfate and thiosulfate the toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a and dissolved sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 the ph was

usa with an ionpac analytical column as19 4 250 mm qiu et al 2020 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification sequencing and analysis the sludge samples were collected from the sulfidogenic reactors at the end of each stage to investigate the effects of different ph levels on functional groups using illumina miseq sequencing the genomic dna was extracted using the mo bio powersoil dna isolation kit carlsbad ca usa per the manufacturer s instructions a primer set 341f 806r was used for the v4 hypervariable regions of 16s rrna gene amplification the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca was provided by bgi bio tech inc wuhan china kozich et al 2013 the obtained paired end 16s rrna gene sequences were assembled and filtered in mothur the aligned sequences were checked for chimera using usearch 6 1 in qiime and classified into operational taxonomic units otus within a 97 similarity range employing the de novo otu picking workflow in qiime caporaso et al 2010 principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on the unweighted unifrac distance matrix in qiime was performed to determine the beta diversity of the bacterial communities lozupone et al 2011 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis was performed to predict the metabolic functions of the microbial community in the sulfidogenic reactors during the different stages using the galaxy platform against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg orthology database langille et al 2013 the abundances of predicted functional genes kegg ortholog ko at l1 l2 and l3 levels were calculated the genes related to biological sulfur cycling were further visualized and a heatmap analysis was conducted using the pheatmap package of r programme http www r project org 3 results 3 1 performance of the sulfidogenic bioreactor the sulfidogenic bioreactors showed different regulating capacity for the influent ph the effluent ph values of the srb driven bsp kept stably throughout the four stages fig 2 a indicating that the srb driven bsp showed an excellent ability to relieve acidness in comparison the effluent ph values of the s0rb driven bsp did not change significantly fig 2b the different regulating capacity of srb driven bsp and s0rb driven bsp was consistent with the stoichiometric equation of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction eqs 1 and 2 which shows that alkalinity was produced by sulfate reduction but not sulfur reduction the sulfidogenic process driven by srb had a strong adaptability to acidic environments as shown in fig 2c the concentrations of sulfide produced in the srb driven bsp were 129 55 238 51 307 39 and 363 29 mg s l with the influent ph decreased from stage 1 to stage 4 respectively and the sulfide production rates sprs of the sulfidogenic process were 30 12 51 13 70 9 and 83 7 mg s l h from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3 a the results demonstrated that the efficient sulfide production by srb under acidic conditions in the meanwhile 43 9 67 14 80 8 and 86 5 of sulfate was utilized by srb in stage 1 to stage 4 fig 2c the percentage of sulfur conversion i e the weight ratio of sulfide production to sulfate consumption was calculated to be 102 12 during the long term operation the sulfide production in the s0rb driven bsp was weakened under acidic conditions as depicted in fig 2d the effluent sulfide concentrations in stage 1 and stage 4 were 238 36 224 37 165 53 and 165 32 mg s l respectively for which the sprs were calculated to be 56 8 53 6 37 12 and 37 8 mg s l h from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3b respectively the sprs were remarkably decreased with the decline of ph in the s0rb driven bsp accordingly compared to the high rate sulfide production under near neutral conditions the sulfide production by s0rb was significantly weakened under acidic conditions e g ph 5 0 the c s ratios is an indicator of the organic substrate consumption for sulfide production zhang et al 2018b as showed in fig 3c the measured c s ratios of the s0rb driven bsp gradually decreased from stage 1 to stage 4 this implies that the ratio of the organic substrate consumption through sulfate reduction by srb for sulfide production was increased even though the influent ph was decreased in contrast to the srb driven bsp the measured c s ratios of the s0rb driven bsp gradually increased by 40 i e from 0 25 0 07 to 0 35 0 10 mg c mg s from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3d the organic utilization efficiency of the sulfidogenic processes showed different trends as the ph dropped from stage 1 to stage 4 as shown in fig 3e the organic substrates efficiency of the srb driven bsp was maintained at 70 9 during the long term experiment in comparison though the microbial sulfur reduction consumed fewer organic substrates the average organic utilization efficiencies of the s0rb driven bsp were 59 12 51 11 32 11 and 27 13 from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 3f indicating that nearly 70 of the organic matter were not utilized for sulfide production in acidic condition 3 2 effect of different acidity stress on microbial competition in the sulfidogenic bioreactor 3 2 1 microbial community richness and diversity to study the effects of different acidity stress on the microbial communities in the sulfidogenic processes 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted for sludge samples collected from the end of each stage the diversity of the microbial community was sufficiently represented by the sequencing depth of the sludge samples with rarefaction analysis based on otus at 3 dissimilarity fig s1 with the decrease of influent ph from 6 4 stage 1 to 5 4 stage 2 the number of otus at the plateau stage significantly increased from 248 to 482 in the srb driven bsp then the otus number slightly decreased to 452 with the further decrease of ph to 3 2 stage 4 the larger otus numbers in stages 3 and 4 indicate that the bacterial diversity in the srb driven bsp increased with the decreasing ph value of the influent diversity indices including chao index shannon index and simpson index were further calculated and the results confirmed the increase trend for the bacterial diversity in the srb driven bsp fig s1 the bacterial diversity in the s0rb driven bsp showed a different trend for the variation of ph the results demonstrated that the bacterial diversity of the s0rb driven bsp significantly decreased with the decrease of influent ph from 6 4 stage 1 to 5 1 stage 2 but slightly increased with the further decrease of ph in stage 3 and stage 4 furthermore the microbial communities in sulfidogenic processes at different stages were compared using pcoa based on unweighted unifrac distance fig 4 and the result suggests that the microbial community structures of the s0rb driven bsp were significantly re shaped after each change of the influent ph while the microbial community structures of the srb driven bsp were kept steady throughout the 4 stages 3 2 2 microbial community evolution to further analyze the core communities and the main functional bacteria in the sulfidogenic processes bacterial taxonomic identification was performed figs s2 and 5 show the taxonomic composition of the microbial community at different stages revealed by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing at phylum level and genus level respectively at illustrated in fig 5a the microbial community of the srb driven bsp kept stable during the gradually decline of ph levels in stage 1 t78 20 3 and kosmotage 17 1 were the main fermentation genera and five sulfidogenic genera namely desulfomicrobium 7 2 desulfococcus 7 1 desulfobulbus 2 0 desulfobacca 0 6 and desulfuromonas 0 1 were identified in the srb driven bsp fig 5a with decreasing ph desulfococcus became the dominant sulfidogenic genera in stage 2 to stage 4 the relative abundance of desulfobacca increased to 2 1 and 4 5 in stage 2 and stage 3 respectively followed by a gradual decline to 1 7 in stage 4 the relative abundances of dominant sulfidogenic genera in the srb driven bsp from stage 1 to stage 4 were shown in table 1 after 4 stages of cultivation with the decreased of the influent ph the other three sulfidogenic genera geobacter desulfovibrio and desulfomonile were found at the relative abundances of 1 3 0 7 and 0 3 respectively while the abundances of desulfobulbus and desulfuromonas decreased to an undetectable level the results of the microbial community analysis demonstrated that multiple srb were inhabited in sulfate reducing bioreactor throughout the 300 day trial as for the s0rb driven bsp the decrease of influent ph induced the significant changes in the microbial community compositions fig 5b paludibactre 14 5 treponema 13 4 and t78 9 3 were the main fermentation genera in the end of stage 1 paludibactre was the main fermentation genera in stage 2 41 3 and stage 4 48 8 while lactococcus was dominant in stage 3 18 5 the relative abundances of dominant sulfidogenic genera in the s0rb driven bsp from stage 1 to stage 4 were shown in table 1 desulfovibrio 7 8 desulfurella 2 4 and clostridium 1 2 were the main sulfidogenic genera in stage 1 and their abundance varied differentially with decreasing ph the abundance of desulfovibrio decreased to an undetectable level in stage 2 and stage 3 conversely the abundances of desulfurella increased to 48 6 and 46 2 in stage 2 and stage 3 while it decreased to 10 8 as the influent ph further decreased in stage 4 the relative abundance of clostridium was increased to 1 4 10 5 in stage 2 and stage 3 followed by a gradual decline to 5 7 in stage 4 the present results indicate that sulfur reducers exhibited different tolerance to different acidity 3 2 3 predicted metabolic functions in the sulfidogenic bioreactor to investigate the effects of dynamic acidic conditions on metagenomic functions in particular sulfur metabolic functions in the srb driven bsp and the s0rb driven bsp picrust analysis based on kegg database was employed as presented in fig s3 the gene sequences in the collected samples mostly involved in metabolism followed by genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular processes the functional genes involved in sulfur metabolism in the energy metabolism category were further analyzed as shown in fig 6 the relative abundances of the predicted functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism in the srb driven bsp maintained stable with gradually decreasing ph from 6 4 to 3 2 which is consistent with the high rate sulfide production under varying acidic conditions the stable relative abundance of sulfur metabolism may be ascribed to the high abundance of srb the results indicated that the decreasing ph from neutral to acidic did not have a significant influence on sulfate reduction as for the s0rb driven bsp high abundance of the predicted functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism was found in stage 1 0 84 but it decreased in subsequent stages 0 82 in stage 2 and 0 70 in stage 3 the decreased relative abundance of sulfur metabolism may be ascribed to the combined results of a decrease in microbial diversity and a decrease in sulfur reducer abundance fig 5 the results were consistent with the suppressed sulfide production under acidic conditions fig 3b however it should be noted that the genes related to the sulfur metabolism have increased slightly in stage 4 0 79 indicating that the sulfur reducer may adapt to acidic conditions after long term cultivation 4 discussion when the biological sulfide production processes were applied to an actual metal laden wastewater treatment ph is a vital factor for the performance of the s0rb driven bsp and srb driven bsp therefore the selection of sulfidogenic process should be carefully weighed under varying ph conditions based on the stability efficiency and cost effectiveness of the sulfidogenic system 4 1 the stability of the bsp under different ph conditions different chemical and biological behaviors were found in sulfate reducing and sulfur reducing microbial communities with the declining ph the alkalinity produced in the sulfate reduction process benefit the stability of the srb driven bsp in acidic condition the srb driven bsp in our research showed an excellent ability to neutralize the influent and maintained the diversity of microbial community in the sulfate reducing bioreactor the results are consistent with the previous studies montoya et al 2013 sánchez andrea et al 2014 the abundance of fermentation genera such as t78 and kosmotage did not change significantly during the four stages which maintained the ability to decompose organic matter and provided electron for sulfidogenic bacteria by contrast low ph in s0rb driven bsp limited the active of fermentation bacteria which resulted to the decrease of carbon utilization rate and thus limited the production of sulfide the ph tolerance of srb for the wide ph range play an important role in the stability of the srb driven bsp srb were ancient microorganisms that widely exist in a variety of habitats such as lakes paddy fields underground pipelines and some industry wastewater shen et al 2001 more than 40 srb species including desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium desulfobacter and desulfotomaculum have been reported in previous researches hussain et al 2016 li et al 2018 the results of the microbial community analysis in this study demonstrated that more than five sulfidogenic genera were inhabit in the srb driven bsp fig 5a a variety of srb e g desulfomicrobium desulfococcus desulfobacca geobacter desulfovibrio and desulfomonile in the srb driven bsp have been identified to survive in a wide ph range church et al 2007 lee et al 2009 the relative high diversity of srb promised the stability of the srb driven bsp process under acid condition as for the s0rb driven bsp only a few s0rb were reported under extremely acidic condition florentino et al 2015 the microbial community analysis in this study was consistent with previous studies in which desulfovibrio geobacter and clostridium were found to be the main sulfidogenic genera in neutral conditions qiu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 while desulfurella was dominant in acidic conditions florentino et al 2016a sun et al 2019a 2020b lower microbial community diversity was found in the sulfur reducing bioreactor leading to the fluctuation of microbial community and sulfide production efficiency with the dropping ph in the s0rb driven bsp 4 2 the performance of the bsp under different ph conditions to achieved high rate sulfide production the bsps should be designed to efficiently reduce sulfate or sulfur to sulfide in this study we demonstrated that high rate sulfide production was achieved in s0rb driven bsp under nearly neutral condition the polysulfide involved indirect sulfur reduction i e hs n 1 8 s8 sn 2 h ensured the high rate sulfide production in the s0rb driven bsp under neutral or weak alkaline conditions sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b previous researches demonstrated that compared to sulfate reduction sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb in neutral conditions could be more efficiency for the treatment of organics deficient metal laden wastewater guo et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 however the sulfur reduction was weakened under extremely acidic ph condition the polysulfide is unstable and easily decomposes to form elemental sulfur and sulfide under acidic condition boyd and druschel 2013 suggesting that the sulfur reduction pathway at such conditions may be different from that under circumneutral condition sun et al 2019a in addition as illustrated above s0rb was more sensitive to the decline of ph which weaken the spr under acidic condition florentino et al 2016b however sun et al found that desulfrella was more active at ph 3 5 after long term cultivation so the spr of the s0rb driven bsp may be recovered under highly acidic conditions furthermore hydrogen sulfide gas can easily escape from the effluent of the sulfidogenic systems especially at lower ph level in the s0rb driven bsp which might reduce the removal efficiency of heavy metals and lead to a serious potential odor problem chen et al 2016 therefore the effect of the effluent recirculation percentage on metal removal efficiency should be one key parameter and need to be considered sun et al 2019b 2020a comparatively benefit from the acidic tolerance srb the spr of the srb driven bsp maintained efficient during ph fluctuations even though in acidic condition in this study the spr of the srb driven bsp increased with the dropped of influent ph high rate sulfide production was achieved under acidic condition fig 3a the results indicated that the sulfidogenic system driven by srb was a potential technology to achieve stable and efficient sulfide production for metal removal under acidic conditions 4 3 the cost effectiveness of the bsp under different ph conditions the c s ratios of the s0rb driven bsp was always lower than sulfate reduction in the test theoretically the c s ratio of sulfur reduction and sulfate reduction can be estimated at 0 19 mg c mg s and 0 75 mg c mg s based on the electron balance as described in eqs 1 and 2 zhang et al 2018b in this study the c s ratio of the s0rb driven bsp was always lower than that of the srb driven bsp throughout the 4 stages fig 2c d the results implied that the organic substrates consumption through sulfur reduction by s0rb for sulfide production was lower than that through sulfate reduction by srb especially under neutral conditions although the extra sulfur might lead to an increase of the chemical cost of the proposed sulfidogenic system with sulfur reduction previous studies also found that sulfur reduction process could reduce the chemical costs by 25 6 78 9 in terms of electron donor supply than those reported in the sulfate reduction processes employed in the treatment of metal laden wastewater in neutral conditions qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2020a recently a pilot scale s0rb driven bsp for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater was developed and remarkably reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 for cu2 removal li et al 2021 however the c s ratio in the s0rb driven bsp slightly increased with the decrease of influent ph while it gradually decreased in the srb driven bsp the thermodynamical calculation was conducted to compare the gibbs free energy of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction text s2 reactions of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction under different ph range from 2 0 to 8 0 was described in tables s3 and s4 a higher gibbs free energy means more energy were gained bijmans et al 2009 as shown in fig 7 the gibbs free energy of sulfur reduction was higher at neutral ph ph 5 2 8 0 while the gibbs free energy of sulfate reduction was higher at a lower ph ph 2 0 5 2 moreover srb would better outcompete methanogens at low ph because methanogens are more sensitive to low ph stefanie et al 1994 weijma et al 2002 as a result less of the costly electron donor was lost in acetogenesis methanogenesis or other processes than that in sulfate reduction which decreases the c s ratio of the overall process fig 3d furthermore the carbon utilization efficiency of the s0rb driven bsp was significantly lower than that of the srb driven bsp especially under acidic conditions fig 2e f low ph implies more energy investment in proton pumping across the cytoplasmic membrane bracey et al 1998 though the c s ratio of the s0rb driven bsp was lower than that of srb driven bsp through the whole 300 day operation fig 2c d high level of organic substrate dosage was necessary to maintain the efficient sulfide production in acidic condition fig 1f contrarily the ability of elevating ph by srb maintained a stable carbon utilization efficiency in srb driven bsp the alkali produced in sulfate reduction process neutralized the acidity resulting the decrease in the energy for the maintain of intracellular h balance under acidic conditions sánchez andrea et al 2014 5 conclusions in this study a laboratory scale srb driven bsp and a laboratory scale s0rb driven bsp were established to investigate their long term performance under different ph conditions during 300 days of operation the stability performance and cost effectiveness of the sulfidogenic processes were evaluated the main findings are 1 the srb driven bsp showed higher stability than the s0rb driven bsp during the gradually decline of ph levels the alkali produced in sulfate reduction process neutralized the acidity and a higher diversity of microbial community was observed in the srb driven bsp by contrast the microbial diversity and richness of sulfidogenic bacteria in the s0rb driven bsp showed significant variations owing to the acidity stress 2 the spr of srb driven bsp gradually increased with the decline of ph level achieving maximum spr 83 7 mg s l at the ph 3 2 4 4 while the s0rb driven bsp achieved high spr 56 8 mg s l h under near neutral and mild acidic conditions ph 5 1 6 4 but significantly fluctuated and declined under acidic condition 3 compared to srb driven bsp the s0rb driven bsp remarkable reduced the total carbon cost for the sulfide production under circumneutral condition but the cost effectiveness weakened under acidic condition the extra organic substrate dosage in acidic condition led to the increase of the cost of the s0rb driven bsp 4 collectively to treat metal laden wastewater with different ph conditions the bsp driven by s0rb has higher performance and cost effectiveness under neutral or mild acid conditions 5 0 ph 7 0 while srb driven bsp was more stable and applicable under acidic condition 3 0 ph 5 0 this study demonstrated the long term performance of sulfate and sulfur reducing processes under varying ph conditions and provided a guidance to determine the suitable bsp for different metal laden wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

concentrations of water quality parameters some empirical methods doña et al 2014 niroumand jadidi et al 2019 which either quantitatively or qualitatively predict water quality parameters achieved relatively good performance given that model inputs were simple additionally their spatial resolution is relatively coarse such that monitoring water quality in small field scale is not applicable and individual scale is hardly seen these empirical methods bonansea et al 2019 doña et al 2014 niroumand jadidi et al 2019 song et al 2013 mainly considered several spectral bands ratios as parts of a polynomial regression to predict the variation of water quality parameters lobuglio et al 2007 demonstrated a method bayesian maximum entropy bme to provide improved estimates of water quality chl a with reduced uncertainty associated with chl a estimates however the period of the data collection in their study was too long although they covered a great data variation range creaco et al 2016 proposed a method dubbed multi objective evolutionary polynomial regression epr oga to select most relevant input variables such that the relationship between water quality parameters including cod and tss and input variables could be presented through a polynomial regression model which obtained r 2 over 0 9 for predicting concentration of cod and tss but it needed a large volume of dataset as training dataset to obtain relatively good prediction causing long period of data collection a hyperspectral remote sensing based empirical method was proposed to categorize the spatial distribution of chl a and suspended sediments gu et al 2019 through specific bands ratio and obtained relatively good accuracy around 0 815 however the performance of aforementioned methods suffers instability of various data from other sources and heavily depends on the volume of training data however their method lacked accuracy validation of the model which could not prove the robustness and accuracy of their model semi analytical methods associated with monitoring water quality dona et al 2015 dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 are progressive approaches to inspect water pollution levels and usually infuse remote sensing techniques into them to achieve effective and large scale prediction of water quality parameters a four band semi analytical model obtained relatively accurate prediction of chl a only for chl a of low concentration but failed to obtain accurate prediction for chl a of high concentration le et al 2009 a semi analytical method using hyperspectral remote sensing predicted the content levels of chl a turbidity and phosphorus through linear regression of combination of spectral indices developed from spectral data with r 2 ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 and pearson correlation between ground truth and calculated values ranging from 0 7 to 0 8 bansod et al 2018 nonetheless the resolution of their image data was 6 m relatively low for prediction on their study area and their model failed to obtain good prediction accuracy for chl a of low 1 0µg l and high 1 5µg l concentrations andrade et al 2019 proposed a quasi analytical algorithm aqq to retrieve concentration of chl a with input of water reflectance and their model achieved better performance with lower normalized root mean square error nrmse and higher r 2 nevertheless the spatial resolution of satellite image employed in their study was relatively low causing its limitations of application on some small water areas furthermore quasi analytical algorithm qaa v6 aimed at quantitative calculation of trophic state index tsi concerned water quality parameters including chl a total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp by establishing the relationship between total absorption to optically active constituents and water quality parameters shi et al 2019 however their study did not establish a specific and unified framework to calculate different water quality parameters such that they had to tune the framework to fit different water quality parameters most semi analytical methods are time consuming and expensive albeit they may have obtained relatively accurate results they combined some experimental knowledge historical data and some statistical methods to determine which spectral bands are most pertinent to changes of water quality parameters and therefore there still exists uncertainty in their theoretical basis the amount of percent that these selected spectral bands are related to variation of above mentioned water quality parameters is hardly explanatory spatially varying data points with different hyperspectral reflectance are processed with feature engineering such that significant hyperspectral information can be extracted to work as input to hyperspectral model for classification of water quality adamiak et al 2021 malerba et al 2021 an artificial neural network ann based spatially distributed parameterization method du et al 2018 predicted phosphorus turbidity and chl a with r 2 over 0 9 but it failed to have strong robustness to different datasets where some extreme values exist another hyperspectral remote sensing based gated recurrent neural network gru improved from orthodox cnn quantified the concentration of cod achieving good modeling performance but their data was lab simulated which could represent the complex and pragmatic situation tu et al 2019 a progressively decreasing deep neural network pdnn accurately predicted chl a of low concentration with r 2 over 0 8 but suffered an instability for prediction chl a of high concentration peterson et al 2020 however aforementioned methods neglected the importance of mutual influence of various bands in this study we develop a novel hybrid feedback deep factorization machine model hf dfm which involves deep learning factorization machine rendle 2010 statistical analysis and moran index based spatial distribution pattern lee 2001 analysis to quantitatively predict the concentrations of water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen bod cod and chl a feature engineering is engaged in extraction of significant bands such that the most important bands information can be extracted into our model feature interaction between featuring bands by factorization machine enhances mutual influence of similar bands deep neural network dnn assists to balance superfluous information caused by interaction between dissimilar bands furthermore statistical analysis in hf dfm involves maximum a posteriori map probability estimate hegland 2007 to obtain a point value estimate of an unobserved quantity based on population data moreover moran index analysis determines spatial distribution of unmeasured concentration of water quality parameters to some degree based on known measured values of concentration of water quality parameters the objective of study is to develop a unified and effective model with end to end structure to improve precision of predicting concentration values of various water quality parameters with consideration to spatial distribution pattern of points and influence of calculated points on their neighboring unobserved points our model also provides an insight into influence of possible pollution sources on their neighboring water quality environment 2 study area and data measurements 2 1 study area the study area is a part of maozhou river located in shenzhen southeastern part of guangdong province of china maozhou river is 41 61 km in length in total and 398 13 km 2 in watershed area as shown in fig 1 a the study area ranges from 22 47 45 n to 22 48 15 n in latitude and from 113 50 00 e to 113 51 00 e in longitude covering 0 42 km 2 area furthermore the annual mean precipitation of maozhou river is around 1606 mm the greatest annual rain fall is 2382 mm and the least rain fall is 761 mm precipitation gradually decreases from west to east lin et al 2021 flood season of maozhou river is usually between april and september constituting over 80 precipitation of the whole year and its siltation volume is 110 000 m 3 the annual mean temperature is 22 3 celsius degrees annual mean relative humidity is 79 with improvement of life quality and environmental awareness environmental protection of water have been attracting a great deal of attention of the public some industrial factories along the banks of maozhou river seriously affect the ecological balance of its water environment for these factories may discharge some chemically perilous substances into the river li et al 2019 for instance leakage of industrial waste of textile and leather manufacturing into the river results in deterioration of the water the degradation of water quality can be irreversible within a short time period sarkar et al 2017 countercurrents often occurs in maozhou river since it is adjacent to an estuary which may cause accumulation of large masses of living and industrial waste near or in the river krasner et al 1994 the main types of land use along the river consist of industrial factories dwelling areas parks wetlands and water treatment plant as shown in fig 1 b in fig 1 b wastewater discharge outlet and purified water discharge outlet which represent the discharge outlet for wastewater by local dwellers and factories and the discharge outlet for purified water by sewage treatment plant respectively are marked for further discussion in section 4 additionally fig 1 a and b are from googlemaps and analytical spectral device asd data was collected on sept 3 2019 between 9 a m and 4 p m ecological environment of this river is in the charge of local environmental protection department which is also responsible for inspection of the river contamination the increasing prevalence of remote sensing techniques applied on inspecting water quality poses a significant opportunity such that we can rapidly obtain the reflectance data of the water on large scale for calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters from point to point effectively the study area is wide and open and thus uav can work efficiently efficient and successive inspection of water quality in maozhou river assists local environment protection department to acquire its current state and the environmental state of its adjacent watershed which may affect its water quality the uav flight area is the same with the study area such that we are able to collect reflectance data of densely distributed samples for model training and testing thus researchers can trace the locations of possible pollution sources through concentration distributions of water quality parameters 2 2 data sampling water quality parameter samples and ground reflectance data were collected in situ from five different routes as shown in fig 1 b for training and testing our model uav collected hyperspectral image data could be rapidly obtained for large scale calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters data supporting this research are available here http ruby8 tpy888 cn and http swj sz gov cn with management and regulation of shenzhen city environment protection department and our datasets are not accessible to the public or research community other researchers can obtain the datasets if they get the permission of access to the dataset by shenzhen city environment protection department where they can ask this department for a temporary access account and password to login the internal database of the website http swj sz gov cn we will discuss the details concerning above mentioned data in the following subsections the process of collecting ground and uav hyperspectral data and of calculating water surface reflectance are demonstrated in section 2 2 1 the method of storing collected water samples and of experimental chemical analysis are elaborated in section 2 2 2 finally the process of featuring spectral bands selection is elucidated in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 ground water surface spectral reflectance we collected ground water surface reflectance data by asd with serial number as fshh 325 1075 and manufactured by malvern panalytical ltd usa which covers the wavelengths ranging from 325 nm to 1075 nm 751 wavelengths totally spaced bandwidth of 1nm apart continuous three time recording of readings of sample measurement at each sampling point was implemented the mean of three readings at each sampling point served as the final reading furthermore we used calibrated and standard reference board which has known spectral reflectance to obtain reflectance value via water surface radiance or digital number value as follows peddle et al 2001 1 ρ w a t e r λ r w a t e r λ r r e f λ ρ r e f λ where r w a t e r λ and r r e f λ denotes the radiance from water surface and that from reference board measured under same intensity of solar illumination at wavelength λ respectively ρ r e f λ represents known reflectance from reference board at given wavelength λ the standard protocol of measuring radiance which we employed in this study was modified from that in the study by ruddick et al 2019 we needed a boat to collect water quality parameter samples at sampling sites and chemical analysis of concentrations of water quality parameters from each sample was implemented in laboratories operators on the boat pointed the asd vertically to the water surface to avoid disturbance of water wave such that more intensive and direct reflection could be collected additionally operators should avoid cloud shadow during measurement they held the asd towards water surface as vertically as possible and kept 0 5 m between asd and water surface to avoid interference of shadow in measurement area thus measurement errors would be minimized to some degree meanwhile the measurement of standard reference panel was implemented before we measured the radiance of water surface at each sample site there was no atmospheric correction implemented in this study the uav and ground data were collected simultaneously in order to establish a transferring model for transferring uav data to ground data for reflectance of each point thus we could reduce medium interference between uav and water surface such as dust in the air and clouds the process of data collection by uav was cost efficient and effective and therefore could be applied to calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters on large scale satellite remote sensing reflectance was not employed in our study but uav remote sensing data since satellites and atmospheric correction including angles of solar zenith were not engaged in this study furthermore we collected 35 water samples and conducted ground measurements of water surface reflectance from 5 different routes such that we could generate 35 training samples to train our model the uav platform utilized in our study is dji m600 manufactured by dji company shenzhen guangdong china it has maximum loading capacity of 6 kg flying height limit of 2500 m horizontal and vertical hanging precision of 1 5 m and 0 5 m maximum speed of 18 m s and digital figure transmission station of lightbridge 2 which carried the hyperspectral image collection camera to measure and collect water surface hyperspectral reflectance the uav carried hyperspectral imager is gaia sky m manufactured by dualix company chengdu sichuan china which is a push scanning image device it has 272 wavelengths totally ranging from 399 69 nm to 1001 08 nm bandwidth of approximately 2 21 nm 12 bits weight of 8 kg frame frequency of 25 fps maximum working distance of 5 km and minimum spatial resolution of 0 15 m furthermore we used a nonlinear transferring model to transfer uav reflectance to ground reflectance at each wavelength we placed calibrated reference panels with various known reflectance of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 in the flight area such that uav hyperspectral imager could calculate the water surface reflectance with calibrated reference panels as a reference the measurements of calibrated reference panel were conducted at the beginning and end of data collection by hyperspectral imager carried by uav flight information details are demonstrated in table 1 and uav data was collected on sept 3 2019 the spatial resolution was set to 0 2 m and resampled spatial resolution was set to 0 4 m field of view of flight was 32 degrees and the mean flying speed was 1 6 m s fig 2 shows the flight area covered by ten uav sorties without surroundings covering 0 42 km 2 we are able to transfer uav hyperspectral reflectance to ground reflectance by established transferring model since the range of wavelengths of asd covers that of hyperspectral imager so that they have the same band centers and the same number of wavelengths after transferring 2 2 2 water sampling and chemical analysis the water sampling in this study was implemented simultaneously with the collection of reflectance data we took a boat to collect three bottles of 500 ml water from 0 5 m below the water surface gitelson et al 2008 in situ at each sampling site along each route meanwhile asd and uav collected reflectance data at the same sampling point in accordance with water sampling bottles were shaded with black cloth before chemical analysis of concentrations of water quality parameters in laboratories huang et al 2016 we implemented chemical analysis and discussed chemical instruments for each water quality parameter as below 1 phosphorus mainly exists in the form of dissolved inorganic phosphorus total phosphorus and dissolved total phosphorus concentrations of which were analyzed using experimental reagent ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate by spectrophotometry and a chemical instrument of 722s visible spectrophotometer with precision of 0 02 mg l divrikli et al 2009 2 nitrogen mainly exists in the form of ammonia nitrogen nh 3 n free ammonia nh 3 and ammonium salt nh 4 concentrations of which were tested via nashi reagent spectrophotometry and 722s visible spectrophotometer with precision of 0 03 mg l labhade et al 2015 3 cod was chemically tested for its concentration by an dichromate oxidation method using burette of 2 mg l for precision ryding and forsberg 1977 4 bod was chemically analyzed for its concentration through dilution and seeding method spx 250bsh ii and biochemical incubator with precision of 0 25 mg l jouanneau et al 2014 5 chl a was chemically analyzed for its concentration by spectrophotometry with 99 5 ethanol at a temperature of 78 c in a restrained light condition and precision of 1ug l cotton et al 1978 qiu et al 2013 water samples were stored in dark condition once collected we implemented chemical analysis on water samples from each sampling site and employed the average concentration of each water quality parameter of three water samples at each sampling point as the final concentration for each water quality parameter additionally we took a portion of each water sample to chemically analyze one water quality parameter and then took one more portion to test another water quality parameter such that chemical reaction would not occur between different reagents the chemical reagent ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate for phosphorus would not produce chemical reaction with other water quality parameters mesquita et al 2011 yang et al 2020 nashi reagent spectrophotometry for nitrogen would not make chemical reaction with other water quality parameters zhang et al 2008 dichromate for analyzing cod would not chemically react with other water quality parameters dedkov et al 2000 dilution and seeding method for testing bod would not generate substances chemically reacting with other water quality parameters leiviskä et al 2008 also ethanol for testing chl a would not chemically react with other water quality parameters galès et al 2019 thus our chemical analysis could effectively avoid the interference of other substances 2 2 3 featuring spectral bands selection we employed feature engineering to select 206 featuring bands ranging from 399 69 nm to 941 08 nm the feature engineering includes single value decomposition svd correlation analysis f regression and χ 2 test with degree of freedom of five where 99 95 variance can be explained first the spectral reflectance data from ground asd covering 751 wavelengths at each pixel point could be denoised and decorrelated we employed f regression and χ 2 test where null hypothesis was defined that each band of samples is independent on these denoised and decorrelated bands to obtain the bands with explained variance of 99 95 then svd could be applied on these bands to reduce the total amount of wavelengths such that our model inputs could be reduced for more effective calculation where interminable reflectance information were reduced to some extent first ten single values which could explain 99 95 variance of r d d were calculated furthermore we utilized the first ten columns of v to reduce feature dimension of r d d finally we applied these first ten columns of v as v s f 10 to working as feature matrix to extract the most significant information from r d d the entire process of obtaining final featuring bands can be expressed by eq 2 2 r f i n a l r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 n r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n v s f 10 t where r i j is reflectance of sample i at wavelength j r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 n r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n is the asd reflectance matrix m is the number of samples and n is the number of wavelengths of asd v s f 10 represents the first ten significant features extracted from right singular matrix v the dimensionality of which is 10 n d f denotes degree of freedom ground points were chosen to eliminate the medium interference between asd reflectance and uav hyperspectral reflectance the transferring model is established to transfer uav reflectance to asd reflectance to make uav reflectance consistent with asd reflectance such that the transferred uav hyperspectral reflectance can be applied to calculating concentrations of water quality parameters effectively on large scale the basis part of the transferring model can be expressed by a cubic spline basis function 3 g r λ 1 r λ r λ 2 r λ 3 h r λ ξ 1 h r λ ξ k where h i j denotes i j 3 if i j and 0 otherwise and 1 r λ r λ 2 r λ 3 h r λ ξ 1 h r λ ξ k are spline basis function denotes as g 0 r λ g 1 r λ g k r λ additionally ξ is a set of knots and k is the number of knots in cubic spline we use mean squared error mse as evaluation metric to choose a proper k we define the objective function to choose the best coefficients as below 4 obje ctive a r g min b y gb 2 2 γ b t ω b where y is the observed value vector y 1 y n t b is the coefficient vector β 0 β k 3 t g is the design matrix which can be defined as 1 r λ 1 2 h r λ 0 ξ k 1 r λ 2 2 h r λ 1 ξ k 1 r λ n 2 h r λ n ξ k n k 4 ω is the penalty matrix with ω i j g i r λ g j r λ d r λ and γ is tunning parameter the optimal b can be obtained through normal equation royston and sauerbrei 2007 5 b g t g γ ω 1 g t y where optimal γ can be selected through leave one out cross validation loocv therefore our transferring model can be defined as 6 y r λ g r λ b β 0 β 1 r λ β 2 r λ 2 β 3 r λ 3 i 4 k 3 β i h r λ ξ i 3 where y r λ is the transferred reflectance from uav to asd at wavelength λ and β i s are coefficients y r λ can be processed with feature engineering as eq 2 to work as inputs of our model thus the whole process of obtaining the significant and featuring bands information can be summarized as 1 simultaneous collection of asd and uav hyperspectral reflectance data 2 uav hypersepctral reflectance data can be transferred to asd reflectance through eq 6 3 all transferred bands from uav to asd can be processed with feature engineering and most significant features v s f 10 about these bands can be extracted through eq 2 4 finally uav hyperspectral data r f i n a l work as the input of our model for large scale calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters 3 methodology in this study our proposed model hf dfm mainly consists of deep neural network probability analysis machine with feedback mechanism feature extractor and factorization machine hf dfm is imrpoved from conventional deepfm guo et al 2017 with probabilistic modeling and bidirectional feedback engaged such that hf dfm can balance calculation effectiveness and resulting precision fig 3 shows the workflow of our proposed method hf dfm for calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters on large scale first ground data collection mainly consists of collection of in situ water samples and collection of water surface spectral reflectance these two datasets as training datasets are engaged in establishment of hf dfm model feature engineering extracts the most significant features of ground spectral reflectance by asd as training dataset of hf dfm second the uav hypspectral reflectance data are transferred to asd reflectance and are processed with feature engineering as eq 2 to obtain significant bands information working as final inputs of hf dfm model for large scale calculation thus hf dfm is able to calculate large scale concentrations of water quality parameters efficiently through uav hyperspectral image data finally the package of arcgis is applied to generating thematic images of concentration distributions from each water quality parameter fig 4 shows the architecture of our proposed model hf dfm hf dfm is established based on deepfm guo et al 2017 which integrates high and low order feature interaction and deep learning to make some bands information influenced by other bands information the input of hf dfm can be divided into two parts the significant bands information and deviation degree the extracted significant features can be obtained through eq 2 6 and deviation degree denotes how many standard deviations that each sample deviates from the mean of the sample population concentrations of five water quality parameters can be obtained through chemical analysis for each sample whereby five deviation degrees corresponding to five water quality parameters can be obtained for each sample additionally deviation degree of each sample is employed and separated by a dashed line from first k fields which are extracted from feature engineering layer in concatenation layer from fig 4 after concatenation of k fields and n k indicator fields representing deviation degrees for each observation all fields in concatenation layer are processed with deepfm deepfm includes two main parts factoization machine and deep neural network details of which are shown as follows 7 y f m w x j 1 1 n j 2 j 1 1 n e j 1 e j 2 x j 1 x j 2 where w is the embedding weights x is the input e i is the i th feature embedding and n is the dimension of the field size dnn part is defined as 8 y d n n σ w h 1 a h b d n n h 1 where w h 1 is the hidden weight of layer h 1 and a h is the output from layer h then a fully connected layer is applied to concatenation of dnn output and factorization machine output 9 y f c σ w f c y c o n n e c t b f c where y c o n n e c t is the concatenation of y f m and y d n n w f c is the weight matrix in fully connected layer and b f c is the bias in fully connected layer the output can be obtained in output unit 10 y o u t σ w o u t y f c b o u t where y o u t is the output w o u t is the weight matrix and b o u t is the bias in output unit respectively once the output in output unit is obtained we utilize a probabilistic analysis machine to investigate concentration distributions of each water quality parameter with a unknown mean μ and known variance σ 2 we suppose that concentration of each water quality parameter follows a normal distribution abdullah et al 2009 pasha and lansey

x μ is the joint distribution of x i and x i i i d n μ σ 2 x represents the concentration of a water quality parameter for each sample μ 0 and σ 0 2 can be determined by the mean and variance of each

concentration of each water quality parameter from each route we set log l θ τ θ 0 and log l θ τ τ 0 and thus θ m l e j i 1 n x i n and τ m l e j i 1 n x i θ m l e 2 n can be obtained from each route j and there are five of them totally thus μ 0 i 1 5 θ m l e i 5 and σ 0 i 1 5 τ m l e i 5 work as the mean and variance of the empirical prior distribution σ 2 can be determined by the variance of concentration of each water quality parameter from chemically analyzed results of samples from five routes thus the max a posterior for μ x can be denoted as μ m a p μ 0 σ 2 i 1 n σ 0 2 x i σ 2 n σ 0

outputs the resulting concentration of each water quality parameter we set a threshold 3 σ 1 for the concentration of each water quality parameter and the resulting concentration is regarded as an outlier and deprecated if it is beyond 3 σ 1 additionally it is added to μ x as new observation to expand the sample size of μ x if it is within 3 σ 1 for the sake of higher data completeness and robustness of posterior distribution of gaussian mean to various inputs moreover we recalculate the concentration if it is an outlier compared with 3 σ 1 by moran index arbia 2001 analysis machine 13 i n w i j w i j x i x x j x i x i x 2 where n is the amount of spatial units that we have calculated and obtained from sampling indexed by i and j x denotes the calculated and chemically analyzed concentration of water quality parameters w i j is a matrix of spatial weights with zeroes on the diagonal and w is the sum of all w i j s the null hypothesis for spatial distribution of concentration is that concentrations are randomly distributed the alternative hypothesis is that spatial distribution of concentration is distributed by a certain pattern two sided z test is employed for determination of spatial distribution pattern of concentrations 14 z i i e i v i where e i 1 n 1 v i e i 2 e i 2 and significance level is set to 0 05 therefore we can determine the spatial distribution mode of concentrations of water quality parameters by moran index a uav hyperspectral image can be divided into large amounts of small areas whereby areas with concentrations calculated are combined together to show distributions of concentration of each water quality parameter for the convenience of calculation each small area consists of nine pixel points with known observation as the center of calculation area as shown in fig 5 a furthermore we extend each small calculation area from their neighboring points such that calculation can be implemented around ground truth and follow a certain distribution pattern the reason that concentrations of water quality parameters may follow a spatial distribution pattern lies in the mobility of water and the location fixity of sewage discharge das and ghosh 2017 once a calculated concentration is an outlier a moran index is utilized to determine the spatial distribution pattern of the small area where the outlier pixel point is replaced with the mean of concentrations of its geographically nearest four pixel points a threshold zero is set for moran index such that concentrations area clustered if moran index is greater than zero and dispersed otherwise outlier concentration point is replaced with mean of four concentration points with center distance of 2 unit to it if moran index of this small area is less than zero also outlier concentration point is replaced with the mean of four concentration points with center distance of 1 unit to it if moran index of this small area is greater than zero as fig 5 b demonstrates thus a feedback mechanism is established through two components moran index analysis machine and probabilistic analysis machine which improves calculation precision probabilistic analysis machine receives and analyzes the results and transmits the results to moran index analysis machine we recalculate the concentration results if results are determined to be outliers according to the feedback from moran index analysis machine finally the obejctive function to be minimized is defined as 15 o b j i 1 n y i y i 2 λ θ s where y i is the ground truth y i is the predicted value θ is the size of all parameters and s is the embedding size furthermore more details about working mechanism of hf dfm can be found in algorithm 1 4 results and discussion in this section we conduct experiments on our proposed model hf dfm to evaluate the effectiveness of predicting concentration of each water quality parameter on our in situ collected testing dataset first we briefly introduce our dataset evaluation metrics parameter settings second we compare our method hf dfm with other relevant methods finally we test the effects of different parameter settings on the performance of hf dfm 4 1 dataset we collected two datasets on the same study area as mentioned in study area section where one dataset collected on sept 3 2019 as training dataset was utilized to train hf dfm and the other dataset collected on sept 17 2019 the same data volume with training dataset was the testing dataset training dataset was collected under 33 5 c and testing dataset was collected under 26 5 c the variation of sunlight intensity did not interfere the accuracy of collected reflectance data of asd and uav since calibration by standard reference panel for asd and uav was implemented before measurement fig 6 shows the in situ collected asd spectral reflectance from different routes which covers the entire study area table 2 shows the range of concentration of each water quality from different routes some water quality parameters vary considerably from route to route which may be caused by some sewage drainages nearby reflectance of different substances varies based on their optical properties from table 2 and fig 6 route 1 has higher reflectance values near wavelengths of 300 nm 600 nm 900 nm and 1000 nm compared with other routes and it has higher concentration of phosphorus song et al 2018 demonstrated that there is strong positive correlation between concentration of phosphorus and spectral reflectance in the range from 450 to 630 nm fig 6 a indicates the positive correlation between concentration of phosphorus and spectral reflectance near the wavelength 600 nm which implies that phosphorus has a reflection peak near 600 nm wavelength phosphorus varies considerably in spectra from 400 nm to 900 nm nitrogen has a reflection peak near 890 nm which indicates a positive correlation between concentration of nitrogen and the reflectance at wavelength of 890 nm barrett and frazier 2016 song et al 2018 yao et al 2010 as shown in fig 6 a c e furthermore high reflectance values at wavelengths ranging from 900 nm to 1000 nm may elucidate the high concentration of cod essam et al 2017 tong et al 2010 as shown fig 6 a d and e in fig 6 a d and e they have higher reflectance values near wavelengths ranging from 350 nm to 500 nm and from 700 nm to 950 nm and they have higher concentration of bod which means bod may have relatively high reflection around near these wavelengths if massive accumulation of bod occurs xing et al 2019 bod and cod are related to the spectra ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm to some extent peterson et al 2020 sharaf and zhang 2017 moreover higher concentration of chl a may show a higher reflection values near wavelength ranging from 600 nm to 700 nm li et al 2010 also reflectance of chl a experimentally varies in spectra ranging from 450 nm to 850 nm gitelson et al 2007 water quality parameters are mostly covered within our selected wavelength range from 399 69 nm to 941 08 nm 4 2 baselines to validate the effectiveness of hf dfm hf dfm was compared with several related and representative methods ols tong et al 2010 it employs ordinary least square ols method to predict the concentrations of bod and cod quantitatively based on combinations of several bands reflectance ga pls song et al 2013 it is a hybrid model combining genetic algorithm and partial least square pls to predict concentrations of phosphorus and chl a through hyperspectral reflectance data plsr svmr zhai et al 2013 it combines partial least squares regression plsr and support vector machine regression svmr to estimate the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus based on reflectance spectroscopy dlf wang et al 2020 it combines partial least squares pls random forest rf extreme learning machine elm and gaussian process gp to predict the concentration of total nitrogen tn through uav collected hyperspectral reflectance idfm dona et al 2015 it develops an integrated algorithm for data fusion and mining of remote sensing images to estimate the concentration of chl a by using fused water surface reflectance data as inputs filling the temporal gaps and capturing spectral features bpnn essam et al 2017 it is an artificial intelligence modeling method for mapping concentrations of both optical and non optical water quality parameters including tss cod and bod 4 3 evaluation metrics according to the common practice in evaluation of performance in predicting concentrations of water quality parameters rmse mape and r 2 to compare the performance of hf dfm with that of aforementioned baselines furthermore we establish a hypothesis test with f statistic which plays an important and indispensable role in analysis of variance anova to verify the validity and effectiveness of hf dfm where the null hypothesis is that model 2 does not outperform the model 1 and the alternative hypothesis is defined that model 2 outperforms the model 1 by calculating f statistics bentler and yuan 1999 16 g f s t a t i s t i c s y y r s s 1 r s s 2 p 2 p 1 r s s 2 n p 2 where r s s i denotes the rss of model i p i is the number of features of model i and n represents the number of samples thereby the model which outperforms the others can be determined by f statistic value additionally we apply another hypothesis test by using welch s t test to measure the degree of deviation between predicted values and the measured values through the mean of each group where the null hypothesis is defined that the mean of predicted values is as same as that of the measured values we suppose that predicted values and measured values are independent samples with unequal variance t statistic and corresponding degree of freedom by welch s t test with can be formulated as 17 f welch s t test y y y m e a n y m e a n s y 2 n y s y 2 n y 18 d f welch s t test y y s y 2 n y s y 2 n y 2 s y 4 n y 2 n y 1 s y 4 n y 2 n y 1 where f welch s t test y y is resulting t score for y and y d f welch s t test y y denotes the degree of freedom s represents standard deviation and n is the number of sample thus the difference between predicted values and measured values can be tested by t statistic and its corresponding p value for further improvement of our model 4 4 parameter settings the main parameters employed in this research consists of embedding size k the number of hidden layers h significant level for welch s t test α learning rate γ and activation function σ all these parameters are initialized as k 16 h 3 α 0 05 γ 0 001 h 3 and leaky relu activation function as σ moreover the training dataset has 35 samples collected on sept 3 2019 and testing dataset has the same amount of samples collected on sept 17 2019 4 5 performance comparison we tested the performance of our proposed method hf dfm on testing dataset where predicted values were compared with measured values as shown in fig 7 the further off the orange line the predicted values are the lower precision hf dfm gets the blue line denotes the regression line between predicted values and measured values hf dfm obtains better results on phosphorus and chl a in terms of r 2 values hf dfm is stable under various external environments since it was trained and tested on the datasets collected at the same sampling sites under different external environments such as temperature and sunlight intensity additionally hf dfm has also obtained relatively accurate prediction results on testing dataset therefore hf dfm has shown a great stability and accuracy on predicting concentrations of water quality parameters furthermore our proposed method hf dfm was compared with its pertinent methods with respect to rmse mape r 2 f statistic t statistic and p value however there is seldom a unified method which is able to predict concentrations of all aforementioned water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a thus one state of the art method is able to predict some of these water quality parameters the comparison results are demonstrated in table 3 and the best results for each water quality parameter are shown in boldface denotes that these methods are unavailable for calculation of some water quality parameters represents that methods of this row are compared with hf dfm the best of which is substituted into eq 16 as model 2 to calculate the f statistic therefore hf dfm is only compared with the best model of this row for f statistic additionally hf dfm generally denotes the model 1 in eq 16 f statistic is thereby compared with the critical value of f distribution with p 2 p 1 n p 2 as parameters where p i is the number features of model i and n is the sample size the null hypothesis is accepted if the resulting f statistic is less than the critical value of the f distribution meaning that model 2 does not outperform hf dfm as model 1 for each water quality parameter the resulting f statistic is smaller than its corresponding critical f statistic value additionally corresponding critical f statistics are 2 32 3 95 4 82 4 23 and 4 52 for phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a respectively t statistic and p value are utilized to determine whether the null hypothesis that the mean of predicted values is as same as that of measured values is rejected or accepted where the critical p value is set as 0 05 for each water quality parameter the null hypothesis is accepted since all resulting p values are greater than the critical p value of 0 05 from table 3 our proposed method hf dfm outperforms other related methods in terms of all aforementioned statistical criteria for predicting concentrations of water quality parameters 4 6 concentration maps the resulting concentration distributions of water quality parameters are shown in fig 8 variability of concentrations of water quality parameters can be observed through the change in the color of each plot the classification standards of pollution level of water quality parameters are established by local environment protection department as shown in each plots of fig 8 thus the local environment protection department is able to determine possible locations of pollution sources according to the change of concentration of each water quality parameter however our uav had to fly along the river several times since there existed restrictions about uav flying height and uav battery imposed by the local government thus all uav hyperspectral images had to be combined to cover the whole study area causing combining traces between images in each plot from september to october the river flowed from right to left in fig 8 the left red rectangle represents the wastewater discharge outlet and the right red rectangle represents the purified water discharge outlet due to the daily living waste discharge along banks of the river such as washing detergent and farm waste the concentration of phosphorus along the banks is higher than that of other parts of the river in accordance with the concentration distribution map of phosphorus as shown in fig 8 a additionally the concentration of phosphorus is relatively lower in the river center since the water carries the phosphorus substances downstream which results in less accumulation of phosphorus substances in the river center fig 8 b shows the similar concentration distribution with fig 8 e since nitrogen is important for synthesis of chl a mishra and srivastava 1983 shangguan et al 2000 discharge of farm fertilizer into the river by fishermen and local inhabitants causes algal boom which is associated with high concentration of chl a abdel 1997 the concentration distribution of phosphorus along the banks is similar to that of nitrogen and chl a because phosphorus and nitrogen are two paramount elements in chemical synthesis of chl a yuan and jones 2020 herbicide related protoporphyrinogen oxidase protox and copper sulfate are used in aquaculture and plastic based materials garcía muñoz et al 2009 nandihalli et al 1994 are discharged into the river on the right side where some fish farms are located and thus the concentrations of nitrogen and of chl a are lower than that on the left side protox is an inhibitor as a herbicide and copper sulfate is necessary in cultivation of aquatic life also copper sulfate is a main component of algaecides and pesticides salam and el fadel 2008 which helps the prevention of some diseases associated with aquatic life furthermore bod and cod have similar distributions as shown in fig 8 c and d massive accumulation bod and cod causes algae to overgrow mahapatra et al 2013 the accumulation of phosphorus nitrogen and chl a are relatively slow in the narrower upper watercourse than that of other parts of the river accordingly lower concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen constrain the growth of algae in narrower upper watercourse and thus algae is short of essential substances to support its growth causing lower concentration of chl a the accumulation of cod and bod is slow in narrower upper watercourse mainly because some fishery farms which cultivate aquatic animals mangunwardoyo et al 2013 are located along banks of the narrower upper watercourse where less residential area and industrial factories are located additionally quick accumulation of nitrogen occurs narrower upper watercourse due to discharge of protox and copper sulfate for reduction of algae and cultivation of aquatic animals concentrations of water quality parameters are higher near wastewater discharge outlet and lower near purified water discharge outlet for most industrial and living waste are discharged through wastewater discharge outlet as shown in fig 8 a e concentrations of water quality parameters on the left side of each plot are almost higher than that on the right side since more industrial parks and dwelling district are located near banks of the right side of the river and the river flows to the left carrying wastewater additionally the evaluation criteria of water quality adopt environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 ghzb1 1999 and the detailed information of evaluation criteria about phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a are demonstrated at the lower left corner of each plot in fig 8 according to environmental quality standards for surface water water quality of class i is mainly applicable to water sources and national natural reserve water quality of class ii is mainly applicable to centralized drinking water first grade protection zones of surface water source and habitats for rare aquatic life water quality of class iii is mainly applicable to centralized drinking water second grade protection zones of surface water source and fisheries water water quality of class iv is mainly applicable to industrial water areas and recreational water areas where the direct contact with human body is not allowed water quality of class v is mainly applicable to agricultural water and landscape related water water quality of class vi is mainly applicable to seriously contaminated water which is not allowed to be used for any purpose in fig 8 water quality ranges from class iii to class vi in terms of concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen water quality ranges from class ii to class iv with respect to cod and from class iii to class v with respect to bod furthermore water quality ranges from class i to class iii based on chl a according to instruction of local environment protection department the comprehensive water quality is determined by the mean of water quality in terms of phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a the water quality of our study area varies considerably with respect to different water quality parameters abuse of phosphorus based detergent industrial pigment fertilizer pesticides and so on causes a serious degradation of water quality efficient methods need to be employed to alleviate eutrophication such as algal boom by local environmental protection department thus it is of paramount importance to monitor water quality and reduce the volume of industrial and domestic wastewater effectively 4 7 parameter sensitivity different settings of model parameters may have some effects on the performance of hf dfm to explore the impacts of various parameters of hf dfm we investigate the influence of the embedding size and of the number of hidden layers on the performance of hf dfm we use mape as evaluation metric to test the performance of hf dfm since rmse of different water quality parameters varies considerably in numerical magnitude 4 7 1 effects of embedding size the embedding size of hf dfm is related to the capacity of encoded information of bands features and we set embedding size to 4 8 16 32 and 64 the results of different settings are shown in fig 9 with embedding size increasing mape of hf dfm gradually decreases until embedding size of 16 the performance of hf dfm achieves the best result at embedding size of 16 however mape gradually increases after embedding size of 16 the reasonably large embedding size may improve the performance of hf dfm however mape increases if embedding size exceeds the critical value such as 16 since too large embedding size may cause our model to capture some redundant and insignificant information about bands features fig 9 shows variability of mape of all water quality parameters over the different embedding sizes 4 7 2 effects of the number of hidden layers the impact of the number of hidden layers on the performance of hf dfm can not be neglected the number of hidden layers is denoted as hidden layers in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 with the number of hidden layers increasing mape decreases until the number of hidden layers of 3 where hf dfm achieves the best performance and increases after the number of hidden layers of 3 which may be caused by too large masses of hidden layers unreasonably large amount of hidden layers may contain some superfluous and unnecessary information of inputs and increase the computational cost 4 8 challenges and opportunities our proposed model hf dfm is a unified model which is able to predict various water quality parameters by varying the output without changing the entire architecture of the model compared with other related models hf dfm is capable of predicting more water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a with higher accuracy in a unified structure and achieves better performance in terms of rmse mape and r 2 compared with satellite based hyperspectral remote sensing methods bonansea et al 2019 dona et al 2015 dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 essam et al 2017 for predicting concentrations of water quality parameters uva based hyperspectral remote sensing methods are more effective because it is more flexible to collect data with high quality of images and it achieves a great performance our proposed method is applicable to quantitative and precise estimation of water quality of small and medium sized water areas such as urban rivers due to flexibility and effective data collection of uav and robustness of our proposed method the proposed method is applied to monitoring water quality and early warning system of water environment protection which may also notice the public to minimize contact with the water of high pollution level compared with satellite based remote sensing techniques the transmission of collected data from uav to our workstation is faster and collected image data have higher spatial resolution for urban rivers high spatial resolution of images is important and significant since the concentration distribution of water quality parameters in some parts of urban rivers may indicate pollution sources additionally lengthy process of obtaining and transmitting satellite data may result in a delay in tracing pollution sources and solving related problems thereby our proposed method poses significant opportunities for effectively monitoring water quality of urban rivers there exists intensive medium interference between satellite based remote sensing and target objects although satellite based remote sensing can cover larger areas however there still exist some limitations such as limitation of size of training dataset calculation bias of transferring uav reflectance data to asd reflectance data operational bias of sample collection and systematic bias of chemical analysis of water quality parameters additionally operators may not point asd to the water surface with intense sunlight and without any shadow in the target area ground sampling may not be completely simultaneous with data collection of uav also gps location may have tiny systematic error some other methods employed hundreds of samples which were simulated in laboratory rather than in situ collected laboratory simulated samples may not represent the complex and practical environment of water quality additionally total organic carbon toc turbidity and tss are also water quality parameters our samples are in situ collected in this study nevertheless the data collection is time consuming and chemical analysis of water quality parameters is expensive in laboratory which seriously hinders the progress of our research and local environmental protection mainly focuses on phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a thus we have not chemically analyzed toc tss and turbidity and further study will cover analysis of toc tss and turbidity our proposed method is robust and efficient due to its spectral feature interaction and feedback mechanism including probabilistic analysis and spatial distribution pattern analysis and shows higher accuracy on quantitatively estimation of water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a there may exist a positive correlation between cod bod and toc lee et al 2016 and hf dfm has shown great performance on calculation of concentrations of cod and bod whereby hf dfm is highly likely to accurately predict the concentration of toc moreover turbidity and tss are related to water clarity and have some optical properties such as their concentrations negatively correlate with reflectance olmanson et al 2013 the existence of turbidity and tss may negatively affect algal photosynthesis and further hinder algal growth to reduce the concentration of chl a by blocking the passage of sunlight to underwater algae chaffin et al 2018 tosic et al 2019 hf dfm is able to accurately estimate concentrations of tss and turbidity since hf dfm has obtained accurate prediction on chl a with which tss and turbidity may have a negative correlation he et al 2019 saluja and garg 2016 furthermore prediction of concentrations of water quality parameters based on low value and considerably varying reflectance is difficult since it is hard to employ weak signals to quantitatively estimate concentrations the small range of concentrations of water quality parameters in training dataset may constrain the variation range of predicted results in testing dataset to some extent which may affect the prediction accuracy in some parts of the study area due to the constraints of financial support and the time we collected 35 samples as training dataset and another 35 samples of the same sampling points after two weeks other related methods might perform better with larger training dataset but their samples were simulated in laboratory without considering practical and complicated water environment such that their works were short of consideration of real situation to some degree additionally other methods as mentioned early were tested on a small fraction of their entire dataset to achieve better performance for future study we should collect more samples from various rivers and thus our model hf dfm is more generalized and more adaptable to hyperspectral data from different watersheds moreover we need to ensure that the sampling process should be implemented under intense sunlight and no shadow is in the target area also the high quality of uav hyperspectral image data have to be ensured for high prediction accuracy featuring bands may not be fixed for future research and further study about bands selection should be done unmanned collection of ground samples and in situ quick chemical analysis of samples may pose a great opportunity to more effective ground sample collection and analysis in further study prior distribution of unknown parameters in eqs 11 and 12 should determined with more related works to ensure that the posterior distribution models the in situ collected data more appropriately and our model will achieve higher prediction accuracy in future work 5 conclusion in this study we developed a hybrid method hf dfm improved from deep factorization machine which involves deep learning statistical analysis and spatial distribution pattern to quantitatively predict concentrations of water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod chl a based on hyperspectral reflectance data furthermore we also developed a procedure of collecting water samples and ground spectral reflectance data simultaneously with uav hyperspectral sampling we employed feature engineering to select significant bands features and we established a transferring model to transfer uav reflectance data to asd reflectance data we combined all above models into a unified architecture an end to end structure with raw data from uav asd and chemically analyzed results of water samples as inputs the experimental results from hf dfm on testing dataset shows a greater performance compared with other relevant methods as discussed in section 4 baselines in terms of rmse mape and r 2 where mapes of phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a are 8 78 12 36 8 96 9 62 and 9 14 respectively the fitness of model to the testing dataset can be demonstrated by r 2 and r 2 of phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a are 0 92 0 91 0 88 0 81 and 0 93 respectively collection of hyperspectral image data by uav is more effective and more flexible with higher spatial resolution than that collected by satellites the medium interference of which is much smaller compared with data collected by satellites further research can be implemented to reduce the time and financial cost cloud stations for immediate data exchange may be established unmanned collection of water samples may be established to reduce time cost of sample collection the scanning width of a uav could be much wider to cover more area effectively further research may require more relevant data to make the model more generalized to fit a wide variety of water bodies mutual influence from featuring bands corresponding to the variation of water quality parameters and feedback mechanism of probabilistic analysis and spatial distribution pattern analysis enhance the robustness and accuracy of hf dfm and balance hf dfm sensitivity and anti interference to some extreme concentration values such that hf dfm has a potential to be applied to other water bodies such as urban rivers additionally hf dfm has obtained relatively accurate prediction on low and high concentrations of water quality parameters and thus it is highly possible to achieve equally great performance on quantifying these water quality parameters in other urban rivers moreover hf dfm is currently applied to monitoring the water quality of maozhou river shenzhen city guandong province china thus local environment protection department is able to trace the locations of pollution sources through variation of concentrations of water quality parameters effectiveness of the methodology for quantifying concentrations of water quality parameters and the procedure for featuring bands selection were validated through the application of monitoring water quality in maozhou river the significance of this study lies in 1 the proposed method is effective for real time monitoring variation of water quality of urban rivers and is a useful operational monitoring tool to support decision making for water environment management of urban rivers 2 the study establishes a systematic approach of water sampling data collection laboratory chemical analysis of water samples data modeling and prediction for further research 3 the model framework can enhance transferability between different applications with more and various data collection and can be replicated in other regions of the world for evaluating the suitability of water quality for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes 4 the proposed method is beneficial and helpful to trace pollution sources and shows profound prospects in establishment of early warning system to notify the public to avoid touching contaminated water to make our model more applicable and robust to various watersheds more multidisciplinary research should be involved in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16656,environmental protection of water resources is of critical importance to daily life of human beings in recent years monitoring the variation of water quality using remote sensing techniques has become prevalent unmanned aerial vehicle uav based remote sensing techniques have been applied to quantitative retrieval of concentrations of water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and chlorophyll a chl a successfully and efficiently in this study a novel method with deep factorization machine spatial distribution pattern analysis and probabilistic analysis engaged named hybrid feedback deep factorization machine hf dfm has been developed to quantitatively estimate concentrations of water quality parameters based on hyperspectral reflectance data on large scale effectively our proposed method is a unified model for quantifying concentrations of water quality parameters with an end to end structure which integrates uav based optical remote sensing techniques and deep learning to estimate concentrations of water quality parameters furthermore our proposed model was applied to real time quantitative monitoring the variation of water quality of mazhou river shenzhen guangdong china finally we evaluate the performance of proposed model on a real world dataset in terms of root of mean squared error rmse mean absolute percent error mape and coefficient of determination r 2 the experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms other state of the art models with respect to rmse mape and r 2 where resulting mapes for quantifying all water quality parameters range from 8 78 to 12 36 and resulting r 2 s range from 0 81 to 0 93 it can serve as a useful tool for decision makers in effectively monitoring water quality of urban rivers keywords hyperspectral images water quality monitoring deep learning spectral unmixing spatial distribution analysis 1 introduction contamination of water due to sewage disposal into urban rivers causing the deterioration of water quality has become one of the most important topics of environmental protection therefore effective monitoring the variation of water quality is important to protection of urban rivers which assists to track possible locations of pollution sources recently models of monitoring water quality based on deep learning and machine learning which involve remote sensing techniques have been widely applied to quantitative calculation of the content levels of major water quality parameters including phosphorus lewis jr et al 2011 shinohara et al 2017 nitrogen islam et al 2004 biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod hua 2017 chlorophyll a chl a hara et al 2020 turbidity and total suspended solids tss bilotta and brazier 2008 the massive accumulation of phosphorus and nitrogen causes the eutrophication lewis jr et al 2011 shinohara et al 2017 and eutrophication can cause the quick accumulation of chl a in mass which seriously disturbs the urban river ecosystem such as mortality of aquatic organism such as fish and shrimp islam et al 2004 furthermore the high content level of chl a gets associated with that of cod and bod hua 2017 phu 2014 turbidity and total suspended solids are associated to each other affecting the complexity and time length of physical process of water purification bilotta and brazier 2008 bukhari 2008 real time and high precision assessment of monitoring the change in water quality is fundamental and paramount for water environment protection moreover determining types and concentrations of major pollution components which result in the variation of water quality is essential to solving problems of water pollution in recent years with rapid advance in remote sensing techniques remote sensing based retrieval of variation of water quality parameters in urban rivers on large scale have become prevalent in monitoring water quality ross et al 2019 van dijk et al 2016 monitoring water quality often adopts various approaches including empirical methods bonansea et al 2019 doña et al 2014 niroumand jadidi et al 2019 song et al 2013 semi analytical methods dona et al 2015 dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network cnn malerba et al 2021 deep convolutional generative and adversarial network dcgan adamiak et al 2021 and bayesian neural network bnn essam et al 2017 hassan esfahani et al 2017 most of them categorized the level of water quality according to concentrations of water quality parameters some empirical methods doña et al 2014 niroumand jadidi et al 2019 which either quantitatively or qualitatively predict water quality parameters achieved relatively good performance given that model inputs were simple additionally their spatial resolution is relatively coarse such that monitoring water quality in small field scale is not applicable and individual scale is hardly seen these empirical methods bonansea et al 2019 doña et al 2014 niroumand jadidi et al 2019 song et al 2013 mainly considered several spectral bands ratios as parts of a polynomial regression to predict the variation of water quality parameters lobuglio et al 2007 demonstrated a method bayesian maximum entropy bme to provide improved estimates of water quality chl a with reduced uncertainty associated with chl a estimates however the period of the data collection in their study was too long although they covered a great data variation range creaco et al 2016 proposed a method dubbed multi objective evolutionary polynomial regression epr oga to select most relevant input variables such that the relationship between water quality parameters including cod and tss and input variables could be presented through a polynomial regression model which obtained r 2 over 0 9 for predicting concentration of cod and tss but it needed a large volume of dataset as training dataset to obtain relatively good prediction causing long period of data collection a hyperspectral remote sensing based empirical method was proposed to categorize the spatial distribution of chl a and suspended sediments gu et al 2019 through specific bands ratio and obtained relatively good accuracy around 0 815 however the performance of aforementioned methods suffers instability of various data from other sources and heavily depends on the volume of training data however their method lacked accuracy validation of the model which could not prove the robustness and accuracy of their model semi analytical methods associated with monitoring water quality dona et al 2015 dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 are progressive approaches to inspect water pollution levels and usually infuse remote sensing techniques into them to achieve effective and large scale prediction of water quality parameters a four band semi analytical model obtained relatively accurate prediction of chl a only for chl a of low concentration but failed to obtain accurate prediction for chl a of high concentration le et al 2009 a semi analytical method using hyperspectral remote sensing predicted the content levels of chl a turbidity and phosphorus through linear regression of combination of spectral indices developed from spectral data with r 2 ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 and pearson correlation between ground truth and calculated values ranging from 0 7 to 0 8 bansod et al 2018 nonetheless the resolution of their image data was 6 m relatively low for prediction on their study area and their model failed to obtain good prediction accuracy for chl a of low 1 0µg l and high 1 5µg l concentrations andrade et al 2019 proposed a quasi analytical algorithm aqq to retrieve concentration of chl a with input of water reflectance and their model achieved better performance with lower normalized root mean square error nrmse and higher r 2 nevertheless the spatial resolution of satellite image employed in their study was relatively low causing its limitations of application on some small water areas furthermore quasi analytical algorithm qaa v6 aimed at quantitative calculation of trophic state index tsi concerned water quality parameters including chl a total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp by establishing the relationship between total absorption to optically active constituents and water quality parameters shi et al 2019 however their study did not establish a specific and unified framework to calculate different water quality parameters such that they had to tune the framework to fit different water quality parameters most semi analytical methods are time consuming and expensive albeit they may have obtained relatively accurate results they combined some experimental knowledge historical data and some statistical methods to determine which spectral bands are most pertinent to changes of water quality parameters and therefore there still exists uncertainty in their theoretical basis the amount of percent that these selected spectral bands are related to variation of above mentioned water quality parameters is hardly explanatory spatially varying data points with different hyperspectral reflectance are processed with feature engineering such that significant hyperspectral information can be extracted to work as input to hyperspectral model for classification of water quality adamiak et al 2021 malerba et al 2021 an artificial neural network ann based spatially distributed parameterization method du et al 2018 predicted phosphorus turbidity and chl a with r 2 over 0 9 but it failed to have strong robustness to different datasets where some extreme values exist another hyperspectral remote sensing based gated recurrent neural network gru improved from orthodox cnn quantified the concentration of cod achieving good modeling performance but their data was lab simulated which could represent the complex and pragmatic situation tu et al 2019 a progressively decreasing deep neural network pdnn accurately predicted chl a of low concentration with r 2 over 0 8 but suffered an instability for prediction chl a of high concentration peterson et al 2020 however aforementioned methods neglected the importance of mutual influence of various bands in this study we develop a novel hybrid feedback deep factorization machine model hf dfm which involves deep learning factorization machine rendle 2010 statistical analysis and moran index based spatial distribution pattern lee 2001 analysis to quantitatively predict the concentrations of water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen bod cod and chl a feature engineering is engaged in extraction of significant bands such that the most important bands information can be extracted into our model feature interaction between featuring bands by factorization machine enhances mutual influence of similar bands deep neural network dnn assists to balance superfluous information caused by interaction between dissimilar bands furthermore statistical analysis in hf dfm involves maximum a posteriori map probability estimate hegland 2007 to obtain a point value estimate of an unobserved quantity based on population data moreover moran index analysis determines spatial distribution of unmeasured concentration of water quality parameters to some degree based on known measured values of concentration of water quality parameters the objective of study is to develop a unified and effective model with end to end structure to improve precision of predicting concentration values of various water quality parameters with consideration to spatial distribution pattern of points and influence of calculated points on their neighboring unobserved points our model also provides an insight into influence of possible pollution sources on their neighboring water quality environment 2 study area and data measurements 2 1 study area the study area is a part of maozhou river located in shenzhen southeastern part of guangdong province of china maozhou river is 41 61 km in length in total and 398 13 km 2 in watershed area as shown in fig 1 a the study area ranges from 22 47 45 n to 22 48 15 n in latitude and from 113 50 00 e to 113 51 00 e in longitude covering 0 42 km 2 area furthermore the annual mean precipitation of maozhou river is around 1606 mm the greatest annual rain fall is 2382 mm and the least rain fall is 761 mm precipitation gradually decreases from west to east lin et al 2021 flood season of maozhou river is usually between april and september constituting over 80 precipitation of the whole year and its siltation volume is 110 000 m 3 the annual mean temperature is 22 3 celsius degrees annual mean relative humidity is 79 with improvement of life quality and environmental awareness environmental protection of water have been attracting a great deal of attention of the public some industrial factories along the banks of maozhou river seriously affect the ecological balance of its water environment for these factories may discharge some chemically perilous substances into the river li et al 2019 for instance leakage of industrial waste of textile and leather manufacturing into the river results in deterioration of the water the degradation of water quality can be irreversible within a short time period sarkar et al 2017 countercurrents often occurs in maozhou river since it is adjacent to an estuary which may cause accumulation of large masses of living and industrial waste near or in the river krasner et al 1994 the main types of land use along the river consist of industrial factories dwelling areas parks wetlands and water treatment plant as shown in fig 1 b in fig 1 b wastewater discharge outlet and purified water discharge outlet which represent the discharge outlet for wastewater by local dwellers and factories and the discharge outlet for purified water by sewage treatment plant respectively are marked for further discussion in section 4 additionally fig 1 a and b are from googlemaps and analytical spectral device asd data was collected on sept 3 2019 between 9 a m and 4 p m ecological environment of this river is in the charge of local environmental protection department which is also responsible for inspection of the river contamination the increasing prevalence of remote sensing techniques applied on inspecting water quality poses a significant opportunity such that we can rapidly obtain the reflectance data of the water on large scale for calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters from point to point effectively the study area is wide and open and thus uav can work efficiently efficient and successive inspection of water quality in maozhou river assists local environment protection department to acquire its current state and the environmental state of its adjacent watershed which may affect its water quality the uav flight area is the same with the study area such that we are able to collect reflectance data of densely distributed samples for model training and testing thus researchers can trace the locations of possible pollution sources through concentration distributions of water quality parameters 2 2 data sampling water quality parameter samples and ground reflectance data were collected in situ from five different routes as shown in fig 1 b for training and testing our model uav collected hyperspectral image data could be rapidly obtained for large scale calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters data supporting this research are available here http ruby8 tpy888 cn and http swj sz gov cn with management and regulation of shenzhen city environment protection department and our datasets are not accessible to the public or research community other researchers can obtain the datasets if they get the permission of access to the dataset by shenzhen city environment protection department where they can ask this department for a temporary access account and password to login the internal database of the website http swj sz gov cn we will discuss the details concerning above mentioned data in the following subsections the process of collecting ground and uav hyperspectral data and of calculating water surface reflectance are demonstrated in section 2 2 1 the method of storing collected water samples and of experimental chemical analysis are elaborated in section 2 2 2 finally the process of featuring spectral bands selection is elucidated in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 ground water surface spectral reflectance we collected ground water surface reflectance data by asd with serial number as fshh 325 1075 and manufactured by malvern panalytical ltd usa which covers the wavelengths ranging from 325 nm to 1075 nm 751 wavelengths totally spaced bandwidth of 1nm apart continuous three time recording of readings of sample measurement at each sampling point was implemented the mean of three readings at each sampling point served as the final reading furthermore we used calibrated and standard reference board which has known spectral reflectance to obtain reflectance value via water surface radiance or digital number value as follows peddle et al 2001 1 ρ w a t e r λ r w a t e r λ r r e f λ ρ r e f λ where r w a t e r λ and r r e f λ denotes the radiance from water surface and that from reference board measured under same intensity of solar illumination at wavelength λ respectively ρ r e f λ represents known reflectance from reference board at given wavelength λ the standard protocol of measuring radiance which we employed in this study was modified from that in the study by ruddick et al 2019 we needed a boat to collect water quality parameter samples at sampling sites and chemical analysis of concentrations of water quality parameters from each sample was implemented in laboratories operators on the boat pointed the asd vertically to the water surface to avoid disturbance of water wave such that more intensive and direct reflection could be collected additionally operators should avoid cloud shadow during measurement they held the asd towards water surface as vertically as possible and kept 0 5 m between asd and water surface to avoid interference of shadow in measurement area thus measurement errors would be minimized to some degree meanwhile the measurement of standard reference panel was implemented before we measured the radiance of water surface at each sample site there was no atmospheric correction implemented in this study the uav and ground data were collected simultaneously in order to establish a transferring model for transferring uav data to ground data for reflectance of each point thus we could reduce medium interference between uav and water surface such as dust in the air and clouds the process of data collection by uav was cost efficient and effective and therefore could be applied to calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters on large scale satellite remote sensing reflectance was not employed in our study but uav remote sensing data since satellites and atmospheric correction including angles of solar zenith were not engaged in this study furthermore we collected 35 water samples and conducted ground measurements of water surface reflectance from 5 different routes such that we could generate 35 training samples to train our model the uav platform utilized in our study is dji m600 manufactured by dji company shenzhen guangdong china it has maximum loading capacity of 6 kg flying height limit of 2500 m horizontal and vertical hanging precision of 1 5 m and 0 5 m maximum speed of 18 m s and digital figure transmission station of lightbridge 2 which carried the hyperspectral image collection camera to measure and collect water surface hyperspectral reflectance the uav carried hyperspectral imager is gaia sky m manufactured by dualix company chengdu sichuan china which is a push scanning image device it has 272 wavelengths totally ranging from 399 69 nm to 1001 08 nm bandwidth of approximately 2 21 nm 12 bits weight of 8 kg frame frequency of 25 fps maximum working distance of 5 km and minimum spatial resolution of 0 15 m furthermore we used a nonlinear transferring model to transfer uav reflectance to ground reflectance at each wavelength we placed calibrated reference panels with various known reflectance of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 in the flight area such that uav hyperspectral imager could calculate the water surface reflectance with calibrated reference panels as a reference the measurements of calibrated reference panel were conducted at the beginning and end of data collection by hyperspectral imager carried by uav flight information details are demonstrated in table 1 and uav data was collected on sept 3 2019 the spatial resolution was set to 0 2 m and resampled spatial resolution was set to 0 4 m field of view of flight was 32 degrees and the mean flying speed was 1 6 m s fig 2 shows the flight area covered by ten uav sorties without surroundings covering 0 42 km 2 we are able to transfer uav hyperspectral reflectance to ground reflectance by established transferring model since the range of wavelengths of asd covers that of hyperspectral imager so that they have the same band centers and the same number of wavelengths after transferring 2 2 2 water sampling and chemical analysis the water sampling in this study was implemented simultaneously with the collection of reflectance data we took a boat to collect three bottles of 500 ml water from 0 5 m below the water surface gitelson et al 2008 in situ at each sampling site along each route meanwhile asd and uav collected reflectance data at the same sampling point in accordance with water sampling bottles were shaded with black cloth before chemical analysis of concentrations of water quality parameters in laboratories huang et al 2016 we implemented chemical analysis and discussed chemical instruments for each water quality parameter as below 1 phosphorus mainly exists in the form of dissolved inorganic phosphorus total phosphorus and dissolved total phosphorus concentrations of which were analyzed using experimental reagent ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate by spectrophotometry and a chemical instrument of 722s visible spectrophotometer with precision of 0 02 mg l divrikli et al 2009 2 nitrogen mainly exists in the form of ammonia nitrogen nh 3 n free ammonia nh 3 and ammonium salt nh 4 concentrations of which were tested via nashi reagent spectrophotometry and 722s visible spectrophotometer with precision of 0 03 mg l labhade et al 2015 3 cod was chemically tested for its concentration by an dichromate oxidation method using burette of 2 mg l for precision ryding and forsberg 1977 4 bod was chemically analyzed for its concentration through dilution and seeding method spx 250bsh ii and biochemical incubator with precision of 0 25 mg l jouanneau et al 2014 5 chl a was chemically analyzed for its concentration by spectrophotometry with 99 5 ethanol at a temperature of 78 c in a restrained light condition and precision of 1ug l cotton et al 1978 qiu et al 2013 water samples were stored in dark condition once collected we implemented chemical analysis on water samples from each sampling site and employed the average concentration of each water quality parameter of three water samples at each sampling point as the final concentration for each water quality parameter additionally we took a portion of each water sample to chemically analyze one water quality parameter and then took one more portion to test another water quality parameter such that chemical reaction would not occur between different reagents the chemical reagent ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate for phosphorus would not produce chemical reaction with other water quality parameters mesquita et al 2011 yang et al 2020 nashi reagent spectrophotometry for nitrogen would not make chemical reaction with other water quality parameters zhang et al 2008 dichromate for analyzing cod would not chemically react with other water quality parameters dedkov et al 2000 dilution and seeding method for testing bod would not generate substances chemically reacting with other water quality parameters leiviskä et al 2008 also ethanol for testing chl a would not chemically react with other water quality parameters galès et al 2019 thus our chemical analysis could effectively avoid the interference of other substances 2 2 3 featuring spectral bands selection we employed feature engineering to select 206 featuring bands ranging from 399 69 nm to 941 08 nm the feature engineering includes single value decomposition svd correlation analysis f regression and χ 2 test with degree of freedom of five where 99 95 variance can be explained first the spectral reflectance data from ground asd covering 751 wavelengths at each pixel point could be denoised and decorrelated we employed f regression and χ 2 test where null hypothesis was defined that each band of samples is independent on these denoised and decorrelated bands to obtain the bands with explained variance of 99 95 then svd could be applied on these bands to reduce the total amount of wavelengths such that our model inputs could be reduced for more effective calculation where interminable reflectance information were reduced to some extent first ten single values which could explain 99 95 variance of r d d were calculated furthermore we utilized the first ten columns of v to reduce feature dimension of r d d finally we applied these first ten columns of v as v s f 10 to working as feature matrix to extract the most significant information from r d d the entire process of obtaining final featuring bands can be expressed by eq 2 2 r f i n a l r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 n r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n v s f 10 t where r i j is reflectance of sample i at wavelength j r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 n r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n is the asd reflectance matrix m is the number of samples and n is the number of wavelengths of asd v s f 10 represents the first ten significant features extracted from right singular matrix v the dimensionality of which is 10 n d f denotes degree of freedom ground points were chosen to eliminate the medium interference between asd reflectance and uav hyperspectral reflectance the transferring model is established to transfer uav reflectance to asd reflectance to make uav reflectance consistent with asd reflectance such that the transferred uav hyperspectral reflectance can be applied to calculating concentrations of water quality parameters effectively on large scale the basis part of the transferring model can be expressed by a cubic spline basis function 3 g r λ 1 r λ r λ 2 r λ 3 h r λ ξ 1 h r λ ξ k where h i j denotes i j 3 if i j and 0 otherwise and 1 r λ r λ 2 r λ 3 h r λ ξ 1 h r λ ξ k are spline basis function denotes as g 0 r λ g 1 r λ g k r λ additionally ξ is a set of knots and k is the number of knots in cubic spline we use mean squared error mse as evaluation metric to choose a proper k we define the objective function to choose the best coefficients as below 4 obje ctive a r g min b y gb 2 2 γ b t ω b where y is the observed value vector y 1 y n t b is the coefficient vector β 0 β k 3 t g is the design matrix which can be defined as 1 r λ 1 2 h r λ 0 ξ k 1 r λ 2 2 h r λ 1 ξ k 1 r λ n 2 h r λ n ξ k n k 4 ω is the penalty matrix with ω i j g i r λ g j r λ d r λ and γ is tunning parameter the optimal b can be obtained through normal equation royston and sauerbrei 2007 5 b g t g γ ω 1 g t y where optimal γ can be selected through leave one out cross validation loocv therefore our transferring model can be defined as 6 y r λ g r λ b β 0 β 1 r λ β 2 r λ 2 β 3 r λ 3 i 4 k 3 β i h r λ ξ i 3 where y r λ is the transferred reflectance from uav to asd at wavelength λ and β i s are coefficients y r λ can be processed with feature engineering as eq 2 to work as inputs of our model thus the whole process of obtaining the significant and featuring bands information can be summarized as 1 simultaneous collection of asd and uav hyperspectral reflectance data 2 uav hypersepctral reflectance data can be transferred to asd reflectance through eq 6 3 all transferred bands from uav to asd can be processed with feature engineering and most significant features v s f 10 about these bands can be extracted through eq 2 4 finally uav hyperspectral data r f i n a l work as the input of our model for large scale calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters 3 methodology in this study our proposed model hf dfm mainly consists of deep neural network probability analysis machine with feedback mechanism feature extractor and factorization machine hf dfm is imrpoved from conventional deepfm guo et al 2017 with probabilistic modeling and bidirectional feedback engaged such that hf dfm can balance calculation effectiveness and resulting precision fig 3 shows the workflow of our proposed method hf dfm for calculation of concentrations of water quality parameters on large scale first ground data collection mainly consists of collection of in situ water samples and collection of water surface spectral reflectance these two datasets as training datasets are engaged in establishment of hf dfm model feature engineering extracts the most significant features of ground spectral reflectance by asd as training dataset of hf dfm second the uav hypspectral reflectance data are transferred to asd reflectance and are processed with feature engineering as eq 2 to obtain significant bands information working as final inputs of hf dfm model for large scale calculation thus hf dfm is able to calculate large scale concentrations of water quality parameters efficiently through uav hyperspectral image data finally the package of arcgis is applied to generating thematic images of concentration distributions from each water quality parameter fig 4 shows the architecture of our proposed model hf dfm hf dfm is established based on deepfm guo et al 2017 which integrates high and low order feature interaction and deep learning to make some bands information influenced by other bands information the input of hf dfm can be divided into two parts the significant bands information and deviation degree the extracted significant features can be obtained through eq 2 6 and deviation degree denotes how many standard deviations that each sample deviates from the mean of the sample population concentrations of five water quality parameters can be obtained through chemical analysis for each sample whereby five deviation degrees corresponding to five water quality parameters can be obtained for each sample additionally deviation degree of each sample is employed and separated by a dashed line from first k fields which are extracted from feature engineering layer in concatenation layer from fig 4 after concatenation of k fields and n k indicator fields representing deviation degrees for each observation all fields in concatenation layer are processed with deepfm deepfm includes two main parts factoization machine and deep neural network details of which are shown as follows 7 y f m w x j 1 1 n j 2 j 1 1 n e j 1 e j 2 x j 1 x j 2 where w is the embedding weights x is the input e i is the i th feature embedding and n is the dimension of the field size dnn part is defined as 8 y d n n σ w h 1 a h b d n n h 1 where w h 1 is the hidden weight of layer h 1 and a h is the output from layer h then a fully connected layer is applied to concatenation of dnn output and factorization machine output 9 y f c σ w f c y c o n n e c t b f c where y c o n n e c t is the concatenation of y f m and y d n n w f c is the weight matrix in fully connected layer and b f c is the bias in fully connected layer the output can be obtained in output unit 10 y o u t σ w o u t y f c b o u t where y o u t is the output w o u t is the weight matrix and b o u t is the bias in output unit respectively once the output in output unit is obtained we utilize a probabilistic analysis machine to investigate concentration distributions of each water quality parameter with a unknown mean μ and known variance σ 2 we suppose that concentration of each water quality parameter follows a normal distribution abdullah et al 2009 pasha and lansey

x μ is the joint distribution of x i and x i i i d n μ σ 2 x represents the concentration of a water quality parameter for each sample μ 0 and σ 0 2 can be determined by the mean and variance of each

concentration of each water quality parameter from each route we set log l θ τ θ 0 and log l θ τ τ 0 and thus θ m l e j i 1 n x i n and τ m l e j i 1 n x i θ m l e 2 n can be obtained from each route j and there are five of them totally thus μ 0 i 1 5 θ m l e i 5 and σ 0 i 1 5 τ m l e i 5 work as the mean and variance of the empirical prior distribution σ 2 can be determined by the variance of concentration of each water quality parameter from chemically analyzed results of samples from five routes thus the max a posterior for μ x can be denoted as μ m a p μ 0 σ 2 i 1 n σ 0 2 x i σ 2 n σ 0

outputs the resulting concentration of each water quality parameter we set a threshold 3 σ 1 for the concentration of each water quality parameter and the resulting concentration is regarded as an outlier and deprecated if it is beyond 3 σ 1 additionally it is added to μ x as new observation to expand the sample size of μ x if it is within 3 σ 1 for the sake of higher data completeness and robustness of posterior distribution of gaussian mean to various inputs moreover we recalculate the concentration if it is an outlier compared with 3 σ 1 by moran index arbia 2001 analysis machine 13 i n w i j w i j x i x x j x i x i x 2 where n is the amount of spatial units that we have calculated and obtained from sampling indexed by i and j x denotes the calculated and chemically analyzed concentration of water quality parameters w i j is a matrix of spatial weights with zeroes on the diagonal and w is the sum of all w i j s the null hypothesis for spatial distribution of concentration is that concentrations are randomly distributed the alternative hypothesis is that spatial distribution of concentration is distributed by a certain pattern two sided z test is employed for determination of spatial distribution pattern of concentrations 14 z i i e i v i where e i 1 n 1 v i e i 2 e i 2 and significance level is set to 0 05 therefore we can determine the spatial distribution mode of concentrations of water quality parameters by moran index a uav hyperspectral image can be divided into large amounts of small areas whereby areas with concentrations calculated are combined together to show distributions of concentration of each water quality parameter for the convenience of calculation each small area consists of nine pixel points with known observation as the center of calculation area as shown in fig 5 a furthermore we extend each small calculation area from their neighboring points such that calculation can be implemented around ground truth and follow a certain distribution pattern the reason that concentrations of water quality parameters may follow a spatial distribution pattern lies in the mobility of water and the location fixity of sewage discharge das and ghosh 2017 once a calculated concentration is an outlier a moran index is utilized to determine the spatial distribution pattern of the small area where the outlier pixel point is replaced with the mean of concentrations of its geographically nearest four pixel points a threshold zero is set for moran index such that concentrations area clustered if moran index is greater than zero and dispersed otherwise outlier concentration point is replaced with mean of four concentration points with center distance of 2 unit to it if moran index of this small area is less than zero also outlier concentration point is replaced with the mean of four concentration points with center distance of 1 unit to it if moran index of this small area is greater than zero as fig 5 b demonstrates thus a feedback mechanism is established through two components moran index analysis machine and probabilistic analysis machine which improves calculation precision probabilistic analysis machine receives and analyzes the results and transmits the results to moran index analysis machine we recalculate the concentration results if results are determined to be outliers according to the feedback from moran index analysis machine finally the obejctive function to be minimized is defined as 15 o b j i 1 n y i y i 2 λ θ s where y i is the ground truth y i is the predicted value θ is the size of all parameters and s is the embedding size furthermore more details about working mechanism of hf dfm can be found in algorithm 1 4 results and discussion in this section we conduct experiments on our proposed model hf dfm to evaluate the effectiveness of predicting concentration of each water quality parameter on our in situ collected testing dataset first we briefly introduce our dataset evaluation metrics parameter settings second we compare our method hf dfm with other relevant methods finally we test the effects of different parameter settings on the performance of hf dfm 4 1 dataset we collected two datasets on the same study area as mentioned in study area section where one dataset collected on sept 3 2019 as training dataset was utilized to train hf dfm and the other dataset collected on sept 17 2019 the same data volume with training dataset was the testing dataset training dataset was collected under 33 5 c and testing dataset was collected under 26 5 c the variation of sunlight intensity did not interfere the accuracy of collected reflectance data of asd and uav since calibration by standard reference panel for asd and uav was implemented before measurement fig 6 shows the in situ collected asd spectral reflectance from different routes which covers the entire study area table 2 shows the range of concentration of each water quality from different routes some water quality parameters vary considerably from route to route which may be caused by some sewage drainages nearby reflectance of different substances varies based on their optical properties from table 2 and fig 6 route 1 has higher reflectance values near wavelengths of 300 nm 600 nm 900 nm and 1000 nm compared with other routes and it has higher concentration of phosphorus song et al 2018 demonstrated that there is strong positive correlation between concentration of phosphorus and spectral reflectance in the range from 450 to 630 nm fig 6 a indicates the positive correlation between concentration of phosphorus and spectral reflectance near the wavelength 600 nm which implies that phosphorus has a reflection peak near 600 nm wavelength phosphorus varies considerably in spectra from 400 nm to 900 nm nitrogen has a reflection peak near 890 nm which indicates a positive correlation between concentration of nitrogen and the reflectance at wavelength of 890 nm barrett and frazier 2016 song et al 2018 yao et al 2010 as shown in fig 6 a c e furthermore high reflectance values at wavelengths ranging from 900 nm to 1000 nm may elucidate the high concentration of cod essam et al 2017 tong et al 2010 as shown fig 6 a d and e in fig 6 a d and e they have higher reflectance values near wavelengths ranging from 350 nm to 500 nm and from 700 nm to 950 nm and they have higher concentration of bod which means bod may have relatively high reflection around near these wavelengths if massive accumulation of bod occurs xing et al 2019 bod and cod are related to the spectra ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm to some extent peterson et al 2020 sharaf and zhang 2017 moreover higher concentration of chl a may show a higher reflection values near wavelength ranging from 600 nm to 700 nm li et al 2010 also reflectance of chl a experimentally varies in spectra ranging from 450 nm to 850 nm gitelson et al 2007 water quality parameters are mostly covered within our selected wavelength range from 399 69 nm to 941 08 nm 4 2 baselines to validate the effectiveness of hf dfm hf dfm was compared with several related and representative methods ols tong et al 2010 it employs ordinary least square ols method to predict the concentrations of bod and cod quantitatively based on combinations of several bands reflectance ga pls song et al 2013 it is a hybrid model combining genetic algorithm and partial least square pls to predict concentrations of phosphorus and chl a through hyperspectral reflectance data plsr svmr zhai et al 2013 it combines partial least squares regression plsr and support vector machine regression svmr to estimate the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus based on reflectance spectroscopy dlf wang et al 2020 it combines partial least squares pls random forest rf extreme learning machine elm and gaussian process gp to predict the concentration of total nitrogen tn through uav collected hyperspectral reflectance idfm dona et al 2015 it develops an integrated algorithm for data fusion and mining of remote sensing images to estimate the concentration of chl a by using fused water surface reflectance data as inputs filling the temporal gaps and capturing spectral features bpnn essam et al 2017 it is an artificial intelligence modeling method for mapping concentrations of both optical and non optical water quality parameters including tss cod and bod 4 3 evaluation metrics according to the common practice in evaluation of performance in predicting concentrations of water quality parameters rmse mape and r 2 to compare the performance of hf dfm with that of aforementioned baselines furthermore we establish a hypothesis test with f statistic which plays an important and indispensable role in analysis of variance anova to verify the validity and effectiveness of hf dfm where the null hypothesis is that model 2 does not outperform the model 1 and the alternative hypothesis is defined that model 2 outperforms the model 1 by calculating f statistics bentler and yuan 1999 16 g f s t a t i s t i c s y y r s s 1 r s s 2 p 2 p 1 r s s 2 n p 2 where r s s i denotes the rss of model i p i is the number of features of model i and n represents the number of samples thereby the model which outperforms the others can be determined by f statistic value additionally we apply another hypothesis test by using welch s t test to measure the degree of deviation between predicted values and the measured values through the mean of each group where the null hypothesis is defined that the mean of predicted values is as same as that of the measured values we suppose that predicted values and measured values are independent samples with unequal variance t statistic and corresponding degree of freedom by welch s t test with can be formulated as 17 f welch s t test y y y m e a n y m e a n s y 2 n y s y 2 n y 18 d f welch s t test y y s y 2 n y s y 2 n y 2 s y 4 n y 2 n y 1 s y 4 n y 2 n y 1 where f welch s t test y y is resulting t score for y and y d f welch s t test y y denotes the degree of freedom s represents standard deviation and n is the number of sample thus the difference between predicted values and measured values can be tested by t statistic and its corresponding p value for further improvement of our model 4 4 parameter settings the main parameters employed in this research consists of embedding size k the number of hidden layers h significant level for welch s t test α learning rate γ and activation function σ all these parameters are initialized as k 16 h 3 α 0 05 γ 0 001 h 3 and leaky relu activation function as σ moreover the training dataset has 35 samples collected on sept 3 2019 and testing dataset has the same amount of samples collected on sept 17 2019 4 5 performance comparison we tested the performance of our proposed method hf dfm on testing dataset where predicted values were compared with measured values as shown in fig 7 the further off the orange line the predicted values are the lower precision hf dfm gets the blue line denotes the regression line between predicted values and measured values hf dfm obtains better results on phosphorus and chl a in terms of r 2 values hf dfm is stable under various external environments since it was trained and tested on the datasets collected at the same sampling sites under different external environments such as temperature and sunlight intensity additionally hf dfm has also obtained relatively accurate prediction results on testing dataset therefore hf dfm has shown a great stability and accuracy on predicting concentrations of water quality parameters furthermore our proposed method hf dfm was compared with its pertinent methods with respect to rmse mape r 2 f statistic t statistic and p value however there is seldom a unified method which is able to predict concentrations of all aforementioned water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a thus one state of the art method is able to predict some of these water quality parameters the comparison results are demonstrated in table 3 and the best results for each water quality parameter are shown in boldface denotes that these methods are unavailable for calculation of some water quality parameters represents that methods of this row are compared with hf dfm the best of which is substituted into eq 16 as model 2 to calculate the f statistic therefore hf dfm is only compared with the best model of this row for f statistic additionally hf dfm generally denotes the model 1 in eq 16 f statistic is thereby compared with the critical value of f distribution with p 2 p 1 n p 2 as parameters where p i is the number features of model i and n is the sample size the null hypothesis is accepted if the resulting f statistic is less than the critical value of the f distribution meaning that model 2 does not outperform hf dfm as model 1 for each water quality parameter the resulting f statistic is smaller than its corresponding critical f statistic value additionally corresponding critical f statistics are 2 32 3 95 4 82 4 23 and 4 52 for phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a respectively t statistic and p value are utilized to determine whether the null hypothesis that the mean of predicted values is as same as that of measured values is rejected or accepted where the critical p value is set as 0 05 for each water quality parameter the null hypothesis is accepted since all resulting p values are greater than the critical p value of 0 05 from table 3 our proposed method hf dfm outperforms other related methods in terms of all aforementioned statistical criteria for predicting concentrations of water quality parameters 4 6 concentration maps the resulting concentration distributions of water quality parameters are shown in fig 8 variability of concentrations of water quality parameters can be observed through the change in the color of each plot the classification standards of pollution level of water quality parameters are established by local environment protection department as shown in each plots of fig 8 thus the local environment protection department is able to determine possible locations of pollution sources according to the change of concentration of each water quality parameter however our uav had to fly along the river several times since there existed restrictions about uav flying height and uav battery imposed by the local government thus all uav hyperspectral images had to be combined to cover the whole study area causing combining traces between images in each plot from september to october the river flowed from right to left in fig 8 the left red rectangle represents the wastewater discharge outlet and the right red rectangle represents the purified water discharge outlet due to the daily living waste discharge along banks of the river such as washing detergent and farm waste the concentration of phosphorus along the banks is higher than that of other parts of the river in accordance with the concentration distribution map of phosphorus as shown in fig 8 a additionally the concentration of phosphorus is relatively lower in the river center since the water carries the phosphorus substances downstream which results in less accumulation of phosphorus substances in the river center fig 8 b shows the similar concentration distribution with fig 8 e since nitrogen is important for synthesis of chl a mishra and srivastava 1983 shangguan et al 2000 discharge of farm fertilizer into the river by fishermen and local inhabitants causes algal boom which is associated with high concentration of chl a abdel 1997 the concentration distribution of phosphorus along the banks is similar to that of nitrogen and chl a because phosphorus and nitrogen are two paramount elements in chemical synthesis of chl a yuan and jones 2020 herbicide related protoporphyrinogen oxidase protox and copper sulfate are used in aquaculture and plastic based materials garcía muñoz et al 2009 nandihalli et al 1994 are discharged into the river on the right side where some fish farms are located and thus the concentrations of nitrogen and of chl a are lower than that on the left side protox is an inhibitor as a herbicide and copper sulfate is necessary in cultivation of aquatic life also copper sulfate is a main component of algaecides and pesticides salam and el fadel 2008 which helps the prevention of some diseases associated with aquatic life furthermore bod and cod have similar distributions as shown in fig 8 c and d massive accumulation bod and cod causes algae to overgrow mahapatra et al 2013 the accumulation of phosphorus nitrogen and chl a are relatively slow in the narrower upper watercourse than that of other parts of the river accordingly lower concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen constrain the growth of algae in narrower upper watercourse and thus algae is short of essential substances to support its growth causing lower concentration of chl a the accumulation of cod and bod is slow in narrower upper watercourse mainly because some fishery farms which cultivate aquatic animals mangunwardoyo et al 2013 are located along banks of the narrower upper watercourse where less residential area and industrial factories are located additionally quick accumulation of nitrogen occurs narrower upper watercourse due to discharge of protox and copper sulfate for reduction of algae and cultivation of aquatic animals concentrations of water quality parameters are higher near wastewater discharge outlet and lower near purified water discharge outlet for most industrial and living waste are discharged through wastewater discharge outlet as shown in fig 8 a e concentrations of water quality parameters on the left side of each plot are almost higher than that on the right side since more industrial parks and dwelling district are located near banks of the right side of the river and the river flows to the left carrying wastewater additionally the evaluation criteria of water quality adopt environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 ghzb1 1999 and the detailed information of evaluation criteria about phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a are demonstrated at the lower left corner of each plot in fig 8 according to environmental quality standards for surface water water quality of class i is mainly applicable to water sources and national natural reserve water quality of class ii is mainly applicable to centralized drinking water first grade protection zones of surface water source and habitats for rare aquatic life water quality of class iii is mainly applicable to centralized drinking water second grade protection zones of surface water source and fisheries water water quality of class iv is mainly applicable to industrial water areas and recreational water areas where the direct contact with human body is not allowed water quality of class v is mainly applicable to agricultural water and landscape related water water quality of class vi is mainly applicable to seriously contaminated water which is not allowed to be used for any purpose in fig 8 water quality ranges from class iii to class vi in terms of concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen water quality ranges from class ii to class iv with respect to cod and from class iii to class v with respect to bod furthermore water quality ranges from class i to class iii based on chl a according to instruction of local environment protection department the comprehensive water quality is determined by the mean of water quality in terms of phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a the water quality of our study area varies considerably with respect to different water quality parameters abuse of phosphorus based detergent industrial pigment fertilizer pesticides and so on causes a serious degradation of water quality efficient methods need to be employed to alleviate eutrophication such as algal boom by local environmental protection department thus it is of paramount importance to monitor water quality and reduce the volume of industrial and domestic wastewater effectively 4 7 parameter sensitivity different settings of model parameters may have some effects on the performance of hf dfm to explore the impacts of various parameters of hf dfm we investigate the influence of the embedding size and of the number of hidden layers on the performance of hf dfm we use mape as evaluation metric to test the performance of hf dfm since rmse of different water quality parameters varies considerably in numerical magnitude 4 7 1 effects of embedding size the embedding size of hf dfm is related to the capacity of encoded information of bands features and we set embedding size to 4 8 16 32 and 64 the results of different settings are shown in fig 9 with embedding size increasing mape of hf dfm gradually decreases until embedding size of 16 the performance of hf dfm achieves the best result at embedding size of 16 however mape gradually increases after embedding size of 16 the reasonably large embedding size may improve the performance of hf dfm however mape increases if embedding size exceeds the critical value such as 16 since too large embedding size may cause our model to capture some redundant and insignificant information about bands features fig 9 shows variability of mape of all water quality parameters over the different embedding sizes 4 7 2 effects of the number of hidden layers the impact of the number of hidden layers on the performance of hf dfm can not be neglected the number of hidden layers is denoted as hidden layers in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 with the number of hidden layers increasing mape decreases until the number of hidden layers of 3 where hf dfm achieves the best performance and increases after the number of hidden layers of 3 which may be caused by too large masses of hidden layers unreasonably large amount of hidden layers may contain some superfluous and unnecessary information of inputs and increase the computational cost 4 8 challenges and opportunities our proposed model hf dfm is a unified model which is able to predict various water quality parameters by varying the output without changing the entire architecture of the model compared with other related models hf dfm is capable of predicting more water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a with higher accuracy in a unified structure and achieves better performance in terms of rmse mape and r 2 compared with satellite based hyperspectral remote sensing methods bonansea et al 2019 dona et al 2015 dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 essam et al 2017 for predicting concentrations of water quality parameters uva based hyperspectral remote sensing methods are more effective because it is more flexible to collect data with high quality of images and it achieves a great performance our proposed method is applicable to quantitative and precise estimation of water quality of small and medium sized water areas such as urban rivers due to flexibility and effective data collection of uav and robustness of our proposed method the proposed method is applied to monitoring water quality and early warning system of water environment protection which may also notice the public to minimize contact with the water of high pollution level compared with satellite based remote sensing techniques the transmission of collected data from uav to our workstation is faster and collected image data have higher spatial resolution for urban rivers high spatial resolution of images is important and significant since the concentration distribution of water quality parameters in some parts of urban rivers may indicate pollution sources additionally lengthy process of obtaining and transmitting satellite data may result in a delay in tracing pollution sources and solving related problems thereby our proposed method poses significant opportunities for effectively monitoring water quality of urban rivers there exists intensive medium interference between satellite based remote sensing and target objects although satellite based remote sensing can cover larger areas however there still exist some limitations such as limitation of size of training dataset calculation bias of transferring uav reflectance data to asd reflectance data operational bias of sample collection and systematic bias of chemical analysis of water quality parameters additionally operators may not point asd to the water surface with intense sunlight and without any shadow in the target area ground sampling may not be completely simultaneous with data collection of uav also gps location may have tiny systematic error some other methods employed hundreds of samples which were simulated in laboratory rather than in situ collected laboratory simulated samples may not represent the complex and practical environment of water quality additionally total organic carbon toc turbidity and tss are also water quality parameters our samples are in situ collected in this study nevertheless the data collection is time consuming and chemical analysis of water quality parameters is expensive in laboratory which seriously hinders the progress of our research and local environmental protection mainly focuses on phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a thus we have not chemically analyzed toc tss and turbidity and further study will cover analysis of toc tss and turbidity our proposed method is robust and efficient due to its spectral feature interaction and feedback mechanism including probabilistic analysis and spatial distribution pattern analysis and shows higher accuracy on quantitatively estimation of water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a there may exist a positive correlation between cod bod and toc lee et al 2016 and hf dfm has shown great performance on calculation of concentrations of cod and bod whereby hf dfm is highly likely to accurately predict the concentration of toc moreover turbidity and tss are related to water clarity and have some optical properties such as their concentrations negatively correlate with reflectance olmanson et al 2013 the existence of turbidity and tss may negatively affect algal photosynthesis and further hinder algal growth to reduce the concentration of chl a by blocking the passage of sunlight to underwater algae chaffin et al 2018 tosic et al 2019 hf dfm is able to accurately estimate concentrations of tss and turbidity since hf dfm has obtained accurate prediction on chl a with which tss and turbidity may have a negative correlation he et al 2019 saluja and garg 2016 furthermore prediction of concentrations of water quality parameters based on low value and considerably varying reflectance is difficult since it is hard to employ weak signals to quantitatively estimate concentrations the small range of concentrations of water quality parameters in training dataset may constrain the variation range of predicted results in testing dataset to some extent which may affect the prediction accuracy in some parts of the study area due to the constraints of financial support and the time we collected 35 samples as training dataset and another 35 samples of the same sampling points after two weeks other related methods might perform better with larger training dataset but their samples were simulated in laboratory without considering practical and complicated water environment such that their works were short of consideration of real situation to some degree additionally other methods as mentioned early were tested on a small fraction of their entire dataset to achieve better performance for future study we should collect more samples from various rivers and thus our model hf dfm is more generalized and more adaptable to hyperspectral data from different watersheds moreover we need to ensure that the sampling process should be implemented under intense sunlight and no shadow is in the target area also the high quality of uav hyperspectral image data have to be ensured for high prediction accuracy featuring bands may not be fixed for future research and further study about bands selection should be done unmanned collection of ground samples and in situ quick chemical analysis of samples may pose a great opportunity to more effective ground sample collection and analysis in further study prior distribution of unknown parameters in eqs 11 and 12 should determined with more related works to ensure that the posterior distribution models the in situ collected data more appropriately and our model will achieve higher prediction accuracy in future work 5 conclusion in this study we developed a hybrid method hf dfm improved from deep factorization machine which involves deep learning statistical analysis and spatial distribution pattern to quantitatively predict concentrations of water quality parameters including phosphorus nitrogen cod bod chl a based on hyperspectral reflectance data furthermore we also developed a procedure of collecting water samples and ground spectral reflectance data simultaneously with uav hyperspectral sampling we employed feature engineering to select significant bands features and we established a transferring model to transfer uav reflectance data to asd reflectance data we combined all above models into a unified architecture an end to end structure with raw data from uav asd and chemically analyzed results of water samples as inputs the experimental results from hf dfm on testing dataset shows a greater performance compared with other relevant methods as discussed in section 4 baselines in terms of rmse mape and r 2 where mapes of phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a are 8 78 12 36 8 96 9 62 and 9 14 respectively the fitness of model to the testing dataset can be demonstrated by r 2 and r 2 of phosphorus nitrogen cod bod and chl a are 0 92 0 91 0 88 0 81 and 0 93 respectively collection of hyperspectral image data by uav is more effective and more flexible with higher spatial resolution than that collected by satellites the medium interference of which is much smaller compared with data collected by satellites further research can be implemented to reduce the time and financial cost cloud stations for immediate data exchange may be established unmanned collection of water samples may be established to reduce time cost of sample collection the scanning width of a uav could be much wider to cover more area effectively further research may require more relevant data to make the model more generalized to fit a wide variety of water bodies mutual influence from featuring bands corresponding to the variation of water quality parameters and feedback mechanism of probabilistic analysis and spatial distribution pattern analysis enhance the robustness and accuracy of hf dfm and balance hf dfm sensitivity and anti interference to some extreme concentration values such that hf dfm has a potential to be applied to other water bodies such as urban rivers additionally hf dfm has obtained relatively accurate prediction on low and high concentrations of water quality parameters and thus it is highly possible to achieve equally great performance on quantifying these water quality parameters in other urban rivers moreover hf dfm is currently applied to monitoring the water quality of maozhou river shenzhen city guandong province china thus local environment protection department is able to trace the locations of pollution sources through variation of concentrations of water quality parameters effectiveness of the methodology for quantifying concentrations of water quality parameters and the procedure for featuring bands selection were validated through the application of monitoring water quality in maozhou river the significance of this study lies in 1 the proposed method is effective for real time monitoring variation of water quality of urban rivers and is a useful operational monitoring tool to support decision making for water environment management of urban rivers 2 the study establishes a systematic approach of water sampling data collection laboratory chemical analysis of water samples data modeling and prediction for further research 3 the model framework can enhance transferability between different applications with more and various data collection and can be replicated in other regions of the world for evaluating the suitability of water quality for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes 4 the proposed method is beneficial and helpful to trace pollution sources and shows profound prospects in establishment of early warning system to notify the public to avoid touching contaminated water to make our model more applicable and robust to various watersheds more multidisciplinary research should be involved in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16657,to alleviate algal fouling in membrane water treatment processes conventional technologies such as coagulation with poly aluminum chloride pacl has been widely adopted by many drinking water treatment plants however coagulation alone exhibited relatively weak removal effect for algal pollutants and the coagulant residues due to the excess dosage also raised concerns thus a novel process of coupling sodium percarbonate spc oxidation and pacl coagulation was proposed integrated with membrane filtration for algae laden water treatment the dosages of pacl and spc were optimized and the spc dosing strategies were systematically compared the changes in the characteristics of algal pollutants were investigated and the results revealed that the resistance of algal foulants to aggregation was decreased and the particle size of algal foulants became larger with the synergism of coagulation and oxidation the degradation of fluorescent organics was strengthened and macromolecular biopolymers were decomposed into low molecular weight organics the fouling control efficiency was further explored and the results indicated that both irreversible and reversible fouling were effectively controlled among which pacl spc simultaneous treatment performed best with the irreversible fouling reduced by 90 5 while the efficiency of spc pacl spc followed by pacl was relatively lower 57 3 the fouling mechanism was altered by slowing the formation of cake filtration and the reduction of algal cells played a more important role for the fouling alleviation the interface properties of contaminated membranes i e functional groups images and micromorphology were characterized and the efficiency of the proposed strategy was further verified the proposed strategy exhibits great application values for improving membrane performance during algae laden water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sodium percarbonate spc oxidation and coagulation membrane fouling algae laden water dosing strategies 1 introduction as important sources of potable water lakes and reservoirs are susceptible to water eutrophication thereby resulting in algae outbreaks in the source water babel and takizawa 2010 liu et al 2020 with growing amounts of exogenous pollutants e g nitrogen and phosphorus discharged into the water algae blooms are increasingly frequent and the security of drinking water are seriously threatened du et al 2020 jin et al 2017 as one of the most potential water treatment technologies ultrafiltration uf membrane shows an excellent application prospect for the purification of algae laden water specifically algal cells could be effectively rejected by uf membranes through size exclusion he et al 2020 schulz et al 2016 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 hence avoiding the rupture of algal cells to the greatest extent noted that algae laden water is generally a complex aquatic system consisting of algal cells organic matter colloidal particles and algae metabolites etc therefore membrane fouling generated by these algal pollutants is still a main obstacle for uf technology chiou et al 2010 ding et al 2020 liu et al 2017b liu et al 2017a reported that the main algal foulants causing membrane fouling contained algal cells debris intracellular and extracellular organic matter i e iom and eom respectively to alleviate algal membrane fouling various pretreatment alternatives have aroused considerable attentions cheng et al 2018 li et al 2014 lu et al 2020 wan et al 2019 xing et al 2019 among which coagulation is an attractive option because of the high algae removal efficiency maintenance of cell integrity and ease of operation however coagulation alone exhibited a weak removal effect for micropollutants e g microcystins and also a large amount of coagulant is required to neutralize the electronegativity of algal cells resulting in the coagulant residues tian et al 2021 recently the combination of coagulation and oxidation e g ozone uv ferrate etc has been explored to solve the above problems for instance the integration of ferrate pre oxidation and fecl3 coagulation was effective for mitigating membrane fouling in algae laden water treatment he et al 2020 noted that it is quite important to maintain the integrity of algal cells and avoid the release of intracellular organics during the oxidation process as an emerging oxidant sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5 h2o2 spc which is also known as a solid form of h2o2 has recently attracted more and more attentions in water purification gao et al 2021 ren et al 2020 xu et al 2021 it is worth noting that spc is more stable than h2o2 and easier to transport which is cost effective in practical applications fu et al 2017 moreover it is valid over a wide range of ph and the reaction products are generally environmental friendly fu et al 2015 li et al 2020 recently the degradation of bisphenol a by uv spc was investigated and the results indicated that uv spc was promising for water purification gao et al 2020 in another work tian et al 2021 spc fe2 process was demonstrated to be effective for the elimination of microcystis aeruginosa and microcystins without damaging cell integrity although beneficial excessive dosing of fe2 could result in unpleasant color and accelerate the corrosion of pipe networks therefore fe based coagulants are seldom used in practical applications for most drinking water plants at present al based coagulants are commonly used for potable water production whereas high coagulant doses are required to remove algal foulants resulting in the coagulant residues thus it is meaningful to utilize spc to enhance the coagulation efficiency of al based coagulants for uf fouling mitigation in algae laden water treatment however there is still no relevant research has been reported so far in the current work a novel strategy of coupling spc oxidation and poly aluminum chloride pacl coagulation was proposed and the effect of spc dosing strategies on the alleviation of membrane fouling by algal foulants was systematically studied the feasibility of this technology for treating algae laden water was explored by investigating the changes in the characteristics of feed water the efficiency of membrane fouling control and the interface characteristics of fouled membranes the proposed strategy could provide some new thoughts into algal fouling control for drinking water plants in practical applications 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials as one of the most widely occurring algae species in potable water sources microcystis aeruginosa no fachb 905 supplied by institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences was employed in this work a sterile bg 11 medium was utilized to provide the required nutrients for the algal growth to simulate the natural growth environment of algae the illumination condition was controlled at a dark light cycle of 12 12 h every day and the temperature was constant at 25 c the cultivated microcystis aeruginosa at stationary phase 35 d was selected to prepare the algae laden water which was diluted to 2 0 106 cells ml using the diluent containing of naclo4 15 0 mmol l cacl2 0 5 mmol l and nahco3 1 0 mmol l ren et al 2020 the eom was extracted using a high speed refrigerated centrifuge 5810r eppendorf germany and the cell suspension was centrifugated at 10 000 r min and 4 c for 15 min followed by filtrating with 0 45 μm filters and diluting the permeate with ultrapure water to a dissolved organic carbon level of 5 0 mg l the precipitated algal cells were resuspended in nacl solution 0 6 to obtain the algal cells solution in addition spc and pacl were acquired from aladdin chemicals shanghai china and all the other chemical reagents were supplied by sinopharm peking china 2 2 experimental procedures as shown in fig s1 the process of coupling spc oxidation and coagulation was carried out under three different spc dosing strategies i e pacl coagulation followed by spc oxidation pacl spc simultaneous addition of pacl and spc pacl spc and spc oxidation followed by pacl coagulation spc pacl furthermore pacl coagulation and spc oxidation alone were carried out as control groups the employed dosages of pacl and spc were 4 10 20 30 40 mg l and 0 04 0 08 0 10 and 0 14 mmol l respectively to be specific the pacl coagulation process was conducted by rapid stirring at 300 r min for 2 min slow mixing at 70 r min for 30 min and sedimentation for 30 min the oxidation experiment by spc was performed by mixing at a constant rate of 150 r min for 30 min the pacl spc treatment was carried out by rapid stirring at 300 r min for 2 min moderate mixing at 150 r min for 30 min slow mixing at 70 r min for 30 min and sedimentation for 30 min the experimental setup for subsequent membrane filtration as shown in fig s2 was composed of an uf cell ufsc 40 001 millipore usa coupled with pes membranes up150 microdyn nadir germany a nitrogen bottle and a data collection system connected to an electronic balance hzy b2200 hz usa the detailed operation methods are visible in our recent works cheng et al 2017 2019 2 3 membrane fouling analysis in this work the reversible and irreversible resistances rr and rir respectively of membranes were distinguished and calculated by a resistance in series model cheng et al 2021b choo and lee 1996 to be specific hydraulic backwash was perormed by reversing the membrane with the supporting layer upwards and ultrapure water was applied to wash the membrane under a significant higher pressure than filtration the rr and rir were determined according to eqs 1 and 2 1 r r t m p μ j 1 t m p μ j 2 2 r i r t m p μ j 2 t m p μ j 0 where tmp is the transmembrane pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity j0 is the average pure water flux of virgin membrane j1 is the permeate flux at the end of filtration j2 is the average pure water flux after hydraulic backwash the fouling mechanisms at different filtration stages were explored using the hermia model hermia 1982 wang et al 2020 and the dominated mechanism was determined by the n value to be specific the n values of 2 0 1 5 1 0 and 0 represent the mechanisms of complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration individually moreover a combined model of pore blockage cake filtration ho and zydney 2000 text s1 was also utilized to fit the filtration data 2 4 analytical methods the uv 1800 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer mapada china was utilized to measure the uv254 and uv685 values particle size distribution of algal cells was determined by a laser particle size analyzer bettersize2600 china while zeta potential was measured using a zetasizer instrument nano zs malvern panalytical uk to identify the fluorescent components in algae laden water fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained through a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 hitachi japan a high performance liquid chromatograph e2695 waters usa equipped with an uv detector was utilized to explore the molecular weight distributions of algal organics the surface functional groups of fouled membranes were detected by a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer spectrum one b perkin elmer usa and the surface morphologies were observed through the jsm 7610f scanning electron microscope sem jeol japan to identify the generated free radical species a spectrometer emxnano bruker germany was utilized to perform the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization for the dosages of pacl and spc the dosages of pacl and spc were optimized according to the removal efficiencies of uv254 and uv685 fig 1 which represent the concentrations of algal organic matter containing unsaturated bonds or aromatic chromophores with uv absorption and algal cells respectively as displayed in fig 1 a b the uv254 and uv685 values were obviously reduced with the pacl dosage elevated from 4 to 20 mg l whereas further increase of pacl dosage did not show significant beneficial effect for algal removal therefore 20 mg l was chosen as the optimal pacl dosage in the coagulation process with the uv254 and uv685 removal efficiencies of 88 0 and 91 5 respectively the removal effect was further enhanced to varying degrees in the pacl spc process and 0 10 mmol l of spc achieved the best result with the removal rates of uv254 and uv685 increased to 92 4 and 97 6 individually based on the above results highly effective algal removal was achieved at the pacl and spc dosages of 20 mg l and 0 10 mmol l which were chosen as the optimal dosages 3 2 the changes in the characteristics of algae laden water 3 2 1 zeta potential and particle size distribution the zeta potential of microcystis aeruginosa laden water was detected to characterize the stability and aggregation status of algal cells as seen in fig 2 a the raw algae laden water exhibited the highest negative surface charge with the zeta potential value of 23 6 mv suggesting that the algal foulants were stable in the water due to the apparent resistance to aggregation the zeta potentials were increased to 11 0 and 13 7 mv by the treatments of pacl and spc respectively which indicated that the negative surface charge was reduced and the resistance of algal foulants to aggregation was weaken regarding the integrated pretreatments the repulsive interactions between algal foulants were further decreased with the zeta potentials increased to 10 8 1 and 10 5 mv for pacl spc pacl spc spc pacl individually compared to single pacl or spc treatment pacl coagulation combined with spc oxidation could further enhance the attractive interactions between algal foulants thus the algal cells and organic pollutants exhibited a stronger tendency to aggregate and deposit noticeably the enhanced effect of pacl spc was more remarkable than the other dosing strategies fig 2 b shows the distributions of particle size under different spc dosing strategies regarding the raw algae laden water the particle size was mainly distributed in 2 5 μm with an average size of approximately 4 μm the results were consistent with previous reports liu et al 2020 suggesting that the algal foulants were stable without the formation of cell aggregates the oxidation of spc slightly changed the size distribution and the size range was broadened to 2 7 μm when pacl coagulation was applied the peak intensity at 3 4 μm was obviously decreased meanwhile a peak at 10 50 μm was observed indicating that the cell aggregation occurred with respect to the combined treatments of pacl and spc the peaks at 3 4 μm were further decreased to varying degrees and the peaks at 10 100 μm were significantly increased the above results indicated that the particle size of algal foulants became larger after pacl coagulation combined with spc oxidation treatments which was caused by the decreased resistance of algal foulants to aggregation as confirmed by the results of zeta potential 3 2 2 fluorescent organic components fig 3 shows the fluorescence spectra of algae laden water and eom with different treatments noted that the eem analysis only detects limited organic components some non fluorescent algal organics could not be identified and were not discussed here as illustrated in fig 3 a the fluorescent components in algae laden water showed four characteristic peaks of a c t1 and t2 of note peaks a and c represented humic substances while tryptophan like protein substances were related to peaks t1 and t2 du et al 2019a 2019b it can be observed that the peak intensities of t1 and t2 were particularly higher in comparison with peaks a and c revealing that a high concentration of protein substances existed in algae laden water all the peak intensities were obviously weakened with pacl or spc treatment alone which indicated that both coagulation and oxidation had some effect on the elimination of fluorescent components the fluorescence intensities were further decreased with the dual effect of pacl and spc regardless of the dosing strategies the enhanced performance was likely caused by the synergistic effect of pacl and spc as seen in fig s3 the signal of dmpooh adduct showing a peak strength of 1 2 2 1 was observed indicating the generation of oh radical in the pacl spc process luo et al 2018 thus the degradation of organic pollutants was strengthened due to the strong oxidizing and non selective property of oh van geluwe et al 2011 with respect to the fluorescence spectra of eom the intensities of peaks a and c became more distinct than algae laden water demonstrating that both humic substances and protein substances were dominated in eom this was because that eom was extracted through high speed centrifugation hence both dissolved and bound organic pollutants existed in the solution by contrast the algae laden water contained fewer bound organics attached on the cell surfaces single pacl or spc treatment could dramatically reduce the intensity of peak t1 whereas a single treatment step was ineffective for the reduction of humic substances the peaks were further weakened when pacl was used together with spc among which pacl spc exhibited the best performance with relatively lower peak intensity and area 3 2 3 molecular weight distributions of organics the molecular weight of organics for algae laden water with various treatments are depicted in fig 4 the peaks of macromolecular biopolymers and humic substances could be seen clearly for the raw water while pacl treatment significantly reduced the peak intensity of biopolymers suggesting that biopolymers could be effectively removed by the coagulation process with spc oxidation the peak intensity of humics was increased and the peak of low molecular weight organic matter appeared which was ascribed to the oxidative decomposition of biopolymers the peaks of humics and low molecular weight organic matter were further strengthened under the synergetic effect of pacl and spc likely due to the strong oxidizing property of in situ formed oh radical specifically oh could accelerate the decomposition of biopolymers and the generation of lower molecular weight uv adsorbing humic substances it was noteworthy that the generated oh radical could be rapidly consumed by dissolved eom thus reducing the contact of the algal cells with the oxidant and avoiding the rupture of algal cells the bound eom adsorbed on the cell surfaces could also consume some of the free radicals thereby helping to maintain the cells integrity and avoiding the release of iom huo et al 2015 qi et al 2016 takaara et al 2010 furthermore the optimized oxidant dosage also minimized the rupture of algal cells while maintaining the excellent performance the results demonstrated that the combined process of pacl and spc could substantially alter the distribution of molecular weight for organic pollutants in algae laden water by decomposing macromolecular biopolymers into low molecular weight organics 3 3 efficiency of membrane fouling mitigation 3 3 1 permeation flux and fouling resistances in the filtration of algae laden water the fouling control efficiency of the combined process of pacl and spc is displayed in fig 5 as seen the filtration of microcystis aeruginosa laden water resulted in a serious flux decline with the terminal specific flux reduced to 0 062 fig 5 a it can be seen that single spc treatment exhibited minor effect on the flux curve suggesting that spc was ineffective for improving the permeate flux while pacl alone could to some extent alleviate the flux decline and improved the terminal normalized flux to 0 353 this was because that pacl coagulation could accelerate the agglomeration and settlement of algal cells and organic pollutants thus reducing the algal pollutants contacting with membranes the permeate flux was dramatically improved with spc pacl treatment and the terminal normalized flux was increased to 0 674 the performances of pacl spc and pacl spc were significantly better than spc pacl with the ultimate normalized fluxes of 0 832 and 0 838 individually the relatively lower efficiency of spc pacl was likely attributed to the generation of small molecules during spc oxidation process which could not be effectively removed by subsequent coagulation thus affecting the membrane flux in some degree regarding the fouling resistance the reversible resistance accounted for a larger proportion of the total resistance fig 5 b the pacl treatment alone effectively alleviated the reversible fouling with a mitigation efficiency of 88 9 whereas the reduction rate of irreversible fouling was only 28 8 by contrast spc alone showed a very low control efficiency for reversible fouling and the irreversible fouling was even slightly increased this was likely because large molecules pollutants were oxidized into small molecules which aggravated the clogging of membrane pores the combined process of coagulation and oxidation could effectively decrease both fouling fractions irrespective of the dosing strategies with respect to the irreversible fouling control pacl spc performed best with the mitigation efficiency reaching 90 5 while the efficiency of spc pacl was relatively lower with the rate of 57 3 for the spc pacl process the generated small molecule organics during spc oxidation could result in membrane pore blockage thereby the irreversible fouling resistance was slightly increased regarding the pacl spc treatment large amounts of algal pollutants could be removed through pacl coagulation thus the small organics formed in subsequent spc oxidation was reduced and the irreversible fouling was well controlled 3 3 2 the variation of fouling mechanisms the fouling mechanisms of algae laden water after various treatments were explored through replotting the filtration data as d2 t dv 2 versus dt dv fig 6 the value of n demonstrated the main fouling mechanism and the transition of the dominated mechanism during filtration could be reflected through the change of n value cheng et al 2021a ho and zydney 2000 lee et al 2013 as displayed in fig 6 a the fouling process of the raw water was divided into two sections with n values of 2 446 and 0 012 individually the result indicated that complete pore blocking occupied a leading role at the early stage of filtration and the main fouling mechanism was converted to cake filtration in the middle and late stage which was consistent with the findings of liu et al 2017b to be specific membrane pores were blocked by the algal cells and macromolecular eom during the initial stage while the inner pores were covered by eom with low molecular weight then cake filtration was gradually formed with the increase of filtration volume it seemed that single pacl or spc treatment exerted minor effect on the fouling mechanism in the filtration process and serious cake layer filtration still existed by contrast the combined treatments of pacl and spc substantially changed the main fouling mechanism and cake filtration was not formed throughout the filtration process specifically the attractive interactions between algal foulants e g algal cells eom etc were enhanced due to the synergistic effect of spc and pacl thus the pollutants exhibited a stronger tendency to aggregate and deposit and the removal efficiency of algal pollutants was strengthened to this end the dense foulants layer formed on membrane surface became looser and more porous and the accumulation of foulants was alleviated hence slowing the generation of cake layer filtration with pacl spc treatment the n value was converted from 1 857 to 1 663 revealing that both complete pore blocking and standard blocking dominated in the fouling mechanism considering pacl spc system the n value was changed from 1 764 to 1 213 demonstrating the transition of dominated mechanism to standard blocking and intermediate blocking with respect to spc pacl process standard blocking played a major role in addition fig s4 showed that all the filtration data were well fitted to the combined model further confirming the combined fouling mechanisms it can also be seen in fig s5 that the fitting models showed similar trends to the filtration data the result suggested that the combined treatments altered the pollution mechanism by delaying the generation of cake layer filtration thus the fouling caused by algal pollutants was significantly alleviated 3 3 3 influence of each algal component to further clarify the fouling control mechanism the influence of each algal component i e algal cells and eom was systematically investigated fig 7 illustrates the fouling conditions of membrane caused by algal cells as seen in fig 7 a the algal cells without pretreatment caused serious membrane fouling and the normalized flux after filtration dropped to 0 135 the pacl treatment could improve the specific flux to 0 731 but spc alone was ineffective for enhancing membrane flux in comparison with a single treatment step the combined treatments with different dosing strategies significantly improved the permeate flux demonstrating the synergistic promotion effect between pacl and spc it seemed that the dosing method exerted little effect on the flux enhancement and the final specific fluxes were promoted to 0 912 0 920 the mitigation effects of the combined pretreatments on the fouling resistances were depicted in fig 7 b due to the large particle size algal cells could be completely intercepted on the surface of uf membrane thus mainly resulting in reversible fouling although pacl coagulation could significantly promote the permeate flux and decrease the reversible resistance the control efficiency of irreversible fouling was still limited the combined processes significantly reduced both irreversible and reversible fouling confirming the superior performance for algal cells fouling control the membrane fouling conditions caused by eom were also explored with the results displayed in fig 8 during the filtration of eom spc oxidation alone was not conductive to the increase of membrane flux while single pacl increased the ultimate normalized flux from 0 171 to 0 219 with the combined treatments of pacl and spc the final specific flux was only slightly increased to 0 222 0 249 demonstrating that the combined processes showed relatively limited effect on the alleviation of flux attenuation caused by eom in comparison with algae laden water and algal cells eom induced more irreversible fouling resistance which was caused by the deposition of eom with low molecular weight on the pore walls for the combined treatments the mitigation efficiencies of reversible and irreversible resistances were 30 7 42 4 and 26 7 53 9 individually it was noteworthy that algal cells existing in the algae laden water could adsorb part of algal organic matter thus enhancing the reduction of algal foulants and the alleviation of membrane fouling by contrast eom alone caused more serious irreversible fouling and the fouling control efficiency was generally lower than that of the algal cells and algae laden water the average size of algal cells approximately 4 μm was significantly larger than membrane pore size therefore algal cells could be effectively rejected by uf membranes through size exclusion when filtrating algal cells a dense foulants layer was formed on the membrane surface and cake filtration was the dominated fouling mechanism different from algal cells eom is a complex mixture with varying molecular weights thus the organics with smaller molecular weight could be attached on membrane pores thus causing severe pore blocking fouling as the filtration volume increased the main fouling mechanism could be converted to cake filtration ascribed to the deposition of algal pollutants onto membrane surfaces in comparison with eom algal cells exhibited a stronger tendency to aggregate and deposit in the combined treatment processes due to the larger size hence the fouling control efficiency of algal cells was generally higher than that of the eom in general the reduction of algal cells played a major role for the mitigation of membrane fouling induced by algal pollutants 3 4 interface characteristics of fouled membranes 3 4 1 surface functional groups the functional groups of fouled membranes were analyzed though ftir with the spectra displayed in fig 9 as seen the typical signals of new pes membrane were clearly detected which was consistent with previous findings wan et al 2019 wang et al 2015 when the membrane was fouled by algae laden water the peak intensities for pes polymers were decreased and strong absorbances at 3283 2924 1650 1542 and 1040 cm 1 were noticed demonstrating the deposition of algal foulants on membrane surfaces specifically the broad peak at approximately 3283 cm 1 was caused by oh stretching vibrations and the peak of 1040 cm 1 was ascribed to c o c vibration both oh and c o c suggested the presence of polysaccharides which were main components of the cell walls for microcystis aeruginosa the peak of c o nh2 amide i was identified in the range of 1650 cm 1 while the signal of nh cn amide ii was observed at 1542 cm 1 corresponding to the characteristics of proteinaceous substances gamage and chellam 2014 moreover a relatively weak response at 2924 cm 1 was also visible which was an indicator of ch vibration in humic substances wang et al 2017 the result indicated that algal foulants causing membrane fouling was complicated consisting of polysaccharides proteins and humics etc spc oxidation alone exhibited negligible influence on the spectrum while pacl pretreatment could obviously decrease the intensities of each peak corresponding to algal foulants when the combined pretreatments were used the foulants peak intensities were further decreased and the peaks related to virgin pes membrane were visible demonstrating the effectiveness of fouling mitigation 3 4 2 surface morphologies as seen in the surface images of fouled membranes fig s6 a dense foulants layer was formed on the membrane surface when filtrating algae laden water spc alone exhibited little effect on the surface appearance while the dense cake became looser and more porous with the combined pretreatments of pacl and spc the surface micromorphology was further observed to explore the interface characteristics of fouled membranes fig 10 after being contaminated by microcystis aeruginosa laden water a mass of algal cells were accumulated on the top of membrane tightly and orderly forming a denser cake layer and resulting in serious membrane fouling when the raw water was pretreated with pacl alone the number of algal cells visible in the image was reduced and clumps were formed under the flocculation effect single spc treatment had almost no effect on the surface micromorphology and the accumulation of algal cells was basically the same as that of raw water which revealed that spc oxidation was relatively mild and did not cause obvious cell rupture at the employed dosage when spc oxidation coupled with pacl coagulation was utilized the number of algal cells on the membrane surface was markedly reduced and the cells aggregated together with the flocs formed during the combined process visible noted that the dosing strategy exhibited minor effect on the surface micromorphology and the effectiveness of the integrated process of pacl and spc for alleviating membrane fouling was further verified overall it is meaningful and practical to integrate spc oxidation with pacl coagulation for algal fouling mitigation by contrast conventional coagulation exhibited a weak removal effect for micropollutants and the coagulant residues also raised concerns while the cells integrity could be destroyed by traditional oxidants e g o3 clo2 etc resulting in the cells rupture and the release of iom with respect to the adsorption method the algal fouling control efficiency was relatively limited generally the combined process of pacl and spc has great advantages over other traditional treatments exhibiting great application values in algae laden water purification 4 conclusion in this work an integrated process coupling spc oxidation and pacl coagulation was proposed for membrane fouling mitigation in the purification of algae laden water and different spc dosing strategies were compared the combined process substantially decreased the resistance of algal foulants to aggregation thus the particle size of foulants became larger than a single treatment step the degradation of fluorescent organics was strengthened owing to the synergism of pacl and spc and the molecular weight distributions of organics were changed with macromolecular biopolymers decomposed into low molecular weight substances both fouling fractions caused by algal foulants were effectively controlled with the combined treatments among which pacl spc performed best with the irreversible fouling reduced by 90 5 while the efficiency of spc pacl was relatively lower with the rate of 57 3 the main fouling mechanism was substantially changed and cake filtration was not formed throughout the filtration process the combined process was more effective for controlling the fouling induced by algal cells rather than eom demonstrating that the fouling alleviation was mainly attributed to the reduction of algal cells the efficiency of the proposed process was further verified through characterization of the membrane interface properties including surface functional groups images and micromorphology the proposed process is convenient and efficient exhibiting great application values for improving membrane performance during algae laden water treatment declaration of competing

16657,to alleviate algal fouling in membrane water treatment processes conventional technologies such as coagulation with poly aluminum chloride pacl has been widely adopted by many drinking water treatment plants however coagulation alone exhibited relatively weak removal effect for algal pollutants and the coagulant residues due to the excess dosage also raised concerns thus a novel process of coupling sodium percarbonate spc oxidation and pacl coagulation was proposed integrated with membrane filtration for algae laden water treatment the dosages of pacl and spc were optimized and the spc dosing strategies were systematically compared the changes in the characteristics of algal pollutants were investigated and the results revealed that the resistance of algal foulants to aggregation was decreased and the particle size of algal foulants became larger with the synergism of coagulation and oxidation the degradation of fluorescent organics was strengthened and macromolecular biopolymers were decomposed into low molecular weight organics the fouling control efficiency was further explored and the results indicated that both irreversible and reversible fouling were effectively controlled among which pacl spc simultaneous treatment performed best with the irreversible fouling reduced by 90 5 while the efficiency of spc pacl spc followed by pacl was relatively lower 57 3 the fouling mechanism was altered by slowing the formation of cake filtration and the reduction of algal cells played a more important role for the fouling alleviation the interface properties of contaminated membranes i e functional groups images and micromorphology were characterized and the efficiency of the proposed strategy was further verified the proposed strategy exhibits great application values for improving membrane performance during algae laden water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sodium percarbonate spc oxidation and coagulation membrane fouling algae laden water dosing strategies 1 introduction as important sources of potable water lakes and reservoirs are susceptible to water eutrophication thereby resulting in algae outbreaks in the source water babel and takizawa 2010 liu et al 2020 with growing amounts of exogenous pollutants e g nitrogen and phosphorus discharged into the water algae blooms are increasingly frequent and the security of drinking water are seriously threatened du et al 2020 jin et al 2017 as one of the most potential water treatment technologies ultrafiltration uf membrane shows an excellent application prospect for the purification of algae laden water specifically algal cells could be effectively rejected by uf membranes through size exclusion he et al 2020 schulz et al 2016 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 hence avoiding the rupture of algal cells to the greatest extent noted that algae laden water is generally a complex aquatic system consisting of algal cells organic matter colloidal particles and algae metabolites etc therefore membrane fouling generated by these algal pollutants is still a main obstacle for uf technology chiou et al 2010 ding et al 2020 liu et al 2017b liu et al 2017a reported that the main algal foulants causing membrane fouling contained algal cells debris intracellular and extracellular organic matter i e iom and eom respectively to alleviate algal membrane fouling various pretreatment alternatives have aroused considerable attentions cheng et al 2018 li et al 2014 lu et al 2020 wan et al 2019 xing et al 2019 among which coagulation is an attractive option because of the high algae removal efficiency maintenance of cell integrity and ease of operation however coagulation alone exhibited a weak removal effect for micropollutants e g microcystins and also a large amount of coagulant is required to neutralize the electronegativity of algal cells resulting in the coagulant residues tian et al 2021 recently the combination of coagulation and oxidation e g ozone uv ferrate etc has been explored to solve the above problems for instance the integration of ferrate pre oxidation and fecl3 coagulation was effective for mitigating membrane fouling in algae laden water treatment he et al 2020 noted that it is quite important to maintain the integrity of algal cells and avoid the release of intracellular organics during the oxidation process as an emerging oxidant sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5 h2o2 spc which is also known as a solid form of h2o2 has recently attracted more and more attentions in water purification gao et al 2021 ren et al 2020 xu et al 2021 it is worth noting that spc is more stable than h2o2 and easier to transport which is cost effective in practical applications fu et al 2017 moreover it is valid over a wide range of ph and the reaction products are generally environmental friendly fu et al 2015 li et al 2020 recently the degradation of bisphenol a by uv spc was investigated and the results indicated that uv spc was promising for water purification gao et al 2020 in another work tian et al 2021 spc fe2 process was demonstrated to be effective for the elimination of microcystis aeruginosa and microcystins without damaging cell integrity although beneficial excessive dosing of fe2 could result in unpleasant color and accelerate the corrosion of pipe networks therefore fe based coagulants are seldom used in practical applications for most drinking water plants at present al based coagulants are commonly used for potable water production whereas high coagulant doses are required to remove algal foulants resulting in the coagulant residues thus it is meaningful to utilize spc to enhance the coagulation efficiency of al based coagulants for uf fouling mitigation in algae laden water treatment however there is still no relevant research has been reported so far in the current work a novel strategy of coupling spc oxidation and poly aluminum chloride pacl coagulation was proposed and the effect of spc dosing strategies on the alleviation of membrane fouling by algal foulants was systematically studied the feasibility of this technology for treating algae laden water was explored by investigating the changes in the characteristics of feed water the efficiency of membrane fouling control and the interface characteristics of fouled membranes the proposed strategy could provide some new thoughts into algal fouling control for drinking water plants in practical applications 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials as one of the most widely occurring algae species in potable water sources microcystis aeruginosa no fachb 905 supplied by institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences was employed in this work a sterile bg 11 medium was utilized to provide the required nutrients for the algal growth to simulate the natural growth environment of algae the illumination condition was controlled at a dark light cycle of 12 12 h every day and the temperature was constant at 25 c the cultivated microcystis aeruginosa at stationary phase 35 d was selected to prepare the algae laden water which was diluted to 2 0 106 cells ml using the diluent containing of naclo4 15 0 mmol l cacl2 0 5 mmol l and nahco3 1 0 mmol l ren et al 2020 the eom was extracted using a high speed refrigerated centrifuge 5810r eppendorf germany and the cell suspension was centrifugated at 10 000 r min and 4 c for 15 min followed by filtrating with 0 45 μm filters and diluting the permeate with ultrapure water to a dissolved organic carbon level of 5 0 mg l the precipitated algal cells were resuspended in nacl solution 0 6 to obtain the algal cells solution in addition spc and pacl were acquired from aladdin chemicals shanghai china and all the other chemical reagents were supplied by sinopharm peking china 2 2 experimental procedures as shown in fig s1 the process of coupling spc oxidation and coagulation was carried out under three different spc dosing strategies i e pacl coagulation followed by spc oxidation pacl spc simultaneous addition of pacl and spc pacl spc and spc oxidation followed by pacl coagulation spc pacl furthermore pacl coagulation and spc oxidation alone were carried out as control groups the employed dosages of pacl and spc were 4 10 20 30 40 mg l and 0 04 0 08 0 10 and 0 14 mmol l respectively to be specific the pacl coagulation process was conducted by rapid stirring at 300 r min for 2 min slow mixing at 70 r min for 30 min and sedimentation for 30 min the oxidation experiment by spc was performed by mixing at a constant rate of 150 r min for 30 min the pacl spc treatment was carried out by rapid stirring at 300 r min for 2 min moderate mixing at 150 r min for 30 min slow mixing at 70 r min for 30 min and sedimentation for 30 min the experimental setup for subsequent membrane filtration as shown in fig s2 was composed of an uf cell ufsc 40 001 millipore usa coupled with pes membranes up150 microdyn nadir germany a nitrogen bottle and a data collection system connected to an electronic balance hzy b2200 hz usa the detailed operation methods are visible in our recent works cheng et al 2017 2019 2 3 membrane fouling analysis in this work the reversible and irreversible resistances rr and rir respectively of membranes were distinguished and calculated by a resistance in series model cheng et al 2021b choo and lee 1996 to be specific hydraulic backwash was perormed by reversing the membrane with the supporting layer upwards and ultrapure water was applied to wash the membrane under a significant higher pressure than filtration the rr and rir were determined according to eqs 1 and 2 1 r r t m p μ j 1 t m p μ j 2 2 r i r t m p μ j 2 t m p μ j 0 where tmp is the transmembrane pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity j0 is the average pure water flux of virgin membrane j1 is the permeate flux at the end of filtration j2 is the average pure water flux after hydraulic backwash the fouling mechanisms at different filtration stages were explored using the hermia model hermia 1982 wang et al 2020 and the dominated mechanism was determined by the n value to be specific the n values of 2 0 1 5 1 0 and 0 represent the mechanisms of complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration individually moreover a combined model of pore blockage cake filtration ho and zydney 2000 text s1 was also utilized to fit the filtration data 2 4 analytical methods the uv 1800 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer mapada china was utilized to measure the uv254 and uv685 values particle size distribution of algal cells was determined by a laser particle size analyzer bettersize2600 china while zeta potential was measured using a zetasizer instrument nano zs malvern panalytical uk to identify the fluorescent components in algae laden water fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained through a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 hitachi japan a high performance liquid chromatograph e2695 waters usa equipped with an uv detector was utilized to explore the molecular weight distributions of algal organics the surface functional groups of fouled membranes were detected by a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer spectrum one b perkin elmer usa and the surface morphologies were observed through the jsm 7610f scanning electron microscope sem jeol japan to identify the generated free radical species a spectrometer emxnano bruker germany was utilized to perform the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization for the dosages of pacl and spc the dosages of pacl and spc were optimized according to the removal efficiencies of uv254 and uv685 fig 1 which represent the concentrations of algal organic matter containing unsaturated bonds or aromatic chromophores with uv absorption and algal cells respectively as displayed in fig 1 a b the uv254 and uv685 values were obviously reduced with the pacl dosage elevated from 4 to 20 mg l whereas further increase of pacl dosage did not show significant beneficial effect for algal removal therefore 20 mg l was chosen as the optimal pacl dosage in the coagulation process with the uv254 and uv685 removal efficiencies of 88 0 and 91 5 respectively the removal effect was further enhanced to varying degrees in the pacl spc process and 0 10 mmol l of spc achieved the best result with the removal rates of uv254 and uv685 increased to 92 4 and 97 6 individually based on the above results highly effective algal removal was achieved at the pacl and spc dosages of 20 mg l and 0 10 mmol l which were chosen as the optimal dosages 3 2 the changes in the characteristics of algae laden water 3 2 1 zeta potential and particle size distribution the zeta potential of microcystis aeruginosa laden water was detected to characterize the stability and aggregation status of algal cells as seen in fig 2 a the raw algae laden water exhibited the highest negative surface charge with the zeta potential value of 23 6 mv suggesting that the algal foulants were stable in the water due to the apparent resistance to aggregation the zeta potentials were increased to 11 0 and 13 7 mv by the treatments of pacl and spc respectively which indicated that the negative surface charge was reduced and the resistance of algal foulants to aggregation was weaken regarding the integrated pretreatments the repulsive interactions between algal foulants were further decreased with the zeta potentials increased to 10 8 1 and 10 5 mv for pacl spc pacl spc spc pacl individually compared to single pacl or spc treatment pacl coagulation combined with spc oxidation could further enhance the attractive interactions between algal foulants thus the algal cells and organic pollutants exhibited a stronger tendency to aggregate and deposit noticeably the enhanced effect of pacl spc was more remarkable than the other dosing strategies fig 2 b shows the distributions of particle size under different spc dosing strategies regarding the raw algae laden water the particle size was mainly distributed in 2 5 μm with an average size of approximately 4 μm the results were consistent with previous reports liu et al 2020 suggesting that the algal foulants were stable without the formation of cell aggregates the oxidation of spc slightly changed the size distribution and the size range was broadened to 2 7 μm when pacl coagulation was applied the peak intensity at 3 4 μm was obviously decreased meanwhile a peak at 10 50 μm was observed indicating that the cell aggregation occurred with respect to the combined treatments of pacl and spc the peaks at 3 4 μm were further decreased to varying degrees and the peaks at 10 100 μm were significantly increased the above results indicated that the particle size of algal foulants became larger after pacl coagulation combined with spc oxidation treatments which was caused by the decreased resistance of algal foulants to aggregation as confirmed by the results of zeta potential 3 2 2 fluorescent organic components fig 3 shows the fluorescence spectra of algae laden water and eom with different treatments noted that the eem analysis only detects limited organic components some non fluorescent algal organics could not be identified and were not discussed here as illustrated in fig 3 a the fluorescent components in algae laden water showed four characteristic peaks of a c t1 and t2 of note peaks a and c represented humic substances while tryptophan like protein substances were related to peaks t1 and t2 du et al 2019a 2019b it can be observed that the peak intensities of t1 and t2 were particularly higher in comparison with peaks a and c revealing that a high concentration of protein substances existed in algae laden water all the peak intensities were obviously weakened with pacl or spc treatment alone which indicated that both coagulation and oxidation had some effect on the elimination of fluorescent components the fluorescence intensities were further decreased with the dual effect of pacl and spc regardless of the dosing strategies the enhanced performance was likely caused by the synergistic effect of pacl and spc as seen in fig s3 the signal of dmpooh adduct showing a peak strength of 1 2 2 1 was observed indicating the generation of oh radical in the pacl spc process luo et al 2018 thus the degradation of organic pollutants was strengthened due to the strong oxidizing and non selective property of oh van geluwe et al 2011 with respect to the fluorescence spectra of eom the intensities of peaks a and c became more distinct than algae laden water demonstrating that both humic substances and protein substances were dominated in eom this was because that eom was extracted through high speed centrifugation hence both dissolved and bound organic pollutants existed in the solution by contrast the algae laden water contained fewer bound organics attached on the cell surfaces single pacl or spc treatment could dramatically reduce the intensity of peak t1 whereas a single treatment step was ineffective for the reduction of humic substances the peaks were further weakened when pacl was used together with spc among which pacl spc exhibited the best performance with relatively lower peak intensity and area 3 2 3 molecular weight distributions of organics the molecular weight of organics for algae laden water with various treatments are depicted in fig 4 the peaks of macromolecular biopolymers and humic substances could be seen clearly for the raw water while pacl treatment significantly reduced the peak intensity of biopolymers suggesting that biopolymers could be effectively removed by the coagulation process with spc oxidation the peak intensity of humics was increased and the peak of low molecular weight organic matter appeared which was ascribed to the oxidative decomposition of biopolymers the peaks of humics and low molecular weight organic matter were further strengthened under the synergetic effect of pacl and spc likely due to the strong oxidizing property of in situ formed oh radical specifically oh could accelerate the decomposition of biopolymers and the generation of lower molecular weight uv adsorbing humic substances it was noteworthy that the generated oh radical could be rapidly consumed by dissolved eom thus reducing the contact of the algal cells with the oxidant and avoiding the rupture of algal cells the bound eom adsorbed on the cell surfaces could also consume some of the free radicals thereby helping to maintain the cells integrity and avoiding the release of iom huo et al 2015 qi et al 2016 takaara et al 2010 furthermore the optimized oxidant dosage also minimized the rupture of algal cells while maintaining the excellent performance the results demonstrated that the combined process of pacl and spc could substantially alter the distribution of molecular weight for organic pollutants in algae laden water by decomposing macromolecular biopolymers into low molecular weight organics 3 3 efficiency of membrane fouling mitigation 3 3 1 permeation flux and fouling resistances in the filtration of algae laden water the fouling control efficiency of the combined process of pacl and spc is displayed in fig 5 as seen the filtration of microcystis aeruginosa laden water resulted in a serious flux decline with the terminal specific flux reduced to 0 062 fig 5 a it can be seen that single spc treatment exhibited minor effect on the flux curve suggesting that spc was ineffective for improving the permeate flux while pacl alone could to some extent alleviate the flux decline and improved the terminal normalized flux to 0 353 this was because that pacl coagulation could accelerate the agglomeration and settlement of algal cells and organic pollutants thus reducing the algal pollutants contacting with membranes the permeate flux was dramatically improved with spc pacl treatment and the terminal normalized flux was increased to 0 674 the performances of pacl spc and pacl spc were significantly better than spc pacl with the ultimate normalized fluxes of 0 832 and 0 838 individually the relatively lower efficiency of spc pacl was likely attributed to the generation of small molecules during spc oxidation process which could not be effectively removed by subsequent coagulation thus affecting the membrane flux in some degree regarding the fouling resistance the reversible resistance accounted for a larger proportion of the total resistance fig 5 b the pacl treatment alone effectively alleviated the reversible fouling with a mitigation efficiency of 88 9 whereas the reduction rate of irreversible fouling was only 28 8 by contrast spc alone showed a very low control efficiency for reversible fouling and the irreversible fouling was even slightly increased this was likely because large molecules pollutants were oxidized into small molecules which aggravated the clogging of membrane pores the combined process of coagulation and oxidation could effectively decrease both fouling fractions irrespective of the dosing strategies with respect to the irreversible fouling control pacl spc performed best with the mitigation efficiency reaching 90 5 while the efficiency of spc pacl was relatively lower with the rate of 57 3 for the spc pacl process the generated small molecule organics during spc oxidation could result in membrane pore blockage thereby the irreversible fouling resistance was slightly increased regarding the pacl spc treatment large amounts of algal pollutants could be removed through pacl coagulation thus the small organics formed in subsequent spc oxidation was reduced and the irreversible fouling was well controlled 3 3 2 the variation of fouling mechanisms the fouling mechanisms of algae laden water after various treatments were explored through replotting the filtration data as d2 t dv 2 versus dt dv fig 6 the value of n demonstrated the main fouling mechanism and the transition of the dominated mechanism during filtration could be reflected through the change of n value cheng et al 2021a ho and zydney 2000 lee et al 2013 as displayed in fig 6 a the fouling process of the raw water was divided into two sections with n values of 2 446 and 0 012 individually the result indicated that complete pore blocking occupied a leading role at the early stage of filtration and the main fouling mechanism was converted to cake filtration in the middle and late stage which was consistent with the findings of liu et al 2017b to be specific membrane pores were blocked by the algal cells and macromolecular eom during the initial stage while the inner pores were covered by eom with low molecular weight then cake filtration was gradually formed with the increase of filtration volume it seemed that single pacl or spc treatment exerted minor effect on the fouling mechanism in the filtration process and serious cake layer filtration still existed by contrast the combined treatments of pacl and spc substantially changed the main fouling mechanism and cake filtration was not formed throughout the filtration process specifically the attractive interactions between algal foulants e g algal cells eom etc were enhanced due to the synergistic effect of spc and pacl thus the pollutants exhibited a stronger tendency to aggregate and deposit and the removal efficiency of algal pollutants was strengthened to this end the dense foulants layer formed on membrane surface became looser and more porous and the accumulation of foulants was alleviated hence slowing the generation of cake layer filtration with pacl spc treatment the n value was converted from 1 857 to 1 663 revealing that both complete pore blocking and standard blocking dominated in the fouling mechanism considering pacl spc system the n value was changed from 1 764 to 1 213 demonstrating the transition of dominated mechanism to standard blocking and intermediate blocking with respect to spc pacl process standard blocking played a major role in addition fig s4 showed that all the filtration data were well fitted to the combined model further confirming the combined fouling mechanisms it can also be seen in fig s5 that the fitting models showed similar trends to the filtration data the result suggested that the combined treatments altered the pollution mechanism by delaying the generation of cake layer filtration thus the fouling caused by algal pollutants was significantly alleviated 3 3 3 influence of each algal component to further clarify the fouling control mechanism the influence of each algal component i e algal cells and eom was systematically investigated fig 7 illustrates the fouling conditions of membrane caused by algal cells as seen in fig 7 a the algal cells without pretreatment caused serious membrane fouling and the normalized flux after filtration dropped to 0 135 the pacl treatment could improve the specific flux to 0 731 but spc alone was ineffective for enhancing membrane flux in comparison with a single treatment step the combined treatments with different dosing strategies significantly improved the permeate flux demonstrating the synergistic promotion effect between pacl and spc it seemed that the dosing method exerted little effect on the flux enhancement and the final specific fluxes were promoted to 0 912 0 920 the mitigation effects of the combined pretreatments on the fouling resistances were depicted in fig 7 b due to the large particle size algal cells could be completely intercepted on the surface of uf membrane thus mainly resulting in reversible fouling although pacl coagulation could significantly promote the permeate flux and decrease the reversible resistance the control efficiency of irreversible fouling was still limited the combined processes significantly reduced both irreversible and reversible fouling confirming the superior performance for algal cells fouling control the membrane fouling conditions caused by eom were also explored with the results displayed in fig 8 during the filtration of eom spc oxidation alone was not conductive to the increase of membrane flux while single pacl increased the ultimate normalized flux from 0 171 to 0 219 with the combined treatments of pacl and spc the final specific flux was only slightly increased to 0 222 0 249 demonstrating that the combined processes showed relatively limited effect on the alleviation of flux attenuation caused by eom in comparison with algae laden water and algal cells eom induced more irreversible fouling resistance which was caused by the deposition of eom with low molecular weight on the pore walls for the combined treatments the mitigation efficiencies of reversible and irreversible resistances were 30 7 42 4 and 26 7 53 9 individually it was noteworthy that algal cells existing in the algae laden water could adsorb part of algal organic matter thus enhancing the reduction of algal foulants and the alleviation of membrane fouling by contrast eom alone caused more serious irreversible fouling and the fouling control efficiency was generally lower than that of the algal cells and algae laden water the average size of algal cells approximately 4 μm was significantly larger than membrane pore size therefore algal cells could be effectively rejected by uf membranes through size exclusion when filtrating algal cells a dense foulants layer was formed on the membrane surface and cake filtration was the dominated fouling mechanism different from algal cells eom is a complex mixture with varying molecular weights thus the organics with smaller molecular weight could be attached on membrane pores thus causing severe pore blocking fouling as the filtration volume increased the main fouling mechanism could be converted to cake filtration ascribed to the deposition of algal pollutants onto membrane surfaces in comparison with eom algal cells exhibited a stronger tendency to aggregate and deposit in the combined treatment processes due to the larger size hence the fouling control efficiency of algal cells was generally higher than that of the eom in general the reduction of algal cells played a major role for the mitigation of membrane fouling induced by algal pollutants 3 4 interface characteristics of fouled membranes 3 4 1 surface functional groups the functional groups of fouled membranes were analyzed though ftir with the spectra displayed in fig 9 as seen the typical signals of new pes membrane were clearly detected which was consistent with previous findings wan et al 2019 wang et al 2015 when the membrane was fouled by algae laden water the peak intensities for pes polymers were decreased and strong absorbances at 3283 2924 1650 1542 and 1040 cm 1 were noticed demonstrating the deposition of algal foulants on membrane surfaces specifically the broad peak at approximately 3283 cm 1 was caused by oh stretching vibrations and the peak of 1040 cm 1 was ascribed to c o c vibration both oh and c o c suggested the presence of polysaccharides which were main components of the cell walls for microcystis aeruginosa the peak of c o nh2 amide i was identified in the range of 1650 cm 1 while the signal of nh cn amide ii was observed at 1542 cm 1 corresponding to the characteristics of proteinaceous substances gamage and chellam 2014 moreover a relatively weak response at 2924 cm 1 was also visible which was an indicator of ch vibration in humic substances wang et al 2017 the result indicated that algal foulants causing membrane fouling was complicated consisting of polysaccharides proteins and humics etc spc oxidation alone exhibited negligible influence on the spectrum while pacl pretreatment could obviously decrease the intensities of each peak corresponding to algal foulants when the combined pretreatments were used the foulants peak intensities were further decreased and the peaks related to virgin pes membrane were visible demonstrating the effectiveness of fouling mitigation 3 4 2 surface morphologies as seen in the surface images of fouled membranes fig s6 a dense foulants layer was formed on the membrane surface when filtrating algae laden water spc alone exhibited little effect on the surface appearance while the dense cake became looser and more porous with the combined pretreatments of pacl and spc the surface micromorphology was further observed to explore the interface characteristics of fouled membranes fig 10 after being contaminated by microcystis aeruginosa laden water a mass of algal cells were accumulated on the top of membrane tightly and orderly forming a denser cake layer and resulting in serious membrane fouling when the raw water was pretreated with pacl alone the number of algal cells visible in the image was reduced and clumps were formed under the flocculation effect single spc treatment had almost no effect on the surface micromorphology and the accumulation of algal cells was basically the same as that of raw water which revealed that spc oxidation was relatively mild and did not cause obvious cell rupture at the employed dosage when spc oxidation coupled with pacl coagulation was utilized the number of algal cells on the membrane surface was markedly reduced and the cells aggregated together with the flocs formed during the combined process visible noted that the dosing strategy exhibited minor effect on the surface micromorphology and the effectiveness of the integrated process of pacl and spc for alleviating membrane fouling was further verified overall it is meaningful and practical to integrate spc oxidation with pacl coagulation for algal fouling mitigation by contrast conventional coagulation exhibited a weak removal effect for micropollutants and the coagulant residues also raised concerns while the cells integrity could be destroyed by traditional oxidants e g o3 clo2 etc resulting in the cells rupture and the release of iom with respect to the adsorption method the algal fouling control efficiency was relatively limited generally the combined process of pacl and spc has great advantages over other traditional treatments exhibiting great application values in algae laden water purification 4 conclusion in this work an integrated process coupling spc oxidation and pacl coagulation was proposed for membrane fouling mitigation in the purification of algae laden water and different spc dosing strategies were compared the combined process substantially decreased the resistance of algal foulants to aggregation thus the particle size of foulants became larger than a single treatment step the degradation of fluorescent organics was strengthened owing to the synergism of pacl and spc and the molecular weight distributions of organics were changed with macromolecular biopolymers decomposed into low molecular weight substances both fouling fractions caused by algal foulants were effectively controlled with the combined treatments among which pacl spc performed best with the irreversible fouling reduced by 90 5 while the efficiency of spc pacl was relatively lower with the rate of 57 3 the main fouling mechanism was substantially changed and cake filtration was not formed throughout the filtration process the combined process was more effective for controlling the fouling induced by algal cells rather than eom demonstrating that the fouling alleviation was mainly attributed to the reduction of algal cells the efficiency of the proposed process was further verified through characterization of the membrane interface properties including surface functional groups images and micromorphology the proposed process is convenient and efficient exhibiting great application values for improving membrane performance during algae laden water treatment declaration of competing

16658,sustainable treatment of the highly saline landfill leachate concentrate for application as green fertilizer calls for effective fractionation of the existing humic substances and inorganic salts advanced selective nanofiltration membranes are proposed for this one step rapid assembly of a tannic acid fe3 coordination complex is a promising strategy to endow the membranes with an enhanced nanofiltration performance in this study a robust and homogeneous tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer was effectively coated onto the surface of a loose nanofiltration substrate in an extremely short time 15 s after the coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer the nanofiltration membrane showed a significantly reduced molecule weight cutoff i e reduction from 601 to 279 da and thus enhanced selectivity towards humic substances specifically the rejection to humic substances of the coated nanofiltration membrane increased from 95 31 0 54 to 99 32 0 18 with negligible rise in salt rejection demonstrating an enhanced fractionation efficacy for humic substances and salts assisted by a diafiltration operation with the coated nanofiltration membrane humic substances in the landfill leachate concentrate were effectively purified and extracted with 96 60 recovery particularly the humic substances were linearly enriched by ca 7 8 folds i e from 1837 to 13970 mg l 1 with a purity of 98 91 for potential application as liquid fertilizer the one step rapid tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating exhibits an impressive efficacy to engineer advanced nanofiltration membranes that could be applied at a large scale for sustainable resource extraction from landfill leachate concentrate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tannic acid fe3 complexes nanofiltration membranes landfill leachate concentrate fractionation humic substances sustainable resource extraction 1 introduction landfill leachate has become a global environmental concern as an intrinsic consequence of the disposal of solid waste by landfilling particularly landfill leachate is highly loaded with extremely toxic compounds e g ammonia heavy metals salts and recalcitrant organics posing a detrimental harm to the eco system and human health yuan et al 2017 yi et al 2017 aftab et al 2019 the combination of membrane bioreactor with nanofiltration is a prevalent strategy for effective treatment of landfill leachate removing the biodegradable organics and heavy metals to minimize the toxicity of landfill leachate to great extent ahmed and lan 2012 hu et al 2018 however the landfill leachate concentrate lcc that is inevitably generated from this hybrid membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration process contains refractory organics i e humic substances and inorganic salts at high concentrations emerging as a tough technical challenge from the perspective of circular economy the humic substances present in lcc stream can be used as fertilizers to promote the plant propagation and growth which enables the llc to be a potentially recyclable resource iskander et al 2019 ye et al 2019 unfortunately the conventional approaches e g coagulation long et al 2017 evaporation hendrych et al 2019 and advanced oxidation chen et al 2019 el kateb et al 2019 not only involve high energy consumption and operational cost but also fail to extract the humic substances since they are removed or degraded compromising the sustainable management of llc in order to sustainably recover the humic substances as a useful source of nutrients it is of great significance to purify them by effective separation from the inorganic salts that are also present in the llc stream nanofiltration membranes are increasingly emerging as an important tool to fractionate the organic compounds and inorganic salts via the synergistic effect of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion chen et al 2018 lin et al 2015 chen et al 2019 liu et al 2015 tan et al 2018 generally nanofiltration membranes typically have molecular weight cutoffs mwcos of 200 1000 da and can potentially retain humic substances with small molecular weights unfortunately most commercial nanofiltration membranes with polyamide chemistry e g nf90 dow filmtec df90 origin water utc 60 toray nt103 microdyn nadir have considerably dense surface structure mwcos 500 da and high charge density yielding a low transmission for inorganic salts and thus tremendously jeopardizing the separation efficacy of organic compounds i e humic substances and inorganic salts with reduced permeation flux van der bruggen et al 2004 chen et al 2018 van der bruggen et al 2001 alternatively loose nanofiltration membranes show larger pore size for high salt permeation zhao and wang 2017 cheng et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 however the moderate retention of humic substances for loose nanofiltration membranes could lead to a considerable loss of humic substances compromising the resource recovery from the llc stream ye et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to develop advanced nanofiltration membranes with enhanced permselectivity by tailoring their surface structural morphology and property membrane surface engineering is established as a useful method to elevate the nanofiltration performance by tailoring the membrane morphology and property choudhury et al 2018 ng et al 2013 unfortunately conventional surface modification methods such as nanoparticle nanosheet incorporation uv plasma induced grafting covalent coupling and layer by layer adsorption need sophisticated procedures to immobilize the nanomaterials or functional chemical groups onto the selective layer of the target membranes additionally the dopamine based bio inspired coating has attracted increasing interest for surface engineering to construct advanced membranes you et al 2018 xi et al 2009 guo et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 however the extremely low self polymerization kinetics of dopamine limits its potential application in large scale production of high performance membranes zhao et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 in this study one step rapid assembly 15 s of metal organic coordination based on tannic acid fe3 complexes onto a loose nanofiltration substrate was conducted to enhance its separation performance for sustainable treatment of the llc stream such a rapid tannic acid fe3 complex coating conferred the surface coated nanofiltration membrane with enhanced fractionation of humic substances and inorganic salts specifically the effect of this coordination complex coating on the membrane properties was comprehensively explored through surface morphology scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy chemical composition x ray photoelectron spectroscopy wettability water contact angle surface charge zeta potential and pore size mwco subsequently the potential of the surface coated nanofiltration membrane in separation of humic substances and inorganic salts was evaluated along with its long term operation stability finally a diafiltration process consisting of a pre concentration step and a constant volume diafiltration step based on the coated nanofiltration membrane was applied to enrich purify and extract the humic substances from llc for green fertilizer application this study demonstrates the superiority of the one step rapid tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating to tailor make the advanced nanofiltration membranes at a large scale for sustainable management of highly saline wastewaters such as llc 2 experimental 2 1 membranes and chemicals a thin film composite nanofiltration membrane with poly piperazine amide surface chemistry purchased from yinachuan environmental science technology co ltd guangdong china was applied as the substrate for membrane modification due to its loose surface structure mwco of 601 da the properties of this loose nanofiltration substrate are shown in the supplementary table s1 tannic acid and ferric chloride fecl3 with analytic grade were supplied from aladdin china for surface coating by metal organic coordination complexes onto the loose nanofiltration substrate nacl and kcl with purity of 99 99 were ordered from aladdin china for testing the membrane performance ultrapure water from a milli q system was used throughout the experiments the llc derived from the hybrid membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration process was taken from a municipal solid waste landfill and applied as feed for filtration experiment the biodegradable organic species and heavy metals can be removed during the hybrid membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration process humic substances as refractory organic compounds were merely remained in the llc which can be potentially extracted as organic fertilizer for plant growth atiyeh et al 2002 nardi et al 2002 arancon et al 2006 the main compounds in the llc are listed in table 1 2 2 membrane coating by metal organic coordination complexes in order to enhance the nanofiltration performance through tailoring the surface properties the loose nanofiltration substrate was coated by metal organic coordination complexes fig 1 before the surface coating the loose nanofiltration substrate was fully rinsed with pure water to remove the impurities on its surface after the water rinsing the loose nanofiltration substrate coupon with a diameter of 12 cm was firmly fixed in a round custom designed mould ensuring the complete exposure of the membrane surface with the coating solution next 20 ml of ferric chloride fecl3 solution 12 0 mmol l 1 was poured into the round mould for 2 min subsequently 20 ml tannic acid solution 2 4 mmol l 1 was added for membrane coating under shaking condition at room temperature the coating duration for the loose nanofiltration substrate was set at 0 5 10 15 30 and 60 s respectively finally the surface coated nanofiltration membranes were taken from the round mould for complete rinsing with pure water the resultant nanofiltration membranes were denoted as tam 0 tam 1 tam 2 tam 3 tam 4 and tam 5 respectively 2 3 membrane characterization the surface morphology of the coated nanofiltration membranes was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem with a hitachi su8010 japan field emission scanning electron microscope at a voltage of 5 kv and a magnification of 50 000 moreover atomic force microscopy afm from bruker dimension icon was applied to investigate the surface roughness of the coated membranes at a scanning area of 3 0 μm 3 0 μm based on root mean squared roughness r rms x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was applied to explore the chemical elements of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes which was performed with esca lab 250 xps analyzer using a mono x ray source al kα excitation of 1486 6 ev energy dispersive spectrometer eds was also applied to investigate the distribution of the chemical elements on membrane surfaces using a hitachi su8010 field emission scanning electron microscope the water contact angle measurement using an optical surface analyzer osa200 ningbo scientific instruments co ltd china was undertaken to assess the wettability of the coated nanofiltration membranes a surpass electrokinetic analyzer anton paar gmbh austria was applied to determine the surface charge of the nanofiltration membranes in a 10 mmol l 1 nacl electrolyte at ph 6 5 2 4 pore size the pore size of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes was studied through filtration of 0 1 g l 1 aqueous polyethylene glycol solutions i e molecular weight of 200 300 400 600 or 1000 da at a pressure of 6 bar the rejection coefficient r of polyethylene glycol polymers for the nanofiltration membranes was determined through their concentrations in the feed c f and permeate c p using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu as shown in eq 1 1 r 1 c p c f afterwards a log normal probability density function between the stokes diameter d p of the polyethylene glycol polymers and their rejection coefficients was used to quantify the membrane pore size distribution as displayed in eq 2 kong et al 2016 cheng et al 2015 ye et al 2019 2020 2 d r d p d d p 1 d p ln σ p 2 π exp ln d p ln μ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where μ p denotes the mean effective pore size of the coated nanofiltration membranes as determined at r of 50 and σ p is the geometric standard deviation for pore size defined as ratio of the pore size at r of 84 13 to μ p specifically the stokes diameter d p of the polyethylene glycol polymers was determined via their molecular weights mw which is shown in eq 3 ye et al 2020 3 d p 33 46 10 12 m w 0 557 the mwco of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes can be eventually calculated through the obtained stokes diameter at r of 90 by eq 3 2 5 separation performance 2 5 1 separation of pure salt solutions separation performance of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes was investigated in a cross flow filtration setup at lab scale lin et al 2016 before the filtration experiment the surface coated nanofiltration membranes were pre pressurized through filtrating the pure water at 6 bar to achieve a stable water permeation afterwards the filtration of the pure salt solutions i e nacl or kcl with different contents 0 1 1 0 and 5 0 g l 1 was conducted at 6 bar to investigate the salt rejection of the coated nanofiltration membranes particularly the retentate and permeate were recirculated into the feed to maintain the salt concentration constant 2 5 2 filtration of landfill leachate concentrate filtration of the llc solution was carried out at 6 bar to evaluate the applicability of the coated nanofiltration membranes in separation of humic substances and inorganic salts each filtration of llc was repeated 3 times furthermore the filtration of llc with a 120 h duration was performed to assess the long term stability of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes 2 6 diafiltration of landfill leachate concentrate for extraction of humic substances a diafiltration process based on the coated nanofiltration membrane consisting of a pre concentration step and a constant volume diafiltration step was performed to extract the highly pure humic substances from the llc for purpose of natural fertilizer typically 5000 ml of llc sample was pre concentrated by a factor of 7 8 to minimize the feed volume for enrichment of humic substances afterwards the constant volume diafiltration step was further initiated for desalination and purification of the humic substances through the addition of pure water into the feed at different diavolumes up to 8 0 diavolumes the nanofiltration diafiltration experiment was performed at 6 bar the permeation flux j and solute rejection r s of the coated nanofiltration membrane were determined as follows 4 j v a δ t 5 r s c c p c 100 where v presents the volume of collected permeate a denotes the effective area of the coated nanofiltration membrane and t is the time for permeate collection c or c p is the concentration of humic substances or inorganic salts in the feed or permeate respectively 2 7 analytical methods the concentration of humic substances was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu the concentration of anions i e cl and no3 and cations i e na k ca2 and mg2 was quantified by ion chromatography metrohm 881 compact ic pro swiss and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy perkin elmer optima 3000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface composition and morphology in order to evaluate the efficacy of surface coating with the tannic acid fe3 coordination complexes the surface composition of the coated nanofiltration membranes was analyzed by xps measurement fig 2 as indicated in fig 2 a the pristine loose nanofiltration substrate has a white surface pattern after rapid exposure in tannic acid fe3 coordination complex solution the coated nanofiltration membranes have evenly light purple surface indicating the successful and effective coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex onto the membrane surface which can be also reflected through the elemental composition of membrane surfaces as demonstrated by xps analysis in fig 2 b two unique peaks centered at the binding energy of 710 and 722 ev which were assigned to fe 2p can be exclusively observed on the coated nanofiltration membranes apart from the common o 1s 529 ev n 1s 397 ev and c 1s 282 ev peaks in addition the coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex onto membrane surfaces evolved with increasing exposure duration as demonstrated by the increasingly darkening color pattern of the coated membrane surfaces fig 2 a in particular the coated nanofiltration membranes yielded an enhanced intensity in the peak of o 1s but a reduced intensity in the peak of n 1s during xps measurement fig 2 b since the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer was gradually covered onto the membrane surfaces where a higher atomic percentage of oxygen o element was contained in tannic acid molecule without nitrogen n element the sem and afm analyses were performed to visualize the morphology of the nanofiltration membranes after coating with tannic acid fe3 coordination complexes fig 3 as demonstrated in fig 3 the pristine nanofiltration substrate with poly piperazine amide chemistry has an evenly discrete spotted structure on the nanoscale resulting in a loose but smooth surface with a considerably low roughness 11 5 0 3 nm after the exposure into a tannic acid fe3 mixed solution the loose nanofiltration substrate was rapidly coated with the thin layer of tannic acid fe3 coordination complexes allowing for the coverage of the pore structure this would potentially lead to a reduction in membrane pore size which thus enhances the selectivity to the organic solutes as the coating duration extended an increasingly thick layer of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex was deposited onto the membrane surface however this coordination complex layer has no significant alteration on the surface morphology of the coated nanofiltration membranes yielding a slight boost in surface roughness to 18 8 0 9 nm such a negligible increase in surface roughness demonstrates a thin but homogeneous tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating which can be also confirmed by eds measurement supplementary fig s1 3 3 pore size and water permeability pore size and water permeability are key performance properties to demonstrate the permselectivity of the nanofiltration membranes for organic solutes the pore size and water permeability of the nanofiltration membranes after coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex are shown in fig 4 as observed in fig 4 the loose nanofiltration substrate i e tam 0 has an mwco of 601 da yielding a pure water permeability of 16 76 0 85 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 this is due to the fact that the loose surface structure of the pristine nanofiltration substrate creates excessive nano channels for water transport conversely resulting in a reduced selectivity towards organic solutes after the coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex an increasingly narrow and even pore size distribution can be anticipated for these coated nanofiltration membranes which is reflected by the reduced mwco and geometric standard deviation for pore size σ p specifically the mwco of the coated nanofiltration membrane tam 1 was declined to 423 da after a 5 s coating indicating the impressive efficacy of this coordination complex coating in bridging the loose cavity structure on the membrane surface for enhanced solute selectivity this is consistent with the membrane morphology observed in the sem images fig 3 on the other hand such a coordination complex coating also lead to an enhancement in the intrinsic hydraulic resistance of the membranes compromising the water permeation with a 15 s coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex a remarkable reduction in membrane pore size i e mwco of 279 da was found along with the permeability of 12 62 0 69 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 as the coating duration further prolonged the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer was readily evolved on the loose nanofiltration substrate resulting in a mwco of 265 da in the 60 s coating duration nevertheless the increasing thickness of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer and reduced pore size further boosted the intrinsic hydraulic resistance of the coated nanofiltration membranes based on the hagen poiseuille equation liu et al 2015 chen et al 2018 experiencing a considerably low permeability of 6 53 0 57 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 3 4 filtration of salt solutions a high transmission of inorganic salts is of vital importance in the separation of humic substances and inorganic salts for achieving the sustainable treatment of llc the separation performance of the coated nanofiltration membranes in the pure salt solutions i e nacl or kcl is shown in fig 5 as illustrated in fig 5 the pristine nanofiltration substrate shows a considerable low rejection to both nacl and kcl i e 12 35 2 03 for 1 0 g l 1 nacl 9 33 0 94 for 1 0 g l 1 kcl although the negative charges were highly loaded on the membrane surface due to its loose surface structure diminished the electrostatic repulsion against ions allowing for a high salt permeation after coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer the resultant nanofiltration membranes had a monotonically enhanced rejection for salts specifically as the exposure duration in the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex solution increased to 60 s the rejection of nacl and kcl for the coated nanofiltration membrane i e tam 5 increased to 27 35 3 18 and 21 24 3 36 respectively on the one hand the negative charge density on the coated membrane surface was diminished as reflected by reduced surface zeta potential supplementary fig s2a which would diminish the electrostatic repulsion to the ions for reducing salt rejection on the other hand the reduced pore size of the nanofiltration membranes via the coordination complex coating would further intensify the size exclusion effect for retaining the salts jiang et al 2018 ye et al 2020 therefore the observed rejection of salts for the coated nanofiltration membranes is the sum of these two opposing effects and therefore is determined by the extent of each effect additionally when the salt concentration increased from 0 1 to 5 0 g l 1 during the filtration of the nacl or kcl solution a significant reduction in salt rejection for all the nanofiltration membranes was found ascribed to the fact that the increasing salt concentration could jeopardize the electrostatic repulsion via suppressing the debye length to promote the salt permeation ye et al 2019 liu et al 2015 such a merit of low salt rejection for the nanofiltration membranes coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer not only minimizes the osmosis pressure for enhanced permeation flux but also potentially improves the selectivity between the organic compounds and inorganic salts during the filtration of the highly saline solutions 3 5 filtration of landfill leachate concentrate in order to investigate the efficacy of the nanofiltration membranes coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex in fractionation of humic substances and salts the membrane filtration performance in llc was studied fig 6 due to the considerably large pore size the humic substances with small molecular weights would easily penetrate through the loose nanofiltration substrate i e tam 0 thus resulting in a loss along with the nanofiltration permeate as indicated in fig 6 a an insufficient rejection of 95 31 0 54 for humic substances was observed for the loose nanofiltration substrate which would compromise the fractionation of humic substances and salts in the llc as expected the coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex conferred the fabricated nanofiltration membranes with a remarkably enhanced retention to the humic substances since such a coating could reduce the pore size of these nanofiltration membranes to great extent for effectively screening the humic substances with enhanced rejection specifically the coated nanofiltration membrane tam 3 exhibited a rejection of 99 32 0 18 to humic substances after a 15 s coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex however the surface coated nanofiltration membranes yielded a very slight enhancement in the rejection of humic substances i e plateau in the rejection through prolonging the coating duration as no significant reduction in membrane pore size was observed fig 4 a thereby the extremely rapid coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex for the nanofiltration membranes was superior to retain the humic substances which is favorable for large scale production of advanced nanofiltration membranes in practice on the other hand the negative charge was still loaded onto membrane surfaces which facilitated these surface coated nanofiltration membranes for salt screening via electrostatic repulsion force fig 6 b nevertheless the nanofiltration membranes exhibited a considerably low rejection to inorganic salts 7 32 10 52 although the membrane pore size was tremendously shrunk with the coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer this is mainly ascribed to the decreasing negative charge density with the increasing coordination complex coating duration supplementary fig s2a which in turn diminishes the electrostatic repulsion effect for ions in addition the nanofiltration membranes with rapidly coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex yielded the strong stability and robustness as indicated by the consistently high rejection of humic substances and salt permeation during a long term operation supplementary fig s3 possessing a great promise in fractionation of humic substances and salts from the llc in view of advanced sustainability obviously the surface coated nanofiltration membranes experienced a reduced permeation flux during the filtration of the llc fig 6 c attributed to the deposition of humic substances onto the membrane surface or pore structure which could inevitably elevate the membrane hydraulic resistance however the surface coated nanofiltration membranes experienced a less significant reduction in permeation flux during the filtration of the llc compared to that during the filtration of pure water in fig 4 b specifically the tam 3 nanofiltration membrane displayed a less pronounced flux decline i e 5 1 than the pristine loose nanofiltration substrate i e 6 2 tam 0 plausibly attributed to the increasing hydrophilicity derived from the hydrophilic group i e oh in tannic acid supplementary fig s2b additionally the reduced pore size of the coated nanofiltration membranes could hinder the foulant e g humic substances entering the pore structure thus alleviating the membrane fouling therefore the coated nanofiltration membranes e g tam 3 exhibited the acceptably high permeation flux e g 11 97 0 57 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for practical application in sustainable management of the llc 3 6 nanofiltration diafiltration of landfill leachate concentrate for extraction of pure humic substances the nanofiltration membrane coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex provides a potential feasibility to fractionate the humic substances and inorganic salts from the llc therefore the nanofiltration diafiltration process including a pre concentration step and a diafiltration step based on the tam 3 membrane was performed to purify and extract the humic substances from the llc as a purpose of green fertilizer for plant proliferation and growth fig 7 initially the pre concentration step through the tam 3 nanofiltration membrane was conducted to minimize the feed volume and thus enrich the humic substances during the filtration of the llc as indicated in fig 7 a the tam 3 membrane experienced a reduced flux with increasing concentration factor during the pre concentration step which is strongly attributed to the steady evolution of the cake layer caused by the accumulation of humic substances onto the membrane surface for enhancing hydraulic resistance and thus hindering the water permeation to large extent the permeation flux of the tam 3 membrane monotonically declined from 71 3 to 40 4 l m 2 h 1 as the concentration factor increased to 7 8 furthermore the content of the humic substances in the feed linearly increased from 1837 to 14277 mg l 1 which is critically related to the concentration factor fig 7 b this is due to the extremely high retention of humic substances i e 99 34 99 65 for the tam 3 membrane fig 7 e simultaneously the concentration of inorganic salts slightly increased from 5658 to 6965 mg l 1 due to the low salt rejection i e 10 5 11 7 which minimized the accumulation of the salts in the feed during the pre concentration step in particular the concentration of primary ions i e na k and cl increased by 17 0 i e from 1318 to 1542 mg l 1 17 9 i e from 1004 to 1184 mg l 1 and 16 1 i e from 2921 to 3392 mg l 1 respectively fig 7 c given that the tam 3 membrane provided a high retention to humic substances and allowed for a fast salt permeation the effective fractionation of humic substances and inorganic salts can be potentially achieved subsequently the diafiltration step was further performed to purify and extract the humic substances in the pre treated llc derived from the pre concentration step as indicated in fig 7 a the tam 3 membrane exhibited an increasing permeation flux with the addition of pure water at increasing diavolumes mainly ascribed to the fact that the decreasing salt concentration would significantly diminish the osmosis pressure difference between two sides of the membrane and enhance the driving force for water permeation the permeation flux of the tam 3 membrane increased from 40 4 to 61 3 l m 2 h 1 showing an acceptably high permeation flux for practical application furthermore the content of humic substances in the feed slightly decreased from 14 277 to 13 970 mg l 1 fig 7 b after the addition of pure water with 8 0 diavolumes yielding a 96 6 recovery of humic substances during this diafiltration step such a sufficient recovery of humic substances is due to the enhanced rejection of humic substances 99 65 99 74 which induces an insignificant loss of humic substances from the nanofiltration permeate fig 7 d additionally the content of inorganic salts reduced from 5658 3 to 153 8 mg l 1 with a 99 65 desalination efficiency such a desalination efficiency not only demonstrates the outstanding fractionation efficacy of the tam 3 membrane for humic substances and inorganic salts in the llc but also facilitates to purify the humic substances in this case the humic substances yielded a 98 91 purity after the addition of pure water with 8 0 diavolumes showing a great potential as green fertilizer for plant growth 4 conclusions this study demonstrates a highly efficient one step rapid coating method based on tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating to engineer high performance nanofiltration membranes the results provide significant and practical guidelines of these advanced nanofiltration membranes for sustainable resource recovery from the llc with the following conclusions a homogeneous and stable tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating was evolved and completed within 1 min onto a loose nanofiltration substrate to tailor the membrane surface

16658,sustainable treatment of the highly saline landfill leachate concentrate for application as green fertilizer calls for effective fractionation of the existing humic substances and inorganic salts advanced selective nanofiltration membranes are proposed for this one step rapid assembly of a tannic acid fe3 coordination complex is a promising strategy to endow the membranes with an enhanced nanofiltration performance in this study a robust and homogeneous tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer was effectively coated onto the surface of a loose nanofiltration substrate in an extremely short time 15 s after the coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer the nanofiltration membrane showed a significantly reduced molecule weight cutoff i e reduction from 601 to 279 da and thus enhanced selectivity towards humic substances specifically the rejection to humic substances of the coated nanofiltration membrane increased from 95 31 0 54 to 99 32 0 18 with negligible rise in salt rejection demonstrating an enhanced fractionation efficacy for humic substances and salts assisted by a diafiltration operation with the coated nanofiltration membrane humic substances in the landfill leachate concentrate were effectively purified and extracted with 96 60 recovery particularly the humic substances were linearly enriched by ca 7 8 folds i e from 1837 to 13970 mg l 1 with a purity of 98 91 for potential application as liquid fertilizer the one step rapid tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating exhibits an impressive efficacy to engineer advanced nanofiltration membranes that could be applied at a large scale for sustainable resource extraction from landfill leachate concentrate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tannic acid fe3 complexes nanofiltration membranes landfill leachate concentrate fractionation humic substances sustainable resource extraction 1 introduction landfill leachate has become a global environmental concern as an intrinsic consequence of the disposal of solid waste by landfilling particularly landfill leachate is highly loaded with extremely toxic compounds e g ammonia heavy metals salts and recalcitrant organics posing a detrimental harm to the eco system and human health yuan et al 2017 yi et al 2017 aftab et al 2019 the combination of membrane bioreactor with nanofiltration is a prevalent strategy for effective treatment of landfill leachate removing the biodegradable organics and heavy metals to minimize the toxicity of landfill leachate to great extent ahmed and lan 2012 hu et al 2018 however the landfill leachate concentrate lcc that is inevitably generated from this hybrid membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration process contains refractory organics i e humic substances and inorganic salts at high concentrations emerging as a tough technical challenge from the perspective of circular economy the humic substances present in lcc stream can be used as fertilizers to promote the plant propagation and growth which enables the llc to be a potentially recyclable resource iskander et al 2019 ye et al 2019 unfortunately the conventional approaches e g coagulation long et al 2017 evaporation hendrych et al 2019 and advanced oxidation chen et al 2019 el kateb et al 2019 not only involve high energy consumption and operational cost but also fail to extract the humic substances since they are removed or degraded compromising the sustainable management of llc in order to sustainably recover the humic substances as a useful source of nutrients it is of great significance to purify them by effective separation from the inorganic salts that are also present in the llc stream nanofiltration membranes are increasingly emerging as an important tool to fractionate the organic compounds and inorganic salts via the synergistic effect of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion chen et al 2018 lin et al 2015 chen et al 2019 liu et al 2015 tan et al 2018 generally nanofiltration membranes typically have molecular weight cutoffs mwcos of 200 1000 da and can potentially retain humic substances with small molecular weights unfortunately most commercial nanofiltration membranes with polyamide chemistry e g nf90 dow filmtec df90 origin water utc 60 toray nt103 microdyn nadir have considerably dense surface structure mwcos 500 da and high charge density yielding a low transmission for inorganic salts and thus tremendously jeopardizing the separation efficacy of organic compounds i e humic substances and inorganic salts with reduced permeation flux van der bruggen et al 2004 chen et al 2018 van der bruggen et al 2001 alternatively loose nanofiltration membranes show larger pore size for high salt permeation zhao and wang 2017 cheng et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 however the moderate retention of humic substances for loose nanofiltration membranes could lead to a considerable loss of humic substances compromising the resource recovery from the llc stream ye et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to develop advanced nanofiltration membranes with enhanced permselectivity by tailoring their surface structural morphology and property membrane surface engineering is established as a useful method to elevate the nanofiltration performance by tailoring the membrane morphology and property choudhury et al 2018 ng et al 2013 unfortunately conventional surface modification methods such as nanoparticle nanosheet incorporation uv plasma induced grafting covalent coupling and layer by layer adsorption need sophisticated procedures to immobilize the nanomaterials or functional chemical groups onto the selective layer of the target membranes additionally the dopamine based bio inspired coating has attracted increasing interest for surface engineering to construct advanced membranes you et al 2018 xi et al 2009 guo et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 however the extremely low self polymerization kinetics of dopamine limits its potential application in large scale production of high performance membranes zhao et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 in this study one step rapid assembly 15 s of metal organic coordination based on tannic acid fe3 complexes onto a loose nanofiltration substrate was conducted to enhance its separation performance for sustainable treatment of the llc stream such a rapid tannic acid fe3 complex coating conferred the surface coated nanofiltration membrane with enhanced fractionation of humic substances and inorganic salts specifically the effect of this coordination complex coating on the membrane properties was comprehensively explored through surface morphology scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy chemical composition x ray photoelectron spectroscopy wettability water contact angle surface charge zeta potential and pore size mwco subsequently the potential of the surface coated nanofiltration membrane in separation of humic substances and inorganic salts was evaluated along with its long term operation stability finally a diafiltration process consisting of a pre concentration step and a constant volume diafiltration step based on the coated nanofiltration membrane was applied to enrich purify and extract the humic substances from llc for green fertilizer application this study demonstrates the superiority of the one step rapid tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating to tailor make the advanced nanofiltration membranes at a large scale for sustainable management of highly saline wastewaters such as llc 2 experimental 2 1 membranes and chemicals a thin film composite nanofiltration membrane with poly piperazine amide surface chemistry purchased from yinachuan environmental science technology co ltd guangdong china was applied as the substrate for membrane modification due to its loose surface structure mwco of 601 da the properties of this loose nanofiltration substrate are shown in the supplementary table s1 tannic acid and ferric chloride fecl3 with analytic grade were supplied from aladdin china for surface coating by metal organic coordination complexes onto the loose nanofiltration substrate nacl and kcl with purity of 99 99 were ordered from aladdin china for testing the membrane performance ultrapure water from a milli q system was used throughout the experiments the llc derived from the hybrid membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration process was taken from a municipal solid waste landfill and applied as feed for filtration experiment the biodegradable organic species and heavy metals can be removed during the hybrid membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration process humic substances as refractory organic compounds were merely remained in the llc which can be potentially extracted as organic fertilizer for plant growth atiyeh et al 2002 nardi et al 2002 arancon et al 2006 the main compounds in the llc are listed in table 1 2 2 membrane coating by metal organic coordination complexes in order to enhance the nanofiltration performance through tailoring the surface properties the loose nanofiltration substrate was coated by metal organic coordination complexes fig 1 before the surface coating the loose nanofiltration substrate was fully rinsed with pure water to remove the impurities on its surface after the water rinsing the loose nanofiltration substrate coupon with a diameter of 12 cm was firmly fixed in a round custom designed mould ensuring the complete exposure of the membrane surface with the coating solution next 20 ml of ferric chloride fecl3 solution 12 0 mmol l 1 was poured into the round mould for 2 min subsequently 20 ml tannic acid solution 2 4 mmol l 1 was added for membrane coating under shaking condition at room temperature the coating duration for the loose nanofiltration substrate was set at 0 5 10 15 30 and 60 s respectively finally the surface coated nanofiltration membranes were taken from the round mould for complete rinsing with pure water the resultant nanofiltration membranes were denoted as tam 0 tam 1 tam 2 tam 3 tam 4 and tam 5 respectively 2 3 membrane characterization the surface morphology of the coated nanofiltration membranes was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem with a hitachi su8010 japan field emission scanning electron microscope at a voltage of 5 kv and a magnification of 50 000 moreover atomic force microscopy afm from bruker dimension icon was applied to investigate the surface roughness of the coated membranes at a scanning area of 3 0 μm 3 0 μm based on root mean squared roughness r rms x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was applied to explore the chemical elements of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes which was performed with esca lab 250 xps analyzer using a mono x ray source al kα excitation of 1486 6 ev energy dispersive spectrometer eds was also applied to investigate the distribution of the chemical elements on membrane surfaces using a hitachi su8010 field emission scanning electron microscope the water contact angle measurement using an optical surface analyzer osa200 ningbo scientific instruments co ltd china was undertaken to assess the wettability of the coated nanofiltration membranes a surpass electrokinetic analyzer anton paar gmbh austria was applied to determine the surface charge of the nanofiltration membranes in a 10 mmol l 1 nacl electrolyte at ph 6 5 2 4 pore size the pore size of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes was studied through filtration of 0 1 g l 1 aqueous polyethylene glycol solutions i e molecular weight of 200 300 400 600 or 1000 da at a pressure of 6 bar the rejection coefficient r of polyethylene glycol polymers for the nanofiltration membranes was determined through their concentrations in the feed c f and permeate c p using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu as shown in eq 1 1 r 1 c p c f afterwards a log normal probability density function between the stokes diameter d p of the polyethylene glycol polymers and their rejection coefficients was used to quantify the membrane pore size distribution as displayed in eq 2 kong et al 2016 cheng et al 2015 ye et al 2019 2020 2 d r d p d d p 1 d p ln σ p 2 π exp ln d p ln μ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where μ p denotes the mean effective pore size of the coated nanofiltration membranes as determined at r of 50 and σ p is the geometric standard deviation for pore size defined as ratio of the pore size at r of 84 13 to μ p specifically the stokes diameter d p of the polyethylene glycol polymers was determined via their molecular weights mw which is shown in eq 3 ye et al 2020 3 d p 33 46 10 12 m w 0 557 the mwco of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes can be eventually calculated through the obtained stokes diameter at r of 90 by eq 3 2 5 separation performance 2 5 1 separation of pure salt solutions separation performance of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes was investigated in a cross flow filtration setup at lab scale lin et al 2016 before the filtration experiment the surface coated nanofiltration membranes were pre pressurized through filtrating the pure water at 6 bar to achieve a stable water permeation afterwards the filtration of the pure salt solutions i e nacl or kcl with different contents 0 1 1 0 and 5 0 g l 1 was conducted at 6 bar to investigate the salt rejection of the coated nanofiltration membranes particularly the retentate and permeate were recirculated into the feed to maintain the salt concentration constant 2 5 2 filtration of landfill leachate concentrate filtration of the llc solution was carried out at 6 bar to evaluate the applicability of the coated nanofiltration membranes in separation of humic substances and inorganic salts each filtration of llc was repeated 3 times furthermore the filtration of llc with a 120 h duration was performed to assess the long term stability of the surface coated nanofiltration membranes 2 6 diafiltration of landfill leachate concentrate for extraction of humic substances a diafiltration process based on the coated nanofiltration membrane consisting of a pre concentration step and a constant volume diafiltration step was performed to extract the highly pure humic substances from the llc for purpose of natural fertilizer typically 5000 ml of llc sample was pre concentrated by a factor of 7 8 to minimize the feed volume for enrichment of humic substances afterwards the constant volume diafiltration step was further initiated for desalination and purification of the humic substances through the addition of pure water into the feed at different diavolumes up to 8 0 diavolumes the nanofiltration diafiltration experiment was performed at 6 bar the permeation flux j and solute rejection r s of the coated nanofiltration membrane were determined as follows 4 j v a δ t 5 r s c c p c 100 where v presents the volume of collected permeate a denotes the effective area of the coated nanofiltration membrane and t is the time for permeate collection c or c p is the concentration of humic substances or inorganic salts in the feed or permeate respectively 2 7 analytical methods the concentration of humic substances was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu the concentration of anions i e cl and no3 and cations i e na k ca2 and mg2 was quantified by ion chromatography metrohm 881 compact ic pro swiss and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy perkin elmer optima 3000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface composition and morphology in order to evaluate the efficacy of surface coating with the tannic acid fe3 coordination complexes the surface composition of the coated nanofiltration membranes was analyzed by xps measurement fig 2 as indicated in fig 2 a the pristine loose nanofiltration substrate has a white surface pattern after rapid exposure in tannic acid fe3 coordination complex solution the coated nanofiltration membranes have evenly light purple surface indicating the successful and effective coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex onto the membrane surface which can be also reflected through the elemental composition of membrane surfaces as demonstrated by xps analysis in fig 2 b two unique peaks centered at the binding energy of 710 and 722 ev which were assigned to fe 2p can be exclusively observed on the coated nanofiltration membranes apart from the common o 1s 529 ev n 1s 397 ev and c 1s 282 ev peaks in addition the coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex onto membrane surfaces evolved with increasing exposure duration as demonstrated by the increasingly darkening color pattern of the coated membrane surfaces fig 2 a in particular the coated nanofiltration membranes yielded an enhanced intensity in the peak of o 1s but a reduced intensity in the peak of n 1s during xps measurement fig 2 b since the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer was gradually covered onto the membrane surfaces where a higher atomic percentage of oxygen o element was contained in tannic acid molecule without nitrogen n element the sem and afm analyses were performed to visualize the morphology of the nanofiltration membranes after coating with tannic acid fe3 coordination complexes fig 3 as demonstrated in fig 3 the pristine nanofiltration substrate with poly piperazine amide chemistry has an evenly discrete spotted structure on the nanoscale resulting in a loose but smooth surface with a considerably low roughness 11 5 0 3 nm after the exposure into a tannic acid fe3 mixed solution the loose nanofiltration substrate was rapidly coated with the thin layer of tannic acid fe3 coordination complexes allowing for the coverage of the pore structure this would potentially lead to a reduction in membrane pore size which thus enhances the selectivity to the organic solutes as the coating duration extended an increasingly thick layer of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex was deposited onto the membrane surface however this coordination complex layer has no significant alteration on the surface morphology of the coated nanofiltration membranes yielding a slight boost in surface roughness to 18 8 0 9 nm such a negligible increase in surface roughness demonstrates a thin but homogeneous tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating which can be also confirmed by eds measurement supplementary fig s1 3 3 pore size and water permeability pore size and water permeability are key performance properties to demonstrate the permselectivity of the nanofiltration membranes for organic solutes the pore size and water permeability of the nanofiltration membranes after coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex are shown in fig 4 as observed in fig 4 the loose nanofiltration substrate i e tam 0 has an mwco of 601 da yielding a pure water permeability of 16 76 0 85 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 this is due to the fact that the loose surface structure of the pristine nanofiltration substrate creates excessive nano channels for water transport conversely resulting in a reduced selectivity towards organic solutes after the coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex an increasingly narrow and even pore size distribution can be anticipated for these coated nanofiltration membranes which is reflected by the reduced mwco and geometric standard deviation for pore size σ p specifically the mwco of the coated nanofiltration membrane tam 1 was declined to 423 da after a 5 s coating indicating the impressive efficacy of this coordination complex coating in bridging the loose cavity structure on the membrane surface for enhanced solute selectivity this is consistent with the membrane morphology observed in the sem images fig 3 on the other hand such a coordination complex coating also lead to an enhancement in the intrinsic hydraulic resistance of the membranes compromising the water permeation with a 15 s coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex a remarkable reduction in membrane pore size i e mwco of 279 da was found along with the permeability of 12 62 0 69 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 as the coating duration further prolonged the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer was readily evolved on the loose nanofiltration substrate resulting in a mwco of 265 da in the 60 s coating duration nevertheless the increasing thickness of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer and reduced pore size further boosted the intrinsic hydraulic resistance of the coated nanofiltration membranes based on the hagen poiseuille equation liu et al 2015 chen et al 2018 experiencing a considerably low permeability of 6 53 0 57 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 3 4 filtration of salt solutions a high transmission of inorganic salts is of vital importance in the separation of humic substances and inorganic salts for achieving the sustainable treatment of llc the separation performance of the coated nanofiltration membranes in the pure salt solutions i e nacl or kcl is shown in fig 5 as illustrated in fig 5 the pristine nanofiltration substrate shows a considerable low rejection to both nacl and kcl i e 12 35 2 03 for 1 0 g l 1 nacl 9 33 0 94 for 1 0 g l 1 kcl although the negative charges were highly loaded on the membrane surface due to its loose surface structure diminished the electrostatic repulsion against ions allowing for a high salt permeation after coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer the resultant nanofiltration membranes had a monotonically enhanced rejection for salts specifically as the exposure duration in the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex solution increased to 60 s the rejection of nacl and kcl for the coated nanofiltration membrane i e tam 5 increased to 27 35 3 18 and 21 24 3 36 respectively on the one hand the negative charge density on the coated membrane surface was diminished as reflected by reduced surface zeta potential supplementary fig s2a which would diminish the electrostatic repulsion to the ions for reducing salt rejection on the other hand the reduced pore size of the nanofiltration membranes via the coordination complex coating would further intensify the size exclusion effect for retaining the salts jiang et al 2018 ye et al 2020 therefore the observed rejection of salts for the coated nanofiltration membranes is the sum of these two opposing effects and therefore is determined by the extent of each effect additionally when the salt concentration increased from 0 1 to 5 0 g l 1 during the filtration of the nacl or kcl solution a significant reduction in salt rejection for all the nanofiltration membranes was found ascribed to the fact that the increasing salt concentration could jeopardize the electrostatic repulsion via suppressing the debye length to promote the salt permeation ye et al 2019 liu et al 2015 such a merit of low salt rejection for the nanofiltration membranes coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer not only minimizes the osmosis pressure for enhanced permeation flux but also potentially improves the selectivity between the organic compounds and inorganic salts during the filtration of the highly saline solutions 3 5 filtration of landfill leachate concentrate in order to investigate the efficacy of the nanofiltration membranes coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex in fractionation of humic substances and salts the membrane filtration performance in llc was studied fig 6 due to the considerably large pore size the humic substances with small molecular weights would easily penetrate through the loose nanofiltration substrate i e tam 0 thus resulting in a loss along with the nanofiltration permeate as indicated in fig 6 a an insufficient rejection of 95 31 0 54 for humic substances was observed for the loose nanofiltration substrate which would compromise the fractionation of humic substances and salts in the llc as expected the coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex conferred the fabricated nanofiltration membranes with a remarkably enhanced retention to the humic substances since such a coating could reduce the pore size of these nanofiltration membranes to great extent for effectively screening the humic substances with enhanced rejection specifically the coated nanofiltration membrane tam 3 exhibited a rejection of 99 32 0 18 to humic substances after a 15 s coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex however the surface coated nanofiltration membranes yielded a very slight enhancement in the rejection of humic substances i e plateau in the rejection through prolonging the coating duration as no significant reduction in membrane pore size was observed fig 4 a thereby the extremely rapid coating of tannic acid fe3 coordination complex for the nanofiltration membranes was superior to retain the humic substances which is favorable for large scale production of advanced nanofiltration membranes in practice on the other hand the negative charge was still loaded onto membrane surfaces which facilitated these surface coated nanofiltration membranes for salt screening via electrostatic repulsion force fig 6 b nevertheless the nanofiltration membranes exhibited a considerably low rejection to inorganic salts 7 32 10 52 although the membrane pore size was tremendously shrunk with the coating of the tannic acid fe3 coordination complex layer this is mainly ascribed to the decreasing negative charge density with the increasing coordination complex coating duration supplementary fig s2a which in turn diminishes the electrostatic repulsion effect for ions in addition the nanofiltration membranes with rapidly coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex yielded the strong stability and robustness as indicated by the consistently high rejection of humic substances and salt permeation during a long term operation supplementary fig s3 possessing a great promise in fractionation of humic substances and salts from the llc in view of advanced sustainability obviously the surface coated nanofiltration membranes experienced a reduced permeation flux during the filtration of the llc fig 6 c attributed to the deposition of humic substances onto the membrane surface or pore structure which could inevitably elevate the membrane hydraulic resistance however the surface coated nanofiltration membranes experienced a less significant reduction in permeation flux during the filtration of the llc compared to that during the filtration of pure water in fig 4 b specifically the tam 3 nanofiltration membrane displayed a less pronounced flux decline i e 5 1 than the pristine loose nanofiltration substrate i e 6 2 tam 0 plausibly attributed to the increasing hydrophilicity derived from the hydrophilic group i e oh in tannic acid supplementary fig s2b additionally the reduced pore size of the coated nanofiltration membranes could hinder the foulant e g humic substances entering the pore structure thus alleviating the membrane fouling therefore the coated nanofiltration membranes e g tam 3 exhibited the acceptably high permeation flux e g 11 97 0 57 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for practical application in sustainable management of the llc 3 6 nanofiltration diafiltration of landfill leachate concentrate for extraction of pure humic substances the nanofiltration membrane coated by tannic acid fe3 coordination complex provides a potential feasibility to fractionate the humic substances and inorganic salts from the llc therefore the nanofiltration diafiltration process including a pre concentration step and a diafiltration step based on the tam 3 membrane was performed to purify and extract the humic substances from the llc as a purpose of green fertilizer for plant proliferation and growth fig 7 initially the pre concentration step through the tam 3 nanofiltration membrane was conducted to minimize the feed volume and thus enrich the humic substances during the filtration of the llc as indicated in fig 7 a the tam 3 membrane experienced a reduced flux with increasing concentration factor during the pre concentration step which is strongly attributed to the steady evolution of the cake layer caused by the accumulation of humic substances onto the membrane surface for enhancing hydraulic resistance and thus hindering the water permeation to large extent the permeation flux of the tam 3 membrane monotonically declined from 71 3 to 40 4 l m 2 h 1 as the concentration factor increased to 7 8 furthermore the content of the humic substances in the feed linearly increased from 1837 to 14277 mg l 1 which is critically related to the concentration factor fig 7 b this is due to the extremely high retention of humic substances i e 99 34 99 65 for the tam 3 membrane fig 7 e simultaneously the concentration of inorganic salts slightly increased from 5658 to 6965 mg l 1 due to the low salt rejection i e 10 5 11 7 which minimized the accumulation of the salts in the feed during the pre concentration step in particular the concentration of primary ions i e na k and cl increased by 17 0 i e from 1318 to 1542 mg l 1 17 9 i e from 1004 to 1184 mg l 1 and 16 1 i e from 2921 to 3392 mg l 1 respectively fig 7 c given that the tam 3 membrane provided a high retention to humic substances and allowed for a fast salt permeation the effective fractionation of humic substances and inorganic salts can be potentially achieved subsequently the diafiltration step was further performed to purify and extract the humic substances in the pre treated llc derived from the pre concentration step as indicated in fig 7 a the tam 3 membrane exhibited an increasing permeation flux with the addition of pure water at increasing diavolumes mainly ascribed to the fact that the decreasing salt concentration would significantly diminish the osmosis pressure difference between two sides of the membrane and enhance the driving force for water permeation the permeation flux of the tam 3 membrane increased from 40 4 to 61 3 l m 2 h 1 showing an acceptably high permeation flux for practical application furthermore the content of humic substances in the feed slightly decreased from 14 277 to 13 970 mg l 1 fig 7 b after the addition of pure water with 8 0 diavolumes yielding a 96 6 recovery of humic substances during this diafiltration step such a sufficient recovery of humic substances is due to the enhanced rejection of humic substances 99 65 99 74 which induces an insignificant loss of humic substances from the nanofiltration permeate fig 7 d additionally the content of inorganic salts reduced from 5658 3 to 153 8 mg l 1 with a 99 65 desalination efficiency such a desalination efficiency not only demonstrates the outstanding fractionation efficacy of the tam 3 membrane for humic substances and inorganic salts in the llc but also facilitates to purify the humic substances in this case the humic substances yielded a 98 91 purity after the addition of pure water with 8 0 diavolumes showing a great potential as green fertilizer for plant growth 4 conclusions this study demonstrates a highly efficient one step rapid coating method based on tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating to engineer high performance nanofiltration membranes the results provide significant and practical guidelines of these advanced nanofiltration membranes for sustainable resource recovery from the llc with the following conclusions a homogeneous and stable tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating was evolved and completed within 1 min onto a loose nanofiltration substrate to tailor the membrane surface properties demonstrating the impressive efficacy of metal organic coordination complex coating for membrane modification after tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating onto the membrane surface the pore size of the nanofiltration membrane markedly reduced as reflected by the reduction of its molecule weight cutoff from 601 to 265 da significantly enhancing the selectivity between organic compounds and inorganic salts the extremely rapid tannic acid fe3 coordination complex coating at a duration of 15 s endowed the surface coated nanofiltration membrane i e tam 3 with an enhanced fractionation efficiency for humic substances and inorganic salts during the filtration of the llc specifically the tam 3 membrane displayed an almost complete rejection to humic substances i e 99 32 0 18 the integrated nanofiltration diafiltration process by the tam 3 membrane effectively purified and extracted the humic substances with 96 60 recovery from the llc as potential liquid fertilizer in particular the humic substances were enriched by ca 7 8 folds i e from 1837 to13970 mg l 1 with a purity of 98 91 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

reactivity of dom in water columns through altering water residence time and structure stubbins et al 2010 cory et al 2014 for instance in natural lakes and oceanic settings water stratification or external water mass intrusion would influence water structure and could isolate surface water from middle or bottom water leading to high variations in quantity e g concentrations decreasing of organic carbon and quality e g terrestrial humic like signature of dom along the surface to bottom water column gareis et al 2010 cory et al 2015 medeiros et al 2015a she et al 2021 in contrast to natural aquatic ecosystems reservoirs are one of the most far reaching human modifications of hydrological conditions of rivers and have a complicated water stratification regime due to hydrological management maavara et al 2020 compared with the investigation of nutrients and quantity of organic and inorganic carbon whether the hydrological management will affect the vertical characteristics i e from surface to bottom of dom chemistry is poorly understood yi et al 2021 which is particularly important considering the bottom drainage strategy of reservoirs reservoir water was drained from dam bottom to downstream maavara et al 2020 reservoir construction has been proved to affect the light conditions hydraulic retention time and relative water column stability rwcs resulting in different degrees of change in the transport and transformation of materials e g nutrients in different layers of the water column especially in deep tributaries with longer water retention time than the mainstream of reservoirs burford et al 2012 wang 2020 however systematic research on how reservoirs alter riverine dom chemistry in water columns remains lacking three gorges reservoir tgr the largest artificial reservoir in the world has influenced the ecosystem of the yangtze river watershed significantly with a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 and a watershed area of 1080 km2 with reservoir operation a semi lake semi river system has been formed e g he et al 2020 the hydrological management induces variations in the flow speed water level and water structure which complexs the regimes of water residence nutrient retention and sediment trapping hu et al 2013 dai and liu 2013 yang et al 2018 in particular the increase of water residence time and water depth amplifies primary productivity in surface water and reduces the proportion of photic zone in vertical profile which would enhance the biogeochemical heterogeneity in the water column yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 however it is still mysterious whether the tgr construction makes a significant impact on the vertical variation of dom in water columns and further on the biogeochemical and carbon cycles in reservoirs for the investigation of the complex composition of dom multiple complementary methods including optical and molecular techniques have been developed ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption and the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eems technique with parallel factor analysis eem parafac have been widely applied to depict the characteristics of dom in aquatic ecosystems jaffé et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 in recent decades fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been increasingly applied to track the sources of dom at the molecular level kujawinski et al 2004 melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 2021a the combination of the optical properties and molecular composition of dom could help to better qualitatively and quantitatively constrain its biogeochemical behaviors and provide a comprehensive understanding from the bulk to the molecular level stubbins et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 we selected xiangxi bay xxb to investigate the dom chemistry in water columns xxb is a large deep depth 50 m tributary of tgr in addition it is close to the three gorges dam and previous studies have successfully constrained its hydrologic model ji et al 2010 yang et al 2018 therefore xxb could provide a typical case for investigating how reservoir construction would affect the vertical evolution of dom chemistry in terms of the sampling strategy in addition to spatial sampling in surface middle and bottom layers of multiple sites which provides good coverage to constrain the dom sources across xxb we targeted a series of high resolution water column samples from a site with the deepest water depth to monitor dom vertical variations and explore the underlying mechanisms through the application of a series of approaches including bulk geochemical techniques uv vis eems and ft icr ms the objectives were to i characterize the property variation of dom in vertical profiles of xxb ii determine the role of reservoir

positive loadings of pc2 while c2 c4 is located on the negative loadings of pc2 the surface samples were separated from middle and bottom samples mainly based on pc1 which indicated that there were likely larger variations in molecular properties than in optical properties 3 4 the variation of bulk characteristics and dom chemistry along a high resolution vertical profile there were significant

sources identification of dom in xxb the material sources of inland water e g primary productivity riparian soil and sewage constrain the various possible dom sources in aquatic ecosystems e g autochthonous terrestrial and anthropogenic sources amon et al 2012 optical parameters preliminarily demonstrated the multiple sources of dom in xxb the range of fi 1 58 1 80 which has been widely used to classify dom sources with fi values of 1 9 as autochthonous microbial or algae derived with fi values of 1 4 as allochthonous terrestrially derived and with fi values of 1 4 1 9 as mixed sources suggested both allochthonous and autochthonous inputs of dom in tgr table s2 fellman et al 2010 the values of suva254 3 01 6 35 l mg c 1 m 1 and hix 0 48 0 79 also indicated that dom was derived from sources with a wide range of aromaticity and humification degree table s2 ohno et al 2007 in terms of molecular information the wide range of ai 0 22 0 28 and dbe 8 78 10 12 values which were used to assess the aromaticity and unsaturation degree further confirmed the multiple sources of dom table s4 dittmar et al 2008 two humic like components c1 and 3 which are widely found in lakes and estuaries have been proved to derive from terrestrial input table s2 stedmon and markager 2005 murphy et al 2014 furthermore the detection of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds by ft icr ms which were mainly related to vascular plant sourced organic matter and products of lignin degradation respectively also demonstrated the input of terrestrial organic matter seidel et al 2015 in terms of autochthonous input osburn et al 2016 have identified similar components with c4 and suggested that this component was associated with aquatic organisms production the detection of peptides and unsaturated aliphatics by ft icr ms indicated that bacterial and algal derived om contributed to dom in tgr as well table s6 seidel et al 2015 kellerman et al 2018 the protein like component c2 shared the similar eems peak region with wastewater sourced component c5 reported by murphy et al 2014 and cawley et al 2012 and indicated the anthropogenic input table s2 from the ft icr ms a series of chos compounds with o3s and o5s classes was detected which was previously detected as an indicator of anthropogenic input in anthropogenically perturbated waters including wastewater and associated with surfactants tables s4 s7 gonsior et al 2011 melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 4 2 transformation of dom along the vertical profile and the controlling mechanism optical and molecular properties preliminarily exhibited variations of dom chemistry with water depth there was a higher proportion of terrestrial derived dom and a lower proportion of autochthonous and anthropogenic derived dom in middle and bottom water compared to surface water figs 2 and s2 which was also supported by the principal component analysis fig s6 moreover the continuous evolution of dom chemistry was further assessed through the analysis of high resolution samples along the vertical profile the decreasing trends of bix c2 c4 h c ua peptides and increasing trends of hix c1 c3 o c m z ai dbe hu poly demonstrated that the aromaticity humification degree molecular weight and proportion of terrestrial sourced dom increased with water depth from 2 to 60 m whereas the proportion of autochthonous sourced dom decreased fig 4 table s8 various studies have proved the strong linkage between hydrology and dom chemistry he et al 2020 wang et al 2021a the hydrological model in xxb has been well established by ji et al 2010 which exhibited that the density current associated with water intrusion from mainstream to the tributary mainly induced the water stratification fig s1a b since the water in the mainstream is characterized by higher concentrations of k and ca2 the concentration variations of k and ca2 significant increasing trends from upstream to downstream for the middle and bottom water layers further confirm this hydrological model fig s1c h yang et al 2015 in addition no significant trends of concentrations of k and ca2 were observed for the surface water layer indicating that the water intrusion from mainstream to xxb was mainly constrained in the middle and bottom layers therefore integrated with the constrained water exchange model a conceptual model of dom dynamics was established to account for the vertical variations of dom chemistry in the water column fig 5 in the surface water layer 0 5 m the high primary productivity indicated by high concentrations of chla would devote to the enrichment of peptides and unsaturated aliphatics including chon2 chon3 chos compounds with high h c e g c15h16o11n2 c35h39o12n3 c16h24o7s1 henderson et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 ly et al 2017 he et al 2019 the depleted cho compounds with low o c were possibly associated with selective photodegradation of aromatic compounds stubbins et al 2010 chen et al 2014 he et al 2020 this is further supported by the detection of photodegradation produced compounds with high averaged h c but low ai m z and dbe table s9 fig s7a through comparison between surface formulas and photodegradation produced dom pool which was identified by the incubation experiment from our previous study wang et al 2021b supplementary method 1 7 table s10 therefore high autochthonous derived dom with low aromaticity humification degree and molecular weight was exhibited in the surface layer fig 4 in the middle water layer 5 30 m the reservoir operation induced density current drove mainstream water intrusion to xxb fig s1a b since the mainstream dom had a high terrestrial signal table s11 it increased the terrestrial signature of the middle water layer samples in xxb in addition polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds including cho compounds with high o c humification degree and aromaticity could be accumulated and enriched in middle layer water due to limited illumination induced photodegradation sunlit layer 5m stubbins et al 2010 he et al 2018 compared with the surface and middle layers previous studies have demonstrated that microbial carbon pump mcp functioned in deep water through biodegradation and devote to the long term accumulation of recalcitrant dom findlay et al 2003 jiao et al 2010 yi et al 2021 correspondingly the relatively lower averaged concentration of do than surface water and decrease of do with depth 30 60m support further oc mineralization in the bottom layer fig 3b therefore the high terrestrial signal of dom in bottom water might mainly result from biodegradation medeiros et al 2015b which agreed with the high relative abundance of biologically recalcitrant compounds including polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds besides the identification of various crams and biodegradation produced compounds with low h c high m z dbe and ai table s9 fig s7b through comparison between bottom formulas and biodegradation produced dom pool suggest active microbial carbon pump which also supported this point wang et al 2021b supplementary method 1 7 table s10 also the accumulation of terrestrial dom from the middle layer would partly devote to the high terrestrial signal of dom in bottom water previous studies have demonstrated that the variation of dom in the water column would be affected by a regime of water stratification loginova et al 2016 butturini et al 2020 yi et al 2021 in this work the linkage between dom chemistry and reservoir management induced rwcs the parameter applied to assess the degree of water stratification was confirmed by significant correlations between dom molecular composition i e various molecular parameters and rwcs fig s8 therefore the vertical heterogeneity of dom in the water column is shaped by reservoir construction which is likely a typical phenomenon present in multiple tributaries considering the widely observed density currents from the mainstream to tributaries of tgr during the water level rising period yang et al 2018 4 3 implications for carbon cycling and further considerations with the multiple bulk and molecular level techniques the dynamic process of dom in the vertical profile of tgr was illustrated fig 5 which was different from other aquatic ecosystems for instance the m z and ai of dom from surface to bottom layers of tgr here spanned wider ranges than those in lakes e g butturini et al 2020 m z 354 4 365 0 da ai 0 19 0 23 the composition structure e g the abundance of cho chon chos compounds of dom from surface to bottom varied oppositely with those observed in the ocean medeiros et al 2015b to assess this reservoir construction interrupted vertical dynamic of dom comprehensively the molecular comparison of dom quality in the water column between reservoirs and other natural aquatic ecosystems e g rivers and lakes was further evaluated based on dbe and m z fig 6 a significant positive correlation between dbe and m z was observed across reservoir river and lake ecosystems fig 6 interestingly the cluster of dom in the water column of tgr was separated from others for the higher m z and dbe values than in rivers and lakes indicating that the operation of tgr not only induced unique dom stratification but also shaped molecular composition into more unsaturation and recalcitrance and higher averaged molecular weight hansen et al 2016 which might be attributed to the variations in sources and transformation due to density currents and mcp due to reservoir construction induced water depth increasing jiao et al 2010 as the major form of reactive carbon dom played an important role in regional carbon cycling stedmon et al 2003 the reservoir construction induced vertical heterogeneity of dom thus exerts a non negligible influence on carbon processes the isolation of surface water from middle and bottom water results from density current decreases the material connection between surface and bottom fig s1a b yang et al 2018 thus the primary productivity related dom e g alga derived protein like compounds would be partially retained in surface water and drained downstream instead of depositing to the bottom since the deposition of organic matter in the surface water column would increase microbial activities in middle and bottom layers e g biodegradation jiao et al 2010 the interruption of vertical mixing would likely exclude surface dom from biodegradation in middle and bottom water and devote to the reduction of microbial activity related co2 production in the tributary moreover the addition of biodegradation resistant terrestrial dom would dilute the proportion of autochthonous dom in middle and bottom water which tends to be the substrate for heterotrophic microorganisms and reduce biodegradation related co2 production saadi et al 2006 hansen et al 2016 most of the terrestrial dom compounds brought by density current in the water column are aromatic with high molecular weight and environmental stability and tend to be well reserved in the water column catalán et al 2017 by adsorbing on particulate matter and flocculation with metal ions terrestrial dom compounds including c1 and 3 associated compounds polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds would devote to the accumulation of organic matter in water columns and sediments making a critical contribution to oc burial schmidt et al 2009 jacinthe et al 2012 reservoir construction has been proved to interrupt the carbon delivery of rivers 250 260 tg c yr 1 from land to ocean by a significant in situ carbon burial 26 tg c yr 1 with a complicated and unclarified mechanism maavara et al 2017 our observed vertical evolution of dom chemistry would devote to a better understanding of the carbon burial mechanism in reservoirs some limitations still exist in this study firstly this research was conducted during the water level rising period of tgr a seasonal investigation including the water level falling period highest and lowest water level periods of dom variation in the vertical profile is needed to better clarify the vertical dynamic of dom chemistry secondly particulate organic carbon poc also relates to oc burial in reservoirs but it is not constrained in this study although poc is usually characterized by significantly lower concentrations than doc in most inland waters the linkage between doc and poc and its contribution to the oc in sediments should be further explored he et al 2016 nevertheless by tracing the vertical evolution of dom chemistry a novel insight e g increase of dom recalcitrance with depth into carbon sequestration and burial during the water level rising period of tgr was noted in this work which would help to better constrain the carbon budget in inland waters concerning the global blooming of reservoirs the vertical evolution of dom chemistry which tightly links to carbon burial in reservoirs should be further explored in multiple reservoirs from different climatic regions grill et al 2019 5 conclusions this research demonstrates the effect of reservoir construction on the vertical heterogeneity of dom in a large and deep tributary of tgr during the water level rising period significant variations in dom chemistry including sources and composition among surface middle and bottom water in vertical profile were revealed by a series of complementary techniques higher terrestrial signal with more biologically recalcitrant dom and higher molecular weight in middle and bottom water than surface water was uncovered which was mainly resulted from reservoir construction induced physiochemical variations e g density currents considering the various carbon cycling processes are involved reservoir construction induced vertical heterogeneity of dom likely contributes to the reducing of co2 emission and the enhancement of organic carbon burial during the water level rising period the mechanism of the vertical profile variation of dom chemistry and its seasonal variability in reservoirs should be further explored for a better understanding of the

16659,reservoirs have boomed for clean energy in recent decades and interrupted the natural river ecosystem severely riverine dissolved organic matter dom which regulates aquatic food web dynamics water quality and carbon storage has been significantly impacted by reservoir construction however the vertical evolution of dom properties and its controlling mechanisms in large reservoirs with hydrological management are not well investigated limiting the understanding of carbon cycling e g co2 emissions and carbon burial in reservoirs to fill this knowledge gap multiple complementary techniques including optical spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry were applied to track composition and property changes of dom along the vertical profile in a large deep tributary of the world largest three gorges reservoir tgr during the water level rising period the results indicated that middle and bottom water have relatively more terrestrial input and recalcitrant dom while surface water has relatively more autochthonous input and labile dom integrated with the comprehensive analysis of dom chemistry in a high resolution vertical profile the primary production and photodegradation in surface water the density currents induced water intrusion from mainstream to tributaries in middle water and the biodegradation in bottom water are main factors controlling the vertical heterogeneity of reservoir dom during the water level rising period this vertical increase of dom recalcitrance likely contributes to the enhancement of organic carbon burial in tgr during the water level rising period all in all this study provides new insight into the vertical variations of riverine dom induced by reservoir construction and emphasizes the important role of reservoir construction in carbon sequestration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter vertical heterogeneity ft

reactivity of dom in water columns through altering water residence time and structure stubbins et al 2010 cory et al 2014 for instance in natural lakes and oceanic settings water stratification or

organic carbon and quality e g terrestrial humic like signature of dom along the surface to bottom water column gareis et al 2010 cory et al 2015 medeiros et al 2015a she et al 2021 in contrast to natural aquatic ecosystems reservoirs are one of the most far reaching human modifications of hydrological conditions of rivers and have a complicated water stratification regime due to hydrological management maavara et al 2020 compared with the investigation of nutrients and quantity of organic and inorganic carbon whether the hydrological management will affect the vertical characteristics i e from surface to bottom of dom chemistry is poorly understood yi et al 2021 which is particularly important considering the bottom drainage strategy of reservoirs reservoir water was drained from dam bottom to downstream maavara et al 2020 reservoir construction has been proved to affect the light conditions hydraulic retention time and relative water column stability rwcs resulting in different degrees of change in the transport and transformation of materials e g nutrients in different layers of the water column especially in deep tributaries with longer water retention time than the mainstream of reservoirs burford et al 2012 wang 2020 however systematic research on how reservoirs alter riverine dom chemistry in water columns remains lacking three gorges reservoir tgr the largest artificial reservoir in the world has influenced the ecosystem of the yangtze river watershed significantly with a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 and a watershed area of 1080 km2 with reservoir operation a semi lake semi river system has been formed e g he et al 2020 the hydrological management induces variations in the flow speed water level and water structure which complexs the regimes of water residence nutrient retention and sediment trapping hu et al 2013 dai and liu 2013 yang et al 2018 in particular the increase of water residence time and water depth amplifies primary productivity in surface water and reduces the proportion of photic zone in vertical profile which would enhance the biogeochemical heterogeneity in the water column yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 however it is still mysterious whether the tgr construction makes a significant impact on the vertical variation of dom in water columns and further on the biogeochemical and carbon cycles in reservoirs for the investigation of the complex composition of dom multiple complementary methods including optical and molecular techniques have been developed ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption and the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eems technique with parallel factor analysis eem parafac have been widely applied to depict the characteristics of dom in aquatic ecosystems jaffé et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 in recent decades fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been increasingly applied to track the sources of dom at the molecular level kujawinski et al 2004 melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 2021a the combination of the optical properties and molecular composition of dom could help to better qualitatively and quantitatively constrain its biogeochemical behaviors and provide a comprehensive understanding from the bulk to the molecular level stubbins et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 we selected xiangxi bay xxb to investigate the dom chemistry in water columns xxb is a large deep depth 50 m tributary of tgr in addition it is close to the three gorges dam and previous studies have successfully constrained its hydrologic model ji et al 2010 yang et al 2018 therefore xxb could provide a typical case for investigating how reservoir construction would affect the vertical evolution of dom chemistry in terms of the sampling strategy in addition to spatial sampling in surface middle and bottom layers of multiple sites which provides good coverage to constrain the dom sources across xxb we targeted a series of high resolution water column samples from a site with the deepest water depth to monitor dom vertical variations and explore the underlying mechanisms through the application of a series of approaches including bulk geochemical techniques uv vis eems and ft icr ms the objectives were to i characterize the property variation of dom in vertical profiles of xxb ii determine the role of reservoir

are located on the negative loadings of pc1 optical parameters tend to be mainly associated with pc2 humification and aromaticity associated optical parameters e g hix and suva254 are located on the positive loadings of pc2 while c2 c4 is located on the negative loadings of pc2 the surface samples were separated from middle and bottom samples mainly based on pc1 which indicated that there were likely larger variations in molecular properties than in optical properties 3 4 the variation of bulk characteristics and dom chemistry along a high resolution vertical profile there were significant

sources identification of dom in xxb the material sources of inland water e g primary productivity riparian soil and sewage constrain the various possible dom sources in aquatic ecosystems e g autochthonous terrestrial and anthropogenic sources amon et al 2012 optical parameters preliminarily demonstrated the multiple sources of dom in xxb the range of fi 1 58 1 80 which has been widely used to classify dom sources with fi values of 1 9 as autochthonous microbial or algae derived with fi values of 1 4 as allochthonous terrestrially derived and with fi values of 1 4 1 9 as mixed sources suggested both allochthonous and autochthonous inputs of dom in tgr table s2 fellman et al 2010 the values of suva254 3 01 6 35 l mg c 1 m 1 and hix 0 48 0 79 also indicated that dom was derived from sources with a wide range of aromaticity and humification degree table s2 ohno et al 2007 in terms of molecular information the wide range of ai 0 22 0 28 and dbe 8 78 10 12 values which were used to assess the aromaticity and unsaturation degree further confirmed the multiple sources of dom table s4 dittmar et al 2008 two humic like components c1 and 3 which are widely found in lakes and estuaries have been proved to derive from terrestrial input table s2 stedmon and markager 2005 murphy et al 2014 furthermore the detection of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds by ft icr ms which were mainly related to vascular plant sourced organic matter and products of lignin degradation respectively also demonstrated the input of terrestrial organic matter seidel et al 2015 in terms of autochthonous input osburn et al 2016 have identified similar components with c4 and suggested that this component was associated with aquatic organisms production the detection of peptides and unsaturated aliphatics by ft icr ms indicated that bacterial and algal derived om contributed to dom in tgr as well table s6 seidel et al 2015 kellerman et al 2018 the protein like component c2 shared the similar eems peak region with wastewater sourced component c5 reported by murphy et al 2014 and cawley et al 2012 and indicated the anthropogenic input table s2 from the ft icr ms a series of chos compounds with o3s and o5s classes was detected which was previously detected as an indicator of anthropogenic input in anthropogenically perturbated waters including wastewater and associated with surfactants tables s4 s7 gonsior et al 2011 melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 4 2 transformation of dom along the vertical profile and the controlling mechanism optical and molecular properties preliminarily exhibited variations of dom chemistry with water depth there was a higher proportion of terrestrial derived dom and a lower proportion of autochthonous and anthropogenic derived dom in middle and bottom water compared to surface water figs 2 and s2 which was also supported by the principal component analysis fig s6 moreover the continuous evolution of dom chemistry was further assessed through the analysis of high resolution samples along the vertical profile the decreasing trends of bix c2 c4 h c ua peptides and increasing trends of hix c1 c3 o c m z ai dbe hu poly demonstrated that the aromaticity humification degree molecular weight and proportion of terrestrial sourced dom increased with water depth from 2 to 60 m whereas the proportion of autochthonous sourced dom decreased fig 4 table s8 various studies have proved the strong linkage between hydrology and dom chemistry he et al 2020 wang et al 2021a the hydrological model in xxb has been well established by ji et al 2010 which exhibited that the density current associated with water intrusion from mainstream to the tributary mainly induced the water stratification fig s1a b since the water in the mainstream is characterized by higher concentrations of k and ca2 the concentration variations of k and ca2 significant increasing trends from upstream to downstream for the middle and bottom water layers further confirm this hydrological model fig s1c h yang et al 2015 in addition no significant trends of concentrations of k and ca2 were observed for the surface water layer indicating that the water intrusion from mainstream to xxb was mainly constrained in the middle and bottom layers therefore integrated with the constrained water exchange model a conceptual model of dom dynamics was established to account for the vertical variations of dom chemistry in the water column fig 5 in the surface water layer 0 5 m the high primary productivity indicated by high concentrations of chla would devote to the enrichment of peptides and unsaturated aliphatics including chon2 chon3 chos compounds with high h c e g c15h16o11n2 c35h39o12n3 c16h24o7s1 henderson et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 ly et al 2017 he et al 2019 the depleted cho compounds with low o c were possibly associated with selective photodegradation of aromatic compounds stubbins et al 2010 chen et al 2014 he et al 2020 this is further supported by the detection of photodegradation produced compounds with high averaged h c but low ai m z and dbe table s9 fig s7a through comparison between surface formulas and photodegradation produced dom pool which was identified by the incubation experiment from our previous study wang et al 2021b supplementary method 1 7 table s10 therefore high autochthonous derived dom with low aromaticity humification degree and molecular weight was exhibited in the surface layer fig 4 in the middle water layer 5 30 m the reservoir operation induced density current drove mainstream water intrusion to xxb fig s1a b since the mainstream dom had a high terrestrial signal table s11 it increased the terrestrial signature of the middle water layer samples in xxb in addition polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds including cho compounds with high o c humification degree and aromaticity could be accumulated and enriched in middle layer water due to limited illumination induced photodegradation sunlit layer 5m stubbins et al 2010 he et al 2018 compared with the surface and middle layers previous studies have demonstrated that microbial carbon pump mcp functioned in deep water through biodegradation and devote to the long term accumulation of recalcitrant dom findlay et al 2003 jiao et al 2010 yi et al 2021 correspondingly the relatively lower averaged concentration of do than surface water and decrease of do with depth 30 60m support further oc mineralization in the bottom layer fig 3b therefore the high terrestrial signal of dom in bottom water might mainly result from biodegradation medeiros et al 2015b which agreed with the high relative abundance of biologically recalcitrant compounds including polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds besides the identification of various crams and biodegradation produced compounds with low h c high m z dbe and ai table s9 fig s7b through comparison between bottom formulas and biodegradation produced dom pool suggest active microbial carbon pump which also supported this point wang et al 2021b supplementary method 1 7 table s10 also the accumulation of terrestrial dom from the middle layer would partly devote to the high terrestrial signal of dom in bottom water previous studies have demonstrated that the variation of dom in the water column would be affected by a regime of water stratification loginova et al 2016 butturini et al 2020 yi et al 2021 in this work the linkage between dom chemistry and reservoir management induced rwcs the parameter applied to assess the degree of water stratification was confirmed by significant correlations between dom molecular composition i e various molecular parameters and rwcs fig s8 therefore the vertical heterogeneity of dom in the water column is shaped by reservoir construction which is likely a typical phenomenon present in multiple tributaries considering the widely observed density currents from the mainstream to tributaries of tgr during the water level rising period yang et al 2018 4 3 implications for carbon cycling and further considerations with the multiple bulk and molecular level techniques the dynamic process of dom in the vertical profile of tgr was illustrated fig 5 which was different from other aquatic ecosystems for instance the m z and ai of dom from surface to bottom layers of tgr here spanned wider ranges than those in lakes e g butturini et al 2020 m z 354 4 365 0 da ai 0 19 0 23 the composition structure e g the abundance of cho chon chos compounds of dom from surface to bottom varied oppositely with those observed in the ocean medeiros et al 2015b to assess this reservoir construction interrupted vertical dynamic of dom comprehensively the molecular comparison of dom quality in the water column between reservoirs and other natural aquatic ecosystems e g rivers and lakes was further evaluated based on dbe and m z fig 6 a significant positive correlation between dbe and m z was observed across reservoir river and lake ecosystems fig 6 interestingly the cluster of dom in the water column of tgr was separated from others for the higher m z and dbe values than in rivers and lakes indicating that the operation of tgr not only induced unique dom stratification but also shaped molecular composition into more unsaturation and recalcitrance and higher averaged molecular weight hansen et al 2016 which might be attributed to the variations in sources and transformation due to density currents and mcp due to reservoir construction induced water depth increasing jiao et al 2010 as the major form of reactive carbon dom played an important role in regional carbon cycling stedmon et al 2003 the reservoir construction induced vertical heterogeneity of dom thus exerts a non negligible influence on carbon processes the isolation of surface water from middle and bottom water results from density current decreases the material connection between surface and bottom fig s1a b yang et al 2018 thus the primary productivity related dom e g alga derived protein like compounds would be partially retained in surface water and drained downstream instead of depositing to the bottom since the deposition of organic matter in the surface water column would increase microbial activities in middle and bottom layers e g biodegradation jiao et al 2010 the interruption of vertical mixing would likely exclude surface dom from biodegradation in middle and bottom water and devote to the reduction of microbial activity related co2 production in the tributary moreover the addition of biodegradation resistant terrestrial dom would dilute the proportion of autochthonous dom in middle and bottom water which tends to be the substrate for heterotrophic microorganisms and reduce biodegradation related co2 production saadi et al 2006 hansen et al 2016 most of the terrestrial dom compounds brought by density current in the water column are aromatic with high molecular weight and environmental stability and tend to be well reserved in the water column catalán et al 2017 by adsorbing on particulate matter and flocculation with metal ions terrestrial dom compounds including c1 and 3 associated compounds polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds would devote to the accumulation of organic matter in water columns and sediments making a critical contribution to oc burial schmidt et al 2009 jacinthe et al 2012 reservoir construction has been proved to interrupt the carbon delivery of rivers 250 260 tg c yr 1 from land to ocean by a significant in situ carbon burial 26 tg c yr 1 with a complicated and unclarified mechanism maavara et al 2017 our observed vertical evolution of dom chemistry would devote to a better understanding of the carbon burial mechanism in reservoirs some limitations still exist in this study firstly this research was conducted during the water level rising period of tgr a seasonal investigation including the water level falling period highest and lowest water level periods of dom variation in the vertical profile is needed to better clarify the vertical dynamic of dom chemistry secondly particulate organic carbon poc also relates to oc burial in reservoirs but it is not constrained in this study although poc is usually characterized by significantly lower concentrations than doc in most inland waters the linkage between doc and poc and its contribution to the oc in sediments should be further explored he et al 2016 nevertheless by tracing the vertical evolution of dom chemistry a novel insight e g increase of dom recalcitrance with depth into carbon sequestration and burial during the water level rising period of tgr was noted in this work which would help to better constrain the carbon budget in inland waters concerning the global blooming of reservoirs the vertical evolution of dom chemistry which tightly links to carbon burial in reservoirs should be further explored in multiple reservoirs from different climatic regions grill et al 2019 5 conclusions this research demonstrates the effect of reservoir construction on the vertical heterogeneity of dom in a large and deep tributary of tgr during the water level rising period significant variations in dom chemistry including sources and composition among surface middle and bottom water in vertical profile were revealed by a series of complementary techniques higher terrestrial signal with more biologically recalcitrant dom and higher molecular weight in middle and bottom water than surface water was uncovered which was mainly resulted from reservoir construction induced physiochemical variations e g density currents considering the various carbon cycling processes are involved reservoir construction induced vertical heterogeneity of dom likely contributes to the reducing of co2 emission and the enhancement of organic carbon burial during the water level rising period the mechanism of the vertical profile variation of dom chemistry and its seasonal variability in reservoirs should be further explored for a better understanding of the
