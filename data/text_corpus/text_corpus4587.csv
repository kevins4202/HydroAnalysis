22935,the flow of a weakly conductive fluid i e seawater can be controlled by electromagnetic forces which holds promising applications in the drag reduction in this paper a fully developed weakly conductive turbulent flow controlled by a space dependent electromagnetic force is investigated with direct numerical simulation dns methods for different reynolds numbers with the application of electromagnetic force the in depth relations among characteristic structures in the flow field mean reynolds shear stress and the effect of drag reduction for different reynolds numbers are discussed the numerical results indicate that the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures induced by electromagnetic force are generated with the optimal values of the amplitude and the wave number the reynolds shear stress is suppressed and the maximum of drag reduction is obtained with the effect of these structures however with the increase of reynolds number the wave number of optimal electromagnetic force increases resulting in the decrease of scale of the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures which leads to the decrease of the height of these vortex structures therefore the maximum rate of drag reduction decreases due to the decrease of the effective depth with the increase of reynolds number keywords flow control drag reduction electromagnetic force turbulent channel flow 1 introduction the boundary layer is produced on surfaces of moving objects in the viscous fluid which leads to deceleration vibration and instability especially in turbulent flow the friction drag significantly increases therefore many control approaches have been studied to modify the structures of the boundary layer which can decrease the friction drag of moving objects and have a wide applied prospect and great practical value in the navigation to improve propulsive efficiency energy loss and kinetic stability ghassemi and ghiasi 2008 yoon et al 2009 liu et al 2014 for flow control the active methods can be distinguished from passive methods by energy input the electromagnetic control has been considered as one of the most practical active methods due to the flexible design and easy installation auteri et al 2010 as early as the 1960s gailitis found that the boundary layer can be modified by electromagnetic actuators with alternating electrodes and magnets subsequently the control effects of streamwise vortexes in turbulence channel flow were investigated numerically by lim et al 1998 with electromagnetic force along the streamwise spanwise and wall normal respectively the results indicated that the streamwise vortexes can be suppressed by both the spanwise and wall normal electromagnetic force and the former had more remarkable effects in suppressing streamwise vortices jiménez and pinelli 2000 further found that the regenerating cycle mechanism of turbulence depends on the two structures i e quasi streamwise vortexes and streaks next satake and kasagi 1996 and du and karniadakis 2000 du et al 2002 studied the turbulent control by electromagnetic force with a spanwise wave traveling along streamwise direction they found that the number of initial near wall streak structures was decreased and instead a wide ribbon of low speed velocity is formed when parameters of electromagnetic force matched well which result in a drag reduction rate up to 30 lee and kim 2002 investigated the vorticity dynamics in the viscous sublayer with the application of electromagnetic force the results indicated that turbulent structure can be improved near the wall and the skin drag can also be decreased by suppressing the streamwise vortexes of viscous sublayers moreover the streamwise traveling and standing waves of velocity imposed at the walls of a plane turbulent channel flow were investigated by viotti et al 2009 and quadrio et al 2009 with dns methods they obtained drag reductions about 48 and 52 for traveling waves and standing waves respectively moubarak and antar 2012 and habchi and antar 2016 investigated two scales on the energy cascade in a two dimension 2d turbulent flow with electromagnetic force and found that there exists a linear relationship between the large scale motion in the atmosphere and the very small ones recently ostillamónico and lee 2017 calculated three dimension 3d turbulent with electromagnetic force by fully solving the navier stokes equations which were coupled with the poisson nernst planck equations the results showed that an ion concentration dependent viscosity led to the emergence of a quiescent layer of higher ion concentration and the presence of this layer could play a role in disrupting the turbulence generation cycle as one would expect that the turbulence was weaker in regions of higher viscosity thus potentially decreasing friction dns study for a fully developed turbulent channel flow was carried out by altıntaş and davidson 2016 with introducing a spanwise oscillating electromagnetic force near the lower wall they observed that the sweeps and ejections moved away from the wall in the fully turbulent region with the application of electromagnetic force the control effects of streamwise traveling wave and bidirectional wavy electromagnetic force to wall turbulence were also investigated by our research group huang et al 2010 2014 the results indicated that the negative streamwise vortex induced by electromagnetic force existed in the flow field with control which can suppress the inherent positive streamwise vortex and merge the inherent negative streamwise vortex in turbulent flow field therefore the number of streamwise vortexes and streaks in the flow field was decreased which further led to the decrease of skin drag the above mentioned studies indicate that the significant effects of turbulence control can be achieved by using electromagnetic force with spanwise oscillating or traveling wave however the characteristic structures of the steady flow field dependent on the distribution of the electromagnetic force including the variations of characteristic structures with the reynolds numbers cannot be obtained due to the time varying electromagnetic force therefore the more in depth studies about the structures of the flow field are necessary especially for different reynolds numbers in this paper the turbulent channel flow controlled by the space dependent electromagnetic force is investigated by dns with the fourier chebyshev spectral method the spanwise electromagnetic force with sinusoidal distribution along the streamwise direction is selected to control weakly conductive fluids the potential relations among characteristic structures in the flow field mean reynolds shear stress and the friction drag are studied the control effects are discussed firstly for re 4000 with different values of amplitude a and wave number k x the characteristic structures and their effects in flow field with the electromagnetic force are analyzed then the variations of these characteristic structures which lead to the variation of drag reduction are further discussed with the increase of reynolds number finally the in depth mechanisms are revealed between the structures of the flow field and the effects of drag reduction for different reynolds numbers 2 numerical calculations 2 1 governing equations based on the fully developed turbulent flow of a weakly conductive fluid i e seawater the flow can be controlled by electromagnetic actuators which are installed on the lower wall of the channel with the electromagnetic force imposed as a source term the dimensionless navier stokes equations of incompressible 3d channel flow can be written as 1 u t u u p 1 re 2 u f 2 u 0 here all variables are nondimensionalized with respect to the channel half width h and the centre line u c u is the velocity vector p is the pressure re u c h ν is the reynolds number with ν the kinematic viscosity coefficient and f is electromagnetic force given by 3 f 0 0 f z where 4 f z a e y δ sin 2 π l x k x x here f z is the spanwise electromagnetic force with sinusoidal distributions along the streamwise direction whose variation depends on space rather than time a is the nondimensional amplitude δ is the effective penetration of electromagnetic force huang et al 2010 and l x and k x are the channel length and wave number along the streamwise direction respectively where l x k x λ x is the streamwise wave length the standard fourier chebyshey spectral method is applied to spatial directions for eqs 1 and 2 with the periodic character of turbulent channel flow in the streamwise and spanwise directions the dealiased fourier method is applied in these two directions while the chebyshev tau method is used in the normal direction of the wall moreover the usual no slip and no penetration conditions are used on the wall zhao et al 2004 the time advancement is performed by a semi implicit back differentiation formula method with third order accuracy to eliminate residual divergence the pressure term and the linear term are solved with a chebyshev tau influence matrix method for the non linear term a spectral truncation method referred to as the 3 2 rule is employed to remove aliasing errors the computational domain is shown in fig 1 where the size of the streamwise normal and spanwise directions corresponds to 4π 3 2 2π 3 approximately 754 360 377 wall units respectively uniform grid spacing is employed in the streamwise and spanwise directions while the non uniform grid space is employed in the normal direction more details about the numerical methods can be found in huang et al 2010 2014 the turbulent channel flow is controlled with the application of electromagnetic force at t 300 when the initial disturbance induced for generating a fully developed turbulence has been essentially eliminated which is steady from t 500 to t 1000 the cases are selected with different reynolds numbers from re 4000 to 7000 2 2 friction drag and mean velocity along the streamwise direction in turbulent channel flow the reynolds decomposition is used in eq 1 in x direction one obtains 5 u t u u x u v y u w z p x 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2 u z 2 where u u y t u v v w w and p x t p here y is the distance from the lower wall u v and w are velocities along x y z directions respectively the overbar indicates the average value of corresponding plane for a constant y the superscript indicates the fluctuation t is the real time adjustment of pressure for keeping flow stable then we have 6 u t 2 u u x u u x u v y u w z u w z t p x 1 re 2 u y 2 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2 u z 2 based on the assumption of the periodic flow structures in the homogeneous directions fukagata et al 2002 and the no slip boundary conditions which are the basic characters of the turbulent wall bounded flow we average eq 6 by integrating the equation in x and z directions and have 7 u t u v y t 1 re 2 u y 2 integrating eq 7 from 0 to 1 in y direction with the friction drag coefficient defined as c f π w ρ u c 2 2 then 8 t 1 re u y w π w c f 2 substituting eq 8 into eq 7 we have 9 c f 2 y u v 1 re u y u t with the double integral 0 y 0 y f y d y d y of eq 9 one obtains 10 y 2 2 y 4 c f 0 y u v d y 1 re u 0 y 0 y u t d y d y with the streamwise velocity distribution of base flow u y 1 1 y 2 2 y y 2 we have 11 0 1 u d y 0 1 u y d y 2 3 then integrating eq 10 from 0 to 1 in y direction one obtains 12 c f 4 re 6 0 1 1 y u v d y 3 0 1 1 y 2 u t d y for the steady turbulence 13 u t 0 then the friction drag coefficient is obtained 14 c f 4 re 6 0 1 1 y u v d y the equation indicates that the friction drag coefficient is composed of two parts for the steady turbulent channel flow fukagata et al 2002 the first term is the laminar drag coefficient which depends on reynolds numbers the second term is the y weighted integration of u v which is the reynolds shear stress due to the ejection and sweep in the turbulence moreover substituting eq 12 into eq 10 one obtains 15 u 2 y y 2 re 0 y u v d y 3 2 re 2 y y 2 0 1 1 y u v d y re 0 y 0 y u t d y d y 3 4 re 2 y y 2 0 1 1 y 2 u t d y substituting u y 2 y y 2 into eq 15 we have this form 16 u u y re 0 y u v d y 3 2 re u y 0 1 1 y u v d y re 0 y 0 y u t d y d y 3 4 re u y 0 1 1 y 2 u t d y substituting eq 13 into eq 16 the average velocity along the streamwise direction can be obtained 17 u u y re 0 y u v d y 3 2 u y 0 1 1 y u v d y where the first term is the laminar velocity distribution resulting in the laminar drag i e the first term in eq 14 and the second term is related to the ejection and sweep in the turbulence resulting in the second term in eq 14 3 results and discussions 3 1 program verification for the sake of testing the code and algorithm the turbulent channel flow without control for re 4000 7000 are compared with the results from kim et al 1987 as shown in fig 2 our results indicate that the mean velocity profiles for re 4000 5000 6000 7000 in the paper correspond with those in kim et al 1987 and the classic wall law more details about the validation of the code can be found in huang et al 2010 2014 3 2 induced flow fields the induced flow field is a stable laminar flow field with the effect of electromagnetic force the spanwise electromagnetic force introduced in the paper is defined by eq 4 which is independent of time the spatial distribution of electromagnetic force for parameters k x 3 a 1 0 and δ 0 02 as a case is shown in fig 3 the electromagnetic force can induce spanwise motion in the conductive fluid and produce shear layers called stokes layer near the wall when the conductive fluid is affected by the electromagnetic force as a case of the laminar flow field for re 4000 the spanwise velocity distribution of the induced laminar flow field is presented in fig 4 where the red and blue areas refer to the positive and negative values respectively as a result of the main flow along the positive direction of x axis the distribution of spanwise velocity is inclined significantly to the downstream which is asymmetric but periodic with the electromagnetic force 3 3 modulated flow fields the streamwise vortexes and the streaks are basic elements of the near wall coherent structure in the turbulent flow the electromagnetic force in eq 4 is dependent of a and k x where a represents the amplitude of the force and k x the wave number along the streamwise direction therefore the different control effects are obtained with different values of parameters with the application of electromagnetic force for k x 3 the steady near wall flow fields for re 4000 for different amplitudes are shown in fig 5 the first second and third columns represent the distributions of the spanwise velocities at y 5 streaks at y 5 and vortex structures at y 0 100 together with red and blue areas representing positive and negative values respectively the distributions of spanwise velocities on the location y 5 are shown in the first column where red regions denote positive values and blue areas denote negative values a small amplitude and irregular distributions of velocities without control i e a 0 0 is shown in fig 5 a which describes the random characters of turbulent flow with the application of electromagnetic force in fig 5 b e the distributions of spanwise velocities shows an alternate positive negative character of which the period is equal to that of the electromagnetic force and the values of velocities increases with the increase of the electromagnetic force moreover the regularity of the spanwise velocity distributions increases firstly at a 1 0 which indicates the enhanced influences of the induced flow on the intrinsic flow then the regularity decreases a 1 0 due to the enhancement of the random fluctuations the optimal control effect is obtained at a 1 0 when the flow field is dominated by the induced flow the distributions of streak structures on the location y 5 are shown in the second column where red regions denote high speed streaks and blue areas denote low speed the streaks without control represent an alternating distribution along the spanwise direction and different lengths together with degree of curve which indicates the essential characters of coherent structure near the wall the sinusoidal distribution of streaks is obtained with control which has the same period with the electromagnetic force with the increase of a the intensity of streaks weakens first a 1 0 reaches the minimum at a 1 0 and then increases a 1 0 however the regularity of streaks enhances first a 1 0 reaches the optimal condition at a 1 0 and then weakens gradually a 1 0 due to the enhancement of the irregular streaks the distributions of vortex structures at y 0 100 are drawn by the imaginary part of complex eigenvalues of the velocity gradient tensor zhou et al 1999 these distributions are shown in the third column where red denotes positive values of streamwise vorticity and blue denotes negative a great number of irregular quasi streamwise vortices are presented without control however the distributions of quasi streamwise vortices are modified significantly due to the effect of electromagnetic force the number and the intensity of the vortices decrease first a 1 0 reach the minimum at a 1 0 where only a series of well organized quasi streamwise vortices are observed and then increase with the increase of a a 1 0 the control effects are also distinct with the different wave numbers k x even with the same amplitude a 1 0 which is shown in fig 6 being similar with fig 5 the first second and third columns represent the distributions of the spanwise velocities at y 5 streaks at y 5 and vortex structures at y 0 100 together with red and blue areas representing positive and negative values respectively in the first column figures the amplitude of spanwise velocity decreases with the increase of the wave numbers which means the decrease of motion induced by the electromagnetic force along the spanwise direction however the regularity of distribution enhances first reaches the optimal condition at wave number k x 3 when the induced flow field dominates and then weakens with the increase of the wave numbers in the second column the values of the streaks decreases and then increases while the regularity of the streaks distributions enhance and then weaken the optimal control effect is obtained at wave number k x 3 when distributions of the regular curve streaks alternate along the spanwise direction which has the same period with the electromagnetic force in the third column the number of the quasi streamwise vortex structures decreases and then increases with the increase of wave numbers the number of the irregular vortices decreases dramatically at wave number k x 3 while the well organized quasi streamwise vortices have the periodical distributions with alternating positive and negative along the streamwise direction the flow fields are modified by electromagnetic force which further result in the variations of reynolds stress the distributions of mean reynolds stress u v with the different parameters of electromagnetic force for re 4000 are shown in fig 7 where fig 7 a and b describe u v with amplitudes and wave numbers respectively the electromagnetic force is only applied on the lower wall i e y 0 the absolute value of u v decreases first and then increases with the increase of amplitudes in fig 7 a particularly in the near wall region which reaches the minimum at the amplitude a 1 0 the corresponding flow fields are shown in fig 5 where the suppression effect is enhanced with the increase of amplitudes in fig 5 a c the induced well organized quasi streamwise vortices are generated instead of the irregular ones in fig 5 c at a 1 0 when the minimum absolute value of u v is obtained however the random fluctuations of turbulence are enhanced by the overlarge value of the amplitude which leads to a great number of irregular streaks and vortices as shown in fig 5 d e and then enhance the absolute value of u v rapidly similarly the absolute value of u v also increases first and then decreases with the increase of wave numbers as shown in fig 7 b therefore the corresponding control effects are enhanced first and then weakened with the increase of wave numbers as shown in figs 6 a d where the absolute value of u v reaches the minimum at k x 3 due to the well organized quasi streamwise vortexes generated as shown in fig 6 b in the flow control the rate of drag reduction is usually introduced to evaluate the control effect of electromagnetic force which is defined as huang et al 2010 18 d r 1 τ w τ w n 100 1 c f c f n 100 where τ w and τ w n are the average values of the wall shear stress with and without control and c f and c f n are the corresponding friction drag coefficients of τ w and τ w n respectively the variations of d r with k x and a for re 4000 are shown in fig 8 where red areas refer to positive values of drag reduction rates and blue areas refer to negative values i e the increase of drag based on eq 14 the friction drag coefficient only depends on the y weighted integration of u v when the reynolds number is a constant in fig 8 the drag reduction rates increase first and then decrease with the increase of a at k x 3 due to the variations of u v shown in fig 7 a particularly the value of drag reduction rates is negative when a is larger than 2 0 because the absolute value of u v is larger than that without control with the increase of k x at a 1 0 the variations of drag reduction rates are similar due to the similar variations of u v shown in fig 7 b apart from differences in some negative values moreover the maximum drag reduction can be obtained with the optimal parameter combination a 1 0 k x 3 when the quasi streamwise vortex structures are generated as shown in both figs 5 c and 6 b to reveal the effects of the induced quasi streamwise vortexes the relation between the electromagnetic force and these induced vortex structures near the wall is investigated further with parameters a 1 0 and k x 3 at re 4000 as shown in fig 9 the top part shows the distribution of electromagnetic force in the streamwise direction and the middle and bottom parts offer views of the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures near the wall on the x z and x y planes where red and blue areas represent positive and negative values of vorticity respectively including the above mentioned character i e the period of the well organized quasi streamwise vortexes is equal to that of the electromagnetic force it can be seen that the negative streamwise vortexes are induced by positive spanwise electromagnetic force and inclined toward the positive spanwise direction whereas the positive streamwise vortexes are induced by negative spanwise electromagnetic force and inclined toward the negative spanwise direction it is well known that vortexes and streaks interact with each other in turbulent flow field the relation between the quasi streamwise vortexes and the distribution of streaks near the wall is shown in fig 10 the red and blue lines represent positive and negative quasi streamwise vortexes which correspond to those vortexes in the middle part of fig 9 the distribution of streaks at y 5 the same with figs 5 c and 6 b is on the background where red and blue represent high speed and low speed streaks respectively from the figure it can be seen that the vortexes and streaks have the same period however high speed streaks are always located above negative vortexes and below positive vortexes while low speed streaks are always located below negative vortexes and above positive vortexes moreover the strength of streaks is large at the location of the heads and tails of the quasi streamwise vortexes and small at the location of the middle part of the quasi streamwise vortexes to investigate the development of quasi streamwise vortexes in detail a pair of positive and negative vortex structures in fig 9 is selected as shown in fig 11 in the figure the left side is a 3d figure in which red areas represent positive vorticity marked as sp and blue areas represent negative vorticity marked as sn for the right side d0 d0 d1 d1 d2 d2 and d3 d3 are the corresponding sectional views along x direction sequentially moreover the curves on the right of the sectional views are isolines of streamwise vorticities in which the solid lines represent positive vorticities with clockwise rotation and the dotted lines represent negative vorticities with counterclockwise rotation the development of the quasi streamwise vortexes in the figure can be summarized as the following the positive streamwise vortex is defined as the parent vortex and its tail the lower end part turned inward is induced by the upstream vortex the middle is the main part of vortex structure which lifts gradually and is inclined with the effect of spanwise electromagnetic force then the vorticity grows and reaches the maximum at d0 when the streamwise vortex is developed to d1 a new negative streamwise vortex called offspring vortex is generated at the lower left under the effect of entrainment of the parent vortex next the parent vortex decays while the offspring vortex grows and the parent vortex reaches to the top point at d2 which is the head of parent vortex at the part of d1 d2 subsequently the parent vortex disappears through turbulent bursts while the offspring vortex is fully developed at d3 the generation mechanism of streamwise vortex in a turbulent flow has been discussed in detail by schoppa and hussain 2000 2002 combined with fig 9 it is obvious that the locations f z 0 correspond to the tails and heads of the vortexes with the small absolute values of vorticities while the locations f z the maximum values correspond to the middle parts of the vortexes with the maximum absolute values of vorticities moreover combined with fig 10 it can be seen that the strength of the streaks grows with the decay of vortexes and decays with the growth of vortexes from the x z coordinate plane the vortex structure sp is tilted into z by electromagnetic force and sn is tilted into z as shown in fig 12 however both the two tilts of vortex structures can generate the spanwise vorticities in the same direction i e negative spanwise vorticities ωz with the effect of the quasi streamwise vortexes in fig 11 the variations of mean velocity distributions are shown in fig 13 where the mean velocity profile of laminar turbulence and turbulence control are denoted by the solid dashed and dash dotted lines respectively based on eq 17 the absolute value of u v decreases with the effect of well organized quasi streamwise vortexes which leads to the decrease of second term in eq 17 for the parameter combination a 1 0 k x 3 therefore the mean velocity profile of turbulence is close to that of the laminar with the application of electromagnetic force which indicates the relaminarization of flow field moreover as shown in fig 12 both the two kinds of vortex structures i e sp and sn in fig 11 result in negative spanwise vorticities in the near wall region as mentioned in fig 12 which corresponds well with the model proposed by choi and clayton 2001 3 4 control effects with reynolds numbers the variations of dr with k x and a for different reynolds numbers are shown in fig 14 where fig 14 a b c and d correspond to the cases of re 4000 5000 6000 and 7000 respectively from the figures the variations of d r with the parameters of electromagnetic force have similar distributions for different reynolds numbers at low wave numbers the values of drag reduction rate vary dramatically with the amplitude i e the absolute values of drag decrease and increase are large whereas these values vary gradually at high wave numbers moreover the maximum drag reduction can be obtained with the optimal parameter combination in each case of the four reynolds numbers the parameters of electromagnetic force corresponding to the maximum drag reduction rate in fig 14 are shown in table 1 from the table it can be seen the maximum drag reduction rate decreases with the increase of reynolds numbers and the corresponding wave number of electromagnetic force increases while the variations of the amplitude are around 1 0 to find the reasons that the drag reduction rate decreases with the increase of reynolds number it is necessary to study the in depth mechanisms from the structure of flow fields before and after control respectively therefore the distribution of streamwise vortex structures before and after control correspond to the first and second column in fig 15 where a b c and d correspond to the cases of re 4000 5000 6000 and 7000 respectively the figure describes the distribution of streamwise vortex structures at 0 y 100 where red areas denote positive values of streamwise vorticity and blue areas denote negative values of streamwise vorticity in the first column there are a large number of irregular quasi streamwise vortexes near the wall at re 4000 and more vortexes appear in a denser distribution and on smaller scales with the increase of re in the second column the number of irregular quasi streamwise vortexes of the flow field controlled by electromagnetic force at re 4000 is significantly decreased then the remaining well organized quasi streamwise vortexes induced by electromagnetic force are distributed regularly and the period of the alternate positive negative is equal to that of the electromagnetic force therefore the period of the quasi streamwise vortexes decreases corresponding to the period of electromagnetic force with the increase of reynolds number however irregular quasi streamwise vortexes whose number increases with the increase of reynolds number reappear farther away from the wall for the cases with different reynolds numbers there are similar quasi streamwise vortex structures with the application of electromagnetic force however the scale of quasi streamwise vortex is distinct due to the different parameter values of the optimal electromagnetic force as shown in fig 16 where y represents the height from the lower wall and the quasi streamwise vortex structures induced by electromagnetic force correspond to the cases of re 4000 5000 6000 and 7000 from left to right respectively from the figure the scale of the induced quasi streamwise vortex structures shrinks with the increase of reynolds number due to the increase of wave number of the optimal electromagnetic force it is well known that the scales of irregular quasi streamwise vortexes decrease with the increase of reynolds number therefore the scale of the induced vortex can match with that of the irregular quasi streamwise vortex in the turbulence and the maximum rates of drag reduction can be obtained for the cases of different reynolds numbers however the height of the quasi streamwise vortex is decreased which means the effective depth decreases with the increase of reynolds number this indicates the weakening effects of drag reduction with the increase of reynolds number in table 1 4 conclusions in this paper the turbulent channel flow controlled by the space dependent electromagnetic force is investigated with dns for the different reynolds numbers the in depth relations among characteristic structures in the flow field mean reynolds shear stress and the effect of drag reduction for different reynolds numbers are discussed with the applications of electromagnetic force the control effects are distinct with different values of a and k x in the optimal combination the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures induced by electromagnetic force are generated these structures suppress random velocity fluctuations which further lead to the decrease of the absolute value of mean reynolds shear stress and the improvement of the mean velocity distribution therefore the maximum of drag reduction is obtained moreover the maximum drag reduction is also obtained with an optimal combination of parameter values for each case of different reynolds numbers and the similar structures i e the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures have the same period with that of electromagnetic force however with the increase of re the wave number of optimal electromagnetic force increases resulting in the decrease of scale of the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures which leads to the decrease of the height of these quasi streamwise vortexes finally the maximum rate of drag reduction decreases due to the decrease of the effective depth acknowledgments the authors are grateful to ms adele hamid who is a teacher in centre for academic english in imperial college

satake and kasagi 1996 and du and karniadakis 2000 du et al 2002 studied the turbulent control by electromagnetic force with a spanwise wave traveling along streamwise direction they found that the number of initial near wall streak structures was decreased and instead a wide ribbon of low speed velocity is formed when parameters of electromagnetic force matched well which result in a drag reduction rate up to 30 lee and kim 2002 investigated the vorticity dynamics in the viscous sublayer with the application of electromagnetic force the results indicated that turbulent structure can be improved near the wall and the skin drag can also be decreased by suppressing the streamwise vortexes of viscous sublayers moreover the streamwise traveling and standing waves of velocity imposed at the walls of a plane turbulent channel flow were investigated by viotti et al 2009 and quadrio et al 2009 with dns methods they obtained drag reductions about 48 and 52 for traveling waves and standing waves respectively moubarak and antar 2012 and habchi and antar 2016 investigated two scales on the energy cascade in a two dimension 2d turbulent flow with electromagnetic force and found that there exists a linear relationship between the large scale motion in the atmosphere and the very small ones recently ostillamónico and lee 2017 calculated three dimension 3d turbulent with electromagnetic force by fully solving the navier stokes equations which were coupled with the poisson nernst planck equations the results showed that an ion concentration dependent viscosity led to the emergence of a quiescent layer of higher ion concentration and the presence of this layer could play a role in disrupting the turbulence generation cycle as one would expect that the turbulence was weaker in regions of higher viscosity thus potentially decreasing friction dns study for a fully developed turbulent channel flow was carried out by altıntaş and davidson 2016 with introducing a spanwise oscillating electromagnetic force near the lower wall they observed that the sweeps and ejections moved away from the wall in the fully turbulent region with the application of electromagnetic force the control effects of streamwise traveling wave and bidirectional wavy electromagnetic force to wall turbulence were also investigated by our research group huang et al 2010 2014 the results indicated that the negative streamwise vortex induced by electromagnetic force existed in the flow field with control which can suppress the inherent positive streamwise vortex and merge the inherent negative streamwise vortex in turbulent flow field therefore the number of streamwise vortexes and streaks in the flow field was decreased which further led to the decrease of skin drag the above mentioned studies indicate that the significant effects of turbulence control can be achieved by using electromagnetic force with spanwise oscillating or traveling wave however the characteristic structures of the steady flow field dependent on the distribution of the electromagnetic force including the variations of characteristic structures with the reynolds numbers cannot be obtained due to the time varying electromagnetic force therefore the more in depth studies about the structures of the flow field are necessary especially for different reynolds numbers in this paper the turbulent channel flow controlled by the space dependent electromagnetic force is investigated by dns with the fourier chebyshev spectral method the spanwise electromagnetic force with sinusoidal distribution along the streamwise direction is selected to control weakly conductive fluids the potential relations among characteristic structures in the flow field mean reynolds shear stress and the friction drag are studied the control effects are discussed firstly for re 4000 with different values of amplitude a and wave number k x the characteristic structures and their effects in flow field with the electromagnetic force are analyzed then the variations of these characteristic structures which lead to the variation of drag reduction are further discussed with the increase of reynolds number finally the in depth mechanisms are revealed between the structures of the flow field and the effects of drag reduction for different reynolds numbers 2 numerical calculations 2 1 governing equations based on the fully developed turbulent flow of a weakly conductive fluid i e seawater the flow can be controlled by electromagnetic actuators which are installed on the lower wall of the channel with the electromagnetic force imposed as a source term the dimensionless navier stokes equations of incompressible 3d channel flow can be written as 1 u t u u p 1 re 2 u f 2 u 0 here all variables are nondimensionalized with respect to the channel half width h and the centre line u c u is the velocity vector p is the pressure re u c h ν is the reynolds number with ν the kinematic viscosity coefficient and f is electromagnetic force given by 3 f 0 0 f z where 4 f z a e y δ sin 2 π l x k x x here f z is the spanwise electromagnetic force with sinusoidal distributions along the streamwise direction whose variation depends on space rather than time a is the nondimensional amplitude δ is the effective penetration of electromagnetic force huang et al 2010 and l x and k x are the channel length and wave number along the streamwise direction respectively where l x k x λ x is the streamwise wave length the standard fourier chebyshey spectral method is applied to spatial directions for eqs 1 and 2 with the periodic character of turbulent channel flow in the streamwise and spanwise directions the dealiased fourier method is applied in these two directions while the chebyshev tau method is used in the normal direction of the wall moreover the usual no slip and no penetration conditions are used on the wall zhao et al 2004 the time advancement is performed by a semi implicit back differentiation formula method with third order accuracy to eliminate residual divergence the pressure term and the linear term are solved with a chebyshev tau influence matrix method for the non linear term a spectral truncation method referred to as the 3 2 rule is employed to remove aliasing errors the computational domain is shown in fig 1 where the size of the streamwise normal and spanwise directions corresponds to 4π 3 2 2π 3 approximately 754 360 377 wall units respectively uniform grid spacing is employed in the streamwise and spanwise directions while the non uniform grid space is employed in the normal direction more details about the numerical methods can be found in huang et al 2010 2014 the turbulent channel flow is controlled with the application of electromagnetic force at t 300 when the initial disturbance induced for generating a fully developed turbulence has been essentially eliminated which is steady from t 500 to t 1000 the cases are selected with different reynolds numbers from re 4000 to 7000 2 2 friction drag and mean velocity along the streamwise direction in turbulent channel flow the reynolds decomposition is used in eq 1 in x direction one obtains 5 u t u u x u v y u w z p x 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2 u z 2 where u u y t u v v w w and p x t p here y is the distance from the lower wall u v and w are velocities along x y z directions respectively the overbar indicates the average value of corresponding plane for a constant y the superscript indicates the fluctuation t is the real time adjustment of pressure for keeping flow stable then we have 6 u t 2 u u x u u x u v y u w z u w z t p x 1 re 2 u y 2 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2 u z 2 based on the assumption of the periodic flow structures in the homogeneous directions fukagata et al 2002 and the no slip boundary conditions which are the basic characters of the turbulent wall bounded flow we average eq 6 by integrating the equation in x and z directions and have 7 u t u v y t 1 re 2 u y 2 integrating eq 7 from 0 to 1 in y direction with the friction drag coefficient defined as c f π w ρ u c 2 2 then 8 t 1 re u y w π w c f 2 substituting eq 8 into eq

of base flow u y 1 1 y 2 2 y y 2 we have 11 0 1 u d y 0 1 u y d y 2 3 then integrating eq 10 from 0 to 1 in y direction one obtains 12 c f 4 re 6 0 1 1 y u v d y 3 0 1 1 y 2 u t d y for the steady turbulence 13 u t 0 then the friction drag coefficient is obtained 14 c f 4 re 6 0 1 1 y u v d y the equation indicates that the friction drag coefficient is composed of two parts for the steady turbulent channel flow fukagata et al 2002 the first term is the laminar drag coefficient which depends on reynolds numbers the second term is the y weighted integration of u v which is the reynolds shear stress due to the ejection and sweep in the turbulence moreover substituting eq 12 into eq 10 one obtains 15 u 2 y y 2 re 0 y u v d y 3 2 re 2 y y 2 0 1 1 y u v d y re 0 y 0 y u t d y d y 3 4 re

13 into eq 16 the average velocity along the streamwise direction can be obtained 17 u u y re 0 y u v d y 3 2 u y 0 1 1 y u v d y where the first term is the laminar velocity distribution resulting in the laminar drag i e the first term in eq 14 and the second term is related to the ejection and sweep in the turbulence resulting in the second term in eq 14 3 results and discussions 3 1 program verification for the sake of testing the code and algorithm the turbulent channel flow without control for re 4000 7000 are compared with the results from kim et al 1987 as shown in fig 2 our results indicate that the mean velocity profiles for re 4000 5000 6000 7000 in the paper correspond with those in kim et al 1987 and the classic wall law more details about the validation of the code can be found in huang et al 2010 2014 3 2 induced flow fields the induced flow field is a stable laminar flow field with the effect of electromagnetic force the spanwise electromagnetic force introduced in the paper is defined by eq 4 which is independent of time the spatial distribution of electromagnetic force for parameters k x 3 a 1 0 and δ 0 02 as a case is shown in fig 3 the electromagnetic force can induce spanwise motion in the conductive fluid and produce shear layers called stokes layer near the wall when the conductive fluid is affected by the electromagnetic force as a case of the laminar flow field for re 4000 the spanwise velocity distribution of the induced laminar flow field is presented in fig 4 where the red and blue areas refer to the positive and negative values respectively as a result of the main flow along the positive direction of x axis the distribution of spanwise velocity is inclined significantly to the downstream which is asymmetric but periodic with the electromagnetic force 3 3 modulated flow fields the streamwise vortexes and the streaks are basic elements of the near wall coherent structure in the turbulent flow the electromagnetic force in eq 4 is dependent of a and k x where a represents the amplitude of the force and k x the wave number along the streamwise direction therefore the different control effects are obtained with different values of parameters with the application of electromagnetic force for k x 3 the steady near wall flow fields for re 4000 for different amplitudes are shown in fig 5 the first second and third columns represent the distributions of the spanwise velocities at y 5 streaks at y 5 and vortex structures at y 0 100 together with red and blue areas representing positive and negative values respectively the distributions of spanwise velocities on the location y 5 are shown in the first column where red regions denote positive values and blue areas denote negative values a small amplitude and irregular distributions of velocities without control i e a 0 0 is shown in fig 5 a which describes the random characters of turbulent flow with the application of electromagnetic force in fig 5 b e the distributions of spanwise velocities shows an alternate positive negative character of which the period is equal to that of the electromagnetic force and the values of velocities increases with the increase of the electromagnetic force moreover the regularity of the spanwise velocity distributions increases firstly at a 1 0 which indicates the enhanced influences of the induced flow on the intrinsic flow then the regularity decreases a 1 0 due to the enhancement of the random fluctuations the optimal control effect is obtained at a 1 0 when the flow field is dominated by the induced flow the distributions of streak structures on the location y 5 are shown in the second column where red regions denote high speed streaks and blue areas denote low speed the streaks without control represent an alternating distribution along the spanwise direction and different lengths together with degree of curve which indicates the essential characters of coherent structure near the wall the sinusoidal distribution of streaks is obtained with control which has the same period with the electromagnetic force with the increase of a the intensity of streaks weakens first a 1 0 reaches the minimum at a 1 0 and then increases a 1 0 however the regularity of streaks enhances first a 1 0 reaches the optimal condition at a 1 0 and then weakens gradually a 1 0 due to the enhancement of the irregular streaks the distributions of vortex structures at y 0 100 are drawn by the imaginary part of complex eigenvalues of the velocity gradient tensor zhou et al 1999 these distributions are shown in the third column where red denotes positive values of streamwise vorticity and blue denotes negative a great number of irregular quasi streamwise vortices are presented without control however the distributions of quasi streamwise vortices are modified significantly due to the effect of electromagnetic force the number and the intensity of the vortices decrease first a 1 0 reach the minimum at a 1 0 where only a series of well organized quasi streamwise vortices are observed and then increase with the increase of a a 1 0 the control effects are also distinct with the different wave numbers k x even with the same amplitude a 1 0 which is shown in fig 6 being similar with fig 5 the first second and third columns represent the distributions of the spanwise velocities at y 5 streaks at y 5 and vortex structures at y 0 100 together with red and blue areas representing positive and negative values respectively in the first column figures the amplitude of spanwise velocity decreases with the increase of the wave numbers which means the decrease of motion induced by the electromagnetic force along the spanwise direction however the regularity of distribution enhances first reaches the optimal condition at wave number k x 3 when the induced flow field dominates and then weakens with the increase of the wave numbers in the second column the values of the streaks decreases and then increases while the regularity of the streaks distributions enhance and then weaken the optimal control effect is obtained at wave number k x 3 when distributions of the regular curve streaks alternate along the spanwise direction which has the same period with the electromagnetic force in the third column the number of the quasi streamwise vortex structures decreases and then increases with the increase of wave numbers the number of the irregular vortices decreases dramatically at wave number k x 3 while the well organized quasi streamwise vortices have the periodical distributions with alternating positive and negative along the streamwise direction the flow fields are modified by electromagnetic force which further result in the variations of reynolds stress the distributions of mean reynolds stress u v with the different parameters of electromagnetic force for re 4000 are shown in fig 7 where fig 7 a and b describe u v with amplitudes and wave numbers respectively the electromagnetic force is only applied on the lower wall i e y 0 the absolute value of u v decreases first and then increases with the increase of amplitudes in fig 7 a particularly in the near wall region which reaches the minimum at the amplitude a 1 0 the corresponding flow fields are shown in fig 5 where the suppression effect is enhanced with the increase of amplitudes in fig 5 a c the induced well organized quasi streamwise vortices are generated instead of the irregular ones in fig 5 c at a 1 0 when the minimum absolute value of u v is obtained however the random fluctuations of turbulence are enhanced by the overlarge value of the amplitude which leads to a great number of irregular streaks and vortices as shown in fig 5 d e and then enhance the absolute value of u v rapidly similarly the absolute value of u v also increases first and then decreases with the increase of wave numbers as shown in fig 7 b therefore the corresponding control effects are enhanced first and then weakened with the increase of wave numbers as shown in figs 6 a d where the absolute value of u v reaches the minimum at k x 3 due to the well organized quasi streamwise vortexes generated as shown in fig 6 b in the flow control the rate of drag reduction is usually introduced to evaluate the control effect of electromagnetic force which is defined as huang et al 2010 18 d r 1 τ w τ w n 100 1 c f c f n 100 where τ w and τ w n are the average values of the wall shear stress with and without control and c f and c f n are the corresponding friction drag coefficients of τ w and τ w n respectively the variations of d r with k x and a for re 4000 are shown in fig 8 where red areas refer to positive values of drag reduction rates and blue areas refer to negative values i e the increase of drag based on eq 14 the friction drag coefficient only depends on the y weighted integration of u v when the reynolds number is a constant in fig 8 the drag reduction rates increase first and then decrease with the increase of a at k x 3 due to the variations of u v shown in fig 7 a particularly the value of drag reduction rates is negative when a is larger than 2 0 because the absolute value of u v is larger than that without control with the increase of k x at a 1 0 the variations of drag reduction rates are similar due to the similar variations of u v shown in fig 7 b apart from differences in some negative values moreover the maximum drag reduction can be obtained with the optimal parameter combination a 1 0 k x 3 when the quasi streamwise vortex structures are generated as shown in both figs 5 c and 6 b to reveal the effects of the induced quasi streamwise vortexes the relation between the electromagnetic force and these induced vortex structures near the wall is investigated further with parameters a 1 0 and k x 3 at re 4000 as shown in fig 9 the top part shows the distribution of electromagnetic force in the streamwise direction and the middle and bottom parts offer views of the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures near the wall on the x z and x y planes where red and blue areas represent positive and negative values of vorticity respectively including the above mentioned character i e the period of the well organized quasi streamwise vortexes is equal to that of the electromagnetic force it can be seen that the negative streamwise vortexes are induced by positive spanwise electromagnetic force and inclined toward the positive spanwise direction whereas the positive streamwise vortexes are induced by negative spanwise electromagnetic force and inclined toward the negative spanwise direction it is well known that vortexes and streaks interact with each other in turbulent flow field the relation between the quasi streamwise vortexes and the distribution of streaks near the wall is shown in fig 10 the red and blue lines represent positive and negative quasi streamwise vortexes which correspond to those vortexes in the middle part of fig 9 the distribution of streaks at y 5 the same with figs 5 c and 6 b is on the background where red and blue represent high speed and low speed streaks respectively from the figure it can be seen that the vortexes and streaks have the same period however high speed streaks are always located above negative vortexes and below positive vortexes while low speed streaks are always located below negative vortexes and above positive vortexes moreover the strength of streaks is large at the location of the heads and tails of the quasi streamwise vortexes and small at the location of the middle part of the quasi streamwise vortexes to investigate the development of quasi streamwise vortexes in detail a pair of positive and negative vortex structures in fig 9 is selected as shown in fig 11 in the figure the left side is a 3d figure in which red areas represent positive vorticity marked as sp and blue areas represent negative vorticity marked as sn for the right side d0 d0 d1 d1 d2 d2 and d3 d3 are the corresponding sectional views along x direction sequentially moreover the curves on the right of the sectional views are isolines of streamwise vorticities in which the solid lines represent positive vorticities with clockwise rotation and the dotted lines represent negative vorticities with counterclockwise rotation the development of the quasi streamwise vortexes in the figure can be summarized as the following the positive streamwise vortex is defined as the parent vortex and its tail the lower end part turned inward is induced by the upstream vortex the middle is the main part of vortex structure which lifts gradually and is inclined with the effect of spanwise electromagnetic force then the vorticity grows and reaches the maximum at d0 when the streamwise vortex is developed to d1 a new negative streamwise vortex called offspring vortex is generated at the lower left under the effect of entrainment of the parent vortex next the parent vortex decays while the offspring vortex grows and the parent vortex reaches to the top point at d2 which is the head of parent vortex at the part of d1 d2 subsequently the parent vortex disappears through turbulent bursts while the offspring vortex is fully developed at d3 the generation mechanism of streamwise vortex in a turbulent flow has been discussed in detail by schoppa and hussain 2000 2002 combined with fig 9 it is obvious that the locations f z 0 correspond to the tails and heads of the vortexes with the small absolute values of vorticities while the locations f z the maximum values correspond to the middle parts of the vortexes with the maximum absolute values of vorticities moreover combined with fig 10 it can be seen that the strength of the streaks grows with the decay of vortexes and decays with the growth of vortexes from the x z coordinate plane the vortex structure sp is tilted into z by electromagnetic force and sn is tilted into z as shown in fig 12 however both the two tilts of vortex structures can generate the spanwise vorticities in the same direction i e negative spanwise vorticities ωz with the effect of the quasi streamwise vortexes in fig 11 the variations of mean velocity distributions are shown in fig 13 where the mean velocity profile of laminar turbulence and turbulence control are denoted by the solid dashed and dash dotted lines respectively based on eq 17 the absolute value of u v decreases with the effect of well organized quasi streamwise vortexes which leads to the decrease of second term in eq 17 for the parameter combination a 1 0 k x 3 therefore the mean velocity profile of turbulence is close to that of the laminar with the application of electromagnetic force which indicates the relaminarization of flow field moreover as shown in fig 12 both the two kinds of vortex structures i e sp and sn in fig 11 result in negative spanwise vorticities in the near wall region as mentioned in fig 12 which corresponds well with the model proposed by choi and clayton 2001 3 4 control effects with reynolds numbers the variations of dr with k x and a for different reynolds numbers are shown in fig 14 where fig 14 a b c and d correspond to the cases of re 4000 5000 6000 and 7000 respectively from the figures the variations of d r with the parameters of electromagnetic force have similar distributions for different reynolds numbers at low wave numbers the values of drag reduction rate vary dramatically with the amplitude i e the absolute values of drag decrease and increase are large whereas these values vary gradually at high wave numbers moreover the maximum drag reduction can be obtained with the optimal parameter combination in each case of the four reynolds numbers the parameters of electromagnetic force corresponding to the maximum drag reduction rate in fig 14 are shown in table 1 from the table it can be seen the maximum drag reduction rate decreases with the increase of reynolds numbers and the corresponding wave number of electromagnetic force increases while the variations of the amplitude are around 1 0 to find the reasons that the drag reduction rate decreases with the increase of reynolds number it is necessary to study the in depth mechanisms from the structure of flow fields before and after control respectively therefore the distribution of streamwise vortex structures before and after control correspond to the first and second column in fig 15 where a b c and d correspond to the cases of re 4000 5000 6000 and 7000 respectively the figure describes the distribution of streamwise vortex structures at 0 y 100 where red areas denote positive values of streamwise vorticity and blue areas denote negative values of streamwise vorticity in the first column there are a large number of irregular quasi streamwise vortexes near the wall at re 4000 and more vortexes appear in a denser distribution and on smaller scales with the increase of re in the second column the number of irregular quasi streamwise vortexes of the flow field controlled by electromagnetic force at re 4000 is significantly decreased then the remaining well organized quasi streamwise vortexes induced by electromagnetic force are distributed regularly and the period of the alternate positive negative is equal to that of the electromagnetic force therefore the period of the quasi streamwise vortexes decreases corresponding to the period of electromagnetic force with the increase of reynolds number however irregular quasi streamwise vortexes whose number increases with the increase of reynolds number reappear farther away from the wall for the cases with different reynolds numbers there are similar quasi streamwise vortex structures with the application of electromagnetic force however the scale of quasi streamwise vortex is distinct due to the different parameter values of the optimal electromagnetic force as shown in fig 16 where y represents the height from the lower wall and the quasi streamwise vortex structures induced by electromagnetic force correspond to the cases of re 4000 5000 6000 and 7000 from left to right respectively from the figure the scale of the induced quasi streamwise vortex structures shrinks with the increase of reynolds number due to the increase of wave number of the optimal electromagnetic force it is well known that the scales of irregular quasi streamwise vortexes decrease with the increase of reynolds number therefore the scale of the induced vortex can match with that of the irregular quasi streamwise vortex in the turbulence and the maximum rates of drag reduction can be obtained for the cases of different reynolds numbers however the height of the quasi streamwise vortex is decreased which means the effective depth decreases with the increase of reynolds number this indicates the weakening effects of drag reduction with the increase of reynolds number in table 1 4 conclusions in this paper the turbulent channel flow controlled by the space dependent electromagnetic force is investigated with dns for the different reynolds numbers the in depth relations among characteristic structures in the flow field mean reynolds shear stress and the effect of drag reduction for different reynolds numbers are discussed with the applications of electromagnetic force the control effects are distinct with different values of a and k x in the optimal combination the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures induced by electromagnetic force are generated these structures suppress random velocity fluctuations which further lead to the decrease of the absolute value of mean reynolds shear stress and the improvement of the mean velocity distribution therefore the maximum of drag reduction is obtained moreover the maximum drag reduction is also obtained with an optimal combination of parameter values for each case of different reynolds numbers and the similar structures i e the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures have the same period with that of electromagnetic force however with the increase of re the wave number of optimal electromagnetic force increases resulting in the decrease of scale of the well organized quasi streamwise vortex structures which leads to the decrease of the height of these quasi streamwise vortexes finally the maximum rate of drag reduction decreases due to the decrease of the effective depth acknowledgments the authors are grateful to ms adele hamid who is a teacher in centre for academic english in imperial college

22936,in this paper underwater thrust vectoring method based on double synthetic jet actuator is studied the thrust characteristic of the system under different nozzle distances and phase lags are numerically investigated the numerical method is validated using data in the literature the average normal thrust increases when nozzle distance increases the average tangential thrust decreases when nozzle distance increases the jet interacts with each other strongly under small nozzle distances when the two actuators are far enough the interaction between adjacent jets is negligible the average normal thrust keeps nearly invariant when phase lag varies the average tangential thrust increases when phase lag increases from 0 to π and decreases when phase lag increases from π to 2π the variation of the thrust vectoring angle has the same tendency with the average tangential thrust the velocity vector and the vorticity contour are given the mathematical model of the average normal

demands on the maneuverability of underwater robots the traditional way for underwater maneuvering is using rudders this method is very efficient at cruising speed however when the speed is low the steering force provided by the rudders is significantly reduced on the other hand the protruded rudders can induce significant resistance the other way for underwater thrust vectoring is using special designed mechanical system these mechanical systems can provide the propulsor additional degree of freedom xin et al 2013 cavallo and michelini 2004 kopman et al 2012 so using only one propulsor thrust in different directions can be realized ba xin luo xiaohui xin et al 2013 proposed a vectored water jet propulsor adopting 3rps parallel mechanism emanuele cavallo and rinaldo michelini adopted spherical parallel mechanism to control the thrust in all directions cavallo and michelini 2004 using multiple thrusters or special designed mechanisms will increase the weight and complexity of the propulsion system it will also induce significant resistance there are many marine creatures propelled by jets such as squid and jellyfish inspired by nature krueger krueger and gharib 2003 2005 whittlesey robert and john 2013 lydia et al 2011 krieg mohseni krieg and mohseni 2008 2010 mohseni 2006 proposed a new type of underwater propulsion technique called synthetic jet the main merit of synthetic jet lies in its high efficiency lydia a ruiz lydia et al 2011 found through experiment that pulsed jet has a propulsion efficiency 40 higher than that of steady jet and the drag based hydrodynamic efficiency increase more than 70 michael krieg and kamran mohseni krieg and mohseni 2008 2010 developed an underwater robot with synthetic jet actuator mounted inside the experiment showed the synthetic jet actuator induced the robot rotation of 2 23r min the feasibility of synthetic jet in the steering of underwater robots is validated the numerical simulation of synthetic jet is also intensively investigated there are several methods can be used to simulate turbulent flow including direct numerical simulation method dns large eddy simulation method les and reynolds averaged numerical simulation rans ravi mittal and najjar ravi et al 2004 used dns to study the effect of slot aspect ratio on the formation and evolution of synthetic jets in quiescent and non quiescent external flow rizzetta visbal and stanek rizzetta et al 1999 investigated two and three dimensional flow fields of finite aspect ratio synthetic jets using dns sau and mahesh 2008 used dns

device which implements synthetic jet to enhance thermal management using les you moin you and moin 2008 studied and evaluated the effectiveness of synthetic jets as a separation control technique over an airfoil wu leschziner wu and leschziner 2008 investigated the physical processes involved in the injection of a synthetic jet in quiescent surroundings using les from the view point of computational cost les and dns at high reynolds number flows requires huge computing resources although it could provide higher fidelity details of turbulent flow fields at the same time urans simulation combined with adequate turbulence models such as the k w sst turbulent model could provide reasonably good solutions rumsey et al 2004 the obvious attraction of rans lies in its economy it gives a phase averaged representation of the flow and thus allows far larger time steps to be used in the computational solution and it permits a coarser mesh to be used as the phase averaged fields of statistical quantities vary much more smoothly than the field of instantaneous turbulent motions jain puranik jain et al 2011 studied the influence of the geometrical parameters of the cavity and the nozzle on the flow characteristics of synthetic jet using rans the actuation frequency of the synthetic jet in this study is as high as 500 hz lv zhang lv et al 2014 studied the influence of the actuation frequency on the fluidic characteristics of synthetic jet using sst k w turbulence model xu zhou xu and zhou 2015 studied the pitching stability of a blended wing body aircraft controlled by synthetic jets using sst k w turbulence model duvigneau visonneau duvigneau and visonneau 2006 simulated and optimized the stall control of an airfoil using synthetic jet through rans method for underwater propulsion thrust is crucial the thrust of synthetic jet underwater is previously studied by anderson demont anderson and demont 2000 krieg mohseni krieg and mohseni 2013 2015 and krueger 2005 anderson demont quantified the contribution of the inside fluid acceleration when studying the squid jetting the pressure term was identified by kruger and modeled by the potential of a flat plate moving with the vortex ring the pressure term was also quantified with respect to jet velocity profiles in that study the forming of the vortex plays a big role in the thrust of synthetic jet underwater many experimental findings showed that the existence of vortex can enhance the thrust compared with the steady jet krieg mohseni studied the contribution of radial velocity gradient to thrust enhancement of synthetic jet the radial velocity gradient is actually induced by the formation of the vortex geng hu lin geng and huyang 2018 studied the thrust characteristic of synthetic jet underwater using both experiment and numerical method the thrust of synthetic jet actuator can be accurately predicted using numerical method adopted geng hu lin also modeled the thrust based on the potential flow theory the thrust is modeled using three different parts which is jet momentum jet acceleration and pressure force respectively in this paper a novel underwater maneuvering method based on double synthetic jet actuator is studied through adjusting the phase lags between these two actuators thrust vectoring can be realized the main contribution of this paper includes 1 the thrust characteristic of the double actuator system under different nozzle distances and different phase lags is numerically studied the numerical method is validated using experimental data in the literature the numerical result validates the feasibility of thrust vectoring based on phase differences between double adjacent jets 2 the velocity vector and vorticity contour are given to assistant the analysis 3 the model of the normal and tangential thrust is given the variation of the normal and tangential thrust can be well predicted by the model 2 numerical method the double synthetic jet actuator system is depicted in fig 1 the traditional synthetic jet actuators are mostly circular with the nozzle locating at the center of the cavity the synthetic jet actuator in this paper is rectangular and the nozzle locates at one side of the cavity this design is mainly based on the consideration of thrust vectoring the normal and tangential directions are defined in fig 1 the normal direction is parallel with the jet velocity as a result the thrust of the actuator will be mainly in the normal direction as the motion of the diaphragm is unsteady there exists fluid acceleration in the tangential direction as a result the tangential thrust will not be zero if the cavity is circular the total fluid acceleration in the tangential direction will be zero resulting in the zero tangential thrust so the design of the cavity in this paper can generate nonzero tangential thrust as a result thrust vectoring can be realized the thrust vectoring angle can be controlled through adjusting the phase lags between the two actuators the diaphragm of the actuator locates at the bottom of the actuator it is oscillating up and down in the sinusoidal mode 1 v t 2 π f r a m cos 2 π f r t a m stands for the amplitude which is 5 mm f r stands for the frequency which is 10 hz the main geometric parameters of the synthetic jet actuator include diameter and thickness of the orifice as well as diameter and depth of the cavity the definition of the geometrical parameters is given in fig 2 and the value of geometrical parameters is given in table 1 the average velocity of the jet flow can be computed as xia and mohseni 2016 2 v j e t 2 f r l l stands for the height of the fluid column ejected by the actuator in one cycle using 2 the reynolds number is 3 re j e t ρ v j e t d μ using geometrical parameters given in table 1 the reynolds number is 3 5 105 as the rans method can achieve satisfying accuracy with relatively low computation burden it is chosen in this paper to simulate the turbulent jet flow the computation is carried out by using the commercial cfd software fluent coupled with the user definition function udf describing the diaphragm movement pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso based on a higher degree of approximation between the iterative corrections for pressure and velocity is chosen second order upwind spatial discretization is used for the momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate sst k w turbulence model is used to account for the turbulent nature of the synthetic jet flows the length of the double actuator system is much larger than the width of the nozzle so the 3d problem can be computed using 2d mesh the mesh adopted is given in fig 2 b the nozzle is resolved with quadrilateral elements the bottom part of the cavity is meshed with quadrilateral elements to allow for relative displacement among the nodes on the piston all the other parts are resolved with triangular elements the domain near the nozzle has a big influence on the development of the jet to better simulate the jet interaction near the nozzle a refinement region near the nozzle is created the width and height of the refinement region is l 1 and l 2 respectively as given in fig 2 a the value of l 1 and l 2 is given in table using the nozzle diameter d the domain far away from the nozzle has little influence on jet development meshes in this region can be coarser when jet is ejected outside of the cavity the boundary layer near the nozzle wall will evolves into vortexes to accurately simulate the formation and development of vortexes the element height near the nozzle wall is carefully designed the element height of the boundary layer can be computed using dimensionless wall distance y which is given as y δ y ρ μ τ μ for sst k w turbulence model y should be smaller than 2 y 2 is just a criterion to compute the initial guess of the element height the real value is designed through trial and error in this paper after several trials the first element s height of the boundary layer is confirmed to be 0 01 mm the boundary condition is depicted in fig 2 a the driving diaphragm is modeled using moving wall the motion of the moving wall is governed by 1 using udf user defined function the boundary connecting to the moving wall is set to be deforming wall to allow for relative displacement the height of the deforming wall and the elements in the deforming region can adjust automatically based on the motion of the moving boundary the auv surface is modeled with no slipping wall the other boundaries of the outer flow domain are set to be pressure outlet the relative static pressure of the outlet is set to be 0 to simulate the ambient environment which is far away from the nozzle the turbulence intensity of the outlet is set to be 1 the remaining boundaries of the actuator are set to be no slipping wall the default under relaxation parameters are kept at 0 3 1 0 and 0 7 for pressure density and momentum respectively the default of 120 maximum iterations per time step is kept a time step of 1 200f is chosen based on the actuation frequency to allow for 200 time steps per cycle at the beginning of the simulation the flow field has not convergence so in this paper all the data are sampled after three cycles of computation 2 1 numerical method validation the dependence of the numerical method on the grid resolution is studied in this paper two types of grids with different grid resolution are used to compute the tangential and normal thrust of the system the grid size in different zones is defined in fig 3 scav snozzle sbl srefine sout are the grid size of the cavity the nozzle the boundary layer the refinement region and the far region respectively the grid size of the fine and coarse mesh is given in table 2 the tangential and normal thrust under different grid resolutions is depicted in fig 4 it can be seen the thrust under different grid resolutions is close to each other so the influence of the grid resolution on the result can be ignored the numerical simulation of the isolated synthetic jets has been intensively investigated when two synthetic jets are placed side by side the flow field of these two adjacent synthetic jets will interact strongly with each other as a result the flow field of two adjacent synthetic jets is more complicated than that of single isolated synthetic jet in order to validate the effectiveness of the numerical method adopted in the simulation of adjacent synthetic jets the vorticity contour is compared with result given by sajad alimohammadi alimohammadi et al 2016 sajad alimohammadi et al studied the flow vectoring phenomenon in adjacent synthetic jets using cfd and piv for comparison the actuator with the same geometrical parameters and boundary conditions with ref 28 is simulated using numerical method in this paper the vorticity contour when phase lag is 60 is used for comparison fig 5 a c e g are results given in ref 28 and b d f h are results in this paper fig 5 a and b gives vorticity contour when t 0 there are four pairs of vortexes in the flow field vortex i and vortex ii are outside of the cavity the position and the structure of these two vortexes given by sajad alimohammadi is close to numerical result in this paper the tilting of the vortex i is accurately predicted vortex iii and iv is inside of the cavity vortex iii and vortex iv belongs to the current cycle the vortex far from the centerline is much larger in size than the vortex close to the centerline the room for the vortex near the centerline is very limited as a result the development of this vortex is restrained the vortex contour when t t 4 is given in fig 5 c and d it can be seen the vortexes of the two adjacent actuators strongly interact with each other there are three pairs of vortexes outside of the cavity each vortex pair is composed of two vortexes with opposite vorticity vortex pair ii and iii merges with each other forming a larger vortex the interaction between these two vortexes and the structure of the interacted vortexes are close in fig 5 c and d the two pairs of vortexes inside of the cavity also resemble each other when t t 2 the interaction between the two pairs of vortexes stopped and the vortex of the left actuator vortex i in fig 5 e and f almost disappears the tilting of vortex ii is accurately predicted in fig 5 f the structure of the two pairs of vortexes inside the cavity is also close in fig 5 e and f when t 3t 4 the vortex of the right actuator starts to detach from the nozzle as given in fig 5 g and h the tilting and the structure of the vortex are generally accurate from results and discussion given above it can be known the prediction accuracy of vortexes far away from the nozzle and vortexes with weak intensity is generally poor despite of this the tilting the structure and the interaction of the main vortexes can all be predicted with satisfactory accuracy the thrust characteristic of the isolated synthetic jet actuator is intensively studied the thrust of isolated synthetic jet actuator can be well predicted using numerical method in this paper as validated in our previous studies geng and huyang 2018 the thrust of synthetic jet was measured using 6 dof force sensor the force measured by the force sensor includes not just the thrust of the jet but also the inertial and friction force of the system when it is running to compute the thrust of the jet the experiment is carried both in air and underwater only part of the cavity is underwater the inertial and friction force of the system generated by the reciprocal motion of the piston is independent of the medium the thrust of the jet in the air can be neglected in this case the difference between the force in the air and underwater is the thrust of synthetic jet underwater geng and huyang 2018 as modeled by geng lingbo et al geng and huyang 2018 the thrust of synthetic jet can be expressed as 4 f t k q m v m a c c 1 2 k q m v v and a cc stands for the average velocity and average acceleration at the nozzle exit q m is the average mass flow rate m is the total mass accelerated by the actuator k is the parameter describing the velocity distribution at the nozzle exit the interaction between jets will alternate the velocity distribution at the nozzle exit as a result the value of k changes the velocity distribution mainly depends on the near field and the main vortex structures the vortex far away from the nozzle and vortex with weak intensity has little effect on the velocity distribution as results given in fig 5 the numerical method in this paper can accurately predict the vortex in the near field in this case the thrust of adjacent synthetic jets can also be accurately predicted 3 results and analysis 3 1 the effect of nozzle distance the effect of the nozzle distance is studied in this paper the parameter d is defined to be the distance between the centerline of nozzles the definition of the geometrical parameters is depicted in fig 2 the normal and tangential thrust under different nozzle distances is depicted in fig 6 the phase lag between these two actuators is fixed to be π the peak value of the normal thrust changes significantly about 50 when the distance increases from 10 mm to 15 mm when the nozzle distance continues to increase from 15 mm the peak value of the normal thrust changes slowly the normal thrust constitutes of four peaks in one period locating at t 0 t t 4 t t 2 and t 3t 4 respectively from 1 the velocity of the piston is zero at t t 4 and t 3t 4 the velocity of the piston is largest at t t and t t 2 so the thrust peak at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is generated through fluid acceleration from fig 7 a the peak at t t 4 and t 3t 4 increase in magnitude when nozzle distance increases this means the contribution of fluid acceleration to normal thrust increase when nozzle distance increases the phase lag between these two actuators is π which means the jet velocity is exactly reverse in direction the normal thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 can be expressed as 5 t m l a c c l m r a c c r m l m r is the mass of fluid accelerated by the left and right actuator v l v r is the average fluid acceleration of the left and right actuator respectively a c c l and a c c r are of reverse direction from fig 6 a the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is nonzero this means the net effect of fluid acceleration for this dual synthetic jet actuator is not zero as the two actuators are reverse in phase this means the fluid acceleration during suction cycle and stroke cycle is not simply reverse of direction in other words the flow field during stroke cycle and suction cycle is not symmetrical as the two actuators have identical geometrical and actuation parameters a c c l will become a c c r after half period so the period of the acceleration force is t 2 this can be seen from fig 6 a in different cases the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is very close from fig 6 a the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 increases in magnitude when nozzle distance increases as fluid interaction is stronger under small nozzle distance this means the fluid interaction between the adjacent jets will reduce the acceleration effect the thrust peak at t t 2 and t t is generated through jet velocity the thrust can be expressed as 6 t 0 5 k q m v l n q m v l q m v r 0 5 k q m v r n q m is the mass flow rate and v is the average jet velocity k is a parameter describing the velocity distribution at the nozzle exit n is the outer normal vector of the nozzle plane k q m v n stands for the pressure force l stands for the left actuator and r stands for the right actuator as the geometrical and actuation parameters of these two actuators are identical the mass flow rate and average velocity are the same in magnitude but reverse in direction so q m v l q m v r is 0 6 can be simplified as 7 t 0 5 k q m v l n 0 5 k q m v r n the mass flow rate q m and the average velocity v don t depend on nozzle distance so thrust at t t 2 and t t is close in different cases using 5 and 7 the normal thrust can be expressed as 8 t 0 5 k q m v l n 0 5 k q m v r n m l a c c l m r a c c r from fig 6 a the direction of the normal thrust never change in one period the direction of n doesn t change with time so the first two parts of 8 has constant direction the last two parts of 8 change direction every half period this means the normal thrust mainly depends on the pressure force this is evident in fig 6 a as the thrust at t t t t 2 is much larger than thrust at t t 4 the average normal thrust is given in fig 6 c the average normal thrust increases in magnitude with nozzle distance the variation of the average normal thrust is mainly induced by the acceleration term the interaction between the adjacent jets will undermine the acceleration effect the tangential thrust under different nozzle distances is given in fig 6 b tangential thrust has two peaks locating at t 4 and 3t 4 respectively from 1 at t t 4 and t 3t 4 the acceleration is largest this means the tangential thrust is mainly generated through fluid acceleration as a result the tangential thrust has just two peaks locates at 0 25t and 0 75t respectively the first peak at t t 4 decreases in magnitude with nozzle distance the variation of the second peak at t 3t 4 is not obvious the average tangential thrust is given in fig 6 d the average tangential thrust decrease with the nozzle distance when nozzle distance is small the interaction between jets is strong this means the fluid interaction between the adjacent jets can enhance the tangential thrust to better understand the mechanism behind this velocity vector under different nozzle distances is given in fig 7 10 the velocity vector when nozzle distance is 5 mm is given in fig 7 when d 5 mm the interaction between the two adjacent jets is very strong there are two pairs of vortexes in the flow field vortex i and ii belongs to the left jet sj a for simplicity vortex i and ii belongs to the right jet sj b for simplicity when vortex i and ii forms vortex i and ii flows far away from the nozzle when sj b expels fluid sj a is in suction cycle the suction of sj a will deflect vortex i and ii towards sj a as depicted in fig 7 b the suction of sj a will strengthen the intensity of vortex ii so the strength of vortex ii is much stronger than that of vortex i when these two vortexes flows downstream at t 2t 3 vortex ii locates at the left side of sj a at this time sj a starts to expel fluid and vortex i and vortex ii starts to form the direction of vortex i and vortex ii is the same in this case vortex i and vortex ii will merge as given in fig 7 e on the other hand vortex i almost disappear because of the existence of vortex ii fluid is continuously drawn from sj a into vortex ii meanwhile sj b also draws fluid from sj a as sj b is in its suction cycle the suction of vortex ii and sj b is reverse in direction as a result the deflection of sj a is reduced the deflection angle of sj a is much smaller than that of sj b so the net deflection angle of these two adjacent jets is not zero this is consistent with the result given by sajad alimohammadi alimohammadi et al 2016 from result given by sajad alimohammadi the jet always deflects towards the same direction despite the suction of the other actuator as the jets always deflect toward the same direction the net tangential thrust generated by the jet deflection is not zero this is the mechanism behind the generation of net tangential thrust when nozzle distance increases to 20 mm fig 8 the interaction between the two adjacent jets decreases the deflection angle of sj a is still smaller than that of sj b the net deflection angle and the net tangential thrust generated by jet deflection are nonzero when nozzle distance increases to 50 mm fig 9 the interaction becomes very weak the deflection angle of the jet becomes very small the tangential thrust generated by jet deflection will be neglected in this case the tangential thrust is mainly generated through fluid acceleration the velocity distribution at t t 2 and t t is given in figs 10 12 the left plot in fig 10 gives the velocity distribution of the left actuator which is now in its suction cycle the right plot in fig 10 corresponds to the stroke cycle of the right actuator when t t the left actuator switches to stroke cycle while the right one is in suction cycle when nozzle distance is small the velocity distribution of the left and right actuator is different as can be seen from right plot of fig 10 a and left plot of fig 10 b this means the flow field is not symmetrical for the dual actuator system when nozzle distance increases to 80 mm the fluid interaction between these two actuators is negligible the velocity distribution for these two actuators is nearly the same as can be seen from the right plot of figure and the left plot of fig 12 from velocity vectors given above it is evident that the jet will deflect towards the actuator leading in phase in this paper the actuator first ejects fluids and then switches to suction cycle when one actuator sj a for simplicity is leading in phase it will switches to suction cycle earlier than the other one denoted as sj b in this case the jet ejected by sj b will be sucked by sj a jet b will be deflected as a result the vortex of jet b will also deflect toward sj a when sj a begins its stroke cycle and sj b switches to suction cycle the vortex of jet b ejected during the last stroke cycle will restrain the deflection of jet a in this case the deflection of jet a is weaker than that of jet b the net deflection of the jet is toward jet a the one leading in phase when nozzle distance is small the net deflection angle is larger the deflection of the jet will contribute to the tangential thrust besides the acceleration effect in this case the tangential thrust is larger as given in fig 6 b the decrease of the average normal thrust is mainly induced by the acceleration term as can be seen from fig 6 a thrust at t 0 and t t 2 is generated through pressure force k q m v n on the other hand thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is generated through fluid acceleration from fig 6 a thrust at t 0 and t t 2 doesn t change while thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 increases with nozzle distance especially when nozzle distance is small from velocity vector given when nozzle distance is small the jet of sj a will be sucked by sj b the smaller is the distance more jet will be sucked synthetic jet is pulsed jet the fluid is frequently accelerated decelerated by the actuator the acceleration force is proportional to the total mass accelerated by the dual synthetic jet actuator when jet a is sucked by jet b the total accelerated fluid decreases as a result the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 decrease in magnitude when the two actuators are far away from each other the interaction is negligible every actuator will accelerate part of fluid independently the total accelerated fluid increases 3 2 the effect of phase lag in this section the effect of phase lag is studied the nozzle distance in this section is fixed to be 10 mm the thrust variation and vorticity contour under different phase lags are given thrust model which can precisely predict thrust variation is established the thrust is modeled using potential flow theory thrust generation of double synthetic jet actuator is complicated with physical processes including vortex generation fluid acceleration and jet interaction all these processes are difficult to model precisely the focus of this study is to investigate the characteristic of the double synthetic jet system the thrust model only serves to predict the thrust variation so it is established using potential flow theory with many simplifications only the main physical parameters affecting the thrust variation is modeled the thrust model can precisely predict the thrust variation as given in the following paragraphs however it can t be used to compute the magnitude of the thrust the variation of the normal and tangential thrust under different phase lags denoted as θ is given in fig 13 and 14 respectively the average thrust of synthetic jet can be computed as krieg and mohseni 2013 2015 9 t d o u 2 t ρ π 3 8 d 2 f r 2 l 2 9 is the average thrust of circular synthetic jet l is the height of the fluid column expelled in one period by the actuator f r is the driving frequency of the actuator in this paper the actuator is rectangular in this case the average thrust should be computed as 10 t d o u ρ π 2 2 f r 2 l 2 d l en d stands for the nozzle width and l en stands for the nozzle length all the data points in this paper are normalized using 10 from fig 13 the peak of the tangential thrust first increase when phase lag increase from π 6 to π and then decrease when phase lag increase from π to 2π the tangential thrust of the system can be expressed as 11 t m l a c c l m r a c c r m sin 2 π f r t sin 2 π f r t θ the variation of 11 with m 1 is depicted in fig 15 when θ and t vary the value of 11 composes a 3 d surface the red color represents positive thrust while the blue color represents negative thrust the z θ plane of the 3d surface is given in fig 15 a the amplitude of the tangential thrust corresponds to the chord length of the curve in fig 15 b it can be seen the chord length increases when 0 θ π and decreases when π θ 2π this is consistent with the variation of the amplitude of the tangential thrust the normal thrust can be expressed as 12 t q m l v l k q m l v l n q m r v r k q m r v r n k q m l v l q m r v r k cos 2 2 π f r t v l v l cos 2 2 π f r t θ v r v r k cos 2 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t k cos 2 2 π f r t θ cos 2 π f r t θ cos 2 π f r t θ the variation of 12 with k 1 is depicted in fig 16 similar to 11 all the values of 12 constitute a 3d surface as depicted in fig 16 a the amplitude of the normal thrust corresponds to the chord length of the curve depicted in fig 16 b it can be seen the chord length decrease when 0 θ π and increase when π θ 2π this is consistent with the variation of the amplitude of the normal thrust as depicted in fig 14 the variation of the average thrust is also studied in this paper the total momentum variation of the system in one period is negligible based on the fact that the driving profile of the diaphragm is symmetrical so the average thrust of synthetic jet is mainly generated through pressure force as a result average normal thrust of the double actuator system under phase lag of θ can be expressed as 13 t nor 0 t k 1 2 q m v d t 2 ρ π 2 f r 2 a m 2 s p i s k 0 t cos 2 2 π f r t cos 2 2 π f r t θ d t 1 2 ρ π 2 f r a m 2 s p i s k k ρ π 2 2 f r a m 2 σ s k ρ π 2 2 f r a m 2 σ l e n d s pis is the area of the piston s is the area of the nozzle σ is the area ratio of the piston to the nozzle l en is the length of the nozzle and d is the width of the nozzle the derivation is based on the relation q m ρ s pis v 13 shows the average normal thrust is independent of θ the average normal thrust under different phase lags is given in table 3 similar to thrust in figs 13 and 14 all the data points in table are normalized using 10 from table 3 it can be known the average normal thrust is close to each other the difference between the largest and the smallest value is less than 5 so the average normal thrust can be taken as invariant under different phase lags this is consistent with 13 the average tangential thrust can be expressed as 14 t tan 0 t 2 m l a c c l m r a c c r d t t 2 t m l a c c l m r a c c r d t 0 t 2 m sin 2 π f r t sin 2 π f r t θ t 2 t m sin 2 π f r t sin 2 π f r t θ m 2 π f r cos 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t θ 0 t 2 m 2 π f r cos 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t θ t 2 t m 2 π f r 2 2 cos θ m is the mass of fluid accelerated during suction cycle and m is the mass of fluid accelerated during stroke cycle from 14 it can be known when θ 0 the average tangential thrust is 0 the average tangential thrust increases when 0 θ π when phase lag is larger than π the average tangential thrust starts to decrease this is consistent with that given in table 3 the thrust vectoring angle can be expressed as 15 α t tan t nor the value of α under different phase lags is given in table 3 the thrust vectoring angle increases when 0 θ π and decreases when π θ 2π the maximum thrust vectoring angle realized by the double actuator system is 11 88 this validates its effectiveness in underwater thrust vectoring the tangential thrust is mainly generated through fluid acceleration the jet deflection also contributes to part of the tangential thrust when two actuators work in phase the flow field is symmetrical in this case the jet deflection and the fluid acceleration are negligible the tangential thrust will be 0 with the increase of the phase lag fluid acceleration and jet deflection are enhanced tangential thrust increases as result from fig 13 when phase lag is small the peak of the tangential thrust locates near t t when t t jet velocity is significant while fluid acceleration is small as can be seen from 1 this means when phase lag is small contribution of jet deflection is larger than fluid acceleration with the increase of the phase lag until θ π the peak of the tangential thrust moves towards t t 4 and t 3t 4 as marked using red arrow in fig 13 this means the contribution of fluid acceleration increase and become dominant in tangential thrust generation when θ is larger than π with the increase of the phase lag the thrust peak starts to move far away from t t 4 or t 3t 4 this means the contribution of fluid acceleration starts to decay the pressure force the jet momentum and the fluid acceleration all contributes to the normal thrust the variation of the normal thrust in figure is mainly induced by these three components when two actuators work in phase the peak of the normal thrust locates at t t 2 or t t at this time the jet velocity is highest while the fluid acceleration is very small this means when phase lag is 0 normal thrust depends on k q m v n and q m v k q m v n always has the same direction despite the direction variation of v on the other hand q m v reverse its direction every half period when k q m v n and q m v has the same direction the normal thrust is q m v k q m v n otherwise the normal thrust is q m v k q m v n as a result the positive and negative thrust peaks are different in magnitude in this paper the negative peak is larger than the positive one with the increase of the phase lag the thrust peak starts to move towards t t 4 as marked using red arrow in fig 14 this means the contribution of the acceleration force increases the thrust peak also decreases in magnitude indicating the weaker contribution of the fluid acceleration than the jet velocity the magnitude of the thrust peak is smallest when phase lag is pi the vorticity contour under different phase lags is given in fig 17 when phase lag is 0 the jet never deflects the flow field is symmetrical about the centerline of the dual actuator system with the increase of the phase lag one jet will deflect due to the suction of the other actuator the deflection angle of the jet leading in phase is smaller than the other one thus the net deflection angle is not zero the jet deflects towards the actuator leading in phase the larger is the phase lag the larger is the deflection angle as can be seen from fig 17 the deflection angle is largest when phase lag is pi when phase lag is larger than pi with the increase of the phase lag the deflection angle starts to decrease and the deflection angle will decrease to be 0 when phase lag is 2π this is consistent with the variation of the thrust vectoring angle as the net deflection angle of the jet is always towards the same direction the thrust vectoring angle is also towards the same direction 4 conclusions a novel thrust vectoring method based on double synthetic jet actuator is studied using numerical simulation the thrust and flow field of the double synthetic jet actuator under different nozzle distances and phase lags are investigated thrust of synthetic jet includes three parts fluid acceleration jet momentum and pressure force respectively the net deflection angle of the jet is always towards the actuator leading in phase despite the suction of the other actuator the deflection of the jet contributes to the tangential thrust both the nozzle distance and phase lag affect the jet deflection the jet deflection angle decreases monotonously when nozzle distance increases the jet deflection angle increase when phase lag increases from 0 to π and decreases when phase lag continues to increase from π to 2π fluid acceleration also contributes to the tangential thrust and the variation of fluid acceleration with phase lag has the same tendency with jet deflection when phase lag is small contribution of jet deflection is much larger than fluid acceleration with the increase of the phase lag the contribution of fluid acceleration increases and becomes dominant in tangential thrust generation the variation tendency of the tangential thrust with phase lag is the same with the jet deflection and fluid acceleration fluid acceleration jet momentum and pressure force all contributes to normal thrust when nozzle distance is small the interaction between the adjacent jets is strong part of the jet a will be sucked by jet b in this case the total accelerated fluid decreases the contribution of fluid acceleration decreases when nozzle distance is large enough the interaction between jets can be neglected the acceleration force increases with the increase of the phase lag the contribution of the acceleration force increases the thrust also decreases in magnitude indicating the weaker contribution of the fluid acceleration than the jet momentum and pressure force the average normal thrust mainly depends on the pressure force the pressure force is not affected by the nozzle distance and phase lag as a result the average normal thrust is independent of the phase lags in this case the variation of the thrust vectoring angle is the same with the average tangential thrust

demands on the maneuverability of underwater robots the traditional way for underwater maneuvering is using rudders this method is very efficient at cruising speed however when the speed is low the steering force provided by the rudders is significantly reduced on the other hand the protruded rudders can induce significant resistance the other way for underwater thrust vectoring is using special designed mechanical system these mechanical systems can provide the propulsor additional degree of freedom xin et al 2013 cavallo and michelini 2004 kopman et al 2012 so using only one propulsor thrust in different directions can be realized ba xin luo xiaohui xin et al 2013 proposed a vectored water jet propulsor adopting 3rps parallel mechanism emanuele cavallo and rinaldo michelini adopted spherical parallel mechanism to control the thrust in all directions cavallo and michelini 2004 using multiple thrusters or special designed mechanisms will increase the weight and complexity of the propulsion system it will also induce significant resistance there are many marine creatures propelled by jets such as squid and jellyfish inspired by nature krueger krueger and gharib 2003 2005 whittlesey robert and john 2013 lydia et al 2011 krieg mohseni krieg and mohseni 2008 2010 mohseni 2006 proposed a new type of underwater propulsion technique called synthetic jet the main merit of synthetic jet lies in its high efficiency lydia a ruiz lydia et al 2011 found through experiment that pulsed jet has a propulsion efficiency 40 higher than that of steady jet and the drag based hydrodynamic efficiency increase more than 70 michael krieg and kamran mohseni krieg and mohseni 2008 2010 developed an underwater robot with synthetic jet actuator mounted inside the experiment showed the synthetic jet actuator induced the robot rotation of 2 23r min the feasibility of synthetic jet in the steering of underwater robots is validated the numerical simulation of synthetic jet is also intensively investigated there are several methods can be used to simulate turbulent flow including direct numerical simulation method dns large eddy simulation method les and reynolds averaged numerical simulation rans ravi mittal and najjar ravi et al 2004 used dns to study the effect of slot aspect ratio on the formation and evolution of synthetic jets in quiescent and non quiescent external flow rizzetta visbal and stanek rizzetta et al 1999 investigated two and three dimensional flow fields of finite aspect ratio synthetic jets using dns sau and mahesh 2008 used dns

device which implements synthetic jet to enhance thermal management using les you moin you and moin 2008 studied and evaluated the effectiveness of synthetic jets as a separation control technique over an airfoil wu leschziner wu and leschziner 2008 investigated the physical processes involved in the injection of a synthetic jet in quiescent surroundings using les from the view point of computational cost les and dns at high reynolds number flows requires huge computing resources although it could provide higher fidelity details of turbulent flow fields at the same time urans simulation combined with adequate turbulence models such as the k w sst turbulent model could provide reasonably good solutions rumsey et al 2004 the obvious attraction of rans lies in its economy it gives a phase averaged representation of the flow and thus allows far larger time steps to be used in the computational solution and it permits a coarser mesh to be used as the phase averaged fields of statistical quantities vary much more smoothly than the field of instantaneous turbulent motions jain puranik jain et al 2011 studied the influence of the geometrical parameters of the cavity and the nozzle on the flow characteristics of synthetic jet using rans the actuation frequency of the synthetic jet in this study is as high as 500 hz lv zhang lv et al 2014 studied the influence of the actuation frequency on the fluidic characteristics of synthetic jet using sst k w turbulence model xu zhou xu and zhou 2015 studied the pitching stability of a blended wing body aircraft controlled by synthetic jets using sst k w turbulence model duvigneau visonneau duvigneau and visonneau 2006 simulated and optimized the stall control of an airfoil using synthetic jet through rans method for underwater propulsion thrust is crucial the thrust of synthetic jet underwater is previously studied by anderson demont anderson and demont 2000 krieg mohseni krieg and mohseni 2013 2015 and krueger 2005 anderson demont quantified the contribution of the inside fluid acceleration when studying the squid jetting the pressure term was identified by kruger and modeled by the potential of a flat plate moving with the vortex ring the pressure term was also quantified with respect to jet velocity profiles in that study the forming of the vortex plays a big role in the thrust of synthetic jet underwater many experimental findings showed that the existence of vortex can enhance the thrust compared with the steady jet krieg mohseni studied the contribution of radial velocity gradient to thrust enhancement of synthetic jet the radial velocity gradient is actually induced by the formation of the vortex geng hu lin geng and huyang 2018 studied the thrust characteristic of synthetic jet underwater using both experiment and numerical method the thrust of synthetic jet actuator can be accurately predicted using numerical method adopted geng hu lin also modeled the thrust based on the potential flow theory the thrust is modeled using three different parts which is jet momentum jet acceleration and pressure force respectively in this paper a novel underwater maneuvering method based on double synthetic jet actuator is studied through adjusting the phase lags between these two actuators thrust vectoring can be realized the main contribution of this paper includes 1 the thrust characteristic of the double actuator system under different nozzle distances and different phase lags is numerically studied the numerical method is validated using experimental data in the literature the numerical result validates the feasibility of thrust vectoring based on phase differences between double adjacent jets 2 the velocity vector and vorticity contour are given to assistant the analysis 3 the model of the normal and tangential thrust is given the variation of the normal and tangential thrust can be well predicted by the model 2 numerical method the double synthetic jet actuator system is depicted in fig 1 the traditional synthetic jet actuators are mostly circular with the nozzle locating at the center of the cavity the synthetic jet actuator in this paper is rectangular and the nozzle locates at one side of the cavity this design is mainly based on the consideration of thrust vectoring the normal and tangential directions are defined in fig 1 the normal direction is parallel with the jet velocity as a result the thrust of the actuator will be mainly in the normal direction as the motion of the diaphragm is unsteady there exists fluid acceleration in the tangential direction as a result the tangential thrust will not be zero if the cavity is circular the total fluid acceleration in the tangential direction will be zero resulting in the zero tangential thrust so the design of the cavity in this paper can generate nonzero tangential thrust as a result thrust vectoring can be realized the thrust vectoring angle can be controlled through adjusting the phase lags between the two actuators the diaphragm of the actuator locates at the bottom of the actuator it is oscillating up and down in the sinusoidal mode 1 v t 2 π f r a m cos 2 π f r t a m stands for the amplitude which is 5 mm f r stands for the frequency which is 10 hz the main geometric parameters of the synthetic jet actuator include diameter and thickness of the orifice as well as diameter and depth of the cavity the definition of the geometrical parameters is given in fig 2 and the value of geometrical parameters is given in table 1 the average velocity of the jet flow can be computed as xia and mohseni 2016 2 v j e t 2 f r l l stands for the height of the fluid column ejected by the actuator in one cycle using 2 the reynolds number is 3 re j e t ρ v j e t d μ using geometrical parameters given in table 1 the reynolds number is 3 5 105 as the rans method can achieve satisfying accuracy with relatively low computation burden it is chosen in this paper to simulate the turbulent jet flow the computation is carried out by using the commercial cfd software fluent coupled with the user definition function udf describing the diaphragm movement pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso based on a higher degree of approximation between the iterative corrections for pressure and velocity is chosen second order upwind spatial discretization is used for the momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate sst k w turbulence model is used to account for the turbulent nature of the synthetic jet flows the length of the double actuator system is much larger than the width of the nozzle so the 3d problem can be computed using 2d mesh the mesh adopted is given in fig 2 b the nozzle is resolved with quadrilateral elements the bottom part of the cavity is meshed with quadrilateral elements to allow for relative displacement among the nodes on the piston all the other parts are resolved with triangular elements the domain near the nozzle has a big influence on the development of the jet to better simulate the jet interaction near the nozzle a refinement region near the nozzle is created the width and height of the refinement region is l 1 and l 2 respectively as given in fig 2 a the value of l 1 and l 2 is given in table using the nozzle diameter d the domain far away from the nozzle has little influence on jet development meshes in this region can be coarser when jet is ejected outside of the cavity the boundary layer near the nozzle wall will evolves into vortexes to accurately simulate the formation and development of vortexes the element height near the nozzle wall is carefully designed the element height of the boundary layer can be computed using dimensionless wall distance y which is given as y δ y ρ μ τ μ for sst k w turbulence model y should be smaller than 2 y 2 is just a criterion to compute the initial guess of the element height the real value is designed through trial and error in this paper after several trials the first element s height of the boundary layer is confirmed to be 0 01 mm the boundary condition is depicted in fig 2 a the driving diaphragm is modeled using moving wall the motion of the moving wall is governed by 1 using udf user defined function the boundary connecting to the moving wall is set to be deforming wall to allow for relative displacement the height of the deforming wall and the elements in the deforming region can adjust automatically based on the motion of the moving boundary the auv surface is modeled with no slipping wall the other boundaries of the outer flow domain are set to be pressure outlet the relative static pressure of the outlet is set to be 0 to simulate the ambient environment which is far away from the nozzle the turbulence intensity of the outlet is set to be 1 the remaining boundaries of the actuator are set to be no slipping wall the default under relaxation parameters are kept at 0 3 1 0 and 0 7 for pressure density and momentum respectively the default of 120 maximum iterations per time step is kept a time step of 1 200f is chosen based on the actuation frequency to allow for 200 time steps per cycle at the beginning of the simulation the flow field has not convergence so in this paper all the data are sampled after three cycles of computation 2 1 numerical method validation the dependence of the numerical method on the grid resolution is studied in this paper two types of grids with different grid resolution are used to compute the tangential and normal thrust of the system the grid size in different zones is defined in fig 3 scav snozzle sbl srefine sout are the grid size of the cavity the nozzle the boundary layer the refinement region and the far region respectively the grid size of the fine and coarse mesh is given in table 2 the tangential and normal thrust under different grid resolutions is depicted in fig 4 it can be seen the thrust under different grid resolutions is close to each other so the influence of the grid resolution on the result can be ignored the numerical simulation of the isolated synthetic jets has been intensively investigated when two synthetic jets are placed side by side the flow field of these two adjacent synthetic jets will interact strongly with each other as a result the flow field of two adjacent synthetic jets is more complicated than that of single isolated synthetic jet in order to validate the effectiveness of the numerical method adopted in the simulation of adjacent synthetic jets the vorticity contour is compared with result given by sajad alimohammadi alimohammadi et al 2016 sajad alimohammadi et al studied the flow vectoring phenomenon in adjacent synthetic jets using cfd and piv for comparison the actuator with the same geometrical parameters and boundary conditions with ref 28 is simulated using numerical method in this paper the vorticity contour when phase lag is 60 is used for comparison fig 5 a c e g are results given in ref 28 and b d f h are results in this paper fig 5 a and b gives vorticity contour when t 0 there are four pairs of vortexes in the flow field vortex i and vortex ii are outside of the cavity the position and the structure of these two vortexes given by sajad alimohammadi is close to numerical result in this paper the tilting of the vortex i is accurately predicted vortex iii and iv is inside of the cavity vortex iii and vortex iv belongs to the current cycle the vortex far from the centerline is much larger in size than the vortex close to the centerline the room for the vortex near the centerline is very limited as a result the development of this vortex is restrained the vortex contour when t t 4 is given in fig 5 c and d it can be seen the vortexes of the two adjacent actuators strongly interact with each other there are three pairs of vortexes outside of the cavity each vortex pair is composed of two vortexes with opposite vorticity vortex pair ii and iii merges with each other forming a larger vortex the interaction between these two vortexes and the structure of the interacted vortexes are close in fig 5 c and d the two pairs of vortexes inside of the cavity also resemble each other when t t 2 the interaction between the two pairs of vortexes stopped and the vortex of the left actuator vortex i in fig 5 e and f almost disappears the tilting of vortex ii is accurately predicted in fig 5 f the structure of the two pairs of vortexes inside the cavity is also close in fig 5 e and f when t 3t 4 the vortex of the right actuator starts to detach from the nozzle as given in fig 5 g and h the tilting and the structure of the vortex are generally accurate from results and discussion given above it can be known the prediction accuracy of vortexes far away from the nozzle and vortexes with weak intensity is generally poor despite of this the tilting the structure and the interaction of the main vortexes can all be predicted with satisfactory accuracy the thrust characteristic of the isolated synthetic jet actuator is intensively studied the thrust of isolated synthetic jet actuator can be well predicted using numerical method in this paper as validated in our previous studies geng and huyang 2018 the thrust of synthetic jet was measured using 6 dof force sensor the force measured by the force sensor includes not just the thrust of the jet but also the inertial and friction force of the system when it is running to compute the thrust of the jet the experiment is carried both in air and underwater only part of the cavity is underwater the inertial and friction force of the system generated by the reciprocal motion of the piston is independent of the medium the thrust of the jet in the air can be neglected in this case the difference between the force in the air and underwater is the thrust of synthetic jet underwater geng and huyang 2018 as modeled by geng lingbo et al geng and huyang 2018 the thrust of synthetic jet can be expressed as 4 f t k q m v m a c c 1 2 k q m v v and a cc stands for the average velocity and average acceleration at the nozzle exit q m is the average mass flow rate m is the total mass accelerated by the actuator k is the parameter describing the velocity distribution at the nozzle exit the interaction between jets will alternate the velocity distribution at the nozzle exit as a result the value of k changes the velocity distribution mainly depends on the near field and the main vortex structures the vortex far away from the nozzle and vortex with weak intensity has little effect on the velocity distribution as results given in fig 5 the numerical method in this paper can accurately predict the vortex in the near field in this case the thrust of adjacent synthetic jets can also be accurately predicted 3 results and analysis 3 1 the effect of nozzle distance the effect of the nozzle distance is studied in this paper the parameter d is defined to be the distance between the centerline of nozzles the definition of the geometrical parameters is depicted in fig 2 the normal and tangential thrust under different nozzle distances is depicted in fig 6 the phase lag between these two actuators is fixed to be π the peak value of the normal thrust changes significantly about 50 when the distance increases from 10 mm to 15 mm when the nozzle distance continues to increase from 15 mm the peak value of the normal thrust changes slowly the normal thrust constitutes of four peaks in one period locating at t 0 t t 4 t t 2 and t 3t 4 respectively from 1 the velocity of the piston is zero at t t 4 and t 3t 4 the velocity of the piston is largest at t t and t t 2 so the thrust peak at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is generated through fluid acceleration from fig 7 a the peak at t t 4 and t 3t 4 increase in magnitude when nozzle distance increases this means the contribution of fluid acceleration to normal thrust increase when nozzle distance increases the phase lag between these two actuators is π which means the jet velocity is exactly reverse in direction the normal thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 can be expressed as 5 t m l a c c l m r a c c r m l m r is the mass of fluid accelerated by the left and right actuator v l v r is the average fluid acceleration of the left and right actuator respectively a c c l and a c c r are of reverse direction from fig 6 a the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is nonzero this means the net effect of fluid acceleration for this dual synthetic jet actuator is not zero as the two actuators are reverse in phase this means the fluid acceleration during suction cycle and stroke cycle is not simply reverse of direction in other words the flow field during stroke cycle and suction cycle is not symmetrical as the two actuators have identical geometrical and actuation parameters a c c l will become a c c r after half period so the period of the acceleration force is t 2 this can be seen from fig 6 a in different cases the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is very close from fig 6 a the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 increases in magnitude when nozzle distance increases as fluid interaction is stronger under small nozzle distance this means the fluid interaction between the adjacent jets will reduce the acceleration effect the thrust peak at t t 2 and t t is generated through jet velocity the thrust can be expressed as 6 t 0 5 k q m v l n q m v l q m v r 0 5 k q m v r n q m is the mass flow rate and v is the average jet velocity k is a parameter describing the velocity distribution at the nozzle exit n is the outer normal vector of the nozzle plane k q m v n stands for the pressure force l stands for the left actuator and r stands for the right actuator as the geometrical and actuation parameters of these two actuators are identical the mass flow rate and average velocity are the same in magnitude but reverse in direction so q m v l q m v r is 0 6 can be simplified as 7 t 0 5 k q m v l n 0 5 k q m v r n the mass flow rate q m and the average velocity v don t depend on nozzle distance so thrust at t t 2 and t t is close in different cases using 5 and 7 the normal thrust can be expressed as 8 t 0 5 k q m v l n 0 5 k q m v r n m l a c c l m r a c c r from fig 6 a the direction of the normal thrust never change in one period the direction of n doesn t change with time so the first two parts of 8 has constant direction the last two parts of 8 change direction every half period this means the normal thrust mainly depends on the pressure force this is evident in fig 6 a as the thrust at t t t t 2 is much larger than thrust at t t 4 the average normal thrust is given in fig 6 c the average normal thrust increases in magnitude with nozzle distance the variation of the average normal thrust is mainly induced by the acceleration term the interaction between the adjacent jets will undermine the acceleration effect the tangential thrust under different nozzle distances is given in fig 6 b tangential thrust has two peaks locating at t 4 and 3t 4 respectively from 1 at t t 4 and t 3t 4 the acceleration is largest this means the tangential thrust is mainly generated through fluid acceleration as a result the tangential thrust has just two peaks locates at 0 25t and 0 75t respectively the first peak at t t 4 decreases in magnitude with nozzle distance the variation of the second peak at t 3t 4 is not obvious the average tangential thrust is given in fig 6 d the average tangential thrust decrease with the nozzle distance when nozzle distance is small the interaction between jets is strong this means the fluid interaction between the adjacent jets can enhance the tangential thrust to better understand the mechanism behind this velocity vector under different nozzle distances is given in fig 7 10 the velocity vector when nozzle distance is 5 mm is given in fig 7 when d 5 mm the interaction between the two adjacent jets is very strong there are two pairs of vortexes in the flow field vortex i and ii belongs to the left jet sj a for simplicity vortex i and ii belongs to the right jet sj b for simplicity when vortex i and ii forms vortex i and ii flows far away from the nozzle when sj b expels fluid sj a is in suction cycle the suction of sj a will deflect vortex i and ii towards sj a as depicted in fig 7 b the suction of sj a will strengthen the intensity of vortex ii so the strength of vortex ii is much stronger than that of vortex i when these two vortexes flows downstream at t 2t 3 vortex ii locates at the left side of sj a at this time sj a starts to expel fluid and vortex i and vortex ii starts to form the direction of vortex i and vortex ii is the same in this case vortex i and vortex ii will merge as given in fig 7 e on the other hand vortex i almost disappear because of the existence of vortex ii fluid is continuously drawn from sj a into vortex ii meanwhile sj b also draws fluid from sj a as sj b is in its suction cycle the suction of vortex ii and sj b is reverse in direction as a result the deflection of sj a is reduced the deflection angle of sj a is much smaller than that of sj b so the net deflection angle of these two adjacent jets is not zero this is consistent with the result given by sajad alimohammadi alimohammadi et al 2016 from result given by sajad alimohammadi the jet always deflects towards the same direction despite the suction of the other actuator as the jets always deflect toward the same direction the net tangential thrust generated by the jet deflection is not zero this is the mechanism behind the generation of net tangential thrust when nozzle distance increases to 20 mm fig 8 the interaction between the two adjacent jets decreases the deflection angle of sj a is still smaller than that of sj b the net deflection angle and the net tangential thrust generated by jet deflection are nonzero when nozzle distance increases to 50 mm fig 9 the interaction becomes very weak the deflection angle of the jet becomes very small the tangential thrust generated by jet deflection will be neglected in this case the tangential thrust is mainly generated through fluid acceleration the velocity distribution at t t 2 and t t is given in figs 10 12 the left plot in fig 10 gives the velocity distribution of the left actuator which is now in its suction cycle the right plot in fig 10 corresponds to the stroke cycle of the right actuator when t t the left actuator switches to stroke cycle while the right one is in suction cycle when nozzle distance is small the velocity distribution of the left and right actuator is different as can be seen from right plot of fig 10 a and left plot of fig 10 b this means the flow field is not symmetrical for the dual actuator system when nozzle distance increases to 80 mm the fluid interaction between these two actuators is negligible the velocity distribution for these two actuators is nearly the same as can be seen from the right plot of figure and the left plot of fig 12 from velocity vectors given above it is evident that the jet will deflect towards the actuator leading in phase in this paper the actuator first ejects fluids and then switches to suction cycle when one actuator sj a for simplicity is leading in phase it will switches to suction cycle earlier than the other one denoted as sj b in this case the jet ejected by sj b will be sucked by sj a jet b will be deflected as a result the vortex of jet b will also deflect toward sj a when sj a begins its stroke cycle and sj b switches to suction cycle the vortex of jet b ejected during the last stroke cycle will restrain the deflection of jet a in this case the deflection of jet a is weaker than that of jet b the net deflection of the jet is toward jet a the one leading in phase when nozzle distance is small the net deflection angle is larger the deflection of the jet will contribute to the tangential thrust besides the acceleration effect in this case the tangential thrust is larger as given in fig 6 b the decrease of the average normal thrust is mainly induced by the acceleration term as can be seen from fig 6 a thrust at t 0 and t t 2 is generated through pressure force k q m v n on the other hand thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 is generated through fluid acceleration from fig 6 a thrust at t 0 and t t 2 doesn t change while thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 increases with nozzle distance especially when nozzle distance is small from velocity vector given when nozzle distance is small the jet of sj a will be sucked by sj b the smaller is the distance more jet will be sucked synthetic jet is pulsed jet the fluid is frequently accelerated decelerated by the actuator the acceleration force is proportional to the total mass accelerated by the dual synthetic jet actuator when jet a is sucked by jet b the total accelerated fluid decreases as a result the thrust at t t 4 and t 3t 4 decrease in magnitude when the two actuators are far away from each other the interaction is negligible every actuator will accelerate part of fluid independently the total accelerated fluid increases 3 2 the effect of phase lag in this section the effect of phase lag is studied the nozzle distance in this section is fixed to be 10 mm the thrust variation and vorticity contour under different phase lags are given thrust model which can precisely predict thrust variation is established the thrust is modeled using potential flow theory thrust generation of double synthetic jet actuator is complicated with physical processes including vortex generation fluid acceleration and jet interaction all these processes are difficult to model precisely the focus of this study is to investigate the characteristic of the double synthetic jet system the thrust model only serves to predict the thrust variation so it is established using potential flow theory with many simplifications only the main physical parameters affecting the thrust variation is modeled the thrust model can precisely predict the thrust variation as given in the following paragraphs however it can t be used to compute the magnitude of the thrust the variation of the normal and tangential thrust under different phase lags denoted as θ is given in fig 13 and 14 respectively the average thrust of synthetic jet can be computed as krieg and mohseni 2013 2015 9 t d o u 2 t ρ π 3 8 d 2 f r 2 l 2 9 is the average thrust of circular synthetic jet l is the height of the fluid column expelled in one period by the actuator f r is the driving frequency of the actuator in this paper the actuator is rectangular in this case the average thrust should be computed as 10 t d o u ρ π 2 2 f r 2 l 2 d l en d stands for the nozzle width and l en stands for the nozzle length all the data points in this paper are normalized using 10 from fig 13 the peak of the tangential thrust first increase when phase lag increase from π 6 to π and then decrease when phase lag increase from π to 2π the tangential thrust of the system can be expressed as 11 t m l a c c l m r a c c r m sin 2 π f r t sin 2 π f r t θ the variation of 11 with m 1 is depicted in fig 15 when θ and t vary the value of 11 composes a 3 d surface the red color represents positive thrust while the blue color represents negative thrust the z θ plane of the 3d surface is given in fig 15 a the amplitude of the tangential thrust corresponds to the chord length of the curve in fig 15 b it can be seen the chord length increases when 0 θ π and decreases when π θ 2π this is consistent with the variation of the amplitude of the tangential thrust the normal thrust can be expressed as 12 t q m l v l k q m l v l n q m r v r k q m r v r n k q m l v l q m r v r k cos 2 2 π f r t v l v l cos 2 2 π f r t θ v r v r k cos 2 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t k cos 2 2 π f r t θ cos 2 π f r t θ cos 2 π f r t θ the variation of 12 with k 1 is depicted in fig 16 similar to 11 all the values of 12 constitute a 3d surface as depicted in fig 16 a the amplitude of the normal thrust corresponds to the chord length of the curve depicted in fig 16 b it can be seen the chord length decrease when 0 θ π and increase when π θ 2π this is consistent with the variation of the amplitude of the normal thrust as depicted in fig 14 the variation of the average thrust is also studied in this paper the total momentum variation of the system in one period is negligible based on the fact that the driving profile of the diaphragm is symmetrical so the average thrust of synthetic jet is mainly generated through pressure force as a result average normal thrust of the double actuator system under phase lag of θ can be expressed as 13 t nor 0 t k 1 2 q m v d t 2 ρ π 2 f r 2 a m 2 s p i s k 0 t cos 2 2 π f r t cos 2 2 π f r t θ d t 1 2 ρ π 2 f r a m 2 s p i s k k ρ π 2 2 f r a m 2 σ s k ρ π 2 2 f r a m 2 σ l e n d s pis is the area of the piston s is the area of the nozzle σ is the area ratio of the piston to the nozzle l en is the length of the nozzle and d is the width of the nozzle the derivation is based on the relation q m ρ s pis v 13 shows the average normal thrust is independent of θ the average normal thrust under different phase lags is given in table 3 similar to thrust in figs 13 and 14 all the data points in table are normalized using 10 from table 3 it can be known the average normal thrust is close to each other the difference between the largest and the smallest value is less than 5 so the average normal thrust can be taken as invariant under different phase lags this is consistent with 13 the average tangential thrust can be expressed as 14 t tan 0 t 2 m l a c c l m r a c c r d t t 2 t m l a c c l m r a c c r d t 0 t 2 m sin 2 π f r t sin 2 π f r t θ t 2 t m sin 2 π f r t sin 2 π f r t θ m 2 π f r cos 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t θ 0 t 2 m 2 π f r cos 2 π f r t cos 2 π f r t θ t 2 t m 2 π f r 2 2 cos θ m is the mass of fluid accelerated during suction cycle and m is the mass of fluid accelerated during stroke cycle from 14 it can be known when θ 0 the average tangential thrust is 0 the average tangential thrust increases when 0 θ π when phase lag is larger than π the average tangential thrust starts to decrease this is consistent with that given in table 3 the thrust vectoring angle can be expressed as 15 α t tan t nor the value of α under different phase lags is given in table 3 the thrust vectoring angle increases when 0 θ π and decreases when π θ 2π the maximum thrust vectoring angle realized by the double actuator system is 11 88 this validates its effectiveness in underwater thrust vectoring the tangential thrust is mainly generated through fluid acceleration the jet deflection also contributes to part of the tangential thrust when two actuators work in phase the flow field is symmetrical in this case the jet deflection and the fluid acceleration are negligible the tangential thrust will be 0 with the increase of the phase lag fluid acceleration and jet deflection are enhanced tangential thrust increases as result from fig 13 when phase lag is small the peak of the tangential thrust locates near t t when t t jet velocity is significant while fluid acceleration is small as can be seen from 1 this means when phase lag is small contribution of jet deflection is larger than fluid acceleration with the increase of the phase lag until θ π the peak of the tangential thrust moves towards t t 4 and t 3t 4 as marked using red arrow in fig 13 this means the contribution of fluid acceleration increase and become dominant in tangential thrust generation when θ is larger than π with the increase of the phase lag the thrust peak starts to move far away from t t 4 or t 3t 4 this means the contribution of fluid acceleration starts to decay the pressure force the jet momentum and the fluid acceleration all contributes to the normal thrust the variation of the normal thrust in figure is mainly induced by these three components when two actuators work in phase the peak of the normal thrust locates at t t 2 or t t at this time the jet velocity is highest while the fluid acceleration is very small this means when phase lag is 0 normal thrust depends on k q m v n and q m v k q m v n always has the same direction despite the direction variation of v on the other hand q m v reverse its direction every half period when k q m v n and q m v has the same direction the normal thrust is q m v k q m v n otherwise the normal thrust is q m v k q m v n as a result the positive and negative thrust peaks are different in magnitude in this paper the negative peak is larger than the positive one with the increase of the phase lag the thrust peak starts to move towards t t 4 as marked using red arrow in fig 14 this means the contribution of the acceleration force increases the thrust peak also decreases in magnitude indicating the weaker contribution of the fluid acceleration than the jet velocity the magnitude of the thrust peak is smallest when phase lag is pi the vorticity contour under different phase lags is given in fig 17 when phase lag is 0 the jet never deflects the flow field is symmetrical about the centerline of the dual actuator system with the increase of the phase lag one jet will deflect due to the suction of the other actuator the deflection angle of the jet leading in phase is smaller than the other one thus the net deflection angle is not zero the jet deflects towards the actuator leading in phase the larger is the phase lag the larger is the deflection angle as can be seen from fig 17 the deflection angle is largest when phase lag is pi when phase lag is larger than pi with the increase of the phase lag the deflection angle starts to decrease and the deflection angle will decrease to be 0 when phase lag is 2π this is consistent with the variation of the thrust vectoring angle as the net deflection angle of the jet is always towards the same direction the thrust vectoring angle is also towards the same direction 4 conclusions a novel thrust vectoring method based on double synthetic jet actuator is studied using numerical simulation the thrust and flow field of the double synthetic jet actuator under different nozzle distances and phase lags are investigated thrust of synthetic jet includes three parts fluid acceleration jet momentum and pressure force respectively the net deflection angle of the jet is always towards the actuator leading in phase despite the suction of the other actuator the deflection of the jet contributes to the tangential thrust both the nozzle distance and phase lag affect the jet deflection the jet deflection angle decreases monotonously when nozzle distance increases the jet deflection angle increase when phase lag increases from 0 to π and decreases when phase lag continues to increase from π to 2π fluid acceleration also contributes to the tangential thrust and the variation of fluid acceleration with phase lag has the same tendency with jet deflection when phase lag is small contribution of jet deflection is much larger than fluid acceleration with the increase of the phase lag the contribution of fluid acceleration increases and becomes dominant in tangential thrust generation the variation tendency of the tangential thrust with phase lag is the same with the jet deflection and fluid acceleration fluid acceleration jet momentum and pressure force all contributes to normal thrust when nozzle distance is small the interaction between the adjacent jets is strong part of the jet a will be sucked by jet b in this case the total accelerated fluid decreases the contribution of fluid acceleration decreases when nozzle distance is large enough the interaction between jets can be neglected the acceleration force increases with the increase of the phase lag the contribution of the acceleration force increases the thrust also decreases in magnitude indicating the weaker contribution of the fluid acceleration than the jet momentum and pressure force the average normal thrust mainly depends on the pressure force the pressure force is not affected by the nozzle distance and phase lag as a result the average normal thrust is independent of the phase lags in this case the variation of the thrust vectoring angle is the same with the average tangential thrust 
22937,condition based maintenance is applied in various industries to monitor and control critical assets and to optimize maintenance efforts its applicability to the offshore wind energy industry has been considered for almost 20 years and has resulted in the development and implementation of solutions that have contributed to lower cost of maintenance and increased asset availability however there is currently no public domain guidance available that provides the information required to i prioritize systems for which condition monitoring would generate highest value and to ii understand the parameters that need to be monitored by a specific system from failure cause to failure mode both items are addressed in this paper providing a clearly structured risk based assessment methodology and corresponding results for state of the art offshore wind turbines a total of 337 failure modes have been identified and analysed by experts representing approximately 70 of the european offshore wind market to assess potential benefits of condition monitoring systems results may be used to target the development of condition monitoring systems focusing on critical systems and to find optimal

mode effects and criticality analysis availability operations and maintenance condition monitoring risk assessment 1 introduction deployment of offshore wind power plants for electricity generation is becoming more and more competitive in various regions around the globe pineda and pierre tardieu 2017 its increasing contribution to the overall energy mix emphasises the requirement to comply with standards ensuring energy security at a price of electricity acceptable for a society european commission 2014 and produced in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner in the early years of offshore wind deployment this demand was often not met examples are the barrow north hoyle scroby sands or kentish flats wind farms wfs in the united kingdom uk that only delivered approximately 60 80 of the electricity that could have been produced had the assets continuously fulfilled the desired function feng et al 2010 the main reasons for this shortcoming were identified in early studies and are mainly i a low reliability of the wind turbines wts p tavner 2012 ii underestimation of access restrictions for conducting maintenance activities gjw van bussel and zaaijer mb 2001 iii non availability of specialised vessels for the aforementioned activities gerard van bussel and schöntag 1997 and iv the application of corrective maintenance i e the initialization of maintenance activities in a reactive manner after the fault of a component or part within the wt system jannie jessen nielsen and sørensen 2011 application of such strategies and corresponding effects on wt availability have been investigated in several publications availability is defined as the fraction of time the wt is producing electricity over the full duration of a certain time interval or the electricity produced over the theoretically producible electricity during a time interval elena gonzalez et al 2017b studies presented in scheu 2012 or rademakers l and braam h 2003 quantify the impact of production losses due to downtime following a corrective maintenance strategy to around 12 m annually for a 500 mw wind farm with the direct cost for corrective maintenance around four times the cost for preventive activities it was understood that preventing failures from occurring has a positive effect on wt availability and accordingly on the cash flow returning from the electricity

farms located close to shore offshore renewable energy catapult 2016 to 98 based on the authors industry experience availability depends on amongst other things the wt site conditions and technical characteristics as presented in feng et al 2010 the efforts made to achieve those availability figures are comprised of preventive maintenance activities such as scheduled replacements of wear parts oil or grease and responsiveness to unforeseen scenarios such as wt faults by for example having a suitable means of access through different types of vessels and or helicopters as well as having spare parts tools and technicians readily available a situation that is well known also for other offshore applications such as wave energy converters a gray et al 2017 as the industry is maturing the maintenance strategies as such are further developed and concepts such as condition based maintenance cbm are investigated according to en 13306 maintenance terminology 2017 cbm is a form of preventive maintenance which includes assessment of physical conditions analysis and the possible ensuing maintenance actions cbm strategies allow for failure prevention by understanding the physics of failure and subsequently the corresponding initiation of targeted maintenance activities implementation of cbm requires installation of sensors and application of analysis tools for various wt operational signals which adds complexity and cost to the operation of a wind farm to exploit the benefits of cbm a strategy needs to be developed that is based on a i thorough understanding of physics of failure and ii a subsequent prioritization of wt systems there is yet no published literature containing an inclusive overview about the most critical failure modes of state of the art owts that includes the rotor nacelle assembly rna substructures and foundations as well as their corresponding failure causes and mechanisms based on operating track records of existing assets and design information this information is essential for prioritization of wt systems to assess their suitability and feasibility for incorporation of condition monitoring systems cms this paper presents a systematic methodology for prioritization of wt systems for the application of cbm strategies commensurate with the most critical wt substructure and foundation failure modes as well as their respective causes and failure mechanisms the contents are based on twelve failure mode effects and criticality fmeca workshops involving experts from companies representing more than 70 of the total installed capacity of offshore wind energy in europe the operating experience includes assets with a total capacity of more than 9 gw supplied from over 2500 single wts the following section presents a literature review concerning cbm and risk prioritization in the wind industry this is followed by an explanation of relevant terminology then a methodology and a results section including critical discussion and conclusions 2 literature review 2 1 condition based maintenance in offshore wind the first widely accepted publications concerning operations and maintenance o m optimization by condition monitoring date back to the late 1990s a comprehensive report published out of the wt ω project verbruggen 2003 presented the state of the art of o m for onshore wind applications at that time it describes the different monitoring techniques applicable for pitch systems gear boxes main bearings and blades as well as global monitoring systems the latter referring to an analysis of system data and alarms for detecting a developing fault this is described later on in this section in more detail as the applied techniques are still used today in the context of artificial intelligence ai offshore wind o m optimization was presented for the first time in 2005 caselitz and giebhardt 2005 this paper specifically focuses on the rotor as critical system within the wind turbine assembly later wilkinson et al 2007 presented an in depth analysis regarding the use of condition monitoring systems on the drive train assemblies with a particular focus on the generator results of the european union eu funded condition monitoring for offshore wind farms conmow project were presented by wiggelinkhuizen et al 2008 the conmow project ran from 2002 to 2007 and is the successor of the wt ω project it described the use of direct and indirect measurement techniques for early fault detection and includes on site application and testing of different techniques the application of condition monitoring techniques has been described in a review paper published in 2009 lu et al 2009 this was followed by sørensen 2009 who firstly included the factor of risk this work was followed in j j nielsen and sørensen 2009 focusing on the application of bayesian theory as well as damage and uncertainty modelling like the other referenced works this paper underlines the potential cost savings by moving from a corrective to a preventive maintenance approach the state of the art of acceleration and strain based measurement techniques and algorithms is described in hameed et al 2009 with a focus on onshore applications but outlining potential benefits for offshore turbines due to accessibility restrictions more practical aspects related to installation and testing of cms are described in hameed et al 2010 they point out that particularly the usage of multiple interacting solutions is a complex undertaking requiring extensive system understanding and programming skills their focus is on wind energy in general i e on and offshore applications an attempt to understand root causes and failure prevention strategies for electrical and electronic assemblies is presented by peter tavner et al 2010 the motivation for this study were the high failure rates of the systems at the time causing long periods of downtime particularly offshore an indirect cms using generator power and rotational speed signals was investigated by wenxian yang et al 2010 this paper addresses again the need for lowering complexity of analysing simultaneously various signals such as direct measurements of vibrations strains or lubrication analyses in order to efficiently monitor the condition of the wt and its systems calculating the remaining useful lifetime of a system by deriving a damage function from operating conditions and or direct signals is described by c s gray and watson 2010 they suggest that real time damage calculation is feasible for various systems however the analysis presented was only focused on the gearbox over the following years the topic of cms received increased attention and can be summarized in four research areas 1 literature focusing on advanced o m strategies through risk and condition based strategies in general 2 literature focusing on the technical description of specific cms based on direct measurements 3 literature focusing on the use of indirect signals through supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems 4 review papers presenting the state of the art in specific research developments and applications papers of high relevance within 1 are el thalji and jantunen 2012 who describe challenges for implementation of cms from an academic and industrial perspective the potential benefit of cms is described by maples et al 2013 who assume that 50 of the wt faults may be detected well in advance by monitoring systems which in turn have the potential to raise availability by 1 2 the value of cbm strategies was also addressed by van horenbeek et al 2013 they conclude that cms offers cost saving potential even for onshore wts however when assessing the correlations in more detail it can be seen that the commercial benefits depend strongly on the ability of the cms to reliably predict a developing fault as a follow up to their previous papers j s nielsen and sørensen 2014 propose the use of monitoring information to be fed in a maintenance decision logic based on bayesian networks in order to refine accuracy of predictions and consequently optimize maintenance decision making from a risk perspective a recent publication leimeister and kolios 2018 describes a generic framework of qualitative and quantitative methods for fault path investigation from a reliability perspective providing information of high relevance for the evaluation of the suitability of cms work published in 2 i e those focusing on direct measurements mainly contain specific technical assessments of the applicability of systems for monitoring the condition of i rna or ii structural components such as towers substructures and foundations relevant publications for components in i are sheng et al 2011 tian et al 2011 kostandyan and sorensen 2012 matthews et al 2015 romero et al 2018 gonzález gonzález et al 2018 artigao et al 2018a in category ii focusing on substructures and foundations the following relevant publications have been identified smolka and cheng 2013 devriendt et al 2014 ziegler and muskulus 2016 martinez luengo et al 2016 ziegler et al 2017 weijtjens et al 2017 ziegler et al 2018 it should be noted that these papers refer to the term structural health monitoring shm which is often used as a synonym of cms for structural items these references mainly address the challenge of determining the remaining useful lifetime of offshore wind turbine owt substructures and foundations with a focus on i reducing the required number of inspections by maintaining an acceptable confidence in structural integrity and ii enabling the operation of an owt longer than its intended service life generally referred to as life time extension lte the topic of using scada data for maintenance purposes 3 was first introduced by verbruggen 2003 in recent years from 2010 onwards this topic has gained increased attention these indirect data analysis techniques are today often referred to as predictive maintenance the concept was introduced to offshore wind cms by garcia sanz bobi and del pico 2006 and subsequently by kusiak and li 2011 lapira et al 2012 and wenxian yang court and jiang 2013 from 2015 onwards the topic has gained even more momentum underlined by recent publications such as reder et al 2016 e gonzalez et al 2016 colone et al 2017 elena gonzalez et al 2017a nabati and thoben 2017 e gonzalez et al 2018 dao et al 2018 arcadius tokognon et al 2017 first results presented show promising potentials even though some challenges are still to be addressed in current and futuree research outstanding challenges amongst others are the limited number of components on which the respective machine learning techniques are applicable to and a challenging system identification process that potentially requires linking scada data with direct measurements stemming from strain gauges or accelerometers on the other hand the suggested techniques make efficient use of already available measurements instead of requiring transmission handling storage and analysis of new data which would ultimately result in increased and expensive data management this overall trend is further reflected by current research activities such as the project from which this paper has been developed romeo project 2018 in 4 review papers concerning cms are presented on average one paper per year is published that either focuses on one specific aspect or monitoring in general the most recent are sharma and mahto 2013 nie and wang 2013 tchakoua et al 2014 coronado and fischer 2015 tautz weinert and watson 2017 wang et al 2018 w yang 2016 two publications that link the aspect of risk in the form of a failure mode and effect analysis with offshore wind o m optimization and cms are shafiee and dinmohammadi 2014 and zhou et al 2015 the most comprehensive review of developments in the field of wind turbine reliability considering the potential value of cms is presented in artigao et al 2018b the latter two papers are most relevant for this research as they investigate the problem of the value of cms from a risk perspective rather than on the pure technological feasibility in other words they investigate the likelihood and consequence of the fault of a certain wt component or system in order to make a judgement concerning the potential value of implementing a certain monitoring system it has been shown that a great amount of work has been done to develop test and implement cms shm systems over the past years the focus lies on critical systems which cause long cause long periods of downtime and high costs of failure furthermore for all systems investigated there are records of actual single or serial faults from the field thus it can be concluded that the natural prioritization of systems is reasonable as it focuses on systems whose failure is known to have severe consequences considering the view of an offshore wind developer or operator however one may argue that a prioritization solely based on observed scenarios may be incomplete requiring a greater cohesive and complete system analysis for prioritization of cms developments therefore offering improvement potential for operating performance and maintenance efficiency one approach of doing this is to apply the concept of risk which is explained in more detail in the following section 2 2 risk prioritization and fme c a the concept of risk helps to prioritize systems by assessing which scenarios may occur for instance a component failure how likely is this to happen and what the associated consequences are consequences may be evaluated in different categories depending on the purpose of the risk assessment often they include cost and asset value implications asset availability as a main performance indicator considerations towards health and safety of personnel and environmental impact norsok standard z 008 2001 several qualitative and quantitative methods may be applied to prioritize a system or failure scenario for further investigation a widely applied reference for risk assessment methodologies is the iso 31000 series of standards iso31000 2009 iso31010 2010 from these standards the failure mode and effect analysis fmea is one of the most relevant techniques for creating transparency of the failure scenarios with the highest relevance in the context of the operation of physical assets this thesis is supported by the various publications referred to below a fmea is a logical qualitative risk assessment process aimed at evaluating failure modes fms of a process procedure or system their causes and effects when extended by criticality analysis ca for failure modes classification by including estimates of the likelihood and the severity of each failure mode it is known as failure mode effects and criticality analysis fmeca which is classified as a semi quantitative reliability method it is commonly defined as a systematic process for identifying potential design and process failures before they occur with the intent to eliminate them or minimise the risk associated with them juhaszova 2013 by quantitatively assessing each of the fms it is possible to measure their criticality enabling their prioritization and subsequent identification of appropriate mitigation measures fme c a is an accepted risk assessment technique for functional analysis as per iso31010 2010 which can be applied throughout the complete life cycle of a physical asset from design to decommissioning the fmeca discipline was originally developed in the united sates military and was first formally formulated in 1949 with mil std 1629a which is reflected in the document referred to in reliability analysis centre 1993 it was used as a reliability evaluation technique to assess the effect and consequences of system or equipment failures towards financial and non financial aspects such as safety or the reputation of an organization the technique has been in use for a long period of time especially in the aerospace industry with the development of the smc regulation 800 31 jackson et al 1995 and the automotive industry with sae j1739 surface vehicle standard 2009 however the most widely used standard is mil std 1629a which has been applied in many industries for general failure analysis at present the standards that are usually referred to when carrying out an fme c a include bs en 60812 2006 en 60812 2006 and bs en 5760 5 1991 british standards institution 1991 for more practical guidance see moubray 1992 specifically in the wind industry shafiee and dinmohammadi 2014 presented a systematic review of maintenance optimization methods and strategies within the offshore wind industry over the past few decades the fmea technique was used by arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 in evaluating an existing design of a 2 mw wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generator dfig against a hypothetical brushless doubly fed generator bdfg within the eu fp7 reliawind project peinke et al 2007 it concluded that the fmea is a technique that could significantly contribute to achieving long term cost effective systems this project identified more than 150 different types of components for a wind turbine which have been used as the basis for wt breakdown in upcoming studies this is similar to the work conducted by gauravkumar bharatbhai 2015 who presented a reliability analysis of repower 5 mw wt by means of different tools such as fme c a the study concluded that the overall reliability of the 5 mw wt was very low identified areas susceptible of failure and highlighted those with the need and potential to have condition monitoring systems fitted k fischer et al 2012 applied the concept of rcm in the form of a fmeca workshop with the owner operator and industry experts to assess two wind turbine models vestas v44 600 kw and v90 2 mw kahrobaee and asgarpoor 2011 elaborated the limitations of a traditional fmea or fmeca when applied to the assessment of wind turbines they presented a quantitative approach called risk based fmea based on failure probabilities and incurred failure costs and applied this to a direct drive wind turbine case study similarly dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 developed a fuzzy failure mode and effects analysis fmea approach for risk and failure mode analysis of offshore wind turbine systems most recently kang et al 2017 applied the fmea method to conduct a reliability analysis of floating offshore wind turbines fowt contrary to onshore wind turbines or bottom fixed offshore wind turbines fowts are characterised by a complex structure formed by interdependent sub systems for this reason an alternative fmea method named correlation fmea was applied interestingly the study revealed that the foundation structure and mooring system were high relevance systems as a result of the many dimensions associated with potentially severe consequence of failure furthermore luengo and kolios 2015 presented a comprehensive list of failure modes of owt with particular focus on end of life considerations the literature review in this section has shown that significant research has been conducted in the area of risk prioritization and risk based maintenance optimization there are also some distinct papers specifically addressing the problem of prioritizing cms based on the risk profile of a specific system zhou et al 2015 applied an fmeca for prioritization of cms they focus on representing fmeca information in an ontology in order to enable sophisticated fault diagnosis the paper has a strong emphasis on information technology it and the applicability of using actual fault diagnosis techniques in operation this is also shown by the baseline scenario in which a 1 mw mega watt onshore wt is used as example it includes failure modes and causes for the main wt systems however the data provided is limited to an onshore wt hence does not represent the latest technological state of the art and likewise does not contain information about owt substructures in summary this paper provides good insights into how to efficiently use information e g from an fmeca in order to implement fault diagnosis in an operational wind farm but it lacks assessing typical failure modes of latest offshore wind turbines a highly relevant work was also published by artigao et al 2018b they use reliability statistics and maintenance track records for assigning criticality levels to wt systems in order to prioritize scenarios for cms this paper is the most comprehensive literature available describing in detail asset reliability of wind turbines the study reveals however that availability of reliability data for offshore wind is much more limited than for onshore wind in fact it only refers to one study providing reliability data for a portfolio of wind farms rather than a single array this study was published by carroll et al 2016 and contains highly relevant information for all those stakeholders involved in offshore wind o m artigao condenses the information from carroll s study including in addition twelve other publicly available reliability statistics to identify the top five contributors to asset downtime i e systems with a high failure rate and or long durations for repair or replacement the study concludes with the recommendation to focus development efforts for cms on five systems however a detailed overview concerning which failure modes any particular system should focus upon is not included their study also omits the element of the foundation and substructures in offshore wind those items are subject to a very harsh environment and achieving long term integrity whilst minimising the inspection and maintenance costs is crucial for increasing the overall cost efficiency in order to assess the applicability of cms this information is essential and it is therefore desirable to link cms to the failure rates and downtimes of the systems they refer to 3 methodology 3 1 wind turbine system description this paper addresses the applicability of cms for main owt systems in the rna as shown in fig 1 below and foundation and substructure items it should be noted that modern owt often use direct drive generators instead of a gearbox configuration as shown below for further information on this see polinder et al 2006 and t fischer 2012 for illustration and explanations of the offshore substructure concepts relevant to this study i e monopile and jacket structures for detailed descriptions of the main wind turbine systems subassemblies and components see burton et al 2001 3 2 o m terminology the main wt components are subject to preventive and corrective maintenance activities see fig 2 preventive measures are intending to avoid any fault occurrence whilst corrective measures are those activities taking place subsequent to a component failure en 13306 maintenance terminology 2017 cms can in general terms allow for condition based maintenance which in a more sophisticated approach can be translated to a predictive maintenance strategy predictive maintenance is defined as condition based maintenance carried out following a forecast derived from repeated analysis or known characteristics and evaluation of the significant parameters of the degradation of the item en 13306 maintenance terminology 2017 this form of maintenance offers inherent optimization potential for both preventive and corrective maintenance activities a corrective maintenance strategy has the advantage that the useful lifetime of the item is always fully utilized this means that there is no waste of resources caused by e g a preventive replacement of the item or parts of it on the other hand the disadvantages of a corrective maintenance strategy are that i it relies on a quick reaction time to avoid significant production losses during downtime and ii it can potentially cause indirect costs e g if secondary damages are caused when the item fails the offshore wind industry is moving more and more towards preventive maintenance strategies as long periods of inaccessibility can cause substantial financial losses in case a wind turbine is out of production and cannot be brought back into an operational state a preventive maintenance strategy has the advantage of keeping the asset delivering in a more constant and reliable manner electricity and thus ensures a stable financial income the disadvantage of a preventive maintenance strategy is that it comes at least initially at a higher cost any preventive equipment check overhaul replacement or testing campaign has a cost associated with it a practicable balance must be found between the efforts put into a preventive maintenance campaign and the risk of the component to fail depending on the details of the preventive maintenance strategy there is a possibility of over maintaining this means that for example a component is replaced far earlier than the end of its useful lifetime which is the type of scenario that can be avoided by applying a corrective maintenance strategy a way to mitigate the disadvantages of each of the above strategies is to apply a condition based or predictive maintenance approach within either of these approaches maintenance activities are only carried out when they are actually required i e the item is not unnecessarily over maintained but it will also not fail unexpectedly this is only possible if accurate information on the condition of the item and the associated degradation mechanisms are obtained at any time condition based strategies rely on information based on data gathered by continuous or periodic online or offline condition monitoring systems it must be distinguished between diagnosis and prognosis systems the following definition can be used to differentiate between the two diagnosis is an assessment about the current and past health of a system based on observed symptoms and prognosis is an assessment of the future health mathur et al 2001 3 3 failure assessment and risk prioritization while the potential benefits of a cbm strategy appear obvious a certain effort is required to develop and implement the required systems to reliably provide information about an items current condition it is therefore desirable to prioritize certain components and failure modes with respect to a potential cbm strategy rather than trying to implement it for the entire system a risk based approach is deemed as the most suitable technique for such prioritization based on the author s industry experience and the literature review conducted on this topic an approach based on the fmeca methodology has been developed and applied as explained below in order to gather the relevant information a total of twelve fmeca workshops were held involving more than 40 technical experts mechanical electrical structural o m reliability from leading european offshore wind developers wind turbine manufacturers expert consultancies and universities where applicable data from the wind turbine manufacturer s and structural design documentation the developers or wt manufacturer s operating track record as well as any other relevant experience from the participants was fed into the process for generation of the most optimal and representative results covering the different viewpoints of the stakeholders the process followed is presented in fig 3 below the first author of this paper has acted as workshop leader i e the workshop preparation and moderation were in his responsibility the participants of the workshops were selected in accordance with the requirements for experience within each field relevant industry experience of 5 years was the general requirement but most of the participants were significantly more experienced due to privacy protection reasons further detail on the participant s profiles is omitted the first step was to divide the assets under consideration into systems and components an rds pp reference designation system for power plants vgb standard rds pp application guideline part 32 wind power plants 2014 structure was used to organize the system breakdown in accordance with the equipment s functional location floc this process was conducted considering the wind turbine manufacturer and end user requirements in step 2 the description of the main function was added to each item this description reflects the main design intention and helps at a later stage to assess effects and consequences of a functional failure the failure mode as documented in step 3 contains information about the event which causes a functional failure in basic terms it answers the what happens question not to be confused with the failure cause european standard 14224 2006 the failure cause describes what made the failure mode to occur not to be confused with the failure mechanism european standard 14224 2006 this is documented in step 4 in order to be able to document the likeliest root causes of the failure mode under consideration in the next question answered in step 5 the information about the likelihood of a failure scenario to occur is documented the likelihood of occurrence assessment is a vital part of any risk assessment generally the likelihood of occurrence or probability of occurrence can be assessed quantitatively semi quantitatively or qualitatively quantitative and semi quantitative approaches are applicable if there is an operating track record available of the item under consideration providing statistically viable information i e the information about an items reliability can be obtained from actual data records this approach is not applicable for items which have been in operation for a short period of time therefore qualitative engineering judgment was used for the assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of the given scenarios the mentioned judgments were supported by numerical calculations other modelling techniques or experience from other fields of application of a similar technology where possible within this research project the assets under consideration are of differing ages i e for some assets an operating track record of several years is available whereas others have been in operation only for a relatively short period of time or not even built due to this differing characteristic a qualitative assessment approach has been chosen for the likelihood of occurrence evaluation table 1 summarizes the three levels that have been used the failure end effect documented in step 6 describes what happens when a failure mode occurs not to be confused with failure consequence moubray 1992 it is this scenario which is assessed in terms of consequence in subsequent steps the failure effect description shall consider the realistic worst case scenario in step 7 the β factor is analysed and documented the β factor represents the conditional probability of the failure end effect described in step 6 to materialize given that the failure mode has already occurred it is used to account for the failure progression mitigation measures which would prevent the end effect to occur in case of failure mode occurrence the categories that have been considered in the course of the romeo project are presented in table 2 in step 8 the consequence of the described failure end effect is assessed this step describes why and how a scenario matters different consequence categories were defined in accordance with the project requirements and industry standard practices they encompass safety environment spare part cost production availability and type of intervention three consequence levels were introduced in each category representing their respective severity categorization marginal medium and critical consequences are assessed per individual asset i e per one wind turbine and its individual systems park array full system effects scale effects etc are not considered in this assessment economic consequences are split into direct and indirect cost with the latter referring to production losses this split allows for the identification of items which may be repairable at low cost but potentially having a significant influence on availability vice versa in addition there is a distinction between the types of intervention required in order to account for the impact of specialised resources and logistics required to carry out certain activities the realistic failure end effect of a scenario is assessed with respect to the consequence levels each carrying the same weight in the assessment weighted factoring is omitted here i e eventual weighting shall be reflected by the categorization consequence groups and levels were agreed upon in the expert forum involved in this project as referred to earlier they reflect the particular risk appetite of this specific group of experts and therefore have potential for adjustment risk analysis consequence groups and levels are summarized in table 3 below the criticality value is calculated in step 9 the criticality value provides a quantified result combining the earlier collected information about the potential failure mode the likelihood of occurrence and β factor as well as the consequences of the effect the formula used for the calculation of the criticality is given below this formula relies on the values denoted as factor as listed in the tables above i e a value of 1 3 representing the likelihood of occurrence the β factor and the severity summation c r i t i c a l i t y l i k e l i h o o d β s e v e r i t y the combined result is a value between 5 and 135 for risk evaluation purposes the following categorization presented in table 4 was discussed among the forum of industry experts and reflects the common understanding of acceptable boundaries it should be noted however that these values or classes ultimately depend on the risk appetite of stakeholders and therefore may change see table 5 all failure modes which were either in the medium or high risk category were prioritized and have been further assessed as part of steps 10 to 13 in step 10 the failure mechanisms of any prioritized failure mode were analysed by in depth evaluation of the physical chemical or other processes leading to the failure this information forms the basis for establishing a list of desirable monitoring systems and their requirements steps 10 to 13 were carried out separately for structures and rna this is because structures here monopile and jacket substructures are handled differently to the turbine main systems here blades pitch system yaw system main shaft gearbox generator transformer and converter during the operational phase of a wind farm in general terms structures are subject to an inspection and monitoring regime aimed to verify their structural integrity is maintained throughout the intended lifetime of the asset wind turbine rna components are on the other hand predominantly subject to regular maintenance campaigns which ensure that the components and systems are fit for their desired purpose this main difference is respected by following specific measures in the course of the fmeca process 3 4 benchmarking of wind turbine rna component monitoring options a common method to evaluate the performance of a monitoring system is the pf interval this is defined as the time interval between the detection of a developing fault and the failure occurrence as illustrated in fig 4 below this example shows a fictitious component with a certain performance requirement as soon as the performance falls below the required value the component is considered to be in a failed state this represents the f of the pf interval a and b represent measurements derived from condition monitoring systems in this particular example a is capable of detecting the fault development at time p1 and b is capable of detecting the failure at time p2 the interval between the potential fault detection px and the actual fault f is defined as pf interval the pf interval is used as a performance indicator for condition monitoring systems the longer this interval is and the more accurately the exact point in time of failure occurrence can be estimated the more benefits can be obtained by applying the system for prioritization of monitoring systems for main turbine components the pf interval achievable with contemporary commercially available monitoring systems has been compared with the potential pf interval of any imaginable monitoring system this is done by following the process shown below describe any currently used monitoring system for the failure mechanism under consideration estimate the pf interval achievable with the monitoring system applied today describe how a future monitoring system could look like and what its performance criteria are estimate the potential cost savings achievable by applying the new monitoring system estimate the expected downtime reduction by applying the new monitoring system points 4 and 5 are assessed based on the same levels used in step 8 of the criticality assessment i e three levels for cost savings and three levels for downtime reduction a second prioritization is then performed based on the calculated benefits for the specific monitoring system the respective categories used in the context of this project are provided in table 6 below and reflect the judgement of the industry experts involved in this research project see tables 7 11 any evaluation of the medium and high categories represents an improvement over the current status it should be noted that not all critical failure modes have been assessed in such level of detail this caveat applied in those cases where the respective scenario was already covered by another measure or for those where the failure mechanism did not show any degradation pattern sudden failure and therefore was not considered suitable for monitoring 3 5 benchmarking of substructure structural monitoring options an alternative method to assess the potential of a substructure monitoring system is proposed as the pf interval concept used for the wind turbine rna components has limited applicability for this particular system and components firstly the fmeca results were reviewed and all relevant failure modes extracted the next step consisted of an analysis of these failure modes and a review of the failure mechanism from root cause to failure mode with the objective of assessing the potential for monitoring based on known damage mechanisms prior to failure a benchmark study of substructure monitoring systems was then performed this study focused on those mechanisms that take sufficient time before a failure materialises hence allow sufficient time to react and plan for maintenance mobilization failure prevention or mitigation a number of five core questions were formulated to assess the suitability of monitoring systems for each of the previously identified structural failure modes and mechanisms the questions are can the inspection frequency be reduced can the inspection depth extent be reduced is it possible to defer unplanned maintenance activities is an update of structural capacity enabled can secondary damages be mitigated or prevented by applying a monitoring system the scope of the study was narrowed down to cover primary structural items i e the main items with the function to provide structural integrity and load bearing capacity throughout the lifetime also the scope focused on the submerged section of those primary structural items this is the area of most interest as any inspection activity in this environment is very costly and generally poses an increased risk to personal safety particularly if divers are used the five questions listed above were answered by the forum of technical experts during the workshops by a simple yes or no a yes infers an improvement compared to the current situation while a no refers to no improvement if a monitoring system was judged to not improving the situation compared to today it did not qualify for further assessment 4 results 4 1 overview a presentation of the main observations made during the implementation of the fmeca process outlined above is provided in this section fig 5 shows an overview of the overall distribution of identified failure modes for each of the main systems within the scope of the project the largest proportion is related to the substructure i e approximately one third of the 337 failures identified fall into this category one reason for this may be that the analysis has been done for the specific purpose of identifying areas that would potentially profit from the application of monitoring systems looking deeper into the failure modes assessed for substructures it can be seen that all of them are related to submerged items those items are by nature rather difficult to be inspected so that a tendency for prioritizing them for monitoring can be interpreted as the natural reaction of the experts involved the second most common failure modes are related to the transformer both systems together make up almost half of all failure modes the remaining main systems carry each a comparable weight with values of 16 30 failure modes per item the pitch system is the smallest contributor of the investigated failure modes with only 5 failure modes this can be justified by the fact that this system was initially not part of the scope of work therefore the focus was rather limited if compared to the predominating failure modes of the rotor system the distribution of the overall system criticality is shown in fig 6 below the graph shows the number of failure modes rated with the corresponding criticality value on the horizontal axis most of the failure modes are in the medium region approx 30 a peak of critical items can be observed towards the right of the figure from 54 onwards as described in the methodology section only those failure modes with criticality values greater or equal than 44 have been prioritized fig 7 shows the proportion of criticality numbers per system in this criticality region the overall result looks comparable to fig 6 however the transformer system the converter and the blade bearings show now a slightly higher number of critical failure modes when compared to the other systems the critical failure modes fm including a description of their likely cause and mechanism and potential benefit for monitoring category are presented in the following sections since several failure causes may lead to the same failure mode some of the tables presented contain repetitions of the same failure mode since the presentation of all potential failure paths needs to be assessed for evaluating the suitability of a monitoring system also the paths resulting to the same failure modes have been included and are presented 4 2 blades four of the blade system failure modes have been prioritized for further investigation of monitoring systems one fm is related to incorrect application of adhesives and is therefore not assessed in more detail with respect to a possible cbm strategy of the remaining three monitoring of cracks and delamination could provide high value whereas top coat damage and delamination caused by design errors would not be relevant and therefore be prevented by the application of monitoring during operation 4 3 blade bearings five out of six identified critical failure modes could benefit from the application of monitoring systems all of them are related to material failures that show a time dependency fatigue and wear several monitoring techniques may be investigated to detect developing failures based on those mechanisms well in advance respecting the different potential main causes 4 4 pitch system only one critical failure mode namely wear of the pitch gears has been identified a potential monitoring system was however not assessed the current most common maintenance strategy is run to failure and a monitoring system was not deemed beneficial 4 5 main shaft a large number of failure modes have been identified for the main shaft where also the main bearing is considered the bearing assessment is similar to the blade bearing assessment i e a significant improvement over present practice can be achieved by the use of monitoring systems other potential failure modes of the main shaft such as excessive vibration leakages or fabrication issues are not expected to have an improvement over the current situation 4 6 gearbox four monitoring systems would potentially improve the pf interval of the prioritized fms of the gearbox compared to today the failure mechanisms to be detected cover different fatigue and wear processes as well as various temperature related effects 4 7 generator significant improvements in the current operation and maintenance of the generator system can be achieved by means of monitoring nine mechanisms have been assessed in detail and all of them rank the highest when assessing their impact on pf intervals the failure mechanisms cover material degradation and overheating as well as mechanical failures related to vibration and electrical faults related to isolation specifically monitoring the latter electrical failure mechanisms is considered a great improvement to today 4 8 transformer the largest number of failure modes has been identified and prioritized for transformer systems the failure modes and mechanisms are to a large extent comparable to those identified for the generator i e related to material and electrical faults however there are limited possibilities to monitor specific failure modes of the transformer which leads to further consideration of only two failure modes as having large improvement potential 4 9 converter improvement potential is expected for three out of the seven identified failure modes in the converter system two are related to material failure mechanisms which are expected to have detectable degradation patterns over time the other one relates to an electrical short circuit which could also be detected early by analysing simultaneously temperature current and voltage signals 4 10 yaw system only one out of the seven identified and prioritized failure modes of the yaw system is deemed to offer a significant improvement potential this relates to defects in the yaw motor or yaw gear which may be detected remotely by automatic data analysis methods other failure mechanisms may also be monitored however the impact in respect to pf interval improvement is deemed limited 4 11 jacket and monopile support structure the results show that all assessed and prioritized failure modes in the substructure system have the potential for improvement if compared to their current situation as of today in the event monitoring systems are applied successfully the total benefit rating for each failure mode gives an indication on the overall impact and benefit of the monitoring application for the assessed failure mechanism generally the greatest impact resulting from the application of monitoring systems is deemed to be achieved in the mitigation or prevention of secondary damages 84 this is followed by the possibility of providing the basis structural capacity update 68 and deferment of unplanned maintenance activities 64 approximately 50 of the assessed failure modes will benefit from a reduction in the substructure inspection frequency and the inspection extent refer to section 3 5 for further details 5 discussion a risk based approach has been applied to prioritize owt systems for analysing the potential value of implementing a cbm strategy this is based upon extensive expert experience but also long term operating track records of a large proportion of all wind farms located in european seas a comparison study with different other publicly available risk prioritization studies for wt systems has been carried out to enable investigation of any possible differences that could arise from the particular focus of study the different data and knowledge bases table 17 shows risk priority of the different studies for this paper study 1 the number of critical failure modes identified for each system has been documented this number reflects the focus for cms developments which has been the main objective of the fmeca conducted for achieving those results in kang et al 2017 study 2 the focus is on system reliability of floating owts the authors intend to identify interconnections between systems to improve overall system reliability in gauravkumar bharatbhai 2015 study 3 the focus is somewhat similar except that this study is specifically done for a 5 mw owt on a bottom fixed substructure a risk analysis and failure mode prioritization is presented in study 4 by kougioumtzoglou and lazakis 2015 looking at the optimization of o m of offshore wt systems study 5 presented in dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 attempts to solve some weaknesses of conventional fmeas by introducing fuzzy logic the final aim of this study was to improve system reliability and to optimize maintenance by using any possible data input such as expert opinions but also scada data study 6 presented in kahrobaee and asgarpoor 2011 focuses on failure effect mitigation by thorough understanding of system failure modes and causes this study was applied to an onshore wt system study 7 presented in arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 focuses on system reliability improvement of future designs of onshore wts see tables 12 16 it should be noted that system topology is not consistent throughout the studies this is reflected by zeros in the table below meaning that a specific item may have been included in study x but not in study y the items were grouped into subassemblies and systems as appropriate and in accordance with industry practice in all cases the total sum of individual contributors totals 100 towers and substructures account for almost one third of all critical failure modes identified in the course of this paper this number is unprecedented in the context of the literature available in this subject area in studies 2 3 6 and 7 this category contributes less than 10 of the critical fms whereas the contribution is rather significant in studies 4 and 5 which have a strong focus on o m optimization of owt studies 2 and 3 focus on system reliability studies 6 and 7 deal with onshore wind applications and therefore do not contain the critical submerged area that is mostly associated with the critical fms identified in this study it can therefore be concluded that studies focusing on o m and condition monitoring account more for structural fms than those focused on system reliability or onshore wind applications the second highest priority for cms developments is related to the transformer system this system is identified as somewhat critical in study 2 however not at the magnitude reported in this present paper the other studies either did not include the transformer in their assessment or this system did not contribute significantly to the most critical fms it should be noted that some studies refer to converter and transformer in one system but even if this would be the case for all studies this assembly would not be in the foremost position of risk priority a particular observation is made for the generator system of study 2 with more than 40 this system is the most significant in study 2 from the original paper it appears that this is due to the specific nature of fowt application kang et al 2017 interestingly the generator is a top risk also for the onshore specific studies number 6 and 7 furthermore main shaft and bearing are included in the generator assembly in kang s study which explains the rather high risk priority number with around one quarter of the critical fms the drive train components consisting of main shaft main bearing gearbox and generator are still deemed a critical assembly in this study which is in accordance with earlier studies the blade assembly does not contribute significantly to the critical failure modes in this study however it carries some weight in the onshore studies 6 and 7 as well as in a former offshore study 5 it appears as if the respective fms are well covered by o m technology such as sensors in more recent applications the same reasoning applies to the pitch system which is less of a focus in this study but contributes significantly to critical fms in earlier studies particularly number 3 and 4 which relate to improved o m and system reliability overall the referred studies have a similar profile however this paper in particular emphasises the potential of cms developments for substructures and foundations as well as transformer systems and the main shaft including main bearing it is found that the proposed methodology ensures that i expert knowledge ii operating track records and iii design information is used collectively enabling a comprehensive all encompassing transparent system analysis development efforts for condition monitoring systems can in this manner be targeted towards the most critical systems it may be argued however that costs for developing and implementing monitoring systems are not included in this study which makes it difficult to assess the cost effectiveness in the long term of such systems it may also be argued that the results presented only compare the state of the art i e what is currently been done and the application of condition monitoring other strategies such as increased efforts for predetermined preventive maintenance for instance are not considered in the assessment such strategies may lead to a different risk prioritization that could eliminate or mitigate some of the failure modes prioritized in this study regarding both points it should be noted that the objective of this study is to provide an un biased and realistic risk analysis of wind turbine systems for each specific failure mode a number of different ways forward can be considered based on the results obtained in the analysis this study has considered the development of a monitoring solution for specific prioritized failure modes such a development should be preceded by a comprehensive evaluation of the opportunities and limitations of all possible options for failure mode treatment this should be supported by a thorough cost analysis in order to assess the impact of each of the options in a fully transparent manner 6 conclusion this paper presents the most critical failure modes of state of the art offshore wind turbine systems each failure mode is investigated considering the opportunity to optimize o m less inspections or higher pf interval through the application of condition monitoring systems failure causes and mechanisms are evaluated in order to establish the degradation patterns that may be potentially identified by a monitoring system a total of 337 individual failure modes have been identified and analysed by a consortium representing more than 70 of the total offshore wind capacity installed in europe today results were to some extent in accordance with other studies however a particular potential for monitoring of substructures and foundations as well as transformer systems and the main shaft including main bearing has been identified further work involves the prioritization of all failure modes to be followed by the development of diagnosis and prognosis tools to be implemented in pilot tests at the teesside wikinger and east anglia offshore wind farms this study provides the reader with a structured and transparent risk based assessment methodology that helps optimize o m and to minimise operational expenditure it further provides detailed information about the paths leading to critical failure modes those paths must be understood in order to properly design targeted and useful condition monitoring systems as a first of its kind this paper draws upon extensive operating experience making the methodology and results highly applicable to the

22937,condition based maintenance is applied in various industries to monitor and control critical assets and to optimize maintenance efforts its applicability to the offshore wind energy industry has been considered for almost 20 years and has resulted in the development and implementation of solutions that have contributed to lower cost of maintenance and increased asset availability however there is currently no public domain guidance available that provides the information required to i prioritize systems for which condition monitoring would generate highest value and to ii understand the parameters that need to be monitored by a specific system from failure cause to failure mode both items are addressed in this paper providing a clearly structured risk based assessment methodology and corresponding results for state of the art offshore wind turbines a total of 337 failure modes have been identified and analysed by experts representing approximately 70 of the european offshore wind market to assess potential benefits of condition monitoring systems results may be used to target the development of condition monitoring systems focusing on critical systems and to find optimal o m strategies by understanding failure paths of main offshore wind turbine systems resulting in a lower cost of energy and a more optimal risk return balance keywords offshore wind energy failure mode effects and criticality analysis availability operations and maintenance condition monitoring risk assessment 1 introduction deployment of offshore wind power plants for electricity generation is becoming more and more competitive in various regions around the globe pineda and pierre tardieu 2017 its increasing contribution to the overall energy mix emphasises the requirement to comply with standards ensuring energy security at a price of electricity acceptable for a society european commission 2014 and produced in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner in the early years of offshore wind deployment this demand was often not met examples are the barrow north hoyle scroby sands or kentish flats wind farms wfs in the united kingdom uk that only delivered approximately 60 80 of the electricity that could have been produced had the assets continuously fulfilled the desired function feng et al 2010 the main reasons for this shortcoming were identified in early studies and are mainly i a low reliability of the wind turbines wts p tavner 2012 ii underestimation of access restrictions for conducting maintenance activities gjw van bussel and zaaijer mb 2001 iii non availability of specialised vessels for the aforementioned activities gerard van bussel and schöntag 1997 and iv the application of corrective maintenance i e the initialization of maintenance activities in a reactive manner after the fault of a component or part within the wt system jannie jessen nielsen and sørensen 2011 application of such strategies and corresponding effects on wt availability have been investigated in several publications availability is defined as the fraction of time the wt is producing electricity over the full duration of a certain time interval or the electricity produced over the theoretically producible electricity during a time interval elena gonzalez et al 2017b studies presented in scheu 2012 or rademakers l and braam h 2003 quantify the impact of production losses due to downtime following a corrective maintenance strategy to around 12 m annually for a 500 mw wind farm with the direct cost for corrective maintenance around four times the cost for preventive activities it was understood that preventing failures from occurring has a positive effect on wt availability and accordingly on the cash flow returning from the electricity sold significant efforts have therefore been made to keep wts in an operational state to reliably produce electricity availability figures rose in the following years reaching values of 95 for wind farms located close to shore offshore renewable energy catapult 2016 to 98 based on the authors industry experience availability depends on amongst other things the wt site conditions and technical characteristics as presented in feng et al 2010 the efforts made to achieve those availability figures are comprised of preventive maintenance activities such as scheduled replacements of wear parts oil or grease and responsiveness to unforeseen scenarios such as wt faults by for example having a suitable means of access through different types of vessels and or helicopters as well as having spare parts tools and technicians readily available a situation that is well known also for other offshore applications such as wave energy converters a gray et al 2017 as the industry is maturing the maintenance strategies as such are further developed and concepts such as condition based maintenance cbm are investigated according to en 13306 maintenance terminology 2017 cbm is a form of preventive maintenance which includes assessment of physical conditions analysis and the possible ensuing maintenance actions cbm strategies allow for failure prevention by understanding the physics of failure and subsequently the corresponding initiation of targeted maintenance activities implementation of cbm requires installation of sensors and application of analysis tools for various wt operational signals which adds complexity and cost to the operation of a wind farm to exploit the benefits of cbm a strategy needs to be developed that is based on a i thorough understanding of physics of failure and ii a subsequent prioritization of wt systems there is yet no published literature containing an inclusive overview about the most critical failure modes of state of the art owts that includes the rotor nacelle assembly rna substructures and foundations as well as their corresponding failure causes and mechanisms based on operating track records of existing assets and design information this information is essential for prioritization of wt systems to assess their suitability and feasibility for incorporation of condition monitoring systems cms this paper presents a systematic methodology for prioritization of wt systems for the application of cbm strategies commensurate with the most critical wt substructure and foundation failure modes as well as their respective causes and failure mechanisms the contents are based on twelve failure mode effects and criticality fmeca workshops involving experts from companies representing more than 70 of the total installed capacity of offshore wind energy in europe the operating experience includes assets with a total capacity of more than 9 gw supplied from over 2500 single wts the following section presents a literature review concerning cbm and risk prioritization in the wind industry this is followed by an explanation of relevant terminology then a methodology and a results section including critical discussion and conclusions 2 literature review 2 1 condition based maintenance in offshore wind the first widely accepted publications concerning operations and maintenance o m optimization by condition monitoring date back to the late 1990s a comprehensive report published out of the wt ω project verbruggen 2003 presented the state of the art of o m for onshore wind applications at that time it describes the different monitoring techniques applicable for pitch systems gear boxes main bearings and blades as well as global monitoring systems the latter referring to an analysis of system data and alarms for detecting a developing fault this is described later on in this section in more detail as the applied techniques are still used today in the context of artificial intelligence ai offshore wind o m optimization was presented for the first time in 2005 caselitz and giebhardt 2005 this paper specifically focuses on the rotor as critical system within the wind turbine assembly later wilkinson et al 2007 presented an in depth analysis regarding the use of condition monitoring systems on the drive train assemblies with a particular focus on the generator results of the european union eu funded condition monitoring for offshore wind farms conmow project were presented by wiggelinkhuizen et al 2008 the conmow project ran from 2002 to 2007 and is the successor of the wt ω project it described the use of direct and indirect measurement techniques for early fault detection and includes on site application and testing of different techniques the application of condition monitoring techniques has been described in a review paper published in 2009 lu et al 2009 this was followed by sørensen 2009 who firstly included the factor of risk this work was followed in j j nielsen and sørensen 2009 focusing on the application of bayesian theory as well as damage and uncertainty modelling like the other referenced works this paper underlines the potential cost savings by moving from a corrective to a preventive maintenance approach the state of the art of acceleration and strain based measurement techniques and algorithms is described in hameed et al 2009 with a focus on onshore applications but outlining potential benefits for offshore turbines due to accessibility restrictions more practical aspects related to installation and testing of cms are described in hameed et al 2010 they point out that particularly the usage of multiple interacting solutions is a complex undertaking requiring extensive system understanding and programming skills their focus is on wind energy in general i e on and offshore applications an attempt to understand root causes and failure prevention strategies for electrical and electronic assemblies is presented by peter tavner et al 2010 the motivation for this study were the high failure rates of the systems at the time causing long periods of downtime particularly offshore an indirect cms using generator power and rotational speed signals was investigated by wenxian yang et al 2010 this paper addresses again the need for lowering complexity of analysing simultaneously various signals such as direct measurements of vibrations strains or lubrication analyses in order to efficiently monitor the condition of the wt and its systems calculating the remaining useful lifetime of a system by deriving a damage function from operating conditions and or direct signals is described by c s gray and watson 2010 they suggest that real time damage calculation is feasible for various systems however the analysis presented was only focused on the gearbox over the following years the topic of cms received increased attention and can be summarized in four research areas 1 literature focusing on advanced o m strategies through risk and condition based strategies in general 2 literature focusing on the technical description of specific cms based on direct measurements 3 literature focusing on the use of indirect signals through supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems 4 review papers presenting the state of the art in specific research developments and applications papers of high relevance within 1 are el thalji and jantunen 2012 who describe challenges for implementation of cms from an academic and industrial perspective the potential benefit of cms is described by maples et al 2013 who assume that 50 of the wt faults may be detected well in advance by monitoring systems which in turn have the potential to raise availability by 1 2 the value of cbm strategies was also addressed by van horenbeek et al 2013 they conclude that cms offers cost saving potential even for onshore wts however when assessing the correlations in more detail it can be seen that the commercial benefits depend strongly on the ability of the cms to reliably predict a developing fault as a follow up to their previous papers j s nielsen and sørensen 2014 propose the use of monitoring information to be fed in a maintenance decision logic based on bayesian networks in order to refine accuracy of predictions and consequently optimize maintenance decision making from a risk perspective a recent publication leimeister and kolios 2018 describes a generic framework of qualitative and quantitative methods for fault path investigation from a reliability perspective providing information of high relevance for the evaluation of the suitability of cms work published in 2 i e those focusing on direct measurements mainly contain specific technical assessments of the applicability of systems for monitoring the condition of i rna or ii structural components such as towers substructures and foundations relevant publications for components in i are sheng et al 2011 tian et al 2011 kostandyan and sorensen 2012 matthews et al 2015 romero et al 2018 gonzález gonzález et al 2018 artigao et al 2018a in category ii focusing on substructures and foundations the following relevant publications have been identified smolka and cheng 2013 devriendt et al 2014 ziegler and muskulus 2016 martinez luengo et al 2016 ziegler et al 2017 weijtjens et al 2017 ziegler et al 2018 it should be noted that these papers refer to the term structural health monitoring shm which is often used as a synonym of cms for structural items these references mainly address the challenge of determining the remaining useful lifetime of offshore wind turbine owt substructures and foundations with a focus on i reducing the required number of inspections by maintaining an acceptable confidence in structural integrity and ii enabling the operation of an owt longer than its intended service life generally referred to as life time extension lte the topic of using scada data for maintenance purposes 3 was first introduced by verbruggen 2003 in recent years from 2010 onwards this topic has gained increased attention these indirect data analysis techniques are today often referred to as predictive maintenance the concept was introduced to offshore wind cms by garcia sanz bobi and del pico 2006 and subsequently by kusiak and li 2011 lapira et al 2012 and wenxian yang court and jiang 2013 from 2015 onwards the topic has gained even more momentum underlined by recent publications such as reder et al 2016 e gonzalez et al 2016 colone et al 2017 elena gonzalez et al 2017a nabati and thoben 2017 e gonzalez et al 2018 dao et al 2018 arcadius tokognon et al 2017 first results presented show promising potentials even though some challenges are still to be addressed in current and futuree research outstanding challenges amongst others are the limited number of components on which the respective machine learning techniques are applicable to and a challenging system identification process that potentially requires linking scada data with direct measurements stemming from strain gauges or accelerometers on the other hand the suggested techniques make efficient use of already available measurements instead of requiring transmission handling storage and analysis of new data which would ultimately result in increased and expensive data management this overall trend is further reflected by current research activities such as the project from which this paper has been developed romeo project 2018 in 4 review papers concerning cms are presented on average one paper per year is published that either focuses on one specific aspect or monitoring in general the most recent are sharma and mahto 2013 nie and wang 2013 tchakoua et al 2014 coronado and fischer 2015 tautz weinert and watson 2017 wang et al 2018 w yang 2016 two publications that link the aspect of risk in the form of a failure mode and effect analysis with offshore wind o m optimization and cms are shafiee and dinmohammadi 2014 and zhou et al 2015 the most comprehensive review of developments in the field of wind turbine reliability considering the potential value of cms is presented in artigao et al 2018b the latter two papers are most relevant for this research as they investigate the problem of the value of cms from a risk perspective rather than on the pure technological feasibility in other words they investigate the likelihood and consequence of the fault of a certain wt component or system in order to make a judgement concerning the potential value of implementing a certain monitoring system it has been shown that a great amount of work has been done to develop test and implement cms shm systems over the past years the focus lies on critical systems which cause long cause long periods of downtime and high costs of failure furthermore for all systems investigated there are records of actual single or serial faults from the field thus it can be concluded that the natural prioritization of systems is reasonable as it focuses on systems whose failure is known to have severe consequences considering the view of an offshore wind developer or operator however one may argue that a prioritization solely based on observed scenarios may be incomplete requiring a greater cohesive and complete system analysis for prioritization of cms developments therefore offering improvement potential for operating performance and maintenance efficiency one approach of doing this is to apply the concept of risk which is explained in more detail in the following section 2 2 risk prioritization and fme c a the concept of risk helps to prioritize systems by assessing which scenarios may occur for instance a component failure how likely is this to happen and what the associated consequences are consequences may be evaluated in different categories depending on the purpose of the risk assessment often they include cost and asset value implications asset availability as a main performance indicator considerations towards health and safety of personnel and environmental impact norsok standard z 008 2001 several qualitative and quantitative methods may be applied to prioritize a system or failure scenario for further investigation a widely applied reference for risk assessment methodologies is the iso 31000 series of standards iso31000 2009 iso31010 2010 from these standards the failure mode and effect analysis fmea is one of the most relevant techniques for creating transparency of the failure scenarios with the highest relevance in the context of the operation of physical assets this thesis is supported by the various publications referred to below a fmea is a logical qualitative risk assessment process aimed at evaluating failure modes fms of a process procedure or system their causes and effects when extended by criticality analysis ca for failure modes classification by including estimates of the likelihood and the severity of each failure mode it is known as failure mode effects and criticality analysis fmeca which is classified as a semi quantitative reliability method it is commonly defined as a systematic process for identifying potential design and process failures before they occur with the intent to eliminate them or minimise the risk associated with them juhaszova 2013 by quantitatively assessing each of the fms it is possible to measure their criticality enabling their prioritization and subsequent identification of appropriate mitigation measures fme c a is an accepted risk assessment technique for functional analysis as per iso31010 2010 which can be applied throughout the complete life cycle of a physical asset from design to decommissioning the fmeca discipline was originally developed in the united sates military and was first formally formulated in 1949 with mil std 1629a which is reflected in the document referred to in reliability analysis centre 1993 it was used as a reliability evaluation technique to assess the effect and consequences of system or equipment failures towards financial and non financial aspects such as safety or the reputation of an organization the technique has been in use for a long period of time especially in the aerospace industry with the development of the smc regulation 800 31 jackson et al 1995 and the automotive industry with sae j1739 surface vehicle standard 2009 however the most widely used standard is mil std 1629a which has been applied in many industries for general failure analysis at present the standards that are usually referred to when carrying out an fme c a include bs en 60812 2006 en 60812 2006 and bs en 5760 5 1991 british standards institution 1991 for more practical guidance see moubray 1992 specifically in the wind industry shafiee and dinmohammadi 2014 presented a systematic review of maintenance optimization methods and strategies within the offshore wind industry over the past few decades the fmea technique was used by arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 in evaluating an existing design of a 2 mw wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generator dfig against a hypothetical brushless doubly fed generator bdfg within the eu fp7 reliawind project peinke et al 2007 it concluded that the fmea is a technique that could significantly contribute to achieving long term cost effective systems this project identified more than 150 different types of components for a wind turbine which have been used as the basis for wt breakdown in upcoming studies this is similar to the work conducted by gauravkumar bharatbhai 2015 who presented a reliability analysis of repower 5 mw wt by means of different tools such as fme c a the study concluded that the overall reliability of the 5 mw wt was very low identified areas susceptible of failure and highlighted those with the need and potential to have condition monitoring systems fitted k fischer et al 2012 applied the concept of rcm in the form of a fmeca workshop with the owner operator and industry experts to assess two wind turbine models vestas v44 600 kw and v90 2 mw kahrobaee and asgarpoor 2011 elaborated the limitations of a traditional fmea or fmeca when applied to the assessment of wind turbines they presented a quantitative approach called risk based fmea based on failure probabilities and incurred failure costs and applied this to a direct drive wind turbine case study similarly dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 developed a fuzzy failure mode and effects analysis fmea approach for risk and failure mode analysis of offshore wind turbine systems most recently kang et al 2017 applied the fmea method to conduct a reliability analysis of floating offshore wind turbines fowt contrary to onshore wind turbines or bottom fixed offshore wind turbines fowts are characterised by a complex structure formed by interdependent sub systems for this reason an alternative fmea method named correlation fmea was applied interestingly the study revealed that the foundation structure and mooring system were high relevance systems as a result of the many dimensions associated with potentially severe consequence of failure furthermore luengo and kolios 2015 presented a comprehensive list of failure modes of owt with particular focus on end of life considerations the literature review in this section has shown that significant research has been conducted in the area of risk prioritization and risk based maintenance optimization there are also some distinct papers specifically addressing the problem of prioritizing cms based on the risk profile of a specific system zhou et al 2015 applied an fmeca for prioritization of cms they focus on representing fmeca information in an ontology in order to enable sophisticated fault diagnosis the paper has a strong emphasis on information technology it and the applicability of using actual fault diagnosis techniques in operation this is also shown by the baseline scenario in which a 1 mw mega watt onshore wt is used as example it includes failure modes and causes for the main wt systems however the data provided is limited to an onshore wt hence does not represent the latest technological state of the art and likewise does not contain information about owt substructures in summary this paper provides good insights into how to efficiently use information e g from an fmeca in order to implement fault diagnosis in an operational wind farm but it lacks assessing typical failure modes of latest offshore wind turbines a highly relevant work was also published by artigao et al 2018b they use reliability statistics and maintenance track records for assigning criticality levels to wt systems in order to prioritize scenarios for cms this paper is the most comprehensive literature available describing in detail asset reliability of wind turbines the study reveals however that availability of reliability data for offshore wind is much more limited than for onshore wind in fact it only refers to one study providing reliability data for a portfolio of wind farms rather than a single array this study was published by carroll et al 2016 and contains highly relevant information for all those stakeholders involved in offshore wind o m artigao condenses the information from carroll s study including in addition twelve other publicly available reliability statistics to identify the top five contributors to asset downtime i e systems with a high failure rate and or long durations for repair or replacement the study concludes with the recommendation to focus development efforts for cms on five systems however a detailed overview concerning which failure modes any particular system should focus upon is not included their study also omits the element of the foundation and substructures in offshore wind those items are subject to a very harsh environment and achieving long term integrity whilst minimising the inspection and maintenance costs is crucial for increasing the overall cost efficiency in order to assess the applicability of cms this information is essential and it is therefore desirable to link cms to the failure rates and downtimes of the systems they refer to 3 methodology 3 1 wind turbine system description this paper addresses the applicability of cms for main owt systems in the rna as shown in fig 1 below and foundation and substructure items it should be noted that modern owt often use direct drive generators instead of a gearbox configuration as shown below for further information on this see polinder et al 2006 and t fischer 2012 for illustration and explanations of the offshore substructure concepts relevant to this study i e monopile and jacket structures for detailed descriptions of the main wind turbine systems subassemblies and components see burton et al 2001 3 2 o m terminology the main wt components are subject to preventive and corrective maintenance activities see fig 2 preventive measures are intending to avoid any fault occurrence whilst corrective measures are those activities taking place subsequent to a component failure en 13306 maintenance terminology 2017 cms can in general terms allow for condition based maintenance which in a more sophisticated approach can be translated to a predictive maintenance strategy predictive maintenance is defined as condition based maintenance carried out following a forecast derived from repeated analysis or known characteristics and evaluation of the significant parameters of the degradation of the item en 13306 maintenance terminology 2017 this form of maintenance offers inherent optimization potential for both preventive and corrective maintenance activities a corrective maintenance strategy has the advantage that the useful lifetime of the item is always fully utilized this means that there is no waste of resources caused by e g a preventive replacement of the item or parts of it on the other hand the disadvantages of a corrective maintenance strategy are that i it relies on a quick reaction time to avoid significant production losses during downtime and ii it can potentially cause indirect costs e g if secondary damages are caused when the item fails the offshore wind industry is moving more and more towards preventive maintenance strategies as long periods of inaccessibility can cause substantial financial losses in case a wind turbine is out of production and cannot be brought back into an operational state a preventive maintenance strategy has the advantage of keeping the asset delivering in a more constant and reliable manner electricity and thus ensures a stable financial income the disadvantage of a preventive maintenance strategy is that it comes at least initially at a higher cost any preventive equipment check overhaul replacement or testing campaign has a cost associated with it a practicable balance must be found between the efforts put into a preventive maintenance campaign and the risk of the component to fail depending on the details of the preventive maintenance strategy there is a possibility of over maintaining this means that for example a component is replaced far earlier than the end of its useful lifetime which is the type of scenario that can be avoided by applying a corrective maintenance strategy a way to mitigate the disadvantages of each of the above strategies is to apply a condition based or predictive maintenance approach within either of these approaches maintenance activities are only carried out when they are actually required i e the item is not unnecessarily over maintained but it will also not fail unexpectedly this is only possible if accurate information on the condition of the item and the associated degradation mechanisms are obtained at any time condition based strategies rely on information based on data gathered by continuous or periodic online or offline condition monitoring systems it must be distinguished between diagnosis and prognosis systems the following definition can be used to differentiate between the two diagnosis is an assessment about the current and past health of a system based on observed symptoms and prognosis is an assessment of the future health mathur et al 2001 3 3 failure assessment and risk prioritization while the potential benefits of a cbm strategy appear obvious a certain effort is required to develop and implement the required systems to reliably provide information about an items current condition it is therefore desirable to prioritize certain components and failure modes with respect to a potential cbm strategy rather than trying to implement it for the entire system a risk based approach is deemed as the most suitable technique for such prioritization based on the author s industry experience and the literature review conducted on this topic an approach based on the fmeca methodology has been developed and applied as explained below in order to gather the relevant information a total of twelve fmeca workshops were held involving more than 40 technical experts mechanical electrical structural o m reliability from leading european offshore wind developers wind turbine manufacturers expert consultancies and universities where applicable data from the wind turbine manufacturer s and structural design documentation the developers or wt manufacturer s operating track record as well as any other relevant experience from the participants was fed into the process for generation of the most optimal and representative results covering the different viewpoints of the stakeholders the process followed is presented in fig 3 below the first author of this paper has acted as workshop leader i e the workshop preparation and moderation were in his responsibility the participants of the workshops were selected in accordance with the requirements for experience within each field relevant industry experience of 5 years was the general requirement but most of the participants were significantly more experienced due to privacy protection reasons further detail on the participant s profiles is omitted the first step was to divide the assets under consideration into systems and components an rds pp reference designation system for power plants vgb standard rds pp application guideline part 32 wind power plants 2014 structure was used to organize the system breakdown in accordance with the equipment s functional location floc this process was conducted considering the wind turbine manufacturer and end user requirements in step 2 the description of the main function was added to each item this description reflects the main design intention and helps at a later stage to assess effects and consequences of a functional failure the failure mode as documented in step 3 contains information about the event which causes a functional failure in basic terms it answers the what happens question not to be confused with the failure cause european standard 14224 2006 the failure cause describes what made the failure mode to occur not to be confused with the failure mechanism european standard 14224 2006 this is documented in step 4 in order to be able to document the likeliest root causes of the failure mode under consideration in the next question answered in step 5 the information about the likelihood of a failure scenario to occur is documented the likelihood of occurrence assessment is a vital part of any risk assessment generally the likelihood of occurrence or probability of occurrence can be assessed quantitatively semi quantitatively or qualitatively quantitative and semi quantitative approaches are applicable if there is an operating track record available of the item under consideration providing statistically viable information i e the information about an items reliability can be obtained from actual data records this approach is not applicable for items which have been in operation for a short period of time therefore qualitative engineering judgment was used for the assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of the given scenarios the mentioned judgments were supported by numerical calculations other modelling techniques or experience from other fields of application of a similar technology where possible within this research project the assets under consideration are of differing ages i e for some assets an operating track record of several years is available whereas others have been in operation only for a relatively short period of time or not even built due to this differing characteristic a qualitative assessment approach has been chosen for the likelihood of occurrence evaluation table 1 summarizes the three levels that have been used the failure end effect documented in step 6 describes what happens when a failure mode occurs not to be confused with failure consequence moubray 1992 it is this scenario which is assessed in terms of consequence in subsequent steps the failure effect description shall consider the realistic worst case scenario in step 7 the β factor is analysed and documented the β factor represents the conditional probability of the failure end effect described in step 6 to materialize given that the failure mode has already occurred it is used to account for the failure progression mitigation measures which would prevent the end effect to occur in case of failure mode occurrence the categories that have been considered in the course of the romeo project are presented in table 2 in step 8 the consequence of the described failure end effect is assessed this step describes why and how a scenario matters different consequence categories were defined in accordance with the project requirements and industry standard practices they encompass safety environment spare part cost production availability and type of intervention three consequence levels were introduced in each category representing their respective severity categorization marginal medium and critical consequences are assessed per individual asset i e per one wind turbine and its individual systems park array full system effects scale effects etc are not considered in this assessment economic consequences are split into direct and indirect cost with the latter referring to production losses this split allows for the identification of items which may be repairable at low cost but potentially having a significant influence on availability vice versa in addition there is a distinction between the types of intervention required in order to account for the impact of specialised resources and logistics required to carry out certain activities the realistic failure end effect of a scenario is assessed with respect to the consequence levels each carrying the same weight in the assessment weighted factoring is omitted here i e eventual weighting shall be reflected by the categorization consequence groups and levels were agreed upon in the expert forum involved in this project as referred to earlier they reflect the particular risk appetite of this specific group of experts and therefore have potential for adjustment risk analysis consequence groups and levels are summarized in table 3 below the criticality value is calculated in step 9 the criticality value provides a quantified result combining the earlier collected information about the potential failure mode the likelihood of occurrence and β factor as well as the consequences of the effect the formula used for the calculation of the criticality is given below this formula relies on the values denoted as factor as listed in the tables above i e a value of 1 3 representing the likelihood of occurrence the β factor and the severity summation c r i t i c a l i t y l i k e l i h o o d β s e v e r i t y the combined result is a value between 5 and 135 for risk evaluation purposes the following categorization presented in table 4 was discussed among the forum of industry experts and reflects the common understanding of acceptable boundaries it should be noted however that these values or classes ultimately depend on the risk appetite of stakeholders and therefore may change see table 5 all failure modes which were either in the medium or high risk category were prioritized and have been further assessed as part of steps 10 to 13 in step 10 the failure mechanisms of any prioritized failure mode were analysed by in depth evaluation of the physical chemical or other processes leading to the failure this information forms the basis for establishing a list of desirable monitoring systems and their requirements steps 10 to 13 were carried out separately for structures and rna this is because structures here monopile and jacket substructures are handled differently to the turbine main systems here blades pitch system yaw system main shaft gearbox generator transformer and converter during the operational phase of a wind farm in general terms structures are subject to an inspection and monitoring regime aimed to verify their structural integrity is maintained throughout the intended lifetime of the asset wind turbine rna components are on the other hand predominantly subject to regular maintenance campaigns which ensure that the components and systems are fit for their desired purpose this main difference is respected by following specific measures in the course of the fmeca process 3 4 benchmarking of wind turbine rna component monitoring options a common method to evaluate the performance of a monitoring system is the pf interval this is defined as the time interval between the detection of a developing fault and the failure occurrence as illustrated in fig 4 below this example shows a fictitious component with a certain performance requirement as soon as the performance falls below the required value the component is considered to be in a failed state this represents the f of the pf interval a and b represent measurements derived from condition monitoring systems in this particular example a is capable of detecting the fault development at time p1 and b is capable of detecting the failure at time p2 the interval between the potential fault detection px and the actual fault f is defined as pf interval the pf interval is used as a performance indicator for condition monitoring systems the longer this interval is and the more accurately the exact point in time of failure occurrence can be estimated the more benefits can be obtained by applying the system for prioritization of monitoring systems for main turbine components the pf interval achievable with contemporary commercially available monitoring systems has been compared with the potential pf interval of any imaginable monitoring system this is done by following the process shown below describe any currently used monitoring system for the failure mechanism under consideration estimate the pf interval achievable with the monitoring system applied today describe how a future monitoring system could look like and what its performance criteria are estimate the potential cost savings achievable by applying the new monitoring system estimate the expected downtime reduction by applying the new monitoring system points 4 and 5 are assessed based on the same levels used in step 8 of the criticality assessment i e three levels for cost savings and three levels for downtime reduction a second prioritization is then performed based on the calculated benefits for the specific monitoring system the respective categories used in the context of this project are provided in table 6 below and reflect the judgement of the industry experts involved in this research project see tables 7 11 any evaluation of the medium and high categories represents an improvement over the current status it should be noted that not all critical failure modes have been assessed in such level of detail this caveat applied in those cases where the respective scenario was already covered by another measure or for those where the failure mechanism did not show any degradation pattern sudden failure and therefore was not considered suitable for monitoring 3 5 benchmarking of substructure structural monitoring options an alternative method to assess the potential of a substructure monitoring system is proposed as the pf interval concept used for the wind turbine rna components has limited applicability for this particular system and components firstly the fmeca results were reviewed and all relevant failure modes extracted the next step consisted of an analysis of these failure modes and a review of the failure mechanism from root cause to failure mode with the objective of assessing the potential for monitoring based on known damage mechanisms prior to failure a benchmark study of substructure monitoring systems was then performed this study focused on those mechanisms that take sufficient time before a failure materialises hence allow sufficient time to react and plan for maintenance mobilization failure prevention or mitigation a number of five core questions were formulated to assess the suitability of monitoring systems for each of the previously identified structural failure modes and mechanisms the questions are can the inspection frequency be reduced can the inspection depth extent be reduced is it possible to defer unplanned maintenance activities is an update of structural capacity enabled can secondary damages be mitigated or prevented by applying a monitoring system the scope of the study was narrowed down to cover primary structural items i e the main items with the function to provide structural integrity and load bearing capacity throughout the lifetime also the scope focused on the submerged section of those primary structural items this is the area of most interest as any inspection activity in this environment is very costly and generally poses an increased risk to personal safety particularly if divers are used the five questions listed above were answered by the forum of technical experts during the workshops by a simple yes or no a yes infers an improvement compared to the current situation while a no refers to no improvement if a monitoring system was judged to not improving the situation compared to today it did not qualify for further assessment 4 results 4 1 overview a presentation of the main observations made during the implementation of the fmeca process outlined above is provided in this section fig 5 shows an overview of the overall distribution of identified failure modes for each of the main systems within the scope of the project the largest proportion is related to the substructure i e approximately one third of the 337 failures identified fall into this category one reason for this may be that the analysis has been done for the specific purpose of identifying areas that would potentially profit from the application of monitoring systems looking deeper into the failure modes assessed for substructures it can be seen that all of them are related to submerged items those items are by nature rather difficult to be inspected so that a tendency for prioritizing them for monitoring can be interpreted as the natural reaction of the experts involved the second most common failure modes are related to the transformer both systems together make up almost half of all failure modes the remaining main systems carry each a comparable weight with values of 16 30 failure modes per item the pitch system is the smallest contributor of the investigated failure modes with only 5 failure modes this can be justified by the fact that this system was initially not part of the scope of work therefore the focus was rather limited if compared to the predominating failure modes of the rotor system the distribution of the overall system criticality is shown in fig 6 below the graph shows the number of failure modes rated with the corresponding criticality value on the horizontal axis most of the failure modes are in the medium region approx 30 a peak of critical items can be observed towards the right of the figure from 54 onwards as described in the methodology section only those failure modes with criticality values greater or equal than 44 have been prioritized fig 7 shows the proportion of criticality numbers per system in this criticality region the overall result looks comparable to fig 6 however the transformer system the converter and the blade bearings show now a slightly higher number of critical failure modes when compared to the other systems the critical failure modes fm including a description of their likely cause and mechanism and potential benefit for monitoring category are presented in the following sections since several failure causes may lead to the same failure mode some of the tables presented contain repetitions of the same failure mode since the presentation of all potential failure paths needs to be assessed for evaluating the suitability of a monitoring system also the paths resulting to the same failure modes have been included and are presented 4 2 blades four of the blade system failure modes have been prioritized for further investigation of monitoring systems one fm is related to incorrect application of adhesives and is therefore not assessed in more detail with respect to a possible cbm strategy of the remaining three monitoring of cracks and delamination could provide high value whereas top coat damage and delamination caused by design errors would not be relevant and therefore be prevented by the application of monitoring during operation 4 3 blade bearings five out of six identified critical failure modes could benefit from the application of monitoring systems all of them are related to material failures that show a time dependency fatigue and wear several monitoring techniques may be investigated to detect developing failures based on those mechanisms well in advance respecting the different potential main causes 4 4 pitch system only one critical failure mode namely wear of the pitch gears has been identified a potential monitoring system was however not assessed the current most common maintenance strategy is run to failure and a monitoring system was not deemed beneficial 4 5 main shaft a large number of failure modes have been identified for the main shaft where also the main bearing is considered the bearing assessment is similar to the blade bearing assessment i e a significant improvement over present practice can be achieved by the use of monitoring systems other potential failure modes of the main shaft such as excessive vibration leakages or fabrication issues are not expected to have an improvement over the current situation 4 6 gearbox four monitoring systems would potentially improve the pf interval of the prioritized fms of the gearbox compared to today the failure mechanisms to be detected cover different fatigue and wear processes as well as various temperature related effects 4 7 generator significant improvements in the current operation and maintenance of the generator system can be achieved by means of monitoring nine mechanisms have been assessed in detail and all of them rank the highest when assessing their impact on pf intervals the failure mechanisms cover material degradation and overheating as well as mechanical failures related to vibration and electrical faults related to isolation specifically monitoring the latter electrical failure mechanisms is considered a great improvement to today 4 8 transformer the largest number of failure modes has been identified and prioritized for transformer systems the failure modes and mechanisms are to a large extent comparable to those identified for the generator i e related to material and electrical faults however there are limited possibilities to monitor specific failure modes of the transformer which leads to further consideration of only two failure modes as having large improvement potential 4 9 converter improvement potential is expected for three out of the seven identified failure modes in the converter system two are related to material failure mechanisms which are expected to have detectable degradation patterns over time the other one relates to an electrical short circuit which could also be detected early by analysing simultaneously temperature current and voltage signals 4 10 yaw system only one out of the seven identified and prioritized failure modes of the yaw system is deemed to offer a significant improvement potential this relates to defects in the yaw motor or yaw gear which may be detected remotely by automatic data analysis methods other failure mechanisms may also be monitored however the impact in respect to pf interval improvement is deemed limited 4 11 jacket and monopile support structure the results show that all assessed and prioritized failure modes in the substructure system have the potential for improvement if compared to their current situation as of today in the event monitoring systems are applied successfully the total benefit rating for each failure mode gives an indication on the overall impact and benefit of the monitoring application for the assessed failure mechanism generally the greatest impact resulting from the application of monitoring systems is deemed to be achieved in the mitigation or prevention of secondary damages 84 this is followed by the possibility of providing the basis structural capacity update 68 and deferment of unplanned maintenance activities 64 approximately 50 of the assessed failure modes will benefit from a reduction in the substructure inspection frequency and the inspection extent refer to section 3 5 for further details 5 discussion a risk based approach has been applied to prioritize owt systems for analysing the potential value of implementing a cbm strategy this is based upon extensive expert experience but also long term operating track records of a large proportion of all wind farms located in european seas a comparison study with different other publicly available risk prioritization studies for wt systems has been carried out to enable investigation of any possible differences that could arise from the particular focus of study the different data and knowledge bases table 17 shows risk priority of the different studies for this paper study 1 the number of critical failure modes identified for each system has been documented this number reflects the focus for cms developments which has been the main objective of the fmeca conducted for achieving those results in kang et al 2017 study 2 the focus is on system reliability of floating owts the authors intend to identify interconnections between systems to improve overall system reliability in gauravkumar bharatbhai 2015 study 3 the focus is somewhat similar except that this study is specifically done for a 5 mw owt on a bottom fixed substructure a risk analysis and failure mode prioritization is presented in study 4 by kougioumtzoglou and lazakis 2015 looking at the optimization of o m of offshore wt systems study 5 presented in dinmohammadi and shafiee 2013 attempts to solve some weaknesses of conventional fmeas by introducing fuzzy logic the final aim of this study was to improve system reliability and to optimize maintenance by using any possible data input such as expert opinions but also scada data study 6 presented in kahrobaee and asgarpoor 2011 focuses on failure effect mitigation by thorough understanding of system failure modes and causes this study was applied to an onshore wt system study 7 presented in arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 focuses on system reliability improvement of future designs of onshore wts see tables 12 16 it should be noted that system topology is not consistent throughout the studies this is reflected by zeros in the table below meaning that a specific item may have been included in study x but not in study y the items were grouped into subassemblies and systems as appropriate and in accordance with industry practice in all cases the total sum of individual contributors totals 100 towers and substructures account for almost one third of all critical failure modes identified in the course of this paper this number is unprecedented in the context of the literature available in this subject area in studies 2 3 6 and 7 this category contributes less than 10 of the critical fms whereas the contribution is rather significant in studies 4 and 5 which have a strong focus on o m optimization of owt studies 2 and 3 focus on system reliability studies 6 and 7 deal with onshore wind applications and therefore do not contain the critical submerged area that is mostly associated with the critical fms identified in this study it can therefore be concluded that studies focusing on o m and condition monitoring account more for structural fms than those focused on system reliability or onshore wind applications the second highest priority for cms developments is related to the transformer system this system is identified as somewhat critical in study 2 however not at the magnitude reported in this present paper the other studies either did not include the transformer in their assessment or this system did not contribute significantly to the most critical fms it should be noted that some studies refer to converter and transformer in one system but even if this would be the case for all studies this assembly would not be in the foremost position of risk priority a particular observation is made for the generator system of study 2 with more than 40 this system is the most significant in study 2 from the original paper it appears that this is due to the specific nature of fowt application kang et al 2017 interestingly the generator is a top risk also for the onshore specific studies number 6 and 7 furthermore main shaft and bearing are included in the generator assembly in kang s study which explains the rather high risk priority number with around one quarter of the critical fms the drive train components consisting of main shaft main bearing gearbox and generator are still deemed a critical assembly in this study which is in accordance with earlier studies the blade assembly does not contribute significantly to the critical failure modes in this study however it carries some weight in the onshore studies 6 and 7 as well as in a former offshore study 5 it appears as if the respective fms are well covered by o m technology such as sensors in more recent applications the same reasoning applies to the pitch system which is less of a focus in this study but contributes significantly to critical fms in earlier studies particularly number 3 and 4 which relate to improved o m and system reliability overall the referred studies have a similar profile however this paper in particular emphasises the potential of cms developments for substructures and foundations as well as transformer systems and the main shaft including main bearing it is found that the proposed methodology ensures that i expert knowledge ii operating track records and iii design information is used collectively enabling a comprehensive all encompassing transparent system analysis development efforts for condition monitoring systems can in this manner be targeted towards the most critical systems it may be argued however that costs for developing and implementing monitoring systems are not included in this study which makes it difficult to assess the cost effectiveness in the long term of such systems it may also be argued that the results presented only compare the state of the art i e what is currently been done and the application of condition monitoring other strategies such as increased efforts for predetermined preventive maintenance for instance are not considered in the assessment such strategies may lead to a different risk prioritization that could eliminate or mitigate some of the failure modes prioritized in this study regarding both points it should be noted that the objective of this study is to provide an un biased and realistic risk analysis of wind turbine systems for each specific failure mode a number of different ways forward can be considered based on the results obtained in the analysis this study has considered the development of a monitoring solution for specific prioritized failure modes such a development should be preceded by a comprehensive evaluation of the opportunities and limitations of all possible options for failure mode treatment this should be supported by a thorough cost analysis in order to assess the impact of each of the options in a fully transparent manner 6 conclusion this paper presents the most critical failure modes of state of the art offshore wind turbine systems each failure mode is investigated considering the opportunity to optimize o m less inspections or higher pf interval through the application of condition monitoring systems failure causes and mechanisms are evaluated in order to establish the degradation patterns that may be potentially identified by a monitoring system a total of 337 individual failure modes have been identified and analysed by a consortium representing more than 70 of the total offshore wind capacity installed in europe today results were to some extent in accordance with other studies however a particular potential for monitoring of substructures and foundations as well as transformer systems and the main shaft including main bearing has been identified further work involves the prioritization of all failure modes to be followed by the development of diagnosis and prognosis tools to be implemented in pilot tests at the teesside wikinger and east anglia offshore wind farms this study provides the reader with a structured and transparent risk based assessment methodology that helps optimize o m and to minimise operational expenditure it further provides detailed information about the paths leading to critical failure modes those paths must be understood in order to properly design targeted and useful condition monitoring systems as a first of its kind this paper draws upon extensive operating experience making the methodology and results highly applicable to the

22938,this paper presents some results of particle image velocimetry piv measurements on an impulsively starting isothermal jet from a fully developed circular pipe with re 4880 the temporal evolution of the starting jet from initiation to steady state is clearly revealed by time sequence of instantaneous velocity vorticity fields obtained by piv in terms of the formation evolution and interactions of the vortex rings leading and trailing the current jet exhibits a drastically different vortex topology as compared to that generated by conventional piston driven starting jets from sharp edged orifices or short pipes nozzles in the literature according to the recorded time series of centerline velocity near the jet exit the evolution of the starting jet can be divided into two stages with different speeds of acceleration and each stage is characterized by distinct vortex patterns one cycle catching up and merging process occurs between each pair of consecutively pinched off vortex rings such as the leading ring and the first trailing ring the second and third trailing rings and so on as a result of the merging with the trailing ring the leading vortex ring increases in circulation but its propagation speed is essentially unaffected keywords starting jet vortex ring particle image velocimetry piv 1 introduction starting jets and vortex ring pinch off play a fundamental role in a wide range of engineering applications such as injectors pulsed jet propulsion and mixers but also in natural flows such as a volcanic eruption pulsatile blood flow in the cardiovascular system and jellyfish swimming see review by shariff and leonard 1992 in the laboratory a starting jet is formed by suddenly injecting a column of fluid from a nozzle or an orifice into the ambient fluid syed and sung 2009 the commonly used configurations to generate staring jet and vortex ring are 1 the piston cylinder apparatus which consists of a movable piston translating along the axis of a cylindrical pipe glezer 1988 gharib et al 1998 pawlak et al 2007 and 2 shock tube in injectors and pulse jet propulsion systems murugan and das 2008 murugan et al 2012 dora et al 2014 if the nozzle exit geometry is circular the resulting vortex ring assumes an axisymmetric doughnut like shape with uniform distribution of vorticity around its circumference glezer 1988 which plays a major role in the entrainment characteristics of starting jets cossali et al 2001 after long enough time after start of injection the leading vortex ring interact with strong jet and loses its identity and hence the starting jet becomes the well known steady jet a key topic of starting jets is the evolution of the vortex ring in terms of its formation instability and breakdown phenomena since vortex ring is the building block behind the mixing entrainment noise generation and heat transfer of the starting jet flow understanding vortex rings eventually enable suppression or enhancement of these properties shariff and leonard 1992 kharoua et al 2017 which is vital for the purpose of effective control of jet flows early studies hill and greene 1977 bremhorst and watson 1981 found that mixing is greatly enhanced by the use of unsteady or fully pulsed jets as compared to a steady jet it was shown that the evolution of a starting jet can be described by a characteristic time similarity parameter t d u j where d and u j are the nozzle exit diameter and the injection velocity respectively the analytical prediction by cossali 2001 showed that a starting air jet reaches steady state at non dimensional times t t t 100 whereas a transient period in the jet development exists for t 20 corresponding to x d 10 where x being the downstream distance from the nozzle exit at t 20 the leading vortex seems to grow by entraining fluid from the jet axis rather than its surroundings but at locations upstream of the leading vortex the jet body interacts with its surroundings and entrains ambient fluid cossali 2001 at later times t 70 the leading vortex entrains ambient fluid and the overall entrainment is larger than that of a steady jet andriani et al 1996 past this stage nozzle rather than ambient fluid feeds the development of the vortex ring the so called universal formation number provides the time beyond which the circulation of the vortex ring does not increase any further the value of formation number has been established by gharib et al 1998 as t 3 6 4 5 alternatively the formation number describes the effective stroke ratio of a given injector l d where l is the effective stroke length defined as the time integral of the exit velocity profile the magnitude of l d plays an important role in determining the ensuing motion of the generated vortex ring allen and auvity 2002 it corresponds to the point of transition from a growing vortex ring of increasing strength to where the ring begins to convect as a result of its self induced velocity this point is marked by a contraction of the ring to reach a stable diameter see didden 1979 when l d 0 1 sheffield 1977 showed that the effects of the vortex image and stopping vortex are strong relative to the self induced effect and the potential exists for the ring to propagate back into the tube for l d of the order 0 5 4 5 the ring will convect away from the orifice under its self induced field the vortex will not continue to grow as a discrete structure for increasing l d and eventually the flow transitions to a jet as mentioned by saffman 1978 the significance of vortex ring formation was demonstrated by krueger and gharib 2003 that the average thrust is maximized by jet thrusts of non dimensional duration very near the formation number the propagation convection speed of the vortex ring is one half of the piston velocity for piston driven starting jets gharib et al 1998 similar to single vortex rings while krieg and mohseni 2013 showed that the propagation speed of vortex ring depends on the nozzle arrangement and driving conditions it is noteworthy that in most of the aforementioned studies using piston cylinder apparatus the exit velocity profile is approximately uniform top hat shape however the flow development and vortex dynamics of a jet are sensitive to the initial conditions at the nozzle exit such as the thickness of trailing edge murugan and das 2008 therefore the exit velocity profile may vary by the motion of the piston and the geometry of the orifice nozzle rosenfeld et al 1998 it was found that vortex rings issued from pipe nozzle with a finite length 1d and 2d in rosenfeld et al 1998 1 6d in syed and sung 2009 are weaker than those that from the sharp edged orifice yu et al 2007 showed that for gravity driven starting jets through a contraction nozzle the exit velocity profile is neither uniform nor parabolic and also varies with time therefore different vortex patterns are observed namely vortex leapfrogging at re 2358 and vortex pinch off at re 3568 and 4716 yu et al 2007 however little work has been conducted on starting jet issued from a long pipe which is also a commonly used nozzle type in engineering applications such as hydraulic jet cleaning and cutting joshi and schreiber 2006 investigated the evolution of entrainment constant for an impulsively starting turbulent jet from a long pipe re 12 600 recently landers et al 2016 carried smoke visualization study on a starting turbulent jet re 7500 from a fully developed pipe length 48d and found the presence of discrete large scale structures in the trailing flow whereas the trailing vortices in piston driven starting jet are basically steady krueger and gharib 2003 according to the above literature survey there is still a lack of studies on starting jets from fully developed pipe and quantitative information about the vortex rings leading and trailing in terms of their evolution with time is still unknown there is a need for a more comprehensive study regarding the temporal evolution of starting pipe jet into steady state in the present study detailed velocity measurements were made in the near field using particle image velocimetry piv to obtain quantitative information on the location shape size and strength of the vortices 2 experimental set up and methodology the experimental set up is shown schematically in fig 1 the set up was designed to produce a starting jet from a fully developed pipe at a desired flow rate a submerged stainless steel pump model garden xks 400s put in a constant head reservoir tank driven flow to a pipeline along which a manual valve a solenoid valve and a rotameter were installed the manual valve and the rotameter were used to adjust the volumetric flow rate q 0 40 l min while the solenoid vale centre opened with an aperture of 200 mm in diameter was used to control the initiation of the flow the jet was formed through a straight smooth transparent acrylic pipe with an inner diameter d 26 mm and a wall thickness of 3 mm the length l of the pipe upstream of exit was 2080 mm 80d which was sufficiently long to establish the flow to be fully developed upon issuing at exit tummers et al 2011 wang et al 2015 the pipe was installed horizontally and concentrically along the centerline of a test tank which was made of glass for full optical access it had dimensions of approximately 16d 12d 100d height width length which was large to ensure the influence of the tank walls and free surface on the jet development to be negligible the pipe protruded a length of 76 mm 3d inside the test tank to avoid the no slip effects from the tank sidewall romano 2002 an orthogonal coordinate system was defined with its origin located at the jet exit on the centerline x along the jet axis and y along the radial direction pointing upwards velocity measurements were performed in the x y plane using a digital piv system lavision model to reveal the vortex formation and pinch off the flow field was illuminated with a double cavity nd yag laser light sheet at 532 nm wavelength litron model power 135 mj per pulse duration 5ns sphericel 110p8 hollow glass spheres which were neutrally buoyant with a mean diameter of 13 μm and could offer good traceability and scattering efficiency were seeded in the flow as tracer particles in order to establish uniform distribution of seeding particles over the entire domain before doing the experiments sufficient amount of seeding particles had been added and stirred to be well mixed in the water in both the test tank and the reservoir tank as the flow was a recirculating system there was no need to add particles during the course of experiments the particle images were recorded using a 14 bit charge coupled device ccd camera which had a resolution of 1600 1200 pixels lavision davis software version 7 2 was used to process the particle images and determine the velocity vectors particle displacement was calculated using the fast fourier transform fft based cross correlation algorithm with standard gaussian sub pixel fit structured as an iterative multi grid method the processing procedure included two passes starting with a grid size of 32 32 pixels and stepping down to the final interrogation area ia of 16 16 pixels overlapping by 50 resulting in a set of 30 000 vectors 200 150 for a typical field in between passes the vector maps were filtered by using a 3 3 median filter in order to remove possible outliers if the centre vector differed from the median vector by more than 5 times the root mean square r m s value the centre vector was replaced by the averaged of the eight neighboring ias the number of particles in each ia was of the order of 10 to yield strong correlations the field of view was 360 mm 270 mm approx 13 8d 10 4d so that the spatial resolution for the present set up was 1 8 mm 1 8 mm approx 0 07d 0 07d unlike most previous research which excited the jet for a short period of time using a piston the current jet flow was held at a constant reynolds number during the experiments the water temperature was maintained at 20 c 0 5 c and the volumetric flow rate q was fixed at 6 l min which yielded the bulk average velocity u b 4q πd 2 0 188 m s and reynolds number re 4880 based on the bulk velocity and the pipe diameter prior to piv measurements the pump was turned on but the solenoid valve was fully closed in order to establish a constant pressure at the upstream side of the solenoid valve consequently the solenoid which was actuated by a computer was fully opened within a short period about 10 ms so that an impulsively starting jet was formed into the test tank filled with still water simultaneously the piv system was triggered to continuously record images at a sampling rate of 12 hz in double fame mode until the jet had reached the steady state in this paper t 0 is defined as the first instant when the jet was issued from the exit and not when the solenoid valve was opened since there was a time lag for the disturbed flow to propagate through the pipe until the exit similar to the literature the characteristic time similarity parameter is defined as t d u j where u j u b and therefore t t t t u b d therefore the time interval between consecutive snapshots is δt 1 12 s corresponding to δt 0 6 through adjusting the time interval between each pair of laser pulses the maximum displacement of particles near the jet exit region is about 6 7 pixels satisfying the criteria proposed by boillot and prasad 1996 and the mean displacement over the whole field of view is about 2 3 pixels according to raffel et al 2007 the uncertainty in the particle displacement determined by standard cross correlation algorithm with sub pixel interpolation is of the order of 0 1 pixels normalizing this uncertainty with the mean displacement of the particles yielded a relative error about 4 in the instantaneous velocities u and v based on the velocity vectors the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z δ v δ x δ u δ y was calculated using the least operations extrapolation scheme the uncertainty in ω z was estimated to be about 10 following the procedure proposed by sciacchitano and wieneke 2016 more details of the piv measurement technique were reported in wang and tan 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 nozzle exit conditions flow axisymmetry and repeatability check a representative snapshot of the instantaneous velocity vector plot of the impulsively starting jet is provided in fig 2 in which flood contours of the normalized instantaneous spanswise vorticity ω z d u b are added to visualize the vortex structures as the laser sheet is a two dimensional slice through the jet center each pair of opposite signed vortices with similar size and magnitude represents a vortex ring that is in a toroidal shape the snapshot was taken at about t 1 75 s t 7 2 which clearly depicts the pinched off initial leading vortex ring and multiple trailing vortex rings behind it the vortex rings are essentially coaxial as indicated by that each pair of vortices is symmetrical about the jet axis x axis as they are propagating downstream as mentioned in the previous section 8 independent runs were conducted to check the repeatability of the experimental data here the time histories of the streamwise velocity on the centerline velocity u c immediately downstream of the exit i e at x y 1d 0 were retrieved to illustrate the jet evolution process see fig 3 a it can be observed that the 8 sets of data collapse quite well indicating good repeatability the duration for each run lasted for 90 s and it was found that the flow reached steady state after t 6 s here the results for the first 16 s were shown to depict the initial ramp profile more clearly the jet can be divided into two states starting state at t 6 s and steady state at t 6 s moreover the starting state can be sub divided into two distinct stages i initial rapid ramp up stage at t 0 3 s or t 2 during which the velocity accelerates linearly from 0 to about 0 3 m s ii subsequent mild acceleration stage t 0 3 s 6 s or t 2 42 where the velocity begins to fluctuate which is due to periodic shedding of vortex rings as will be discussed later in next section but the mean value u c continues to increase gradually and linearly until a maximum value of 0 4 m s the ramp ups of centerline velocity for the impulsively starting jet are explained as follows during the experiments it was observed that the flow rate was kept constant once the solenoid valve was opened since the solenoid valve has a smaller diameter than the pipe 20 mm vs 26 mm the flow actually experiences a contraction when passing through the solenoid valve the flow initiated at the exit of the pipe spontaneously when the solenoid valve opened at t 0 as the entire pipe was filled with water whose disturbance speed vary from 1450 to 1498 m s the roll up of the vortex sheet and the subsequent development of vortex ring takes place at the pipe exit the centerline velocity increases gradually and reaches to a steady state value once the starting vortex ring moves far downstream i e no longer affect the velocity at the exit as there is no effect from back pressure the disturbed flow emanating inside the pipe e g from the contact surface of the solenoid moves downstream until reaching the exit at about t 6 s unlike a laminar flow of the undisturbed fluid the disturbed flow reaching the exit has significant velocity fluctuations which reduces the mean velocity this causes a sudden drop in the mean velocity similar phenomenon was reported by cossali et al 2001 for an impulsively starting jet thereafter at t 6 5 s or t 46 the jet becomes steady and the mean velocity maintains a constant level however cossali et al 2001 did not observe the 2 stage evolution for the starting jet which might be due to the fact that the jet exit velocity about 30 m s is too high to be resolved at a fine enough temporal resolution the least squares regression lines for all 8 sets of data at stages i ii and the steady state can be obtained as u c t u c 0 0216 t 0 281 and u c 0 32 respectively the regression lines are plotted in fig 3 b together with the velocity history of run 1 which is the representative case to illustrate the generation interaction and evolution of vortex rings in the next section note that during stage ii there is an overshoot of centerline velocity 0 3 0 4 m s as compared to the steady state value 0 32 m s a phenomenon that has not been reported elsewhere in the literature on starting jets it is well known that the flow development and vortex dynamics of the starting jet are sensitive to the initial conditions at the nozzle exit rosenfeld et al 1998 therefore the streamwsie mean velocity u profile at x 0 1 d the nearest measurement point downstream of the exit for the jet at steady state is presented in fig 4 b the results are compared with both parabolic and power law 1 7th and 1 6th profiles it is well known that a jet issuing from a pipe would yield parabolic velocity profiles if the flow is laminar and power law velocity profiles if the flow is turbulent here the empirical power law profiles are defined as 1 u u max 1 r r 1 n where u max is the maximum velocity which is always on the jet centerline and r d 2 is the radius of the jet as shown in fig 4 a obviously the present jet re 4880 is neither laminar nor fully turbulent but fall in between similar property was found in our earlier study wang et al 2015 for long pipe jets at re 9800 46 550 this is consistent with the literature that the jet laminar to turbulent transition occurs in a considerably wide range of re 2500 o 104 dimotakis et al 1983 bogey and bailly 2006 this judgement is further confirmed by examining the relationship between the bulk velocity u b and the maximum velocity u max for the parabolic profile u max u b 2 for the power law profile the bulk velocity can be can be determined by integrating equation 1 2 u b u max 0 r v 2 π r d r π r 2 u max 2 0 1 1 r r 1 n r r d r r 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 1 therefore the values of u max u b are 1 264 and 1 224 for n 6 and 7 respectively in the present study u max u b 0 32 0 188 1 702 which is larger than the power law value yet smaller than the parabolic value as shown in fig 3 the exit velocity of the starting jet is varying with time fig 4 c shows the streamwise velocity profiles along x 1 d at different instants t 0 17 and 0 25 s at stage i t 1 5 and 4 s at stage ii the profiles at the starting state are quite different from that at the steady state in the following aspects firstly the profiles at t 0 17 0 25 and 1 5 s exhibit a twin peak shape with peak values near the edge of the shear layer and smaller values near the centerline similar shape was found by yu et al 2007 at the beginning of gravity driven starting jets from a contoured nozzle and was attributed to shedding of vortices secondly the profiles change rapidly with time at stage i both the width of the jet stem and the maximum velocity quickly increase from t 0 17 0 25 s at stage ii t 1 5 and 4 s however the width of the jet stem decreases but the velocity on the centerline increases the latter is consistent with the trend depicted in fig 3 it needs to be highlighted the difference between the present study and those generated by conventional piston driven starting jets from sharp edged orifices and pressure or gravity driven jets from short pipes nozzles in the literature notably the peculiar phenomenon of velocity overshoot during stage ii shown in fig 3 it is likely due to the disturbed flow emanating inside the pipe and traveled to the jet exit this leads to the increase of centerline velocity until the disturbed flow reaches the jet exit and the flow becomes steady a supporting evidence is that the length of the pipe from the solenoid to the pipe exit is 2 08 m dividing it by 6 s yields a speed of 0 35 m s which is consistent with the jet exit velocity of 0 3 0 4 m s as depicted in fig 3 in other words the long pipe can be considered as a buffer which effectively extends the duration of the unsteady stage of the starting jet for starting jets generated by conventional piston driven method by contrast such phenomenon does not exist at all for pressure or gravity driven starting jets issued from short pipes in the literature the velocity overshoot would also occur but might be too short to be captured faithfully 3 2 evolution and interactions of vortex rings to depict the evolution process of the starting jet a time sequence of instantaneous vorticity fields obtained for run 1 are shown in fig 5 at t 0 3 s or at stage i the vortex ring continues developing in size but without pinch off therefore this set of piv data starts at t 0 33 s t 2 4 with an interval of δt 1 12 s δt 0 6 from these graphs one can clearly observe the pinch off evolution and interactions of vortex rings which are well defined as regions of discrete vorticity depending on their sequence of generation they are denoted in a chronological order as v0 v1 v2 v3 v4 and so on v0 stands for the leading ring lr and the rest are trailing rings it is shown in fig 5 a and b that the leading vortex v0 detaches from the trailing jet at the streamwise location of x d 1 0 1 5 corresponding to t 2 4 3 which is significantly shorter than the universal value of t 4 0 5 for piston driven jets by gharib et al 1998 this discrepancy is however not unexpected because the latter case has a much thinner shear layer and greater velocity gradient and hence the vortex rings would be more concentrated on the other hand the fully developed jets have continuous supply of momentum resulting in a more complex process of vortex ring evolution and interactions e g leapfrogging as compared to the latter case where the piston always stops once the leading vortex ring pinches off gharib et al 1998 the followings are a detailed description as time progresses v0 travels downstream and the trailing vorticity elongates in the streamwise direction and becomes disconnected pinched off as a discrete vortex ring v1 at t 0 33 s t 3 6 see fig 5 c consequently v1 catches up with v0 and slips through it fig 5 d and then emerges in front of it fig 5 e this process is similar to the leapfrogging phenomenon but has discernible differences as compared to the ideal case of two identical vortex rings travelling in the same direction the induced velocity of the leading ring causes the rear ring to contract radially and accelerate and concurrently the induced velocity of the rear ring causes the leading ring to expand and slow down the rear ring eventually catches up with the leading ring and slips through it shariff and leonard 1992 once the rear ring slips through the leading ring their roles are reversed so that this process would repeat continually in inviscid flow re for the present flow re 4880 where viscous effect cannot be neglected however only one cycle of leapfrogging is observed between v1 and v0 which is likely due to the fact that v1 is both smaller and weaker than v0 therefore v1 is entrained into v0 forming the new leading ring that continues to propagate downstream at an almost constant pace see fig 5 e and f and a more appropriate term to describe this phenomenon is merging rather than leapfrogging meanwhile new trailing vortex rings v2 and v3 are formed in the wake this pair of vortex rings also experiences a similar process with v3 overtaking v2 and then merging into one fig 5 g and h the newly merged vortex ring v2 v3 also has a tendency to catch up with the leading ring however the vortices quickly break down fig 5 i and j and some vorticity is fed into the leading ring similar to v2 and v3 the subsequently pinched off pair of vortex rings v4 and v5 also exhibits the merging process as shown in fig 5 i k however unlike v2 v3 the merged vortex ring v4 v5 is unable to catch up with the leading ring similar observations are found in the other seven runs to summarize the present impulsively starting jet issued from a long pipe is characterized by multiple occurrences of one cycle catching up and merging process notably in pair of consecutively pinched off vortex rings e g v0 and v1 v2 and v3 v4 and v5 which takes place within a relatively narrow streamwise distance range 2 x d 4 note that the initially pinched off vortex cores are roughly circular in shape during the catching up and merging process they become stretched due to self induced strain and mutual interactions the observed vortex patterns can be used to explain the temporal evolution of velocity profiles shown in fig 4 the twin peak shape in the velocity profile at t 0 17 and 0 25 s is obviously induced by the passage of the leading vortex ring v0 whereas that at t 1 5 s is due to a trailing vortex ring the former occurs at a larger radial positon than the latter in other words the leading vortex ring is located at the outer edge of the shear layer i e without affecting the central part of the jet the trailing vortex ring on the contrary is smaller in diameter and penetrates radially inward and hence effectively reduces the jet stem therefore the mean velocity of the jet would increase due to the conservation of mass in addition the central region of the jet or the center of the vortex rings is subjective to velocity fluctuation induced by the regular pinch off of trailing rings both features are evident in the centerline velocity at stage ii see fig 3 b at t 1 25 s t 9 trailing vortex rings continue to form in the wake of the leading ring however the merging process gradually disappears as shown in fig 6 the pair of rings v6 and v7 still exhibit the merging behavior the ensuing pairs of rings such as v8 and v9 v10 and v11 and so on however do not separate from each other instead they tend to immediately merge into one as evolving downstream as a result the core size of vortex ring or the thickness of the shear layer increases with time until reaching a maximum value similar to that of the leading vortex i e o 0 5d this trend implies a deeper engulfing into the jet potential core so that the centerline mean velocity continues to increase with time within stage ii as shown in fig 3 3 3 comparison between the starting jet and the steady jet as shown above the starting jet is characterized by well defined trailing rings that regularly pinch off in the form of relatively large scale discrete vortical structures in the shear layers similar phenomenon was reported by landers et al 2016 on a starting turbulent jet re 7500 from a long pipe using smoke flow visualization technique this vortex pattern which is believed to be linked with the leading vortex ring persists until the end of the starting state at steady state where the effects of leading vortex ring completely vanish on the other hand the discrete type of vortices disappear and a different pattern is observed see fig 7 b the shear layers become loosely distributed with reduced magnitude of vorticity in the form of elongated chains of vorticity similar change in the trailing vortex pattern is also found for other reynold number re 9760 29 280 qualitatively this change in vortex pattern of the starting jet at different evolution stages is analogues to that in the wake of a stationary cylinder under different boundary conditions free or wall bounded under free condition the cylinder wake is characterized as regular kármán bénard vortex street which is in absolute instability huerre and monkewitz 1990 when the cylinder is put in proximity to a solid boundary by contrast periodic vortex shedding is suppressed and the shear layers are characterized as elongated kelvin helmholtz kh type of roll ups in convective instability see for example wang and tan 2008 and nishino and roberts 2008 the similarity between jet flow and bluff body wake was reported by jeon and gharib 2004 that the vortex formation time in a piston driven starting jet is analogues to that of wake transition from symmetry to asymmetry behind a forced oscillating cylinder in order to better illustrate the jet evolution process a sketch of the vortex formation patterns and the streamwise velocity profiles at the beginning of starting state and the steady state are plotted in fig 8 based on the piv measurement initially the presence of discrete rings leading and trailing would result in the twin peak shape of velocity profiles fig 8 a however the size of the vortex rings is small and their effects are limited to the outer edge of jet core therefore in between the rings the velocity profiles might be unaffected as time progresses the shear layer continues to thicken until the maximum velocity occurs on the centerline at the steady state therefore the velocity profiles at all locations become self similar and can be approximated by a gaussian distribution the two rows of small scale kh vortices are distributed across the shear layer that expands gradually with downstream distance see fig 8 b this is in contrast to the discrete vortices in fig 8 a that are both localized and concentrated at the starting state the velocity gradient between the jet and the ambient is high in magnitude but is localized whereas that at steady state is relatively low since it smooths out and spans across the jet shear layer according to the results it can be summarized that the different stages of the jet evolution are associated with different flow regimes namely vortex ring formation and development at stage i co existence and interactions of discrete vortex rings leading and trailing at stage ii loosely distributed kh vortices at steady state appearance and disappearance of discrete vortex rings symbolize the two transitions of jet evolution 3 4 properties of the leading vortex ring the evolution of the starting jet is dominated by the leading vortex ring whose core manifests as circular regions about 0 5d in diameter of significant vorticity and persists within the image window x 13d or t 20 although we have not measured its subsequent motion at further downstream it is expected to completely vanish until the end of the starting state or t 40 50 in comparison the trailing rings are relatively weaker and smaller also they have a much shorter lifespan and break down before x 7d 8d properties including trajectory and circulation of the leading vortex ring are calculated at every time step of the piv results until the vortex ring has propagated out of the image window the trajectories of the vortex center defined as the point of peak vorticity are plotted in fig 9 the streamwise location x c exhibits an increasing trend with time which could be satisfactorily represented by a straight line based on least squares fitting 3 x c d 0 71 t 0 71 t u b d therefore the propagation speed can calculated as the slope of the straight line which is u c x c t 0 71 u b within the range x d 13 the constant propagation speed of the leading ring implies that when it is overtaken by ensuing rings v1 or the merged ring v2 v3 it does not decelerate as in the case of ideal leapfrogging in other words the leading ring is strong enough to induce the trailing rings to accelerate and then entrain them while maintaining its own speed this propagation speed is greater than that of half the jet exit piston velocity for standard piston driven starting jets gharib et al 1998 on the other hand the transverse location of the vortex center defined as the mean value of the positive and negative vortex cores from the jet axis which is actually the radius of the vortex ring can be approximated by a parabolic function 4 y c d 0 0012 t 2 0 048 t 0 635 therefore the temporal trajectory of the leading vortex ring can be obtained as time progresses the leading vortex ring propagates downstream at a constant speed of 0 71 u b and its size diameter expands radially according to a parabolic function in addition the circulation of the leading vortex ring can be obtained by area integration of spanwise vorticity 5 γ a ω z d x d y where a is roughly a circular or elliptical region with significant vorticity cut off level is 10 of the peak vorticity the evolution of circulation is presented in fig 10 as the double x axis plot bottom t top x d initially γincreases monotonically until reaching a maximum at t 6 or x d 4 which coincides where the merging of v0 and v1 takes place this value is slightly larger than the universal vortex formation time of about 4 for piston driven jets by gharib et al 1998 at which the leading vortex ring pinches off the trailing jet and the circulation attains the maximum thereafter the circulation begins to decay due to viscous diffusion however another peak albeit less obvious is observable at x d 7 which also coincides with the second merging experienced by the leading vortex ring with the merged ring v2 v3 4 conclusions vortex rings generated by an impulsively starting jet from a fully developed pipe re 4880 have been studied by examining sequence of instantaneous velocity vorticity fields obtained by piv the current data show that the interaction between the trailing vortex rings and the leading vortex ring is more complicated than that generated by conventional piston cylinder apparatus the time history of centerline velocity near the jet exit suggests that the evolution of the starting jet consists of two stages i e stage i rapid ramp up and stage ii mild acceleration with different slopes accelerations before reaching the steady state each stage is characterized by distinct vortex patterns vortex ring formation and development but without pinch off at stage i co existence and interactions of leading vortex ring and trailing vortex rings at stage ii loosely distributed small scale kh type of vortices at steady state as compared to conventional piston driven starting jets from sharp edged orifices and pressure or gravity driven jets from short pipes nozzles in the literature a unique feature of the present long pipe jet is the presence of stage ii which is characterized by centerline velocity overshoot and organized vortex patterns appearance and disappearance of discrete type of vortex rings symbolize the two transitions of jet evolution process the twin peak shape in the streamwise velocity profiles of the starting jet is induced by the passage of discrete vortex rings initially the size of the vortex rings is small and their effects are limited to the outer edge of jet shear layer as time progresses the shear layer continues to thicken until the maximum velocity always occurs on the centerline at the steady state an important feature for the starting jet is the occurrence of one cycle merging process in pair of consecutively pinched off vortex rings most notably the strong leading vortex ring and the subsequently pinched off weak trailing vortex ring the latter can catch up with the former and get merged into it as a result the leading vortex ring increases in circulation but its propagation speed is essentially unaffected and keeps steady at about 0 71 times the bulk velocity in the jet near field x d 13 acknowledgements

22938,this paper presents some results of particle image velocimetry piv measurements on an impulsively starting isothermal jet from a fully developed circular pipe with re 4880 the temporal evolution of the starting jet from initiation to steady state is clearly revealed by time sequence of instantaneous velocity vorticity fields obtained by piv in terms of the formation evolution and interactions of the vortex rings leading and trailing the current jet exhibits a drastically different vortex topology as compared to that generated by conventional piston driven starting jets from sharp edged orifices or short pipes nozzles in the literature according to the recorded time series of centerline velocity near the jet exit the evolution of the starting jet can be divided into two stages with different speeds of acceleration and each stage is characterized by distinct vortex patterns one cycle catching up and merging process occurs between each pair of consecutively pinched off vortex rings such as the leading ring and the first trailing ring the second and third trailing rings and so on as a result of the merging with the trailing ring the leading vortex ring increases in circulation but its propagation speed is essentially unaffected keywords starting jet vortex ring particle image velocimetry piv 1 introduction starting jets and vortex ring pinch off play a fundamental role in a wide range of engineering applications such as injectors pulsed jet propulsion and mixers but also in natural flows such as a volcanic eruption pulsatile blood flow in the cardiovascular system and jellyfish swimming see review by shariff and leonard 1992 in the laboratory a starting jet is formed by suddenly injecting a column of fluid from a nozzle or an orifice into the ambient fluid syed and sung 2009 the commonly used configurations to generate staring jet and vortex ring are 1 the piston cylinder apparatus which consists of a movable piston translating along the axis of a cylindrical pipe glezer 1988 gharib et al 1998 pawlak et al 2007 and 2 shock tube in injectors and pulse jet propulsion systems murugan and das 2008 murugan et al 2012 dora et al 2014 if the nozzle exit geometry is circular the resulting vortex ring assumes an axisymmetric doughnut like shape with uniform distribution of vorticity around its circumference glezer 1988 which plays a major role in the entrainment characteristics of starting jets cossali et al 2001 after long enough time after start of injection the leading vortex ring interact with strong jet and loses its identity and hence the starting jet becomes the well known steady jet a key topic of starting jets is the evolution of the vortex ring in terms of its formation instability and breakdown phenomena since vortex ring is the building block behind the mixing entrainment noise generation and heat transfer of the starting jet flow understanding vortex rings eventually enable suppression or enhancement of these properties shariff and leonard 1992 kharoua et al 2017 which is vital for the purpose of effective control of jet flows early studies hill and greene 1977 bremhorst and watson 1981 found that mixing is greatly enhanced by the use of unsteady or fully pulsed jets as compared to a steady jet it was shown that the evolution of a starting jet can be described by a characteristic time similarity parameter t d u j where d and u j are the nozzle exit diameter and the injection velocity respectively the analytical prediction by cossali 2001 showed that a starting air jet reaches steady state at non dimensional times t t t 100 whereas a transient period in the jet development exists for t 20 corresponding to x d 10 where x being the downstream distance from the nozzle exit at t 20 the leading vortex seems to grow by entraining fluid from the jet axis rather than its surroundings but at locations upstream of the leading vortex the jet body interacts with its surroundings and entrains ambient fluid cossali 2001 at later times t 70 the leading vortex entrains ambient fluid and the overall entrainment is larger than that of a steady jet andriani et al 1996 past this stage nozzle rather than ambient fluid feeds the development of the vortex ring the so called universal formation number provides the time beyond which the circulation of the vortex ring does not increase any further the value of formation number has been established by gharib et al 1998 as t 3 6 4 5 alternatively the formation number describes the effective stroke ratio of a given injector l d where l is the effective stroke length defined as the time integral of the exit velocity profile the magnitude of l d plays an important role in determining the ensuing motion of the generated vortex ring allen and auvity 2002 it corresponds to the point of transition from a growing vortex ring of increasing strength to where the ring begins to convect as a result of its self induced velocity this point is marked by a contraction of the ring to reach a stable diameter see didden 1979 when l d 0 1 sheffield 1977 showed that the effects of the vortex image and stopping vortex are strong relative to the self induced effect and the potential exists for the ring to propagate back into the tube for l d of the order 0 5 4 5 the ring will convect away from the orifice under its self induced field the vortex will not continue to grow as a discrete structure for increasing l d and eventually the flow transitions to a jet as mentioned by saffman 1978 the significance of vortex ring formation was demonstrated by krueger and gharib 2003 that the average thrust is maximized by jet thrusts of non dimensional duration very near the formation number the propagation convection speed of the vortex ring is one half of the piston velocity for piston driven starting jets gharib et al 1998 similar to single vortex rings while krieg and mohseni 2013 showed that the propagation speed of vortex ring depends on the nozzle arrangement and driving conditions it is noteworthy that in most of the aforementioned studies using piston cylinder apparatus the exit velocity profile is approximately uniform top hat shape however the flow development and vortex dynamics of a jet are sensitive to the initial conditions at the nozzle exit such as the thickness of trailing edge murugan and das 2008 therefore the exit velocity profile may vary by the motion of the piston and the geometry of the orifice nozzle rosenfeld et al 1998 it was found that vortex rings issued from pipe nozzle with a finite length 1d and 2d in rosenfeld et al 1998 1 6d in syed and sung 2009 are weaker than those that from the sharp edged orifice yu et al 2007 showed that for gravity driven starting jets through a contraction nozzle the exit velocity profile is neither uniform nor parabolic and also varies with time therefore different vortex patterns are observed namely vortex leapfrogging at re 2358 and vortex pinch off at re 3568 and 4716 yu et al 2007 however little work has been conducted on starting jet issued from a long pipe which is also a commonly used nozzle type in engineering applications such as hydraulic jet cleaning and cutting joshi and schreiber 2006 investigated the evolution of entrainment constant for an impulsively starting turbulent jet from a long pipe re 12 600 recently landers et al 2016 carried smoke visualization study on a starting turbulent jet re 7500 from a fully developed pipe length 48d and found the presence of discrete large scale structures in the trailing flow whereas the trailing vortices in piston driven starting jet are basically steady krueger and gharib 2003 according to the above literature survey there is still a lack of studies on starting jets from fully developed pipe and quantitative information about the vortex rings leading and trailing in terms of their evolution with time is still unknown there is a need for a more comprehensive study regarding the temporal evolution of starting pipe jet into steady state in the present study detailed velocity measurements were made in the near field using particle image velocimetry piv to obtain quantitative information on the location shape size and strength of the vortices 2 experimental set up and methodology the experimental set up is shown schematically in fig 1 the set up was designed to produce a starting jet from a fully developed pipe at a desired flow rate a submerged stainless steel pump model garden xks 400s put in a constant head reservoir tank driven flow to a pipeline along which a manual valve a solenoid valve and a rotameter were installed the manual valve and the rotameter were used to adjust the volumetric flow rate q 0 40 l min while the solenoid vale centre opened with an aperture of 200 mm in diameter was used to control the initiation of the flow the jet was formed through a straight smooth transparent acrylic pipe with an inner diameter d 26 mm and a wall thickness of 3 mm the length l of the pipe upstream of exit was 2080 mm 80d which was sufficiently long to establish the flow to be fully developed upon issuing at exit tummers et al 2011 wang et al 2015 the pipe was installed horizontally and concentrically along the centerline of a test tank which was made of glass for full optical access it had dimensions of approximately 16d 12d 100d height width length which was large to ensure the influence of the tank walls and free surface on the jet development to be negligible the pipe protruded a length of 76 mm 3d inside the test tank to avoid the no slip effects from the tank sidewall romano 2002 an orthogonal coordinate system was defined with its origin located at the jet exit on the centerline x along the jet axis and y along the radial direction pointing upwards velocity measurements were performed in the x y plane using a digital piv system lavision model to reveal the vortex formation and pinch off the flow field was illuminated with a double cavity nd yag laser light sheet at 532 nm wavelength litron model power 135 mj per pulse duration 5ns sphericel 110p8 hollow glass spheres which were neutrally buoyant with a mean diameter of 13 μm and could offer good traceability and scattering efficiency were seeded in the flow as tracer particles in order to establish uniform distribution of seeding particles over the entire domain before doing the experiments sufficient amount of seeding particles had been added and stirred to be well mixed in the water in both the test tank and the reservoir tank as the flow was a recirculating system there was no need to add particles during the course of experiments the particle images were recorded using a 14 bit charge coupled device ccd camera which had a resolution of 1600 1200 pixels lavision davis software version 7 2 was used to process the particle images and determine the velocity vectors particle displacement was calculated using the fast fourier transform fft based cross correlation algorithm with standard gaussian sub pixel fit structured as an iterative multi grid method the processing procedure included two passes starting with a grid size of 32 32 pixels and stepping down to the final interrogation area ia of 16 16 pixels overlapping by 50 resulting in a set of 30 000 vectors 200 150 for a typical field in between passes the vector maps were filtered by using a 3 3 median filter in order to remove possible outliers if the centre vector differed from the median vector by more than 5 times the root mean square r m s value the centre vector was replaced by the averaged of the eight neighboring ias the number of particles in each ia was of the order of 10 to yield strong correlations the field of view was 360 mm 270 mm approx 13 8d 10 4d so that the spatial resolution for the present set up was 1 8 mm 1 8 mm approx 0 07d 0 07d unlike most previous research which excited the jet for a short period of time using a piston the current jet flow was held at a constant reynolds number during the experiments the water temperature was maintained at 20 c 0 5 c and the volumetric flow rate q was fixed at 6 l min which yielded the bulk average velocity u b 4q πd 2 0 188 m s and reynolds number re 4880 based on the bulk velocity and the pipe diameter prior to piv measurements the pump was turned on but the solenoid valve was fully closed in order to establish a constant pressure at the upstream side of the solenoid valve consequently the solenoid which was actuated by a computer was fully opened within a short period about 10 ms so that an impulsively starting jet was formed into the test tank filled with still water simultaneously the piv system was triggered to continuously record images at a sampling rate of 12 hz in double fame mode until the jet had reached the steady state in this paper t 0 is defined as the first instant when the jet was issued from the exit and not when the solenoid valve was opened since there was a time lag for the disturbed flow to propagate through the pipe until the exit similar to the literature the characteristic time similarity parameter is defined as t d u j where u j u b and therefore t t t t u b d therefore the time interval between consecutive snapshots is δt 1 12 s corresponding to δt 0 6 through adjusting the time interval between each pair of laser pulses the maximum displacement of particles near the jet exit region is about 6 7 pixels satisfying the criteria proposed by boillot and prasad 1996 and the mean displacement over the whole field of view is about 2 3 pixels according to raffel et al 2007 the uncertainty in the particle displacement determined by standard cross correlation algorithm with sub pixel interpolation is of the order of 0 1 pixels normalizing this uncertainty with the mean displacement of the particles yielded a relative error about 4 in the instantaneous velocities u and v based on the velocity vectors the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z δ v δ x δ u δ y was calculated using the least operations extrapolation scheme the uncertainty in ω z was estimated to be about 10 following the procedure proposed by sciacchitano and wieneke 2016 more details of the piv measurement technique were reported in wang and tan 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 nozzle exit conditions flow axisymmetry and repeatability check a representative snapshot of the instantaneous velocity vector plot of the impulsively starting jet is provided in fig 2 in which flood contours of the normalized instantaneous spanswise vorticity ω z d u b are added to visualize the vortex structures as the laser sheet is a two dimensional slice through the jet center each pair of opposite signed vortices with similar size and magnitude represents a vortex ring that is in a toroidal shape the snapshot was taken at about t 1 75 s t 7 2 which clearly depicts the pinched off initial leading vortex ring and multiple trailing vortex rings behind it the vortex rings are essentially coaxial as indicated by that each pair of vortices is symmetrical about the jet axis x axis as they are propagating downstream as mentioned in the previous section 8 independent runs were conducted to check the repeatability of the experimental data here the time histories of the streamwise velocity on the centerline velocity u c immediately downstream of the exit i e at x y 1d 0 were retrieved to illustrate the jet evolution process see fig 3 a it can be observed that the 8 sets of data collapse quite well indicating good repeatability the duration for each run lasted for 90 s and it was found that the flow reached steady state after t 6 s here the results for the first 16 s were shown to depict the initial ramp profile more clearly the jet can be divided into two states starting state at t 6 s and steady state at t 6 s moreover the starting state can be sub divided into two distinct stages i initial rapid ramp up stage at t 0 3 s or t 2 during which the velocity accelerates linearly from 0 to about 0 3 m s ii subsequent mild acceleration stage t 0 3 s 6 s or t 2 42 where the velocity begins to fluctuate which is due to periodic shedding of vortex rings as will be discussed later in next section but the mean value u c continues to increase gradually and linearly until a maximum value of 0 4 m s the ramp ups of centerline velocity for the impulsively starting jet are explained as follows during the experiments it was observed that the flow rate was kept constant once the solenoid valve was opened since the solenoid valve has a smaller diameter than the pipe 20 mm vs 26 mm the flow actually experiences a contraction when passing through the solenoid valve the flow initiated at the exit of the pipe spontaneously when the solenoid valve opened at t 0 as the entire pipe was filled with water whose disturbance speed vary from 1450 to 1498 m s the roll up of the vortex sheet and the subsequent development of vortex ring takes place at the pipe exit the centerline velocity increases gradually and reaches to a steady state value once the starting vortex ring moves far downstream i e no longer affect the velocity at the exit as there is no effect from back pressure the disturbed flow emanating inside the pipe e g from the contact surface of the solenoid moves downstream until reaching the exit at about t 6 s unlike a laminar flow of the undisturbed fluid the disturbed flow reaching the exit has significant velocity fluctuations which reduces the mean velocity this causes a sudden drop in the mean velocity similar phenomenon was reported by cossali et al 2001 for an impulsively starting jet thereafter at t 6 5 s or t 46 the jet becomes steady and the mean velocity maintains a constant level however cossali et al 2001 did not observe the 2 stage evolution for the starting jet which might be due to the fact that the jet exit velocity about 30 m s is too high to be resolved at a fine enough temporal resolution the least squares regression lines for all 8 sets of data at stages i ii and the steady state can be obtained as u c t u c 0 0216 t 0 281 and u c 0 32 respectively the regression lines are plotted in fig 3 b together with the velocity history of run 1 which is the representative case to illustrate the generation interaction and evolution of vortex rings in the next section note that during stage ii there is an overshoot of centerline velocity 0 3 0 4 m s as compared to the steady state value 0 32 m s a phenomenon that has not been reported elsewhere in the literature on starting jets it is well known that the flow development and vortex dynamics of the starting jet are sensitive to the initial conditions at the nozzle exit rosenfeld et al 1998 therefore the streamwsie mean velocity u profile at x 0 1 d the nearest measurement point downstream of the exit for the jet at steady state is presented in fig 4 b the results are compared with both parabolic and power law 1 7th and 1 6th profiles it is well known that a jet issuing from a pipe would yield parabolic velocity profiles if the flow is laminar and power law velocity profiles if the flow is turbulent here the empirical power law profiles are defined as 1 u u max 1 r r 1 n where u max is the maximum velocity which is always on the jet centerline and r d 2 is the radius of the jet as shown in fig 4 a obviously the present jet re 4880 is neither laminar nor fully turbulent but fall in between similar property was found in our earlier study wang et al 2015 for long pipe jets at re 9800 46 550 this is consistent with the literature that the jet laminar to turbulent transition occurs in a considerably wide range of re 2500 o 104 dimotakis et al 1983 bogey and bailly 2006 this judgement is further confirmed by examining the relationship between the bulk velocity u b and the maximum velocity u max for the parabolic profile u max u b 2 for the power law profile the bulk velocity can be can be determined by integrating equation 1 2 u b u max 0 r v 2 π r d r π r 2 u max 2 0 1 1 r r 1 n r r d r r 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 1 therefore the values of u max u b are 1 264 and 1 224 for n 6 and 7 respectively in the present study u max u b 0 32 0 188 1 702 which is larger than the power law value yet smaller than the parabolic value as shown in fig 3 the exit velocity of the starting jet is varying with time fig 4 c shows the streamwise velocity profiles along x 1 d at different instants t 0 17 and 0 25 s at stage i t 1 5 and 4 s at stage ii the profiles at the starting state are quite different from that at the steady state in the following aspects firstly the profiles at t 0 17 0 25 and 1 5 s exhibit a twin peak shape with peak values near the edge of the shear layer and smaller values near the centerline similar shape was found by yu et al 2007 at the beginning of gravity driven starting jets from a contoured nozzle and was attributed to shedding of vortices secondly the profiles change rapidly with time at stage i both the width of the jet stem and the maximum velocity quickly increase from t 0 17 0 25 s at stage ii t 1 5 and 4 s however the width of the jet stem decreases but the velocity on the centerline increases the latter is consistent with the trend depicted in fig 3 it needs to be highlighted the difference between the present study and those generated by conventional piston driven starting jets from sharp edged orifices and pressure or gravity driven jets from short pipes nozzles in the literature notably the peculiar phenomenon of velocity overshoot during stage ii shown in fig 3 it is likely due to the disturbed flow emanating inside the pipe and traveled to the jet exit this leads to the increase of centerline velocity until the disturbed flow reaches the jet exit and the flow becomes steady a supporting evidence is that the length of the pipe from the solenoid to the pipe exit is 2 08 m dividing it by 6 s yields a speed of 0 35 m s which is consistent with the jet exit velocity of 0 3 0 4 m s as depicted in fig 3 in other words the long pipe can be considered as a buffer which effectively extends the duration of the unsteady stage of the starting jet for starting jets generated by conventional piston driven method by contrast such phenomenon does not exist at all for pressure or gravity driven starting jets issued from short pipes in the literature the velocity overshoot would also occur but might be too short to be captured faithfully 3 2 evolution and interactions of vortex rings to depict the evolution process of the starting jet a time sequence of instantaneous vorticity fields obtained for run 1 are shown in fig 5 at t 0 3 s or at stage i the vortex ring continues developing in size but without pinch off therefore this set of piv data starts at t 0 33 s t 2 4 with an interval of δt 1 12 s δt 0 6 from these graphs one can clearly observe the pinch off evolution and interactions of vortex rings which are well defined as regions of discrete vorticity depending on their sequence of generation they are denoted in a chronological order as v0 v1 v2 v3 v4 and so on v0 stands for the leading ring lr and the rest are trailing rings it is shown in fig 5 a and b that the leading vortex v0 detaches from the trailing jet at the streamwise location of x d 1 0 1 5 corresponding to t 2 4 3 which is significantly shorter than the universal value of t 4 0 5 for piston driven jets by gharib et al 1998 this discrepancy is however not unexpected because the latter case has a much thinner shear layer and greater velocity gradient and hence the vortex rings would be more concentrated on the other hand the fully developed jets have continuous supply of momentum resulting in a more complex process of vortex ring evolution and interactions e g leapfrogging as compared to the latter case where the piston always stops once the leading vortex ring pinches off gharib et al 1998 the followings are a detailed description as time progresses v0 travels downstream and the trailing vorticity elongates in the streamwise direction and becomes disconnected pinched off as a discrete vortex ring v1 at t 0 33 s t 3 6 see fig 5 c consequently v1 catches up with v0 and slips through it fig 5 d and then emerges in front of it fig 5 e this process is similar to the leapfrogging phenomenon but has discernible differences as compared to the ideal case of two identical vortex rings travelling in the same direction the induced velocity of the leading ring causes the rear ring to contract radially and accelerate and concurrently the induced velocity of the rear ring causes the leading ring to expand and slow down the rear ring eventually catches up with the leading ring and slips through it shariff and leonard 1992 once the rear ring slips through the leading ring their roles are reversed so that this process would repeat continually in inviscid flow re for the present flow re 4880 where viscous effect cannot be neglected however only one cycle of leapfrogging is observed between v1 and v0 which is likely due to the fact that v1 is both smaller and weaker than v0 therefore v1 is entrained into v0 forming the new leading ring that continues to propagate downstream at an almost constant pace see fig 5 e and f and a more appropriate term to describe this phenomenon is merging rather than leapfrogging meanwhile new trailing vortex rings v2 and v3 are formed in the wake this pair of vortex rings also experiences a similar process with v3 overtaking v2 and then merging into one fig 5 g and h the newly merged vortex ring v2 v3 also has a tendency to catch up with the leading ring however the vortices quickly break down fig 5 i and j and some vorticity is fed into the leading ring similar to v2 and v3 the subsequently pinched off pair of vortex rings v4 and v5 also exhibits the merging process as shown in fig 5 i k however unlike v2 v3 the merged vortex ring v4 v5 is unable to catch up with the leading ring similar observations are found in the other seven runs to summarize the present impulsively starting jet issued from a long pipe is characterized by multiple occurrences of one cycle catching up and merging process notably in pair of consecutively pinched off vortex rings e g v0 and v1 v2 and v3 v4 and v5 which takes place within a relatively narrow streamwise distance range 2 x d 4 note that the initially pinched off vortex cores are roughly circular in shape during the catching up and merging process they become stretched due to self induced strain and mutual interactions the observed vortex patterns can be used to explain the temporal evolution of velocity profiles shown in fig 4 the twin peak shape in the velocity profile at t 0 17 and 0 25 s is obviously induced by the passage of the leading vortex ring v0 whereas that at t 1 5 s is due to a trailing vortex ring the former occurs at a larger radial positon than the latter in other words the leading vortex ring is located at the outer edge of the shear layer i e without affecting the central part of the jet the trailing vortex ring on the contrary is smaller in diameter and penetrates radially inward and hence effectively reduces the jet stem therefore the mean velocity of the jet would increase due to the conservation of mass in addition the central region of the jet or the center of the vortex rings is subjective to velocity fluctuation induced by the regular pinch off of trailing rings both features are evident in the centerline velocity at stage ii see fig 3 b at t 1 25 s t 9 trailing vortex rings continue to form in the wake of the leading ring however the merging process gradually disappears as shown in fig 6 the pair of rings v6 and v7 still exhibit the merging behavior the ensuing pairs of rings such as v8 and v9 v10 and v11 and so on however do not separate from each other instead they tend to immediately merge into one as evolving downstream as a result the core size of vortex ring or the thickness of the shear layer increases with time until reaching a maximum value similar to that of the leading vortex i e o 0 5d this trend implies a deeper engulfing into the jet potential core so that the centerline mean velocity continues to increase with time within stage ii as shown in fig 3 3 3 comparison between the starting jet and the steady jet as shown above the starting jet is characterized by well defined trailing rings that regularly pinch off in the form of relatively large scale discrete vortical structures in the shear layers similar phenomenon was reported by landers et al 2016 on a starting turbulent jet re 7500 from a long pipe using smoke flow visualization technique this vortex pattern which is believed to be linked with the leading vortex ring persists until the end of the starting state at steady state where the effects of leading vortex ring completely vanish on the other hand the discrete type of vortices disappear and a different pattern is observed see fig 7 b the shear layers become loosely distributed with reduced magnitude of vorticity in the form of elongated chains of vorticity similar change in the trailing vortex pattern is also found for other reynold number re 9760 29 280 qualitatively this change in vortex pattern of the starting jet at different evolution stages is analogues to that in the wake of a stationary cylinder under different boundary conditions free or wall bounded under free condition the cylinder wake is characterized as regular kármán bénard vortex street which is in absolute instability huerre and monkewitz 1990 when the cylinder is put in proximity to a solid boundary by contrast periodic vortex shedding is suppressed and the shear layers are characterized as elongated kelvin helmholtz kh type of roll ups in convective instability see for example wang and tan 2008 and nishino and roberts 2008 the similarity between jet flow and bluff body wake was reported by jeon and gharib 2004 that the vortex formation time in a piston driven starting jet is analogues to that of wake transition from symmetry to asymmetry behind a forced oscillating cylinder in order to better illustrate the jet evolution process a sketch of the vortex formation patterns and the streamwise velocity profiles at the beginning of starting state and the steady state are plotted in fig 8 based on the piv measurement initially the presence of discrete rings leading and trailing would result in the twin peak shape of velocity profiles fig 8 a however the size of the vortex rings is small and their effects are limited to the outer edge of jet core therefore in between the rings the velocity profiles might be unaffected as time progresses the shear layer continues to thicken until the maximum velocity occurs on the centerline at the steady state therefore the velocity profiles at all locations become self similar and can be approximated by a gaussian distribution the two rows of small scale kh vortices are distributed across the shear layer that expands gradually with downstream distance see fig 8 b this is in contrast to the discrete vortices in fig 8 a that are both localized and concentrated at the starting state the velocity gradient between the jet and the ambient is high in magnitude but is localized whereas that at steady state is relatively low since it smooths out and spans across the jet shear layer according to the results it can be summarized that the different stages of the jet evolution are associated with different flow regimes namely vortex ring formation and development at stage i co existence and interactions of discrete vortex rings leading and trailing at stage ii loosely distributed kh vortices at steady state appearance and disappearance of discrete vortex rings symbolize the two transitions of jet evolution 3 4 properties of the leading vortex ring the evolution of the starting jet is dominated by the leading vortex ring whose core manifests as circular regions about 0 5d in diameter of significant vorticity and persists within the image window x 13d or t 20 although we have not measured its subsequent motion at further downstream it is expected to completely vanish until the end of the starting state or t 40 50 in comparison the trailing rings are relatively weaker and smaller also they have a much shorter lifespan and break down before x 7d 8d properties including trajectory and circulation of the leading vortex ring are calculated at every time step of the piv results until the vortex ring has propagated out of the image window the trajectories of the vortex center defined as the point of peak vorticity are plotted in fig 9 the streamwise location x c exhibits an increasing trend with time which could be satisfactorily represented by a straight line based on least squares fitting 3 x c d 0 71 t 0 71 t u b d therefore the propagation speed can calculated as the slope of the straight line which is u c x c t 0 71 u b within the range x d 13 the constant propagation speed of the leading ring implies that when it is overtaken by ensuing rings v1 or the merged ring v2 v3 it does not decelerate as in the case of ideal leapfrogging in other words the leading ring is strong enough to induce the trailing rings to accelerate and then entrain them while maintaining its own speed this propagation speed is greater than that of half the jet exit piston velocity for standard piston driven starting jets gharib et al 1998 on the other hand the transverse location of the vortex center defined as the mean value of the positive and negative vortex cores from the jet axis which is actually the radius of the vortex ring can be approximated by a parabolic function 4 y c d 0 0012 t 2 0 048 t 0 635 therefore the temporal trajectory of the leading vortex ring can be obtained as time progresses the leading vortex ring propagates downstream at a constant speed of 0 71 u b and its size diameter expands radially according to a parabolic function in addition the circulation of the leading vortex ring can be obtained by area integration of spanwise vorticity 5 γ a ω z d x d y where a is roughly a circular or elliptical region with significant vorticity cut off level is 10 of the peak vorticity the evolution of circulation is presented in fig 10 as the double x axis plot bottom t top x d initially γincreases monotonically until reaching a maximum at t 6 or x d 4 which coincides where the merging of v0 and v1 takes place this value is slightly larger than the universal vortex formation time of about 4 for piston driven jets by gharib et al 1998 at which the leading vortex ring pinches off the trailing jet and the circulation attains the maximum thereafter the circulation begins to decay due to viscous diffusion however another peak albeit less obvious is observable at x d 7 which also coincides with the second merging experienced by the leading vortex ring with the merged ring v2 v3 4 conclusions vortex rings generated by an impulsively starting jet from a fully developed pipe re 4880 have been studied by examining sequence of instantaneous velocity vorticity fields obtained by piv the current data show that the interaction between the trailing vortex rings and the leading vortex ring is more complicated than that generated by conventional piston cylinder apparatus the time history of centerline velocity near the jet exit suggests that the evolution of the starting jet consists of two stages i e stage i rapid ramp up and stage ii mild acceleration with different slopes accelerations before reaching the steady state each stage is characterized by distinct vortex patterns vortex ring formation and development but without pinch off at stage i co existence and interactions of leading vortex ring and trailing vortex rings at stage ii loosely distributed small scale kh type of vortices at steady state as compared to conventional piston driven starting jets from sharp edged orifices and pressure or gravity driven jets from short pipes nozzles in the literature a unique feature of the present long pipe jet is the presence of stage ii which is characterized by centerline velocity overshoot and organized vortex patterns appearance and disappearance of discrete type of vortex rings symbolize the two transitions of jet evolution process the twin peak shape in the streamwise velocity profiles of the starting jet is induced by the passage of discrete vortex rings initially the size of the vortex rings is small and their effects are limited to the outer edge of jet shear layer as time progresses the shear layer continues to thicken until the maximum velocity always occurs on the centerline at the steady state an important feature for the starting jet is the occurrence of one cycle merging process in pair of consecutively pinched off vortex rings most notably the strong leading vortex ring and the subsequently pinched off weak trailing vortex ring the latter can catch up with the former and get merged into it as a result the leading vortex ring increases in circulation but its propagation speed is essentially unaffected and keeps steady at about 0 71 times the bulk velocity in the jet near field x d 13 acknowledgements

22939,in this work formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients of one dimensional linear water waves propagating on a submerged structure with a cycloidal cross section are obtained in the specialized literature the previous coefficients have been obtained mainly for the limit of linear long water waves which is a strong restriction for their application to avoid this restriction we obtain an approximate analytical solution based on a taylor polynomial to the modified mild slope equation which models the interactions of a wide range of water waves from short waves to long waves the dimensionless governing equation is a function of a kinematical parameter and a geometrical parameter it is found that for a value of 0 35 of the geometrical parameter the reflection coefficient tends increase significantly the results show that as the magnitude of the kinematical parameter increases the reflection coefficient exhibits oscillatory behaviour and increases in magnitude in addition for some discrete values of this parameter the zero reflection phenomenon occurs to validate the present approximate analytical solution we present a comparison against two analytical solutions obtained with the aid of linear long wave theory in which it is found that three solutions behave properly keywords submerged breakwater zero reflection coastal engineering short waves 1 introduction the action of incident water waves along a coast can cause damage to human settlements and disruption to human activities consequently many researches have directed their attention towards the development of artificial protective structures also known as breakwaters these structures are mainly rectangular trapezoidal elliptical or circular in geometry and may be either emerged or submerged wiegel 1964 the interactions of water waves with breakwaters induce such hydrodynamic mechanisms as diffraction refraction reflection and shoaling phenomena that must properly considered for correct breakwater design when an incoming wave interacts with a breakwater a portion of the wave will be reflected while some of it will be transmitted dean and dalrymple 1991 this phenomenon is characterized by reflection and transmission coefficients in the past wave reflection has been studied extensively special mention should be made of the pioneering work developed by lamb 1932 who analysed the interactions of linear water waves with an infinite step providing formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients other important analytical solutions for the reflection of long waves from linear and parabolic shelf profiles can be found in the classic books of mei et al 1997 and dingemans 2005 in a similar direction a relevant contribution was also made by chang and liou 2007 who used the method of matched asymptotic expansions to analyse the reflection and transmission of long waves on a trapezoidal breakwater and a series of trapezoidal breakwaters later liu and luo 2013 obtained an analytical solution for the reflection of linear long waves from two rectangular breakwaters using the linear long wave approximation bautista et al 2015 derived asymptotic formulas for the reflection transmission coefficients of linear long water waves propagating in a harbour composed of a slender tapered region connected to uniform inlet and outlet regions liu et al 2015a reported an analytical solution for the problem of long wave reflection from a series of artificial bars with a parabolic configuration in terms of the associated legendre functions lin and liu 2005 obtained an analytical solution for linear long wave reflection from an obstacle of a general trapezoidal shape a similar investigation was conducted by zeng et al 2017 who derived a closed form analytical solution for the reflection of linear long waves propagating over a series of submerged rectangular breakwaters located on a sloping seabed in these previous works wave reflection has been fundamentally analysed for geometries with linear transitions regarding curvilinear geometries a breakwater with a semicircular cross section is the most commonly studied in this context yuan and tao 2003 numerically analysed the hydrodynamics induced by the interactions of water waves with a submerged semicircular breakwater and an alternately submerged and emerged semicircular breakwater using linear wave theory and multipole expansion liu and li 2012 studied the interaction of water waves with submerged and perforated semicircular breakwaters recently medina rodríguez et al 2016 obtained formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients of linear long water waves propagating over a cycloidal breakwater previous works have appropriately reevaluated the physical parameters of the interactions between waves and breakwaters and have analysed the effects of various physical parameters on wave reflection however one of the most relevant shortcomings of the previous analytical solutions is that the majority of them have been obtained exclusively for the limit of linear long water waves which is a strong restriction for their engineering application an alternative approach is to use the elliptical mild slope equation mse which was derived by berkhoff 1972 as a governing equation berkhoff 1972 proved that for the assumption that the bottom slope is mild which means that it is less than 1 3 they demonstrated that integrating along depth the three dimensional laplace equation is reduced into the two dimensional mse this equation allows one to analyse the propagation of linear water waves from short waves to long waves the mse considers the effects of diffraction refraction reflection and shoaling for linear surface water waves several extensions of the mse have been developed for either steeper slopes with very large characteristic length scales or shorter irregularities such as sand bars as noted by mei et al 1997 however it has been observed by a number of authors that the mse can fail to produce adequate approximations for certain types of topographies such as ripples chamberlain and porter 1995 to improve the application of the mse relevant extensions of the mse can be found in the specialized literature including kirby 1986 chamberlain and porter 1995 porter and staziger 1995 miles and chamberlain 1998 and others in particular the modified mild slope equation mmse in which the bottom curvature term and the slope squared term are considered proposed by chamberlain and porter 1995 has been used to analyse the interactions of water waves with various structures we are aware that the mmse can be solved using different numerical techniques however in this work we have selected an approximate analytical solution to studied the interaction between linear water waves and a submerged structure in the specialized literature few analytical solutions to the mse and the mmse are available and those few solutions are focused on the effects of islands or trenches on the hydrodynamics of water waves the relevance of the analytical solutions is that allows to get inside into the physical problem providing information related with the competition between the different physical mechanism to obtain exact analytical solutions of the mmse is a very difficult task the main difficult come from the trascendental functions included in the variable coefficients of the governing equations in addition for the particular case of a cycloidal breakwater its cross section is defined by parametric equations where the parameter is implicit condition that adds an extra difficulty in this context based on the mmse xie and liu 2012 obtained formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients for water waves propagating over trenches of various shapes liu et al 2004 developed an analytical technique based on the use of series expansions to solve the mse for an axisymmetric topography this technique was applied to study the combined refraction and diffraction of plane monochromatic waves by a circular cylindrical island sitting on a paraboloidal shoal a similar study was conducted by cheng et al 2012 who obtained an approximate analytical solution to the mse to analyse the wave scattering produced by a circular cylindrical island sitting on an axisymmetrical shoal jung et al 2008 derived two types of analytical solutions for waves propagating over an asymmetric trench one is a long wave solution and the other is a mild slope solution which is applicable to deeper water hsiao et al 2010 derived an analytical solution to the mmse for a conical island by adapting hunt s direct solution for linear dispersion to be applicable to waves at intermediate water depths liu and xie 2013 developed an analytical technique for solving the mmse for linear wave scattering by homma islands this solution was obtained in terms of fourier cosine series and taylor series liu et al 2012 proposed an approximate analytical solution to the mmse in the form of a taylor series they reported formulas for the reflection coefficients over the entire range from long waves to short waves for four one dimensional piecewise smooth topographies liu et al 2013a derived an analytical solution to the mmse for wave reflection from a submerged rectangular breakwater with two scour trenches despite these previous investigations no analytical results appropriate for the reflection and transmission coefficients are available for the interaction between short water waves of small amplitude and a submerged cycloidal breakwater except for the simplest case of the problem corresponding to linear parabolic or semi circular breakwaters transitions adjoining a constant depth segment the major of these studies are carried out by considering the approximation of linear long water waves in this work we use the mmse to analyse the hydrodynamics induced by the interaction of linear water waves with a submerged cycloidal structure this structure was first proposed by medina rodríguez et al 2016 who consider that the cross section of some submerged breakwaters i e geotube breakwaters can obey a cycloidal geometry medina rodríguez s work is very restrictive because the solution is obtained using the approximation of linear long water waves based on the above considerations the main purpose of the present study is to eliminate this limitation by obtaining an approximate analytical solution to the mmse the formula for the free surface elevation and the reflection and transmission coefficients derived in the present work have a larger range of engineering applications than those proposed by medina rodríguez et al 2016 because these formulas allow us to analyse the interactions of a wide range of water waves from short waves to long waves with a cycloidal structure because the approximate analytical solution is obtained for a general cycloidal breakwater three geometric configurations are analysed as follows case 1 a cycloidal breakwater case 2 a semi cycloidal breakwater and case 3 a quarter cycloidal breakwater we have selected a cycloidal structure because these structures have several advantages as follows 1 they enable the generation of higher reflection coefficient values than those obtained using parabolic or semicircular breakwaters 2 they can be easily implemented in intermediate water depths and in shallow flows 3 they have little impact on the environment because they allow the exchange of water between the upstream and downstream regions and therefore contribute to improving the water quality in their shadow regions and 4 with small increments in the height of a cycloidal breakwater its reflective behaviour improves significantly this work is organized in the following manner in section 1 the interaction of water waves with a cycloidal structure is described and the governing equation is presented in terms of physical variables the dimensionless version of the governing equation and the methodology for obtaining its analytical solution are explained in section 2 section 3 presents the results and discusses the effects of the kinematical and geometrical parameters on the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the free surface elevation of the water waves for three structure configurations finally the principal conclusions of this study are summarized in section 4 2 formulation of the problem let us consider a one dimensional linear water wave with an incident amplitude a i a wavelength λ 1 and an angular frequency ω 2 π t where t is the wave period propagating from left to right over a submerged structure whose cross section exhibits a cycloidal transition see fig 1 the control volume is formed of three regions r 1 r 2 and r 3 in the selected cartesian coordinate system the positive direction of the x axis is to the right and the x axis has its origin at the intersection of regions r 1 and r 2 the z axis points outwards in the normal direction to the mean sea water level the water depths in regions r 1 and r 3 are constants and the depth transition in region r 2 follows a cycloidal profile the lengths of regions r 1 and r 3 correspond to the intervals x 0 and l x the interval corresponding to the transition region r 2 is 0 x θ l the x axis in region r 2 is a function of the parameter θ which is the rotation angle of a circle of radius r this angle takes values in the interval π 2 θ θ l where θ l is the maximum value of θ and corresponds to x l here it is assumed that the length l y of the breakwater normal to the x z plane satisfies l y l and l y λ 1 the wave field in region r 1 is formed by the sum of an incident wave of amplitude a i and a reflected wave of amplitude a r because there are no obstacles in region r 3 only a transmitted wave of amplitude a t is present in this region the water depths in the three previously defined regions are given by the following functions medina rodríguez et al 2016 1 h h 1 h 2 θ h 1 r cos θ h 3 h 1 r cos θ l for for for x 0 0 x x l θ l π 2 θ θ l the parametric equation for the horizontal distribution in region r 2 is given by 2 x θ r θ sin θ 1 π 2 from the above equation the horizontal projection of the cycloidal breakwater can be calculated as follows 3 l r θ l sin θ l 1 π 2 2 1 governing equation here we consider plane harmonic linear water waves that satisfy the ratio a i h 1 1 and are normally incident on the breakwater because the boundary layer generated by the motion of the fluid on the impermeable bottom is very small compared with the water depth viscous effects are neglected therefore a potential flow is assumed with the aim of obtaining an approximate analytical solution with a greater range of valid engineering applications in the present work the governing equation used to model the free surface elevation is the well known one dimensional modified mild slope equation mmse which includes a bottom curvature term and a slope square term chamberlain and porter 1995 the equation that models the elevation of the free surface elevation in region r 2 is expressed in the following manner 4 c x c g x d 2 η x d x 2 d c x c g x d x d η x d x k 2 2 x c x c g x u 1 d 2 h x d x 2 u 2 d h x d x 2 η x 0 where η x is the free surface elevation k 2 x is the wave number in region r 2 which varies with the depth of the control volume and g is the gravitational acceleration the wave celerity c x can be calculated using the dispersion equation 5 c x g k x tanh k 2 x h x and the group celerity c g x is calculated as follows 6 c g x c x 2 1 2 k 2 x h x sinh 2 k 2 x h x for brevity hereafter η η x h h x k 2 k 2 x c c x and c g c g x in eq 4 the functions u 1 and u 2 are defined by the following equations 7 u 1 g 1 tanh 2 k 2 h 4 2 k 2 h sinh 2 k 2 h sinh 2 k 2 h 2 k 2 h cosh 2 k 2 h and 8 u 2 g k 2 1 tanh 2 k 2 h 12 2 k 2 h sinh 2 k 2 h 3 16 k 2 h 4 32 k 2 h 3 sinh 2 k 2 h 9 sinh 2 k 2 h

x η 0 where the variable coefficient b x in eq 9 is given by 10 b x k 2 2 u 1 c c g h u 2 c c g h 2 here h and h denote the first and second derivatives respectively of the water depth by substituting the dispersive equation 5 into the functions 7 and 8 the latter can be rewritten as follows 11 u 1 g 2 k 2 2 ω 4 g ω 2 g 2 k 2 2 h ω 4 h 4 g k 2 2 g 2 k 2 2 h ω 4 h g ω 2 and 12 u 2 g 2 k 2 2 ω 4 4 96

k 2 2 ω 4 2 g 2 k 2 2 ω 4 3 in a similar manner as before the quantity c c g that appears in eq 9 can be simplified as follows 13 c c g g ω 2 ω 4 h g 2 k 2 2 h 2 g k 2 2 two difficulties arise in an attempt to obtain an approximate analytical solution to eq 9 1 the complexity of the variable coefficients of eq 9 does not allow us to apply standard methods to obtain an analytical solution and 2 the wavenumber k 2 must be obtained from eq 5 via an iterative procedure the cases for which the wave number can be obtained directly for a given wave frequency ω is the long wave approximation corresponding to the limit of k 2 h π 10 because the wave celerity reduces to c ω k 2 g h in this case and for the limit of short waves k 2 h π in addition for the limit of k 2 h 1 we have that c c g to obtain an approximate analytical solution to eq 9 appropriate boundary conditions are required considering continuity of pressure at the intersections x 0 and x l the following boundary conditions are suggested 14 η 1 x 0 η x 0 and η x l η 3 x l where η 1 x and η 3 x are the free surface elevations in regions r 1 and r 3 respectively for these regions where the water depth h is constant eq 4 reduces to 15 d 2 η 1 3 d x 2 k 1 3 2 η 1 3 0 the analytical solutions to eq 15 are well known they are given by 16 η 1 x a i e i k 1 x a r e i k 1 x and 17 η 3 x a t e i k 3 x where the wave numbers in regions r 1 and r 3 are defined as k 1 2 π λ 1 and k 3 2 π λ 3 respectively the wavelength in region r 3 is λ 3 and i 1 as seen in eq 16 and eq 17 there are two additional unknown complex constants a r and a t therefore two additional boundary conditions are required these can be obtained from the principle of mass conservation and are expressed as follows 18 d η 1 d x x 0 d η d x x 0 and d η d x x l d η 3 d x x l 3 dimensionless governing equation to reduce the number of combinations of the physical variables involved in eq 9 the governing equation is presented in its dimensionless version to this end pertinent characteristic scales are introduced for regions r 1 and r 3 the characteristic horizontal scales are the wavelengths in these regions λ 1 and λ 3 respectively and they are related to the wave numbers k 1 2 π λ 1 and k 3 2 π λ 3 for region r 2 the characteristic horizontal scale is the length of the breakwater l the characteristic scale for the free surface elevation is the incident wave amplitude a i thus the following dimensionless variables are proposed 19 χ 1 3 k 1 3 x χ 2 x l δ 1 χ 1 η 1 x a i δ 2 χ 2 η x a i δ 3 χ 3 η 3 x a i h h 2 x θ h 1 and κ k 2 x ω 2 g by substituting the dimensionless variables defined in eq 19 into eq 9 the following equation is obtained 20 d 2 δ 2 d χ 2 2 d ln c c g d χ 2 d δ 2 d χ 2 b δ 2 0 where 21 c c g 1 γ 2 h h κ 2 2 κ 2 22 b γ μ κ 2 u 1 c c g d 2 h d χ 2 2 u 2 c c g d h d χ 2 2 23 u 1 c c g b 1 2 f 2 u 2 c c g b 2 6 f 4 24 b 1 κ 2 h κ 4 γ 4 h γ 2 25 b 2 2 γ 2 h 4 κ 10 8 γ 4 h 4 8 γ 2 h 3 3 h 2 κ 8 6 2 γ 6 h 4 4 γ 4 h 3 2 γ

defined in eq 19 into the dispersive equation eq 5 the dimensionless wavenumber κ can be obtained via an iterative procedure using the following equation 27 κ tanh κ γ h 1 the roots of eq 27 which provides the values of the variable κ are obtained for fixed values of the parameters μ and γ and for each value of the angle θ here we have implemented the iterative method of newton raphson from eq 27 can be calculated the wave number k 1 and k 3 which corresponds to the regions r 1 and r 3 respectively when θ π 2 implies h 1 or h 2 π 2 h 1 consequently k 2 π 2 k 1 in a similar manner when θ θ l we have that h 2 θ l h 3 and k 2 θ l k 3 for the particular case of h 1 h 3 we have that k 1 k 3 by combining eq 1 and eq 2 with eq 20 the following equation expressed in terms of the angle θ is obtained 28 1 cos θ d 2 δ 2 d θ 2 1 cos θ d ln c c g d θ sin θ d δ 2 d θ b ˆ θ δ 2 0 where 29 b ˆ θ γ μ 2 1 cos θ 3 κ 2 b 1 1 cos θ μ 2 f 2 b 2 sin 2 θ 1 cos θ μ 2 6 f 4 in the above equation the dimensionless parameters γ and μ are defined as 30 γ ω 2 g h 1 and μ r h 1 the definition of long intermediate and short waves can be expressed in terms of the parameter γ from eq 27 the following limits are obtained dean and dalrymple 1991 1 long water waves for the limit of k 1 h 1 π 10 we have that tanh k 1 h 1 k 1 h 1 and therefore eq 27 is reduced to 31 γ k 1 h 1 2 for k 1 h 1 π 10 32 or γ π 10 2 2 intermediate water waves the intermediate water waves are defined in the interval π 10 k 1 h 1 π taking into account the previous comment and from the dispersion equation we have 33 γ k 1 h 1 tanh k 1 h 1 for π 10 k 1 h 1 π 34 or π 10 2 γ π 3 short water waves waves are termed as short waves for values of k 1 h 1 π which implies that tanh k 1 h 1 1 and therefore we have that 35 γ k 1 h 1 for k 1 h 1 π we must point out that for a small height of the structure compared with the characteristic water depth that is μ r h 1 1 implies that h 1 h 2 consequently the wave number of region r 1 and the wave number of region r 2 are k 1 k 2 in a similar manner when h 1 h 3 the wave numbers k 1 k 3 by varying the order of magnitude of the parameter γ we can model wave propagation for a larger range of engineering applications than is possible for the work of medina rodríguez et al 2016 because with the present mathematical model it is possible to analyse the propagation of water waves under conditions ranging from deep water to shallow flows the geometrical parameter μ takes values in the interval 0 μ 1 the dimensionless boundary conditions for pressure continuity at θ π 2 and θ θ l can be expressed as follows 36 δ 1 χ 1 0 δ 2 θ π 2 and δ 2 θ θ l δ 3 χ 3 k 3 l taking into account the dimensionless variables 19 in eq 18 and applying the chain rule we can relates the free surface elevation of region r 1 expressed in cartesian coordinates with the free surface elevation of region r 2 that is written as a function of the angle θ i e for θ π 2 from eq 2 we obtain that x 0 therefore the dimensionless boundary conditions given in eq 18 for mass conservation at θ π 2 and θ θ l can be expressed as follows 37 d δ 1 d χ 1 χ 1 0 1 κ γ μ 1 cos θ d δ 2 d θ θ π 2 and 38 1 κ γ μ 1 cos θ d δ 2 d θ θ θ l d δ 3 d χ 3 χ 3 k 3 l the dimensionless surface elevations δ 1 and δ 3 can be straightforwardly obtained by substituting eq 19 into eq 16 and eq 17 the resulting equations are 39 δ 1 χ 1 e i χ 1 r e i χ 1 and δ 3 χ 3 t e i χ 3 where r a r a i and t a t a i are the unknown complex reflection and transmission coefficients respectively 3 1 approximate analytical solution the dimensionless governing equation given in eq 28 is a homogeneous second order differential equation with variable coefficients because of the complexity of the variable coefficients of eq 28 an exact analytical solution is not possible however an approximate analytical solution can be deduced in this section the technique for obtaining an approximate analytical solution to eq 28 is presented here we adopt the methodology proposed by sezer 1996 who presented a matrix method for approximately solving a second order linear differential equation with specified associated conditions expressed in terms of taylor polynomials about any point only the fundamental steps are presented for the specific details see the work of sezer 1996 the presented analytical method is capable of quickly providing insight into how the solution depends on the kinematical parameter γ ω 2 g h 1 and the geometrical parameter μ r h 1 the governing equation given in eq 28 can be rewritten in the following manner 40 p θ d 2 δ 2 θ d θ 2 q θ d δ 2 θ d θ r θ δ 2 θ 0 where the variable coefficients that appear in eq 40 are defined as follows p θ 1 cos θ q θ 1 cos θ d ln c c g d θ sin θ and r θ b ˆ θ to solve eq 40 the notation used by medina rodríguez et al 2016 is introduced p i 0 c q i 0 c and r i 0 c are the values of the i 0 th derivatives of the known functions p θ q θ and r θ where c is any value on the interval π 2 c θ l the particular case of i 0 0 represents the function evaluated at θ c the derivatives of the variable coefficients are obtained using recursive formulas which are explained in detail below the approximate analytical solution to eq 28 or eq 40 is proposed in the form of a taylor polynomial as follows 41 δ 2 θ n 0 n 1 n y n c θ c n for n 0 1 n here the degree of the polynomial is given by n and the y n c are unknown coefficients that must be determined using the following relationship 42 y w 1 f ˆ where y y 0 c y 1 c y n c t is a vector that contains the unknown coefficients y n and the superscript 1 indicates the inverse of the matrix w the matrix w and the vector f ˆ are defined as 43 w w 00 w 01 w 02 0 0 w 10 w 11 w 12 w 13 0 w n 2 0 w n 2 1 w n 2 2 w n 2

s 2 c m s 1 q m s 1 c m s r m s c for m 0 1 n 2 and s 0 1 n in 44 the binomial coefficients are defined as follows 45 i ˆ j ˆ i ˆ i ˆ j ˆ j ˆ the last two terms of the vector f ˆ are different to zero therefore the unknown coefficients y n c can be calculated straightforwardly using the following formula 46 y 0 c y 1 c y 2 c y n c f 0 n 1 1 r f 0 n t e i k 3 l f 1 n 1 1 r f 1 n t e i k 3 l f 2 n 1 1 r f 2 n t e i k 3 l f n n 1 1 r f n n t e i k 3 l where the f m n are the elements of the inverse matrix w 1 3 1 1 recursive formulas the evaluation of eq 44 requires the i 0 th derivatives of p i 0 c q i 0 c and r i 0 c obtaining these derivatives is complicated due to the complex structures of the functions p q and r to solve this problem we adopt the methodology proposed by yang 2011 and liu et al 2012 who derived a series of recursive formulas for obtaining these derivatives some additional recursive formulas are proposed in the present work we note that the function p θ 1 cos θ is simple and that its derivatives can be straightforwardly calculated for brevity hereafter p p θ q q θ and r r θ the m th derivative of the coefficient q θ can be obtained using the following recursive formula 47 q m i 0 m m i p i ln c c g m 1 i sin θ m m 1 2 in eq 47 the m 1 i th derivative of ln c c g is required this derivative is calculated using the following formula 48 ln c c g m 1 c c g c c g

section three geometries are analysed namely a cycloidal breakwater a semi cycloidal breakwater and a quarter cycloidal breakwater for each structure in eqs 57 61 the following restrictions must be considered 1 for the cycloidal breakwater c π a π 2 and b π 2 2 for the semi cycloidal breakwater c 3 π 4 a π 4 and b π 4 3 for the quarter cycloidal breakwater c 5 π 8 a π 8 and b π 8 because the analysed problem is a conservative system the following energy identity must also be satisfied 62 r 2 c g h 3 c g h 1 t 2 1 where the ratio of the celerities group c g h 3 c g h 1 in terms of the present dimensionless variables is defined as 63 c g h 3 c g h 1 1 κ 3 tanh γ κ 3 1 μ cos θ l 1 κ 1 tanh γ κ 1 1 2 γ κ 3 1 μ cos θ l sinh 2 γ κ 3 1 μ cos θ l 1 2 γ κ 1 sinh 2 γ κ 1 and the dimensionless wave numbers κ 3 κ θ l and κ 1 κ π 2 are calculated with eq 27 in particular when θ l 3 π 2 which corresponds to a cycloidal breakwater the ratio c g h 3 c g h 1 1 for the case of long water waves defined by the limit of γ π 10 eq 63 is simplified to 64 c g h 3 c g h 1 1 μ cos θ l h 3 h 1 1 2 and therefore the energy identity 62 can be written in the following manner 65 r 2 1 μ cos θ l 1 2 t 2 1 4 results in this section analytical results are presented to illustrate the effects of different wave characteristics and structural parameters on the reflected and transmitted waves as well as the influence of a cycloidal breakwater on the free surface elevation the physical parameters used to obtain the dimensionless parameters are those presented in table 1 for the application of the mmse the slope parameter must satisfy s h x λ 1 h o 1 in terms of the present variables the slope parameter is rewritten as s 2 π sin θ 1 cos θ 1 1 μ cos θ γ considering a value of θ 3 π 2 which corresponds to the maximum slope of the breakwater and a value of γ 0 785 the parameter s takes a value of s 8 and therefore the assumption of s o 1 is satisfied 4 1 accuracy of the approximate analytical solution because the approximate analytical solution as given in eq 57 is obtained as a taylor polynomial the series must be truncated to a desired accuracy we adopt the criterion that the following equation must be approximately satisfied 66 d θ i 10 k ˆ where 67 d θ i p θ i d 2 δ 2 θ i d θ i 2 q θ i d δ 2 θ i d θ i r θ i δ 2 θ 0 k ˆ is a prescribed integer number and the variable θ i

20 and γ 0 471 as seen the results for n 17 and 21 are almost identical the results shown in fig 2 must approximately satisfy eq 66 table 2 shows the accuracy of the approximate analytical solution for different values of θ i 3 π 4 7 π 8 9 π 8 23 π 16 with the criterion that d θ i 10 3 the required accuracy is satisfied for values of n 13 based on these findings we have selected a value of n 17 for the results presented in the following sections 4 2 convergence analysis the second order differential equation 28 has complex singularities for complex roots of 1 cos θ at θ 2 n π for n 0 1 2 the second complex singularities of eq 28 are given when the term 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 which appears in eq 7 the dimensionless version of this last relationship is given by 68 2 γ κ h sinh 2 γ κ h 0 recall that h 1 μ cos θ therefore eq 68 can be expressed in the following manner 69 2 γ κ 1 μ cos θ sinh 2 γ κ 1 μ cos θ 0 equation 69 is satisfied when 1 μ cos θ 0 therefore the second complex singularities of eq 28 are given by the complex roots of equation cos θ 1 μ 0 which are given by 70 θ 2 n 1 π i ln 1 1 μ 2 μ for n 0 1 2 the approximate analytical solution 57 for a cycloidal breakwater converges if 71 π 2 ln 1 1 μ 2 μ or in other words μ 1 cosh π 2 or μ 0 398 for the semi cycloidal breakwater the series solution 57 converges for 72 π 4 π 4 2 ln 1 1 μ 2 μ 2 or μ 1 for the quarter cycloidal breakwater the series solution 57 converges for 73 π 8 3 π 8 2 ln 1 1 μ 2 μ 2 or μ 1 the previous analysis clarifies that the approximate analytical solution 57 converges and therefore the number of terms of the series will be a function of the desired precision 4 3 comparison of the present mathematical model with the analytical solution of medina rodríguez et al 2016 we note that for this type of cycloidal breakwater neither experimental data nor a full numerical solution for the wave amplification have been previously reported however to verify the correctness of the proposed approximate analytical solution for the dimensionless free surface elevation δ 2 θ we present a comparison with the analytical solution of medina rodríguez et al 2016 medina rodríguez s solution was obtained for the limit of linear long water waves in which case the ursell number must be u r 1 for this comparison the considered water depths are h 1 h 3 0 9 m and the radius of the cycloidal breakwater takes the following values r 0 09 0 18 0 27 m the wavenumber in region r 1 is k 1 0 264 m 1 with the above values the dimensionless parameters take values of γ 0 237 and μ 0 10 0 20 0 30 using these values of γ and μ fig 3 shows a comparison of the present approximate analytical solution against medina rodríguez s solution from which it can be seen that both solutions are in good agreement 4 4 comparison of the approximate analytical solution with the liu et al liu et al 2015b theory the present analytical solution is compared with the analytical solution of liu et al 2015b who obtained an analytical solution for the problem of the long wave reflection by a series of artificial bars with parabolic configuration in terms of associated legendre functions for some values of the dimensionless parameter μ the parabolic geometry analysed by liu et al 2015b is similar with the cycloidal transition but they are not identical following liu et al 2015b the geometrical distribution of the parabolic bar depth in terms of the parameter μ is given by 74 h p χ 2 1 μ μ 2 χ 2 1 2 where h p χ 2 h p x h 1 the free surface elevation δ p χ 2 in the interval 0 χ 2 0 5 is written in the following manner 75 δ p χ 2 a 1 e 0 χ 2 1 4 p 1 2 ϕ e 1 χ 2 a 2 e 0 χ 2 1 4 q 1 2 ϕ e 1 χ 2 and for 0 5 χ 2 1 the free surface elevation is given by 76 δ p χ 2 a 3 h 0 χ 2 1 4 p 1 2 ϕ h 1 χ 2 a 4 h 0 χ 2 1 4 q 1 2 ϕ h 2 χ 2 where 77 e 0 χ 2 1 1 μ 1 μ 1 2 χ 2 2 e 1 χ 2 1 2 χ 2 1 μ μ 1 2 χ 2 2 78 h 0 χ 2 1 1 μ 1 μ 2 χ 2 1 2 h 1 χ 2 2 χ 2 1 1 μ μ 1 2 χ 2 2 and 79 h 2 χ 2 2 χ 2 1 1 μ μ 2 χ 2 1 2 the associated legendre functions of the first and second kinds are given by p 1 2 ϕ and q 1 2 ϕ respectively and ϕ 1 γ μ 2 π 2 2 the constants a 1 a 4 are determined by using the patching boundary conditions of the mass conservation and pressures at χ 2 0 0 5 1 considering the same values of the parameters μ and γ used in section 3 3 in fig 3 is shown the comparison of the present approximate

interval π 2 θ 3 π 2 when h 1 h 3 see fig 4a for the results shown here the parameter values are μ 0 10 0 30 see fig 4b and c respectively and γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 for μ 0 10 the free surface elevation is practically unperturbed for γ 0 785 the maximum elevation at θ π 2 is only 6 greater than the incident wave amplitude however with a small increment in the parameter μ i e to μ 0 30 and the same values of γ and θ the free surface elevation is 1 13 times greater for a value of γ 0 785 than the incident wave amplitude in general with an increase in the parameter γ the free surface elevation increases upstream of the breakwater whereas downstream of the structure it decreases significantly for the submerged cycloidal breakwater shown in figs 4a and 5 presents the reflection and transmission coefficients r and t respectively the results are obtained as a function of the parameter μ and for different values of the parameter γ 0 157 0 237 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 we can appreciate that for small increments of the parameter μ the reflection coefficient increases see fig 5a in addition the results indicate that with increasing magnitude of the parameter γ and for values of μ 0 3 the structure is highly reflective this is a very important result because it is not necessary for the structure to have a large radius to be able to reflect the wave energy significantly from the transmission coefficients t plotted in fig 5b we can see that for values of μ 0 1 the transmission coefficient t 1 which physically implies that the wave energy is completely transmitted for larger values of μ o 0 3 the transmission coefficient rapidly decreases in general the structure generates larger reflection coefficients for short waves than for long waves as an example consider μ 0 35 and two values of γ γ 0 056 long waves k 1 h 1 0 237 and γ 0 785 intermediate waves k 1 h 1 1 017 the reflection coefficient takes values of r 0 15 and r 0 85 respectively indicating that for these parameter values the intermediate waves are 5 67 times more strongly reflected than the long waves as a validation in fig 5a and b we have included the analytical solution for linear long waves of medina rodríguez et al 2016 in the range corresponding to long waves γ 0 237 both solutions are in good agreement fig 6 a and b shows the reflection and transmission coefficients respectively as a function of the parameter γ for different values of the parameter μ 0 10 0 20 0 30 fig 6a shows that for small values of μ i e μ 0 10 0 20 the coefficient r first increases slightly until it reaches a maximum value and then decreases it can be seen that for small values of μ the phenomenon of zero reflection occurs which physically represents that for some discrete values of the parameter γ the structure is transparent the complementary transmission coefficients are shown in fig 6b from which it is evident that for μ 0 2 the transmission coefficient rapidly decrease for the case of short waves i e γ o 1 because the analysed problem is a conservative system table 4 presents a verification of the energy identity given in 62 for the results shown in fig 6a and b from this table we can see that the energy identity is approximately satisfied for all values of the parameters μ and γ in addition for both coefficients fig 6 includes a comparison of the present mathematical model against the analytical solution for linear long waves proposed by medina rodríguez et al medina rodríguez et al 2016 and both solutions are seen to behave properly from figs 5 and 6 it can be appreciated that the present mathematical model is superior to the analytical solution of medina rodríguez et al 2016 because of the elimination of the strong restriction to long water waves γ 0 237 now the analytical solution proposed in this work allows us to analyse the hydrodynamics of linear water waves for values of γ o 1 which physically implies that λ h 1 4 6 semi cycloidal breakwater for the submerged semi cycloidal breakwater shown in fig 7 a fig 7b and c shows snapshots of the free surface elevation δ 2 θ for various values of the kinematical parameter γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 and two values of the geometrical parameter μ 0 20 and μ 0 40 respectively the values of the parameter μ are taking according to the convergence analysis given in section 3 2 for a semi cycloidal breakwater μ 1 fig 7b illustrates that for values of γ 1 the wave amplitude is practically unperturbed however for a value of μ 0 40 and values of γ 1 the amplitude of the water waves is significantly affected see fig 7c the reflection r and transmission t coefficients are shown in fig 8 as functions of the parameter μ and for different values of the parameter γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 in this case the reflection coefficient increases slowly as μ increases in general if the kinematical parameter γ decreases in magnitude the strength of the reflection also increases which physically represents that the semi cycloidal breakwater is more reflective for long waves than for short waves the complementary transmission coefficients are shown at the top of the same figure for small values of μ the transmission coefficient t 1 implying total transmission of the wave energy by contrast as the parameter μ increases the transmission coefficient also increases fig 9 shows the behaviour of the reflection and transmission coefficients as functions of the parameter γ for various values of the parameter μ 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 from this figure it can be appreciated that as γ increases the reflection coefficient tends to decrease up to a value of γ o 0 8 subsequently the reflection coefficient begins to increase with some oscillatory behaviour as the parameter μ decreases in magnitude the zero reflection phenomenon occurs for some discrete values of γ which physically represents that for these values the structure is transparent 4 7 quarter cycloidal breakwater in this section we analyse the hydrodynamics induced by a quarter cycloidal breakwater as shown in fig 10 a the behaviour of the free surface elevation δ 2 θ of water waves propagating over a quarter cycloidal breakwater is shown in fig 10b and c to obtain these results we considered various values of the kinematical parameter γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 and two fixed values of the geometrical parameter μ 0 20 and μ 0 40 see fig 10b and c respectively the values of the parameter μ are taking according to the convergence analysis given in section 3 2 for a quarter cycloidal breakwater μ 1 the evolution of δ 2 along the structure is very similar to that obtained for a semi cycloidal breakwater however for the quarter cycloidal breakwater the height of the free surface elevation is lower than that for the semi cycloidal structure fig 11 shows the reflection and transmission coefficients for the same values of μ and γ the behaviours of these coefficients are also very similar to those for a semi cycloidal breakwater however the quarter cycloidal breakwater is less reflective than the semi cycloidal breakwater fig 12 depicts the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients generated by the interaction of water waves with a quarter cycloidal breakwater in fig 12a the reflection coefficient is shown as a functions of the parameter γ for various values of the parameter μ 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 this figure reveals that for small values of the parameter γ which corresponds to long waves and increasing the values of the parameter μ the reflection coefficient increase in magnitude on the other hand for values of γ 1 the reflection coefficient exhibits oscillatory behaviour for all values of μ it is also shown that the phenomenon of zero reflection coefficient and full transmission of the incident wave energy occurs i e the structure is transparent as noted if the parameter μ increase the occurrence of the zero reflection is more frequently for intermediate and short waves this phenomenon was first revealed by newman 1965 who studied the interaction of water waves with a submerged rectangular sill mound he obtained an explicit formula to calculate the values of the product k b where b is the length of the structure normal to the direction of the wave propagation for which the zero reflection occurs a similar work was conducted by mei et al 1997 who identified that the zero reflection has a periodic behaviour for some discrete values of the wave number to identify for which values of the parameter μ the structure is the most reflective the total reflection tr is calculated which is defined as the area under the reflection coefficient curve liu et al 2013b for the results presented in fig 12 the tr for each value of the parameter μ 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 are tr 1 86861 1 88938 1 9934 199182 respectively in general for increments of the parameter μ the structure is more reflective with the exception that for a value of μ 0 4 the tr is larger than the case of μ 0 5 moreover as the parameter γ increases the reflection coefficient also increases in magnitude the complementary transmission coefficients are shown in fig 12b from which we can see that for small values of μ the transmission coefficient t 1 in the same figure it should be noted that when γ 1 3 the transmission coefficient is t 1 4 8 summary of the simplifications of the mathematical model the present mathematical model is restricted by the following simplifications 1 the hypothesis of linear water waves is assumed a i h 1 1 2 because the thickness of the boundary layer generated on the solid surfaces is very small compared with the depth h 2 the viscous effects are not considered and therefore potential flow is used even when the previous restriction is maintained the solution presented in this work would only correspond to the external region dominated exclusively by the potential flow and effectively without the presence of the dissipative effects however in order to solve the viscous boundary layer it is essential to previously know the solution of the potential flow and that is precisely the spirit of the present work 3 the mathematical model is valid from long waves γ π 10 2 intermediate waves π 10 2 γ π and short waves γ π 4 for a cycloidal breakwater the approximate analytical solution converges for μ r h 1 0 395 and for a semicycloidal breakwater and a quarter cycloidal breakwater μ 1 5 conclusions in this work we have analysed the hydrodynamics induced by the interaction of water waves with a submerged breakwater whose cross section has a cycloidal geometry the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the free surface elevation of the water waves were obtained by analytically solving the modified mild slope equation which is valid for a wide range of waves from short waves to long waves because of the complexity of the variable coefficients of 20 the analytical solution for the free surface elevation of the water waves is expressed in terms of a taylor polynomial three kinds of cycloidal breakwaters were analysed namely cycloidal semi cycloidal and quarter cycloidal breakwaters to verify the correctness of the present results they were compared with the analytical solutions proposed by medina rodríguez et al 2016 and liu et al 2015b which are valid for the approximation of linear long water waves and the three solutions were found to be in good agreement in addition because the analysed problem is a conservative system the formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients were also verified by considering the energy identity expressed in 62 which was found to be satisfied to very good accuracy a comparison of the three breakwaters reveals that the cycloidal breakwater is more reflective than the other two the analytical solution obtained in this work is superior to medina rodríguez s solution because the former is applicable to a wider range of waves from short waves to long waves this implies that the present formula is valid for a wider range of engineering applications than those previously reported in the specialized literature the radius of the generating circle of the cycloidal geometry has a strong influence on the magnitude of the coefficient r because for values of μ o 0 35 the values of the reflection coefficient r increase significantly for example as seen from fig 5a if we select values of γ 0 785 and μ 0 35 then the reflection coefficient takes a value of r 0 85 the results show that for a cycloidal breakwater the zero reflection phenomenon occurs for small values of the parameter μ r h 1 and some discrete values of the parameter γ ω 2 g h 1 in general for these three breakwaters the reflection coefficient exhibits oscillatory behaviour and increases in magnitude as the kinematical parameter increases for γ o 1 acknowledgements this research was financially supported by proyecto apoyado por

22939,in this work formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients of one dimensional linear water waves propagating on a submerged structure with a cycloidal cross section are obtained in the specialized literature the previous coefficients have been obtained mainly for the limit of linear long water waves which is a strong restriction for their application to avoid this restriction we obtain an approximate analytical solution based on a taylor polynomial to the modified mild slope equation which models the interactions of a wide range of water waves from short waves to long waves the dimensionless governing equation is a function of a kinematical parameter and a geometrical parameter it is found that for a value of 0 35 of the geometrical parameter the reflection coefficient tends increase significantly the results show that as the magnitude of the kinematical parameter increases the reflection coefficient exhibits oscillatory behaviour and increases in magnitude in addition for some discrete values of this parameter the zero reflection phenomenon occurs to validate the present approximate analytical solution we present a comparison against two analytical solutions obtained with the aid of linear long wave theory in which it is found that three solutions behave properly keywords submerged breakwater zero reflection coastal engineering short waves 1 introduction the action of incident water waves along a coast can cause damage to human settlements and disruption to human activities consequently many researches have directed their attention towards the development of artificial protective structures also known as breakwaters these structures are mainly rectangular trapezoidal elliptical or circular in geometry and may be either emerged or submerged wiegel 1964 the interactions of water waves with breakwaters induce such hydrodynamic mechanisms as diffraction refraction reflection and shoaling phenomena that must properly considered for correct breakwater design when an incoming wave interacts with a breakwater a portion of the wave will be reflected while some of it will be transmitted dean and dalrymple 1991 this phenomenon is characterized by reflection and transmission coefficients in the past wave reflection has been studied extensively special mention should be made of the pioneering work developed by lamb 1932 who analysed the interactions of linear water waves with an infinite step providing formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients other important analytical solutions for the reflection of long waves from linear and parabolic shelf profiles can be found in the classic books of mei et al 1997 and dingemans 2005 in a similar direction a relevant contribution was also made by chang and liou 2007 who used the method of matched asymptotic expansions to analyse the reflection and transmission of long waves on a trapezoidal breakwater and a series of trapezoidal breakwaters later liu and luo 2013 obtained an analytical solution for the reflection of linear long waves from two rectangular breakwaters using the linear long wave approximation bautista et al 2015 derived asymptotic formulas for the reflection transmission coefficients of linear long water waves propagating in a harbour composed of a slender tapered region connected to uniform inlet and outlet regions liu et al 2015a reported an analytical solution for the problem of long wave reflection from a series of artificial bars with a parabolic configuration in terms of the associated legendre functions lin and liu 2005 obtained an analytical solution for linear long wave reflection from an obstacle of a general trapezoidal shape a similar investigation was conducted by zeng et al 2017 who derived a closed form analytical solution for the reflection of linear long waves propagating over a series of submerged rectangular breakwaters located on a sloping seabed in these previous works wave reflection has been fundamentally analysed for geometries with linear transitions regarding curvilinear geometries a breakwater with a semicircular cross section is the most commonly studied in this context yuan and tao 2003 numerically analysed the hydrodynamics induced by the interactions of water waves with a submerged semicircular breakwater and an alternately submerged and emerged semicircular breakwater using linear wave theory and multipole expansion liu and li 2012 studied the interaction of water waves with submerged and perforated semicircular breakwaters recently medina rodríguez et al 2016 obtained formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients of linear long water waves propagating over a cycloidal breakwater previous works have appropriately reevaluated the physical parameters of the interactions between waves and breakwaters and have analysed the effects of various physical parameters on wave reflection however one of the most relevant shortcomings of the previous analytical solutions is that the majority of them have been obtained exclusively for the limit of linear long water waves which is a strong restriction for their engineering application an alternative approach is to use the elliptical mild slope equation mse which was derived by berkhoff 1972 as a governing equation berkhoff 1972 proved that for the assumption that the bottom slope is mild which means that it is less than 1 3 they demonstrated that integrating along depth the three dimensional laplace equation is reduced into the two dimensional mse this equation allows one to analyse the propagation of linear water waves from short waves to long waves the mse considers the effects of diffraction refraction reflection and shoaling for linear surface water waves several extensions of the mse have been developed for either steeper slopes with very large characteristic length scales or shorter irregularities such as sand bars as noted by mei et al 1997 however it has been observed by a number of authors that the mse can fail to produce adequate approximations for certain types of topographies such as ripples chamberlain and porter 1995 to improve the application of the mse relevant extensions of the mse can be found in the specialized literature including kirby 1986 chamberlain and porter 1995 porter and staziger 1995 miles and chamberlain 1998 and others in particular the modified mild slope equation mmse in which the bottom curvature term and the slope squared term are considered proposed by chamberlain and porter 1995 has been used to analyse the interactions of water waves with various structures we are aware that the mmse can be solved using different numerical techniques however in this work we have selected an approximate analytical solution to studied the interaction between linear water waves and a submerged structure in the specialized literature few analytical solutions to the mse and the mmse are available and those few solutions are focused on the effects of islands or trenches on the hydrodynamics of water waves the relevance of the analytical solutions is that allows to get inside into the physical problem providing information related with the competition between the different physical mechanism to obtain exact analytical solutions of the mmse is a very difficult task the main difficult come from the trascendental functions included in the variable coefficients of the governing equations in addition for the particular case of a cycloidal breakwater its cross section is defined by parametric equations where the parameter is implicit condition that adds an extra difficulty in this context based on the mmse xie and liu 2012 obtained formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients for water waves propagating over trenches of various shapes liu et al 2004 developed an analytical technique based on the use of series expansions to solve the mse for an axisymmetric topography this technique was applied to study the combined refraction and diffraction of plane monochromatic waves by a circular cylindrical island sitting on a paraboloidal shoal a similar study was conducted by cheng et al 2012 who obtained an approximate analytical solution to the mse to analyse the wave scattering produced by a circular cylindrical island sitting on an axisymmetrical shoal jung et al 2008 derived two types of analytical solutions for waves propagating over an asymmetric trench one is a long wave solution and the other is a mild slope solution which is applicable to deeper water hsiao et al 2010 derived an analytical solution to the mmse for a conical island by adapting hunt s direct solution for linear dispersion to be applicable to waves at intermediate water depths liu and xie 2013 developed an analytical technique for solving the mmse for linear wave scattering by homma islands this solution was obtained in terms of fourier cosine series and taylor series liu et al 2012 proposed an approximate analytical solution to the mmse in the form of a taylor series they reported formulas for the reflection coefficients over the entire range from long waves to short waves for four one dimensional piecewise smooth topographies liu et al 2013a derived an analytical solution to the mmse for wave reflection from a submerged rectangular breakwater with two scour trenches despite these previous investigations no analytical results appropriate for the reflection and transmission coefficients are available for the interaction between short water waves of small amplitude and a submerged cycloidal breakwater except for the simplest case of the problem corresponding to linear parabolic or semi circular breakwaters transitions adjoining a constant depth segment the major of these studies are carried out by considering the approximation of linear long water waves in this work we use the mmse to analyse the hydrodynamics induced by the interaction of linear water waves with a submerged cycloidal structure this structure was first proposed by medina rodríguez et al 2016 who consider that the cross section of some submerged breakwaters i e geotube breakwaters can obey a cycloidal geometry medina rodríguez s work is very restrictive because the solution is obtained using the approximation of linear long water waves based on the above considerations the main purpose of the present study is to eliminate this limitation by obtaining an approximate analytical solution to the mmse the formula for the free surface elevation and the reflection and transmission coefficients derived in the present work have a larger range of engineering applications than those proposed by medina rodríguez et al 2016 because these formulas allow us to analyse the interactions of a wide range of water waves from short waves to long waves with a cycloidal structure because the approximate analytical solution is obtained for a general cycloidal breakwater three geometric configurations are analysed as follows case 1 a cycloidal breakwater case 2 a semi cycloidal breakwater and case 3 a quarter cycloidal breakwater we have selected a cycloidal structure because these structures have several advantages as follows 1 they enable the generation of higher reflection coefficient values than those obtained using parabolic or semicircular breakwaters 2 they can be easily implemented in intermediate water depths and in shallow flows 3 they have little impact on the environment because they allow the exchange of water between the upstream and downstream regions and therefore contribute to improving the water quality in their shadow regions and 4 with small increments in the height of a cycloidal breakwater its reflective behaviour improves significantly this work is organized in the following manner in section 1 the interaction of water waves with a cycloidal structure is described and the governing equation is presented in terms of physical variables the dimensionless version of the governing equation and the methodology for obtaining its analytical solution are explained in section 2 section 3 presents the results and discusses the effects of the kinematical and geometrical parameters on the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the free surface elevation of the water waves for three structure configurations finally the principal conclusions of this study are summarized in section 4 2 formulation of the problem let us consider a one dimensional linear water wave with an incident amplitude a i a wavelength λ 1 and an angular frequency ω 2 π t where t is the wave period propagating from left to right over a submerged structure whose cross section exhibits a cycloidal transition see fig 1 the control volume is formed of three regions r 1 r 2 and r 3 in the selected cartesian coordinate system the positive direction of the x axis is to the right and the x axis has its origin at the intersection of regions r 1 and r 2 the z axis points outwards in the normal direction to the mean sea water level the water depths in regions r 1 and r 3 are constants and the depth transition in region r 2 follows a cycloidal profile the lengths of regions r 1 and r 3 correspond to the intervals x 0 and l x the interval corresponding to the transition region r 2 is 0 x θ l the x axis in region r 2 is a function of the parameter θ which is the rotation angle of a circle of radius r this angle takes values in the interval π 2 θ θ l where θ l is the maximum value of θ and corresponds to x l here it is assumed that the length l y of the breakwater normal to the x z plane satisfies l y l and l y λ 1 the wave field in region r 1 is formed by the sum of an incident wave of amplitude a i and a reflected wave of amplitude a r because there are no obstacles in region r 3 only a transmitted wave of amplitude a t is present in this region the water depths in the three previously defined regions are given by the following functions medina rodríguez et al 2016 1 h h 1 h 2 θ h 1 r cos θ h 3 h 1 r cos θ l for for for x 0 0 x x l θ l π 2 θ θ l the parametric equation for the horizontal distribution in region r 2 is given by 2 x θ r θ sin θ 1 π 2 from the above equation the horizontal projection of the cycloidal breakwater can be calculated as follows 3 l r θ l sin θ l 1 π 2 2 1 governing equation here we consider plane harmonic linear water waves that satisfy the ratio a i h 1 1 and are normally incident on the breakwater because the boundary layer generated by the motion of the fluid on the impermeable bottom is very small compared with the water depth viscous effects are neglected therefore a potential flow is assumed with the aim of obtaining an approximate analytical solution with a greater range of valid engineering applications in the present work the governing equation used to model the free surface elevation is the well known one dimensional modified mild slope equation mmse which includes a bottom curvature term and a slope square term chamberlain and porter 1995 the equation that models the elevation of the free surface elevation in region r 2 is expressed in the following manner 4 c x c g x d 2 η x d x 2 d c x c g x d x d η x d x k 2 2 x c x c g x u 1 d 2 h x d x 2 u 2 d h x d x 2 η x 0 where η x is the free surface elevation k 2 x is the wave number in region r 2 which varies with the depth of the control volume and g is the gravitational acceleration the wave celerity c x can be calculated using the dispersion equation 5 c x g k x tanh k 2 x h x and the group celerity c g x is calculated as follows 6 c g x c x 2 1 2 k 2 x h x sinh 2 k 2 x h x for brevity hereafter η η x h h x k 2 k 2 x c c x and c g c g x in eq 4 the functions u 1 and u 2 are defined by the following equations 7 u 1 g 1 tanh 2 k 2 h 4 2 k 2 h sinh 2 k 2 h sinh 2 k 2 h 2 k 2 h cosh 2 k 2 h and 8 u 2 g k 2 1 tanh 2 k 2 h 12 2 k 2 h sinh 2 k 2 h 3 16 k 2 h 4 32 k 2 h 3 sinh 2 k 2 h 9 sinh 2 k 2 h

x η 0 where the variable coefficient b x in eq 9 is given by 10 b x k 2 2 u 1 c c g h u 2 c c g h 2 here h and h denote the first and second derivatives respectively of the water depth by substituting the dispersive equation 5 into the functions 7 and 8 the latter can be rewritten as follows 11 u 1 g 2 k 2 2 ω 4 g ω 2 g 2 k 2 2 h ω 4 h 4 g k 2 2 g 2 k 2 2 h ω 4 h g ω 2 and 12 u 2 g 2 k 2 2 ω 4 4 96

attempt to obtain an approximate analytical solution to eq 9 1 the complexity of the variable coefficients of eq 9 does not allow us to apply standard methods to obtain an analytical solution and 2 the wavenumber k 2 must be obtained from eq 5 via an iterative procedure the cases for which the wave number can be obtained directly for a given wave frequency ω is the long wave approximation corresponding to the limit of k 2 h π 10 because the wave celerity reduces to c ω k 2 g h in this case and for the limit of short waves k 2 h π in addition for the limit of k 2 h 1 we have that c c g to obtain an approximate analytical solution to eq 9 appropriate boundary conditions are required considering continuity of pressure at the intersections x 0 and x l the following boundary conditions are suggested 14 η 1 x 0 η x 0 and η x l η 3 x l where η 1 x and η 3 x are the free surface elevations in regions r 1 and r 3 respectively for these regions where the water depth h is constant eq 4 reduces to 15 d 2 η 1 3 d x 2 k 1 3 2 η 1 3 0 the analytical solutions to eq 15 are well known they are given by 16 η 1 x a i e i k 1 x a r e i k 1 x and 17 η 3 x a t e i k 3 x where the wave numbers in regions r 1 and r 3 are defined as k 1 2 π λ 1 and k 3 2 π λ 3 respectively the wavelength in region r 3 is λ 3 and i 1 as seen in eq 16 and eq 17 there are two additional unknown complex constants a r and a t therefore two additional boundary conditions are required these can be obtained from the principle of mass conservation and are expressed as follows 18 d η 1 d x x 0 d η d x x 0 and d η d x x l d η 3 d x x l 3 dimensionless governing equation to reduce the number of combinations of the physical variables involved in eq 9 the governing equation is presented in its dimensionless version to this end pertinent characteristic scales are introduced for regions r 1 and r 3 the characteristic horizontal scales are the wavelengths in these regions λ 1 and λ 3 respectively and they are related to the wave numbers k 1 2 π λ 1 and k 3 2 π λ 3 for region r 2 the characteristic horizontal scale is the length of the breakwater l the characteristic scale for the free surface elevation is the incident wave amplitude a i thus the following dimensionless variables are proposed 19 χ 1 3 k 1 3 x χ 2 x l δ 1 χ 1 η 1 x a i δ 2 χ 2 η x a i δ 3 χ 3 η 3 x a i h h 2 x θ h 1 and κ k 2 x ω 2 g by substituting the dimensionless variables defined in eq 19 into eq 9 the following equation is obtained 20 d 2 δ 2 d χ 2 2 d ln c c g d χ 2 d δ 2 d χ 2 b δ 2 0 where 21 c c g 1 γ 2 h h κ 2 2 κ 2 22 b γ

defined in eq 19 into the dispersive equation eq 5 the dimensionless wavenumber κ can be obtained via an iterative procedure using the following equation 27 κ tanh κ γ h 1 the roots of eq 27 which provides the values of the variable κ are obtained for fixed values of the parameters μ and γ and for each value of the angle θ here we have implemented the iterative method of newton raphson from eq 27 can be calculated the wave number k 1 and k 3 which corresponds to the regions r 1 and r 3 respectively when θ π 2 implies h 1 or h 2 π 2 h 1 consequently k 2 π 2 k 1 in a similar manner when θ θ l we have that h 2 θ l h 3 and k 2 θ l k 3 for the particular case of h 1 h 3 we have that k 1 k 3 by combining eq 1 and eq 2 with eq 20 the following equation expressed in terms of the angle θ is obtained 28 1 cos θ d 2 δ 2 d θ 2 1 cos θ d ln c c g d θ sin θ d δ 2 d θ b ˆ θ δ 2 0 where 29 b ˆ θ γ μ 2 1 cos θ 3 κ 2 b 1 1 cos θ μ 2 f 2 b 2 sin 2 θ 1 cos θ μ 2 6 f 4 in the above equation the dimensionless parameters γ and μ are defined as 30 γ ω 2 g h 1 and μ r h 1 the definition of long intermediate and short waves can be expressed in terms of the parameter γ from eq 27 the following limits are obtained dean and dalrymple 1991 1 long water waves for the limit of k 1 h 1 π 10 we have that tanh k 1 h 1 k 1 h 1 and therefore eq 27 is reduced to 31 γ k 1 h 1 2 for k 1 h 1 π 10 32 or γ π 10 2 2 intermediate water waves the intermediate water waves are defined in the interval π 10 k 1 h 1 π taking into account the previous comment and from the dispersion equation we have 33 γ k 1 h 1 tanh k 1 h 1 for π 10 k 1 h 1 π 34 or π 10 2 γ π 3 short water waves waves are termed as short waves for values of k 1 h 1 π which implies that tanh k 1 h 1 1 and therefore we have that 35 γ k 1 h 1 for k 1 h 1 π we must point out that for a small height of the structure compared with the characteristic water depth that is μ r h 1 1 implies that h 1 h 2 consequently the wave number of region r 1 and the wave number of region r 2 are k 1 k 2 in a similar manner when h 1 h 3 the wave numbers k 1 k 3 by varying the order of magnitude of the parameter γ we can model wave propagation for a larger range of engineering applications than is possible for the work of medina rodríguez et al 2016 because with the present mathematical model it is possible to analyse the propagation of water waves under conditions ranging from deep water to shallow flows the geometrical parameter μ takes values in the interval 0 μ 1 the dimensionless boundary conditions for pressure continuity at θ π 2 and θ θ l can be expressed as follows 36 δ 1 χ 1 0 δ 2 θ π 2 and δ 2 θ θ l δ 3 χ 3 k 3 l taking into account the dimensionless variables 19 in eq 18 and applying the chain rule we can relates the free surface elevation of region r 1 expressed in cartesian coordinates with the free surface elevation of region r 2 that is written as a function of the angle θ i e for θ π 2 from eq 2 we obtain that x 0 therefore the dimensionless boundary conditions given in eq 18 for mass conservation at θ π 2 and θ θ l can be expressed as follows 37 d δ 1 d χ 1 χ 1 0 1 κ γ μ 1 cos θ d δ 2 d θ θ π 2 and 38 1 κ γ μ 1 cos θ d δ 2 d θ θ θ l d δ 3 d χ 3 χ 3 k 3 l the dimensionless surface elevations δ 1 and δ 3 can be straightforwardly obtained by substituting eq 19 into eq 16 and eq 17 the resulting equations are 39 δ 1 χ 1 e i χ 1 r e i χ 1 and δ 3 χ 3 t e i χ 3 where r a r a i and t a t a i are the unknown complex reflection and transmission coefficients respectively 3 1 approximate analytical solution the dimensionless governing equation given in eq 28 is a homogeneous second order differential equation with variable coefficients because of the complexity of the variable coefficients of eq 28 an exact analytical solution is not possible however an approximate analytical solution can be deduced in this section the technique for obtaining an approximate analytical solution to eq 28 is presented here we adopt the methodology proposed by sezer 1996 who presented a matrix method for approximately solving a second order linear differential equation with specified associated conditions expressed in terms of taylor polynomials about any point only the fundamental steps are presented for the specific details see the work of sezer 1996 the presented analytical method is capable of quickly providing insight into how the solution depends on the kinematical parameter γ ω 2 g h 1 and the geometrical parameter μ r h 1 the governing equation given in eq 28 can be rewritten in the following manner 40 p θ d 2 δ 2 θ d θ 2 q θ d δ 2 θ d θ r θ δ 2 θ 0 where the variable coefficients that appear in eq 40 are defined as follows p θ 1 cos θ q θ 1 cos θ d ln c c g d θ sin θ and r θ b ˆ θ to solve eq 40 the notation used by medina rodríguez et al 2016 is introduced p i 0 c q i 0 c and r i 0 c are the values of the i 0 th derivatives of the known functions p θ q θ and r θ where c is any value on the interval π 2 c θ l the particular case of i 0 0 represents the function evaluated at θ c the derivatives of the variable coefficients are obtained using recursive formulas which are explained in detail below the approximate analytical solution to eq 28 or eq 40 is proposed in the form of a taylor polynomial as follows 41 δ 2 θ n 0 n 1 n y n c θ c n for n 0 1 n here the degree of the polynomial is given by n and the y n c are unknown coefficients that must be determined using the following relationship 42 y w 1 f ˆ where y y 0 c y 1 c y n c t is a vector that contains the unknown coefficients y n and the superscript 1 indicates the inverse of the matrix w the matrix w and the vector f ˆ are defined as 43 w w 00 w 01 w 02 0 0 w 10 w 11 w 12 w 13 0 w n 2 0 w n 2 1 w n 2 2 w n 2

therefore the unknown coefficients y n c can be calculated straightforwardly using the following formula 46 y 0 c y 1 c y 2 c y n c f 0 n 1 1 r f 0 n t e i k 3 l f 1 n 1 1 r f 1 n t e i k 3 l f 2 n 1 1 r f 2 n t e i k 3 l f n n 1 1 r f n n t e i k 3 l where the f m n are the elements of the inverse matrix w 1 3 1 1 recursive formulas the evaluation of eq 44 requires the i 0 th derivatives of p i 0 c q i 0 c and r i 0 c obtaining these derivatives is complicated due to the complex structures of the functions p q and r to solve this problem we adopt the methodology proposed by yang 2011 and liu et al 2012 who derived a series of recursive formulas for obtaining these derivatives some additional recursive formulas are proposed in the present work we note that the function p θ 1 cos θ is simple and that its derivatives can be straightforwardly calculated for brevity hereafter p p θ q q θ and r r θ the m th derivative of the coefficient q θ can be obtained using the following recursive formula 47 q m i 0 m m i p i ln c c g m 1 i sin θ m m 1 2 in eq 47 the m 1 i th derivative of ln c c g is required this derivative is calculated using the following formula 48 ln c c g m 1 c c g c c g

and b 2 are defined in eqs a 4 a 5 given in appendix a using the above technique the formula for the dimensionless free surface elevation δ 2 θ can be expressed in the following manner 57 δ 2 θ n 0 n f n n 1 θ c n n 1 r f n n θ c n n t e i k 3 l by combining eq 57 with the boundary conditions 37 and 38 the formulas for the reflection r and transmission t coefficients can be obtained they are

section three geometries are analysed namely a cycloidal breakwater a semi cycloidal breakwater and a quarter cycloidal breakwater for each structure in eqs 57 61 the following restrictions must be considered 1 for the cycloidal breakwater c π a π 2 and b π 2 2 for the semi cycloidal breakwater c 3 π 4 a π 4 and b π 4 3 for the quarter cycloidal breakwater c 5 π 8 a π 8 and b π 8 because the analysed problem is a conservative system the following energy identity must also be satisfied 62 r 2 c g h 3 c g h 1 t 2 1 where the ratio of the celerities group c g h 3 c g h 1 in terms of the present dimensionless variables is defined as 63 c g h 3 c g h 1 1 κ 3 tanh γ κ 3 1 μ cos θ l 1 κ 1 tanh γ κ 1 1 2 γ κ 3 1 μ cos θ l sinh 2 γ κ 3 1 μ cos θ l 1 2 γ κ 1 sinh 2 γ κ 1 and the dimensionless wave numbers κ 3 κ θ l and κ 1 κ π 2 are calculated with eq 27 in particular when θ l 3 π 2 which corresponds to a cycloidal breakwater the ratio c g h 3 c g h 1 1 for the case of long water waves defined by the limit of γ π 10 eq 63 is simplified to 64 c g h 3 c g h 1 1 μ cos θ l h 3 h 1 1 2 and therefore the energy identity 62 can be written in the following manner 65 r 2 1 μ cos θ l 1 2 t 2 1 4 results in this section analytical results are presented to illustrate the effects of different wave characteristics and structural parameters on the reflected and transmitted waves as well as the influence of a cycloidal breakwater on the free surface elevation the physical parameters used to obtain the dimensionless parameters are those presented in table 1 for the application of the mmse the slope parameter must satisfy s h x λ 1 h o 1 in terms of the present variables the slope parameter is rewritten as s 2 π sin θ 1 cos θ 1 1 μ cos θ γ considering a value of θ 3 π 2 which corresponds to the maximum slope of the breakwater and a value of γ 0 785 the parameter s takes a value of s 8 and therefore the assumption of s o 1 is satisfied 4 1 accuracy of the approximate analytical solution because the approximate analytical solution as given in eq 57 is obtained as a taylor polynomial the series must be truncated to a desired accuracy we adopt the criterion that the following equation must be approximately satisfied 66 d θ i 10 k ˆ where 67 d θ i p θ i d 2 δ 2 θ i d θ i 2 q θ i d δ 2 θ i d θ i r θ i δ 2 θ 0 k ˆ is a prescribed integer number and the variable θ i can take any value in the interval π 2 θ i θ l fig 2 shows a snapshot of the dimensionless free surface elevation δ 2 θ for taylor polynomials of degree n 9 13 17 21 and fixed parameter values of μ 0 20 and γ 0 471 as seen the results for n 17 and 21 are almost identical the results shown in fig 2 must approximately satisfy eq 66 table 2 shows the accuracy of the approximate analytical solution for different values of θ i 3 π 4 7 π 8 9 π 8 23 π 16 with the criterion that d θ i 10 3 the required accuracy is satisfied for values of n 13 based on these findings we have selected a value of n 17 for the results presented in the following sections 4 2 convergence analysis the second order differential equation 28 has complex singularities for complex roots of 1 cos θ at θ 2 n π for n 0 1 2 the second complex singularities of eq 28 are given when the term 2 k h sinh 2 k h 0 which appears in eq 7 the dimensionless version of this last relationship is given by 68 2 γ κ h sinh 2 γ κ h 0 recall that h 1 μ cos θ therefore eq 68 can be expressed in the following manner 69 2 γ κ 1 μ cos θ sinh 2 γ κ 1 μ cos θ 0 equation 69 is satisfied when 1 μ cos θ 0 therefore the second complex singularities of eq 28 are given by the complex roots of equation cos θ 1 μ 0 which are given by 70 θ 2 n 1 π i ln 1 1 μ 2 μ for n 0 1 2 the approximate analytical solution 57 for a cycloidal breakwater converges if 71 π 2 ln 1 1 μ 2 μ or in other words μ 1 cosh π 2 or μ 0 398 for the semi cycloidal breakwater the series solution 57 converges for 72 π 4 π 4 2 ln 1 1 μ 2 μ 2 or μ 1 for the quarter cycloidal breakwater the series solution 57 converges for 73 π 8 3 π 8 2 ln 1 1 μ 2 μ 2 or μ 1 the previous analysis clarifies that the approximate analytical solution 57 converges and therefore the number of terms of the series will be a function of the desired precision 4 3 comparison of the present mathematical model with the analytical solution of medina rodríguez et al 2016 we note that for this type of cycloidal breakwater neither experimental data nor a full numerical solution for the wave amplification have been previously reported however to verify the correctness of the proposed approximate analytical solution for the dimensionless free surface elevation δ 2 θ we present a comparison with the analytical solution of medina rodríguez et al 2016 medina rodríguez s solution was obtained for the limit of linear long water waves in which case the ursell number must be u r 1 for this comparison the considered water depths are h 1 h 3 0 9 m and the radius of the cycloidal breakwater takes the following values r 0 09 0 18 0 27 m the wavenumber in region r 1 is k 1 0 264 m 1 with the above values the dimensionless parameters take values of γ 0 237 and μ 0 10 0 20 0 30 using these values of γ and μ fig 3 shows a comparison of the present approximate analytical solution against medina rodríguez s solution from which it can be seen that both solutions are in good agreement 4 4 comparison of the approximate analytical solution with the liu et al liu et al 2015b theory the present analytical solution is compared with the analytical solution of liu et al 2015b who obtained an analytical solution for the problem of the long wave reflection by a series of artificial bars with parabolic configuration in terms of associated legendre functions for some values of the dimensionless parameter μ the parabolic geometry analysed by liu et al 2015b is similar with the cycloidal transition but they are not identical following liu et al 2015b the geometrical distribution of the parabolic bar depth in terms of the parameter μ is given by 74 h p χ 2 1 μ μ 2 χ 2 1 2 where h p χ 2 h p x h 1 the free surface elevation δ p χ 2 in the interval 0 χ 2 0 5 is written in the following manner 75 δ p χ 2 a 1 e 0 χ 2 1 4 p 1 2 ϕ e 1 χ 2 a 2 e 0 χ 2 1 4 q 1 2 ϕ e 1 χ 2 and for 0 5 χ 2 1 the free surface elevation is given by 76 δ p χ 2 a 3 h 0 χ 2 1 4 p 1 2 ϕ h 1 χ 2 a 4 h 0 χ 2 1 4 q 1 2 ϕ h 2 χ 2 where 77 e 0 χ 2 1 1 μ 1 μ 1 2 χ 2 2 e 1 χ 2 1 2 χ 2 1 μ μ 1 2 χ 2 2 78 h 0 χ 2 1 1 μ 1 μ 2 χ 2 1 2 h 1 χ 2 2 χ 2 1 1 μ μ 1 2 χ 2 2 and 79 h 2 χ 2 2 χ 2 1 1 μ μ 2 χ 2 1 2 the associated legendre functions of the first and second kinds are given by p 1 2 ϕ and q 1 2 ϕ respectively and ϕ 1 γ μ 2 π 2 2 the constants a 1 a 4 are determined by using the patching boundary conditions of the mass conservation and pressures at χ 2 0 0 5 1 considering the same values of the parameters μ and γ used in section 3 3 in fig 3 is shown the comparison of the present approximate analytical solution with the analytical solution proposed by liu et al 2015b it should be noted that both solutions are almost equal considering the results presented in fig 3c and different values of the angle θ π 2 3 π 4 π 5 π 4 3 π 2 in table 3 are presented the values of the free surface elevation for each position as noted the difference between the three solutions is very small 4 5 wave reflection from a cycloidal breakwater fig 4 shows the dimensionless free surface elevation δ 2 θ induced by the interaction of water waves with a cycloidal breakwater whose shape corresponds to the interval π 2 θ 3 π 2 when h 1 h 3 see fig 4a for the results shown here the parameter values are μ 0 10 0 30 see fig 4b and c respectively and γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 for μ 0 10 the free surface elevation is practically unperturbed for γ 0 785 the maximum elevation at θ π 2 is only 6 greater than the incident wave amplitude however with a small increment in the parameter μ i e to μ 0 30 and the same values of γ and θ the free surface elevation is 1 13 times greater for a value of γ 0 785 than the incident wave amplitude in general with an increase in the parameter γ the free surface elevation increases upstream of the breakwater whereas downstream of the structure it decreases significantly for the submerged cycloidal breakwater shown in figs 4a and 5 presents the reflection and transmission coefficients r and t respectively the results are obtained as a function of the parameter μ and for different values of the parameter γ 0 157 0 237 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 we can appreciate that for small increments of the parameter μ the reflection coefficient increases see fig 5a in addition the results indicate that with increasing magnitude of the parameter γ and for values of μ 0 3 the structure is highly reflective this is a very important result because it is not necessary for the structure to have a large radius to be able to reflect the wave energy significantly from the transmission coefficients t plotted in fig 5b we can see that for values of μ 0 1 the transmission coefficient t 1 which physically implies that the wave energy is completely transmitted for larger values of μ o 0 3 the transmission coefficient rapidly decreases in general the structure generates larger reflection coefficients for short waves than for long waves as an example consider μ 0 35 and two values of γ γ 0 056 long waves k 1 h 1 0 237 and γ 0 785 intermediate waves k 1 h 1 1 017 the reflection coefficient takes values of r 0 15 and r 0 85 respectively indicating that for these parameter values the intermediate waves are 5 67 times more strongly reflected than the long waves as a validation in fig 5a and b we have included the analytical solution for linear long waves of medina rodríguez et al 2016 in the range corresponding to long waves γ 0 237 both solutions are in good agreement fig 6 a and b shows the reflection and transmission coefficients respectively as a function of the parameter γ for different values of the parameter μ 0 10 0 20 0 30 fig 6a shows that for small values of μ i e μ 0 10 0 20 the coefficient r first increases slightly until it reaches a maximum value and then decreases it can be seen that for small values of μ the phenomenon of zero reflection occurs which physically represents that for some discrete values of the parameter γ the structure is transparent the complementary transmission coefficients are shown in fig 6b from which it is evident that for μ 0 2 the transmission coefficient rapidly decrease for the case of short waves i e γ o 1 because the analysed problem is a conservative system table 4 presents a verification of the energy identity given in 62 for the results shown in fig 6a and b from this table we can see that the energy identity is approximately satisfied for all values of the parameters μ and γ in addition for both coefficients fig 6 includes a comparison of the present mathematical model against the analytical solution for linear long waves proposed by medina rodríguez et al medina rodríguez et al 2016 and both solutions are seen to behave properly from figs 5 and 6 it can be appreciated that the present mathematical model is superior to the analytical solution of medina rodríguez et al 2016 because of the elimination of the strong restriction to long water waves γ 0 237 now the analytical solution proposed in this work allows us to analyse the hydrodynamics of linear water waves for values of γ o 1 which physically implies that λ h 1 4 6 semi cycloidal breakwater for the submerged semi cycloidal breakwater shown in fig 7 a fig 7b and c shows snapshots of the free surface elevation δ 2 θ for various values of the kinematical parameter γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 and two values of the geometrical parameter μ 0 20 and μ 0 40 respectively the values of the parameter μ are taking according to the convergence analysis given in section 3 2 for a semi cycloidal breakwater μ 1 fig 7b illustrates that for values of γ 1 the wave amplitude is practically unperturbed however for a value of μ 0 40 and values of γ 1 the amplitude of the water waves is significantly affected see fig 7c the reflection r and transmission t coefficients are shown in fig 8 as functions of the parameter μ and for different values of the parameter γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 in this case the reflection coefficient increases slowly as μ increases in general if the kinematical parameter γ decreases in magnitude the strength of the reflection also increases which physically represents that the semi cycloidal breakwater is more reflective for long waves than for short waves the complementary transmission coefficients are shown at the top of the same figure for small values of μ the transmission coefficient t 1 implying total transmission of the wave energy by contrast as the parameter μ increases the transmission coefficient also increases fig 9 shows the behaviour of the reflection and transmission coefficients as functions of the parameter γ for various values of the parameter μ 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 from this figure it can be appreciated that as γ increases the reflection coefficient tends to decrease up to a value of γ o 0 8 subsequently the reflection coefficient begins to increase with some oscillatory behaviour as the parameter μ decreases in magnitude the zero reflection phenomenon occurs for some discrete values of γ which physically represents that for these values the structure is transparent 4 7 quarter cycloidal breakwater in this section we analyse the hydrodynamics induced by a quarter cycloidal breakwater as shown in fig 10 a the behaviour of the free surface elevation δ 2 θ of water waves propagating over a quarter cycloidal breakwater is shown in fig 10b and c to obtain these results we considered various values of the kinematical parameter γ 0 157 0 314 0 471 0 628 0 785 and two fixed values of the geometrical parameter μ 0 20 and μ 0 40 see fig 10b and c respectively the values of the parameter μ are taking according to the convergence analysis given in section 3 2 for a quarter cycloidal breakwater μ 1 the evolution of δ 2 along the structure is very similar to that obtained for a semi cycloidal breakwater however for the quarter cycloidal breakwater the height of the free surface elevation is lower than that for the semi cycloidal structure fig 11 shows the reflection and transmission coefficients for the same values of μ and γ the behaviours of these coefficients are also very similar to those for a semi cycloidal breakwater however the quarter cycloidal breakwater is less reflective than the semi cycloidal breakwater fig 12 depicts the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients generated by the interaction of water waves with a quarter cycloidal breakwater in fig 12a the reflection coefficient is shown as a functions of the parameter γ for various values of the parameter μ 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 this figure reveals that for small values of the parameter γ which corresponds to long waves and increasing the values of the parameter μ the reflection coefficient increase in magnitude on the other hand for values of γ 1 the reflection coefficient exhibits oscillatory behaviour for all values of μ it is also shown that the phenomenon of zero reflection coefficient and full transmission of the incident wave energy occurs i e the structure is transparent as noted if the parameter μ increase the occurrence of the zero reflection is more frequently for intermediate and short waves this phenomenon was first revealed by newman 1965 who studied the interaction of water waves with a submerged rectangular sill mound he obtained an explicit formula to calculate the values of the product k b where b is the length of the structure normal to the direction of the wave propagation for which the zero reflection occurs a similar work was conducted by mei et al 1997 who identified that the zero reflection has a periodic behaviour for some discrete values of the wave number to identify for which values of the parameter μ the structure is the most reflective the total reflection tr is calculated which is defined as the area under the reflection coefficient curve liu et al 2013b for the results presented in fig 12 the tr for each value of the parameter μ 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 are tr 1 86861 1 88938 1 9934 199182 respectively in general for increments of the parameter μ the structure is more reflective with the exception that for a value of μ 0 4 the tr is larger than the case of μ 0 5 moreover as the parameter γ increases the reflection coefficient also increases in magnitude the complementary transmission coefficients are shown in fig 12b from which we can see that for small values of μ the transmission coefficient t 1 in the same figure it should be noted that when γ 1 3 the transmission coefficient is t 1 4 8 summary of the simplifications of the mathematical model the present mathematical model is restricted by the following simplifications 1 the hypothesis of linear water waves is assumed a i h 1 1 2 because the thickness of the boundary layer generated on the solid surfaces is very small compared with the depth h 2 the viscous effects are not considered and therefore potential flow is used even when the previous restriction is maintained the solution presented in this work would only correspond to the external region dominated exclusively by the potential flow and effectively without the presence of the dissipative effects however in order to solve the viscous boundary layer it is essential to previously know the solution of the potential flow and that is precisely the spirit of the present work 3 the mathematical model is valid from long waves γ π 10 2 intermediate waves π 10 2 γ π and short waves γ π 4 for a cycloidal breakwater the approximate analytical solution converges for μ r h 1 0 395 and for a semicycloidal breakwater and a quarter cycloidal breakwater μ 1 5 conclusions in this work we have analysed the hydrodynamics induced by the interaction of water waves with a submerged breakwater whose cross section has a cycloidal geometry the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the free surface elevation of the water waves were obtained by analytically solving the modified mild slope equation which is valid for a wide range of waves from short waves to long waves because of the complexity of the variable coefficients of 20 the analytical solution for the free surface elevation of the water waves is expressed in terms of a taylor polynomial three kinds of cycloidal breakwaters were analysed namely cycloidal semi cycloidal and quarter cycloidal breakwaters to verify the correctness of the present results they were compared with the analytical solutions proposed by medina rodríguez et al 2016 and liu et al 2015b which are valid for the approximation of linear long water waves and the three solutions were found to be in good agreement in addition because the analysed problem is a conservative system the formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients were also verified by considering the energy identity expressed in 62 which was found to be satisfied to very good accuracy a comparison of the three breakwaters reveals that the cycloidal breakwater is more reflective than the other two the analytical solution obtained in this work is superior to medina rodríguez s solution because the former is applicable to a wider range of waves from short waves to long waves this implies that the present formula is valid for a wider range of engineering applications than those previously reported in the specialized literature the radius of the generating circle of the cycloidal geometry has a strong influence on the magnitude of the coefficient r because for values of μ o 0 35 the values of the reflection coefficient r increase significantly for example as seen from fig 5a if we select values of γ 0 785 and μ 0 35 then the reflection coefficient takes a value of r 0 85 the results show that for a cycloidal breakwater the zero reflection phenomenon occurs for small values of the parameter μ r h 1 and some discrete values of the parameter γ ω 2 g h 1 in general for these three breakwaters the reflection coefficient exhibits oscillatory behaviour and increases in magnitude as the kinematical parameter increases for γ o 1 acknowledgements this research was financially supported by proyecto apoyado por
