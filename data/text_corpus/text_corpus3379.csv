16895,this study presents the first large scale assessment of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance of surface water near drinking water intakes across the united states public water systems serve drinking water to nearly 90 of the united states population cyanobacteria and their toxins may degrade the quality of finished drinking water and can lead to negative health consequences satellite imagery can serve as a cost effective and consistent monitoring technique for surface cyanobacterial blooms in source waters and can provide drinking water treatment operators information for managing their systems this study uses satellite imagery from the european space agency s ocean and land colour instrument olci spanning june 2016 through april 2020 at 300 m spatial resolution olci imagery can be used to monitor cyanobacteria in 685 drinking water sources across 285 lakes in 44 states referred to here as resolvable drinking water sources first a subset of satellite data was compared to a subset of responses n 84 submitted as part of the u s environmental protection agency s fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr 4 these ucmr 4 qualitative responses included visual observations of algal bloom presence and absence near drinking water intakes from march 2018 through november 2019 overall agreement between satellite imagery and ucmr 4 qualitative responses was 94 with a kappa coefficient of 0 70 next temporal frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable drinking water sources was assessed in 2019 bloom frequency averaged 2 and peaked at 100 where 100 indicated a bloom was always present at the source waters when satellite imagery was available monthly cyanobacterial abundances were used to assess short term trends across all resolvable drinking water sources and effect size was computed to provide insight on the number of years of data that must be obtained to increase confidence in an observed change generally 2016 through 2020 was an insufficient time period for confidently observing changes at these source waters on average a decade of satellite imagery would be required for observed environmental trends to outweigh variability in the data however five source waters did demonstrate a sustained short term trend with one increasing in cyanobacterial abundance from june 2016 to april 2020 and four decreasing keywords cyanobacteria drinking water source water quality remote sensing inland water water quality 1 introduction public water systems pwss delivered over 23 billion gallons of surface water per day in 2015 for domestic water use in the united states providing freshwater for services such as drinking food preparation bathing and landscaping dieter et al 2018 these pwss served an estimated 283 million people in 2015 representing approximately 87 of the united states population cyanobacterial blooms can degrade the quality of drinking water sources and some blooms can contain toxins called cyanotoxins which pose a human health risk when occurring at elevated levels in finished drinking water whether a bloom contains cyanotoxins or not high levels of cyanobacteria in source water can necessitate that drinking water systems simultaneously address multiple treatment objectives including managing taste and odor concerns cyanotoxin breakthrough and disinfection byproduct dbp formation u s epa 2016a in recent years cyanobacterial blooms have resulted in several large scale drinking water advisories in september 2013 a cyanobacterial bloom along the western shore of lake erie resulted in nearly two thousand people being left without access to clean drinking water in the carroll township in ohio glcr 2013 toledo ohio issued a multi day do not drink advisory for more than 500 000 people in 2014 because of elevated cyanotoxins found in their finished drinking water great lakes commission 2014 in 2018 the city of salem oregon was under a do not drink advisory applying to vulnerable populations for several weeks affecting several hundreds of thousands of people after elevated levels of the cyanotoxins microcystins and cylindrospermopsin were found in its finished drinking water the novak consulting group 2018 conventional drinking water treatment e g coagulation flocculation filtration has been proven effective in removing cyanobacterial cells and intracellular cyanotoxins szlag et al 2015 u s epa 2016a however additional treatment approaches are typically necessary in the presence of extracellular toxins ultimately the possibility of cyanotoxin breakthrough to finished drinking water is dependent on multiple factors including the type and amount of toxins present as well as the treatment approaches management and operations drinking water treatment plants use to respond to a bloom in source waters pwss may benefit from any advance knowledge regarding cyanobacterial bloom development in their source waters to prepare for and if possible mitigate the risks posed by blooms to finished drinking water the implementation of early warning indicators ewis has proven effective in managing cyanobacterial blooms allowing managers to proactively make critical decisions to prevent further bloom proliferation pace et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2018 ewis are typically focused on measuring known drivers of cyanobacterial blooms where a certain predetermined threshold must be met before triggering the ewi satellite imagery is a cost effective and standardized monitoring technique for cyanobacterial blooms e g coffer et al 2020 2021 dekker and hestir 2012 hunter et al 2009 kahru and elmgren 2014 kutser et al 2006 matthews and bernard 2015 mishra et al 2019 papenfus et al 2020 stroming et al 2020 stumpf et al 2016a b urquhart et al 2017 including for drinking water sources clark et al 2017 while satellite imagery is typically not used to measure drivers of cyanobacterial blooms it can provide consistent temporal coverage of cyanobacterial abundance and can serve a similar purpose as ewis advance knowledge can alert drinking water managers to blooms in their source waters indicating a need for cyanotoxin sampling in source and finished water results of that sampling could guide managers in implementing mitigation strategies in the source water itself optimizing existing treatment approaches or implementing additional treatment with the goal of reducing the risk of cyanotoxins breaching the treatment system motivated by concern for the effect of cyanobacterial blooms on drinking water quality this study uses satellite imagery to assess the frequency and abundance of cyanobacteria at surface source waters for nearly 700 drinking water intakes across 44 states in the continental united states additionally this study investigates the potential connection at a subset of these source waters between satellite remotely sensed data and a subset of qualitative visual observations collected under the fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr 4 ucmr 4 qualitative responses assessed whether an algal bloom was visible near the intake within a month of quantitative finished drinking water sampling this study considered a subset of these responses collected from march 2018 through november 2019 satellite data were obtained from the european space agency s esa ocean and land colour instrument olci onboard the sentinel 3a satellite from june 2016 through april 2020 the following research objectives were addressed 1 using a subset of observable drinking water sources assess agreement between satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance and qualitative visual reporting of algal bloom presence and absence collected as part of ucmr 4 2 using satellite imagery collected at all resolvable drinking water sources quantify average annual frequency of cyanobacterial blooms for the year 2019 3 using satellite imagery collected at all resolvable drinking water sources analyze short term trends in cyanobacterial abundance from june 2016 through april 2020 2 data and methods 2 1 satellite observations satellite observations were obtained from olci onboard the sentinel 3a satellite launched in february 2016 olci offers a revisit frequency of approximately 2 to 3 days and a spatial resolution of 300 m at nadir where nadir is defined as the point on earth s surface directly below the satellite data are collected in 21 spectral bands with center wavelengths ranging from 400 to 1020 nanometers nm standard olci level 1b data calibrated top of atmosphere radiances were first obtained from esa through the copernicus program and were then processed to level 2 imagery surface reflectances by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa ocean biology processing group obpg https oceandata sci gsfc nasa gov following urquhart and schaeffer 2020 criteria for satellite pixel inclusion and exclusion satellite pixels were quality flagged and discarded if they contained cloud cover fell along the land water interface were adjacent to a land pixel contained snow or ice or contained mixed land and water signals removing pixels along the land water interface and those adjacent to a land pixel ensures the shallowest portions of most lakes ranging from 300 to 600 m from shore are not considered reducing the possibility of bottom reflectance being measured by the satellite sensor satellite pixels that were not quality flagged and discarded based on these criteria were considered valid this study focuses on the cyanobacteria index product ci cyano the ci cyano algorithm leverages spectral bands centered at 665 nm 681 nm and 709 nm to assess bloom biomass wynne et al 2008 and those centered at 620 nm 665 nm and 681 nm as exclusion criteria to prevent the misidentification of non cyanobacterial blooms as reflectance at 620 nm is sensitive to phycocyanin lunetta et al 2015 graham et al 2008 described potential distributions of cyanobacteria within the water column which included cyanobacteria at a specific depth within the water column cyanobacteria evenly distributed within the water column and cyanobacteria as surface scums surface scums occur when cyanobacteria float on top of the water s surface and have optical properties similar to land vegetation kutser 2009 shi et al 2017 thus in our approach surface scums will likely be quality flagged as mixed pixels and discarded before further analysis instead the ci cyano algorithm characterizes cyanobacteria within the upper layer of the water column including cyanobacteria at depths of up to 2 m in clear water mishra et al 2005 and less than 2 m in more turbid water wynne et al 2010 coffer et al 2020 details the evolution of the ci cyano including the differentiation between cyanobacterial blooms and other algae defined by matthews et al 2012 observations were aggregated into weekly composites preserving the maximum ci cyano value for each pixel the standard ci cyano product was converted to cyanobacterial abundance in units of cells ml as ci cyano 108 as described in lunetta et al 2015 this conversion factor was defined based on a relationship between the satellite derived cyanobacterial index and surface water samples of microcystis spp cell counts in western lake erie throughout this study a bloom detected by satellite imagery is defined as any cyanobacterial abundance that exceeds the detection limit of the sensor which is preliminarily estimated to be between 10 000 and 20 000 cells ml in the united states ci cyano has been validated quantitatively against cyanobacteria cell counts and chlorophyll a across several states including florida ohio rhode island massachusetts new hampshire vermont connecticut and maine clark et al 2017 lunetta et al 2015 from 25 state health advisories in california oregon new york idaho new jersey utah and vermont schaeffer et al 2018 and as presence and absence mishra et al 2021 additionally ci cyano has been successfully demonstrated for state clark et al 2017 urquhart et al 2017 and national coffer et al 2020 2021 assessments of cyanobacterial occurrence within the united states ci cyano has also been used by several states to issue recreational advisories for example the wyoming department of environmental quality issued such recreational advisories at big sandy reservoir wyoming deq 2018a eden reservoir wyoming deq 2018b and pathfinder reservoir wyoming deq 2018c coffer et al 2020 also demonstrated expected seasonality via ci cyano across 46 states early iterations of the ci cyano algorithm have been used for assessing cyanobacterial blooms in lake balaton hungary palmer et al 2015 and the caspian sea moradi 2014 jin et al 2017 leveraged the cyanobacteria index first defined in wynne et al 2008 to assess cyanobacteria presence and absence at lakes taihu and chaohu in china other spectral index algorithms have been used to derive chlorophyll or cyanobacterial biomass based on reflectances in the red through near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the maximum peak height mph algorithm developed using imagery from esa s medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris for four african study sites matthews et al 2012 matthews and odermatt 2015 the maximum chlorophyll index mci also developed using meris imagery but in waters surrounding vancouver island in canada gower et al 2005 and the floating algae index fai developed using imagery from nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis in the western yellow sea near qingdao china hu 2009 there are 2196 lakes and reservoirs across 46 states in the continental united states that can be observed given the spatial resolution of olci fig 1 urquhart and schaeffer 2020 lakes and reservoirs were required to be of sufficient size and shape to accommodate at least one 300 m water only satellite pixel after the exclusion criteria described above these range in size from 1 3 km2 to over 4000 km2 limiting this analysis to relatively large lakes and reservoirs across the united states hereafter lakes and reservoirs will be referred to exclusively as lakes and those lakes that can be observed with 300 m satellite imagery are referred to as observable lakes 2 2 resolvable drinking water intake locations surface intake locations extracted from the safe drinking water information system sdwis database were previously described in clark et al 2017 locations of drinking water intakes for each pws facility are based on information contained in the sdwis database this assigned location will hereafter be referred to as the drinking water intake location or drinking water intake these drinking water intakes were first subset to include just those within 100 m of an observable lake following clark et al 2017 a total of 877 drinking water intake locations were within 100 m of an observable lake these locations were then subset to include just those within 900 m of a valid satellite pixel a slight variation from clark et al 2017 selected to represent a minimum distance of three 300 m pixels in each direction this left 685 drinking water intake locations corresponding to 285 lakes across 44 states fig 1 these remaining 685 drinking water intakes are referred to as resolvable drinking water intakes drinking water intakes that were within 100 m of an observable lake and within 900 m of a valid satellite pixel are referred to as resolvable drinking water intakes drinking water sources refer to the aggregated satellite pixels in an observable lake within the immediate vicinity of the drinking water intake location for each of these resolvable drinking water intake locations source waters were characterized by selecting all valid satellite pixels intersecting or falling within a 900 m buffer of the intake fig 2 2 3 ucmr 4 qualitative responses the u s environmental protection agency epa collects nationally representative finished drinking water data for unregulated contaminants suspected to be present and pose a health risk in drinking water under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr program u s epa 2016b c this monitoring is used by the u s epa to understand the frequency and level of occurrence of unregulated contaminants in the nation s pwss as part of a safe drinking water act mandate every five years the u s epa develops a new list of ucmr contaminants ucmr 4 required monitoring for 30 chemicals between 2018 and 2020 this included monitoring for 10 cyanotoxins in finished water as well as qualitative data collected regarding the presence of an algal bloom and other characteristics in source waters around the same time as the quantitative sample collection cyanotoxin monitoring as part of ucmr 4 was required to be conducted twice a month for each pws for four consecutive months excluding the months of december january and february and was required to be collected during one single year between 2018 and 2020 ucmr 4 cyanotoxin monitoring was required at all large public water systems i e systems serving more than 10 000 customers and a small statistically representative subset of small systems that use surface water as their sources a subset of ucmr 4 responses was obtained from the first quarter of 2020 https www epa gov dwucmr occurrence data unregulated contaminant monitoring rule given the temporal lag between data collected by the pws and data available for distribution this dataset was obtained in april 2020 but only contained data from march 2018 through november 2019 and does not represent all the data collected during that timeframe this study is not utilizing the quantitative ucmr 4 cyanotoxin finished water data instead it utilizes responses provided at the time of finished water monitoring in which the pws was asked preceding the finished water sample collection did you observe an algal bloom in your source waters near the intake only responses to this question of yes no or don t know were considered hereafter these responses will be referred to as ucmr 4 qualitative responses some pwss did not respond while several pwss recorded multiple responses over the time period this resulted in 92 ucmr 4 qualitative responses for comparison to satellite imagery if the pws responded yes they were asked to specify when the algal bloom was observed available responses included the day the ucmr 4 cyanotoxin sample was collected between the day the sample was collected and the past week between the past week and the past month between the past month and the past 12 months and more than a year ago each pws was asked to select all that applied when pwss responded yes this study considered algal blooms observed between the day the cyanotoxin sample was collected and the past month in an effort to include as many ucmr 4 responses as possible including observations between the day the sample was collected and the past month can lead to limitations in the temporal matchup between ucmr 4 qualitative responses and satellite observations however this does not necessarily mean that satellite observations and ucmr 4 responses were one a month apart but sometime within the previous month lunetta et al 2015 found the best correspondence between satellite data and field observations of cyanobacterial abundance was within a 2 week window of the satellite overpass which is similar to the 4 week window used here for cyanobacterial presence and absence additionally it is not possible to confirm that ucmr 4 qualitative responses identified the presence of cyanobacterial blooms specifically rather than algal blooms more generally which could lead to false positive and false negative situations when compared to satellite derived cyanobacteria presence and absence despite potential temporal limitations these visual observation responses provided via ucmr 4 are ideal for satellite comparison given that the satellite signal in our spectral region of interest also only represents the water s surface while not a validation this comparison is useful for assessing satellite derived results against user perception within our target audience of pws managers after identifying the drinking water intake locations corresponding to each ucmr 4 qualitative response intake locations were subset to those identified as resolvable as described in section 2 2 a total of 22 intakes with ucmr 4 responses from march 2018 through november 2019 corresponded to a resolvable drinking water intake location representing 11 lakes across 6 states fig 1 low spatial coverage of ucmr 4 qualitative responses is the result of both sample design and sample reporting while all large surface water systems were required to sample cyanotoxins in finished water as part of ucmr 4 only 800 small systems were required to sample additionally not all pws submitted qualitative source water data as part of their ucmr 4 finished water cyanotoxin sampling drinking water intakes assigned to the systems sampled then needed to correspond to a lake observable with 300 m satellite imagery and fit the selection criteria described in section 2 3 spatial coverage of these locations will likely improve as all ucmr 4 data becomes available 2 4 comparing ucmr 4 qualitative responses to satellite observations satellite data were extracted for each ucmr 4 qualitative response location by taking the average ci cyano value of all valid pixels contained within a 900 m buffer of the drinking water intake as descried in section 2 2 each date associated with the ucmr 4 quantitative sampling was matched to the corresponding satellite weekly composite to assess the agreement between the two datasets two approaches were used first a presence absence agreement matrix was developed to compare on a class by class basis binary satellite data and binary ucmr 4 qualitative responses overall agreement was computed as the number of instances that generated the same response in both satellite data and ucmr 4 qualitative responses normalized to the total number of instances considered the kappa coefficient was computed to indicate how well the two datasets agreed compared to a random assignment of classes cohen 1960 goodman and kruskal 1954 kappa is a ratio between 1 and 1 where higher values indicate better agreement and was computed via the fmsb package in r version 4 0 0 nakazawa 2019 r core team 2020 next the non parametric mann whitney u test was used to assess if cyanobacterial abundance values for ucmr 4 qualitative responses of yes and no were generated from the same population mann and whitney 1947 wilcoxon 1945 a nonparametric approach is required here for several reasons the data are not normally distributed the sample size is relatively small and the satellite observations contain non detects cohen s d was then used to quantify the effect size cohen 1992 via the effsize package in r version 4 0 0 r core team 2020 torchiano 2020 where generally absolute values above 0 5 indicate a large difference between the two means 2 5 assessing bloom frequency at all resolvable drinking water sources to assess the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable source waters near each drinking water intake see fig 2 satellite observations were aggregated into annual detections temporal frequency was computed per pixel following coffer et al 2021 as the proportion of valid satellite pixels that indicate either a detection of cyanobacteria i e those above the detection limit of the sensor or non detection invalid pixels are those with quality flags and were not included in the bloom frequency computation eq 1 in other words bloom frequency is simply the cyanobacteria detected pixels divided by the total number of detect and non detect pixels excluding invalid quality flagged pixels this produces a percentage between 0 and 100 where 0 indicates no bloom was present at that pixel for the given year when satellite imagery was available and 100 indicates a bloom was always present at that pixel for the given year when satellite imagery was available at each drinking water source annual bloom frequency for the year 2019 represented the average bloom frequencies for all pixels contained within a 900 m buffer of each drinking water intake 1 bloom frequency 100 n of pixels with detectable ci cyano n of all valid pixels 2 6 quantifying effect size at all resolvable drinking water source waters to quantify effect size at all resolvable drinking water source waters a γ statistic was used which is conceptually equivalent to cohen s d and has been used for several environmental applications coffer and hestir 2019 henson et al 2010 urquhart et al 2017 in this study this statistic was used to determine the number of observations needed for a trend in the data to be sustained despite the residual variability in the data and can provide insight into how many years of data are needed to increase confidence in an observed change if γ is less than the time period of observations the magnitude of the trend exceeds the residual variability in the data to compute γ cyanobacterial abundance values were first extracted within the previously described 900 m buffer of each drinking water intake cyanobacterial abundance values for all pixels contained in or intersecting this buffer were averaged for each weekly composite satellite image weekly averages were assigned months based on the middle day of the week and monthly averages were computed for june 2016 through april 2020 these monthly averages were used to quantify γ at each intake and those with a γ of less than four years were considered for a trend analysis the γ statistic was computed following eq 2 as 2 γ 1 n y y 2 n 1 m where n is the sample size ŷ represents the residuals of y and m is the thiel sen slope the thiel sen slope determines the magnitude of the trend by computing the slope for all pairs of data and taking their median sen 1968 theil 1992 relatively short time series have been used in previous studies for trend detection kim et al 2007 assessed linear trends in air quality using three and five years of satellite data psilovikos et al 2006 analyzed trends in water quality using three years of field observations to assess short term trends at each drinking water source the nonparametric seasonal mann kendall test for trend and the associated thiel sen slope were computed the seasonal mann kendall test for trend is a variation of the mann kendall test for trend kendall 1955 mann 1945 checking for a monotonic increase or decrease across the time series the trend analysis was performed via the rkt package in r version 4 0 0 marchetto 2017 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 agreement between ucmr 4 qualitative responses and satellite observations of the 92 ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources corresponding to satellite imagery in responding to the question of whether there was an algal bloom preceding the sampling event 8 responded don t know 76 responded no and 8 responded yes those that responded yes indicated this algal bloom was present between the day of quantitative sampling and the past month 72 of the 76 ucmr 4 qualitative responses of no in drinking water sources corresponded to an absence of cyanobacteria in satellite imagery and 7 of the 8 ucmr 4 qualitative responses of yes in drinking water sources corresponded to a presence of cyanobacteria in satellite imagery table 1 thus there were five ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources that disagreed with satellite imagery one in which the ucmr 4 qualitative response in drinking water sources indicated a bloom was present while satellite imagery indicated a bloom was absent and four in which the ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources indicated a bloom was absent and satellite imagery indicated a bloom was present this corresponded to an overall agreement of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 70 in addition to cyanobacterial presence and absence the satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance was analyzed for each of the 92 ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources fig 3 for all ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources in which the observer did not know if an algal bloom was present satellite imagery indicated non detection of cyanobacteria when ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources indicated an algal bloom was not observed median cyanobacterial abundance corresponded to the detection limit of the satellite imagery when ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources indicated an algal bloom was observed median cyanobacterial abundance exceeded 1 200 000 cells ml results of the mann whitney u test and associated cohen s d indicate satellite estimated cyanobacterial abundance corresponding to ucmr 4 qualitative responses of yes and no are not derived from the same population u 82 n 84 cohen s d 4 14 this indicates that visual observations during ucmr 4 monitoring and satellite observations have strong agreement in assessing cyanobacterial occurrence at drinking water source waters 3 2 bloom frequency at drinking water sources for the year 2019 average annual bloom frequency was assessed at all 685 resolvable drinking water sources not just those corresponding to ucmr 4 qualitative responses for each weekly composite an average of 19 satellite pixels were considered within a 900 m buffer of each drinking water intake to compute average annual bloom frequency average bloom frequency in 2019 peaked at 100 meaning that for all valid satellite pixels the average of those closest to the intake always indicated a cyanobacterial bloom was present fig 4 a average bloom frequency reached 100 at source waters in morgan lake new mexico and grand lake ohio commonly referred to as grand lake st mary s throughout the entire year in 2019 despite relatively high average bloom frequency within 900 m at several intakes the majority of the distribution fell below the third quartile at 13 and the median was 2 outliers existed at source waters with an average frequency above 35 the four states with the maximum number of resolvable drinking water sources were selected to demonstrate cyanobacterial frequency in more detail fig 4b similar results can be generated for any boundary including states nations or ecoregions texas is located in the southern united states bordering mexico and the gulf of mexico texas s climate is characterized primarily as subtropical in its central and eastern portions and as arid desert in its western portions new york is located in the northeast united states sharing a border with canada and extending to the atlantic ocean new york s climate is characterized almost entirely as humid continental california is located along the pacific coast and the southern portion of the state also shares a border with mexico most of california is characterized as having a mediterranean climate but some southeastern portions of the state are characterized as desert and semi arid oklahoma is located just north of texas and its climate is primarily characterized as humid subtropical texas contains 130 resolvable intakes whose statewide average bloom frequency was 18 3 in 2019 exceeding the third quartile of all resolvable intakes for the same period of time three source waters had an average bloom frequency of 80 in 2019 while all others were below 70 new york contains 96 resolvable intakes which averaged the lowest statewide bloom frequency in 2019 of these four states at only 1 74 equivalent to the median of all resolvable source waters the resolvable source waters with the highest average bloom frequency in new york were below 20 california contains 75 resolvable intakes that exhibited a statewide average bloom frequency of 3 26 in 2019 two source waters had the highest average frequencies for this state with values of 50 over half of the resolvable source waters in california had an average bloom frequency of 0 for 2019 oklahoma contains 71 resolvable intakes that exhibited a statewide average bloom frequency of 4 63 in 2019 the source waters that exhibited the highest average bloom frequency had a value below 50 and many of the subsequently ranked source waters showed relatively high average bloom frequencies compared to new york and california 3 3 analysis of effect size at drinking water sources effect size was analyzed at all 685 resolvable drinking water sources as described in section 2 6 there were five source waters that were excluded due to low temporal coverage as they did not contain at least four observations for any given month in that time period this left 680 resolvable source waters to include in the analysis of effect size a trend analysis was first applied to average monthly frequencies but no source waters had an effect size indicative of a sustained change i e γ 4 years so this metric was not considered further instead a trend analysis was applied to average satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance values cells ml thus results presented here indicate changes in satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance estimates more data would be needed to identify changes in temporal frequency a time period of four years did not provide sufficient cyanobacterial abundance data to determine a sustained trend amid inherent variability in the data for nearly all resolvable source waters based on the observed variability a median temporal data collection period of just over a decade would be needed to assess trends given the same sampling frequency fig 5 the nature of the γ statistic requires a detectable slope in order for this statistic to be quantified and a relatively small slope will result in a very large γ thus a cutoff on γ of 50 years was selected for fig 5 to focus the analysis on more achievable monitoring time periods which resulted in a subset of 36 intakes being selected for computing the median γ statistic five source waters did exhibit an effect size indicative of a sustained trend from june 2016 through april 2020 γ 4 years but conclusions cannot be drawn regarding changes that may have occurred outside of this time period table 2 fig 6 source waters at morgan lake in new mexico nm increased in average cyanobacterial abundance by 60 per year from 2016 to 2020 and a γ of 3 years indicates that this increase represents a sustained trend source waters at lake overholser in oklahoma ok grand lake in ohio oh choke canyon reservoir in texas tx and lake eufaula ok decreased in cyanobacterial abundance from 2016 to 2020 lake overholser ok decreased by 30 per year and exhibited the lowest γ of the entire dataset requiring only 1 year of observations to draw a conclusion about the observed trend grand lake oh decreased in cyanobacterial abundance by only 10 per year but the γ statistic still supported a sustained trend requiring 3 years of data both choke canyon reservoir tx and lake eufaula ok decreased by 20 per year and required 3 years of observations for the trend to overcome residual variability in the data 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of satellite derived data with field observations this study serves as the first quantitative comparison between satellite remote sensing data and ucmr 4 qualitative responses providing an assessment of two independent approaches for assessing the presence of cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water sources agreement between ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources of algal presence and satellite derived cyanobacterial abundances increases confidence in both the accuracy of pws samplers visual interpretation of algal blooms and the use of satellite imagery for detecting cyanobacteria at surface source waters a kappa coefficient of 0 70 was found between the two datasets kappa coefficients between 0 60 and 0 79 are considered to have a moderate level of agreement mchugh 2012 while 79 responses agreed between the two datasets there were five disagreements however in the absence of field measured cyanobacterial abundance discrepancies between satellite estimated cyanobacterial presence and ucmr 4 qualitative responses cannot be reconciled with complete certainty in four cases ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources recorded no visual observation of an algal bloom but corresponding satellite measurements indicated cyanobacteria detections were present at these four cases at least one of the pixels extracted within a 900 m buffer of the intake had a non detect but other pixels within the 900 m buffer did have detects resulting in the aggregation of these pixels indicating cyanobacteria presence thus the discrepancy could partially be explained by spatial mismatches between the exact visual observations and the 900 m buffer additionally temporal offset between the two datasets could exist in one case ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources recorded a bloom but corresponding satellite measurements indicated non detect for this sample the ucmr 4 qualitative response in drinking water sources to the question preceding the finished water sample collection did you observe an algal bloom in your source waters near the intake was that an algal bloom was observed between the past week and past month a temporal offset could explain this discrepancy or a bloom could have been present below the detection limit of the satellite sensor additionally it is possible to have cyanobacteria with no detectable surface bloom particularly given that cyanobacteria can move horizontally and vertically throughout the water column within hours qi et al 2018 qin et al 2018 a surface bloom could have been present at the time of ucmr 4 data collection but not at the time of satellite overpass as it may have moved within the water column moreover the ability of the satellite to detect picocyanobacteria is still uncertain picocyanobacteria could have been observed during ucmr 4 data collection but not registered through the ci cyano algorithm śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 4 2 large scale assessments of cyanobacterial frequency at source waters monitoring and assessment of cyanobacterial blooms has not been routinely conducted in a nationally consistent manner with adequate spatial and temporal resolutions infrequent field monitoring has been conducted at the national level including the national lakes assessment nla occurring every five years in the united states blocksom et al 2016 regional field monitoring has also been conducted including across 142 chinese lakes and reservoirs over two multi year periods huang et al 2020 field monitoring can be both time and cost intensive while satellite observations offer the potential for increased temporal and spatial resolutions when lakes are of sufficient size and in the absence of cloud cover or snow and ice e g coffer et al 2020 2021 duan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 results presented here indicate that satellite imagery can be an important pre screening tool that drinking water quality managers may use for early detection of cyanobacteria in their drinking water sources cost effective and timely early detection of cyanobacteria in source waters can help inform critical treatment monitoring and management steps from pwss protecting drinking water quality from the risks posed by cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria and improving the quality of finished drinking water to ensure public health however field efforts such as the nla state and local efforts are still needed to validate satellite observations and measure toxins and other parameters not resolvable with satellite imagery particularly in areas not observable using satellite imagery such as the land water interface despite efforts to monitor cyanobacterial blooms across broad spatial and temporal scales monitoring specific to drinking water sources is not routinely collected at the national level in the united states clark et al 2017 used satellite imagery from meris spanning 2008 through 2011 to assess cyanobacterial bloom frequency at source waters in the states of florida and ohio the average cyanobacterial frequency for all resolvable source waters in florida was 30 and for ohio 5 using a different method to extract nearby satellite pixels at each intake and using a different satellite sensor clark et al 2017 found grand lake to have the highest temporal frequency for the state of ohio at 83 from 2008 through 2011 this study presents the first large scale assessment of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance at surface drinking water intakes across the united states national level assessments of cyanobacterial occurrence at drinking water sources have not been conducted through either field or satellite observations upon completion of data reporting ucmr 4 will serve as the first field based dataset of cyanobacteria in source waters across the united states while methods presented here can be used to monitor approximately 700 drinking water sources across 44 states with consistent temporal coverage in the absence of cloud contamination or snow and ice cover 4 3 assessing effect size of cyanobacterial abundance anderson et al 2002 indicated coastal systems in recent decades had increased in occurrence of toxic and otherwise harmful algal blooms but did not provide quantitative evidence of this change it was noted however that this increase could either reflect heightened scientific awareness or an actual increase in the number magnitude or frequency of blooms anderson 1989 a lack of historical data was cited as a limitation for quantifying long term change he et al 2016 also indicated the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater systems is increasing more recently huisman et al 2018 summarized projected increases in cyanobacterial occurrence due to eutrophication rising carbon dioxide levels and changing climatic conditions despite repeated suggestions that cyanobacterial blooms have or will increase few large scale trend analyses have been performed to support this claim using over 200 years of sediment cores from northern hemisphere lakes taranu et al 2015 suggested that cyanobacteria have increased substantially in almost 60 of lakes since the industrial revolution and that cyanobacteria have increased disproportionally compared to other phytoplankton using satellite imagery urquhart et al 2017 analyzed changes in the spatial extent of cyanobacterial blooms from 2008 through 2011 for large lakes in the states of california ohio and florida florida data indicated an increase in spatial extent of blooms but exhibited a γ of 4 1 over the 4 year time series suggesting the observed trend did not quite statistically outweigh residual variability in the data this study found that a median of over 10 years of observations was needed for observed changes to show a sustained trend outside of the residual variability in the data given current sampling frequency for reference the average satellite lifespan was 8 6 years in the 1990 s belward and skøien 2015 and the average water quality field campaign for chlorophyll monitoring lasts approximately 2 5 years belward and skøien 2015 also summarized satellite lifespans for more recent decades but these values were artificially reduced given that many of the sensors considered were at the beginning of their life cycles the average length of water quality field monitoring was found by averaging the difference between start years and end years for all water quality portal https www waterqualitydata us datasets with a characteristic name chlorophyll chlorophyll monitoring was used as a proxy for cyanobacteria monitoring as field measurements for cyanobacteria are often only available through state or local databases u s epa 2020 olci completed its fourth full year of data collection in june 2020 the operational lifespan of sentinel 3a is set to 7 years with consumables available for up to 12 years an identical sensor is housed on esa s sentinel 3b satellite platform launched in 2018 moving forward esa plans to ensure consistent long term coverage through the launch of sentinel 3c and sentinel 3d upon successful launch of all four satellites in the sentinel 3 satellite series mission continuity will then be expected for at least 25 years from the launch of sentinel 3a thus the sentinel 3 satellite constellation offers promise for providing sufficient temporal coverage for defensible quantitative drinking water source trend assessment schaeffer et al 2013 found that mission continuity is critical for end users findings here also highlight the importance of long term monitoring programs both satellite based and field campaigns in order to defend or refute statements regarding large scale changes in cyanobacterial frequency extent and abundance insufficient temporal coverage was a primary concern for this study with nearly all drinking water sources failing to achieve a γ less than the time period of observations additionally the median required time period of 10 04 years was based on an assumed sampling frequency and could be longer if the frequency of observations decreases compared to the reference 2016 through 2020 period used here this supports the need for continued consistent monitoring to better understand long term cyanobacterial bloom trends in drinking water sources the planned constellation of sentinel 3 satellites is expected to improve temporal coverage in the future despite the need for increased temporal coverage source waters at five intakes did exhibit a sustained trend from 2016 to 2020 but these trends cannot be extrapolated outside of this time period and are not indicative of ongoing changes morgan lake is located on the navajo nation in northwest new mexico this source water exhibited the highest possible bloom frequency and was the only source water considered to increase in abundance lake overholser is located in oklahoma city ok and decreased in cyanobacterial abundance from 2016 to 2020 grand lake in western ohio once ranked in the 99th percentile for microcystins in the united states u s epa 2009 while jacquemin et al 2018 found substantial improvements in water quality over the past decade they concluded that this lake s waters remained impaired choke canyon reservoir in southern texas provides drinking water for the city of corpus christi and lake eufaula oklahoma s largest lake provides drinking water to eufaula ok at both of these source waters changes were driven by much lower cyanobacterial abundance values in the last year of observations compared to the first three years temporal patterns at these sites resembled more of a step change rather than a continuous trend but insufficient information exists to determine a potential cause of the sudden decline in cyanobacterial abundances at all sites additional information would be needed to determine drivers of these changes given the short time period considered 4 4 limitations while this study offers the first large scale investigation of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance at drinking water sources across the united states there are several limitations that warrant consideration only drinking water intakes located in or near relatively large lakes were considered and pixels that fell along the shoreline were discarded meaning approximately 80 of all drinking water intakes were not studied when considering a subset of these drinking water intakes for matching with ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources coverage was even lower as ucmr 4 sampling was ongoing through the end of 2020 this study only considered ucmr 4 data reported up to april 2020 and represented a portion of data collected up to november 2019 the estimated pws locations are based on the best available locational data provided by the states in sdwis and are chosen to represent a pws for this national scale analysis in some cases this may cause discrepancies given the 100 m buffer used to assign a lake to each intake applying a similar analysis to finer resolution sensors such as sentinel 2 at 20 m multispectral resolution or landsat 8 at 30 m multispectral resolution could improve spatial coverage sentinel 2 has the potential for quantifying chlorophyll gilerson et al 2010 pahlevan et al 2020 and landsat has shown promise for bloom monitoring ho et al 2017 oyama et al 2015 but cyanobacteria specific algorithms have yet to be validated for large scale applications the meris sensor onboard esa s envisat can also be useful for retrospective analysis with imagery available from 2002 through 2012 a 900 m buffer was selected to characterize source waters at each drinking water intake this distance was chosen to include three 300 m satellite pixels surrounding each intake however these pixels do not perfectly capture the source waters influencing each drinking water intake to determine which 300 m pixels best characterize source waters at each drinking water intake information regarding the bathymetry depth of each intake and the drawdown rate would be required as well as hydrodynamic modeling specific to each system this information is unavailable across all 685 intakes and therefore it is impossible to properly identify which satellite pixels are contributing to drinking water at any given time thus a generalized buffer of 900 m was chosen for consistency across locations and time satellite observations of cyanobacterial frequency or abundance do not represent levels in finished drinking water when investigating cyanobacterial abundance near these intakes it is important to remember that this analysis focuses on source waters only the quality of finished drinking water is a reflection of treatment practices used by the pws in response to changes in intake water quality for example a 2016 report found 43 9 of source waters in ohio to exceed the u s epa health advisory level of 0 3 µg l total microcystins for children and vulnerable populations but only 1 16 of treated drinking water samples exceeded this threshold awwa 2016 demonstrating effective treatment practices for the intakes considered moreover satellite imagery can only detect cyanobacteria not the presence of cyanotoxins stumpf et al 2016a and it is possible for both a visible bloom to be present without cyanotoxins and cyanotoxins to be present without a visible bloom this issue is further complicated by the presence and the possibility of the growth and regrowth of cyanobacteria within the treatment utility potentially leading to toxin or taste and odor production even in the absence of a bloom in the source water almuhtaram et al 2018 greenstein et al 2020 several limitations exist in the acquisition of satellite imagery data gaps exist due to cloud cover sun glint contamination and the presence of snow and ice northern latitude regions are particularly affected by lower data coverage in the winter months coffer et al 2020 although during the cold season proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms is believed to be more limited ibelings et al 2021 however occasional blooms and in some cases cyanotoxins have been noted under ice bertilsson et al 2013 hampton et al 2017 üveges et al 2012 wejnerowski et al 2018 satellite images are acquired mid day and only characterize cyanobacteria at the time of image acquisition however cyanobacterial blooms can change throughout the day and from one day to another the weekly composites used here preserve the week s maximum ci cyano value in an effort to capture any cyanobacterial bloom that may have occurred but no information can be gathered or inferred outside the time of satellite image acquisition additionally difficulties can arise in performing short term trend analyses given limited observations satellites typically cannot detect benthic cyanobacteria except in the case of optically shallow water however benthic systems can contribute to contamination of drinking water sources gaget et al 2017 moreover drinking water intakes can be located at a water s surface or at depths of up to 30 to 40 m hoeger et al 2005 but the satellite signal only represents the top layer of the water column typically up to 2 m for red spectral bands in clear water mishra et al 2005 and less than 2 m in more turbid waters wynne et al 2010 this vertical offset can be important if using this information to inform drinking water management approaches a vertical offset is not accounted for here and is difficult to address given that some facilities have multiple intake depths to accommodate changes in water level and water quality u s epa 2016a 5 conclusions this study used satellite imagery to detect cyanobacteria at nearly 700 drinking water sources across the united states additionally agreement between a subset of 22 of these source waters and visual observations extracted from ucmr 4 qualitative responses indicating the presence or absence of a visible surface algal bloom was analyzed the following conclusions were reached a subset of ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources spanning march 2018 through november 2019 and corresponding satellite derived cyanobacteria detect and non detect measurements achieved an overall agreement of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 70 across 84 observations this demonstrates the utility for use of satellite imagery as a complement to ground based measurements for assessing cyanobacterial occurrence at drinking water sources across all resolvable drinking water sources the majority of detectable cyanobacterial bloom frequencies for 2019 averaged less than 35 but several outliers existed at higher frequencies reaching a maximum value of 100 for source waters at two drinking water intakes nearly all source waters analyzed did not have sufficient data for a trend analysis as indicated by effect size statistics that were longer than the time period of observations instead a decade of observations would be needed on average for trends to outweigh residual variability in the data five source waters demonstrated a short term trend from june 2016 through april 2020 with source waters at one intake increasing in cyanobacterial abundance over this time period and source waters at four intakes decreasing in cyanobacterial abundance however conclusions are only valid within the observed time period and cannot be extrapolated to support long term trends at any source waters additional data are needed to determine drivers of these changes declaration of competing interest the

16895,this study presents the first large scale assessment of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance of surface water near drinking water intakes across the united states public water systems serve drinking water to nearly 90 of the united states population cyanobacteria and their toxins may degrade the quality of finished drinking water and can lead to negative health consequences satellite imagery can serve as a cost effective and consistent monitoring technique for surface cyanobacterial blooms in source waters and can provide drinking water treatment operators information for managing their systems this study uses satellite imagery from the european space agency s ocean and land colour instrument olci spanning june 2016 through april 2020 at 300 m spatial resolution olci imagery can be used to monitor cyanobacteria in 685 drinking water sources across 285 lakes in 44 states referred to here as resolvable drinking water sources first a subset of satellite data was compared to a subset of responses n 84 submitted as part of the u s environmental protection agency s fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr 4 these ucmr 4 qualitative responses included visual observations of algal bloom presence and absence near drinking water intakes from march 2018 through november 2019 overall agreement between satellite imagery and ucmr 4 qualitative responses was 94 with a kappa coefficient of 0 70 next temporal frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable drinking water sources was assessed in 2019 bloom frequency averaged 2 and peaked at 100 where 100 indicated a bloom was always present at the source waters when satellite imagery was available monthly cyanobacterial abundances were used to assess short term trends across all resolvable drinking water sources and effect size was computed to provide insight on the number of years of data that must be obtained to increase confidence in an observed change generally 2016 through 2020 was an insufficient time period for confidently observing changes at these source waters on average a decade of satellite imagery would be required for observed environmental trends to outweigh variability in the data however five source waters did demonstrate a sustained short term trend with one increasing in cyanobacterial abundance from june 2016 to april 2020 and four decreasing keywords cyanobacteria drinking water source water quality remote sensing inland water water quality 1 introduction public water systems pwss delivered over 23 billion gallons of surface water per day in 2015 for domestic water use in the united states providing freshwater for services such as drinking food preparation bathing and landscaping dieter et al 2018 these pwss served an estimated 283 million people in 2015 representing approximately 87 of the united states population cyanobacterial blooms can degrade the quality of drinking water sources and some blooms can contain toxins called cyanotoxins which pose a human health risk when occurring at elevated levels in finished drinking water whether a bloom contains cyanotoxins or not high levels of cyanobacteria in source water can necessitate that drinking water systems simultaneously address multiple treatment objectives including managing taste and odor concerns cyanotoxin breakthrough and disinfection byproduct dbp formation u s epa 2016a in recent years cyanobacterial blooms have resulted in several large scale drinking water advisories in september 2013 a cyanobacterial bloom along the western shore of lake erie resulted in nearly two thousand people being left without access to clean drinking water in the carroll township in ohio glcr 2013 toledo ohio issued a multi day do not drink advisory for more than 500 000 people in 2014 because of elevated cyanotoxins found in their finished drinking water great lakes commission 2014 in 2018 the city of salem oregon was under a do not drink advisory applying to vulnerable populations for several weeks affecting several hundreds of thousands of people after elevated levels of the cyanotoxins microcystins and cylindrospermopsin were found in its finished drinking water the novak consulting group 2018 conventional drinking water treatment e g coagulation flocculation filtration has been proven effective in removing cyanobacterial cells and intracellular cyanotoxins szlag et al 2015 u s epa 2016a however additional treatment approaches are typically necessary in the presence of extracellular toxins ultimately the possibility of cyanotoxin breakthrough to finished drinking water is dependent on multiple factors including the type and amount of toxins present as well as the treatment approaches management and operations drinking water treatment plants use to respond to a bloom in source waters pwss may benefit from any advance knowledge regarding cyanobacterial bloom development in their source waters to prepare for and if possible mitigate the risks posed by blooms to finished drinking water the implementation of early warning indicators ewis has proven effective in managing cyanobacterial blooms allowing managers to proactively make critical decisions to prevent further bloom proliferation pace et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2018 ewis are typically focused on measuring known drivers of cyanobacterial blooms where a certain predetermined threshold must be met before triggering the ewi satellite imagery is a cost effective and standardized monitoring technique for cyanobacterial blooms e g coffer et al 2020 2021 dekker and hestir 2012 hunter et al 2009 kahru and elmgren 2014 kutser et al 2006 matthews and bernard 2015 mishra et al 2019 papenfus et al 2020 stroming et al 2020 stumpf et al 2016a b urquhart et al 2017 including for drinking water sources clark et al 2017 while satellite imagery is typically not used to measure drivers of cyanobacterial blooms it can provide consistent temporal coverage of cyanobacterial abundance and can serve a similar purpose as ewis advance knowledge can alert drinking water managers to blooms in their source waters indicating a need for cyanotoxin sampling in source and finished water results of that sampling could guide managers in implementing mitigation strategies in the source water itself optimizing existing treatment approaches or implementing additional treatment with the goal of reducing the risk of cyanotoxins breaching the treatment system motivated by concern for the effect of cyanobacterial blooms on drinking water quality this study uses satellite imagery to assess the frequency and abundance of cyanobacteria at surface source waters for nearly 700 drinking water intakes across 44 states in the continental united states additionally this study investigates the potential connection at a subset of these source waters between satellite remotely sensed data and a subset of qualitative visual observations collected under the fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr 4 ucmr 4 qualitative responses assessed whether an algal bloom was visible near the intake within a month of quantitative finished drinking water sampling this study considered a subset of these responses collected from march 2018 through november 2019 satellite data were obtained from the european space agency s esa ocean and land colour instrument olci onboard the sentinel 3a satellite from june 2016 through april 2020 the following research objectives were addressed 1 using a subset of observable drinking water sources assess agreement between satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance and qualitative visual reporting of algal bloom presence and absence collected as part of ucmr 4 2 using satellite imagery collected at all resolvable drinking water sources quantify average annual frequency of cyanobacterial blooms for the year 2019 3 using satellite imagery collected at all resolvable drinking water sources analyze short term trends in cyanobacterial abundance from june 2016 through april 2020 2 data and methods 2 1 satellite observations satellite observations were obtained from olci onboard the sentinel 3a satellite launched in february 2016 olci offers a revisit frequency of approximately 2 to 3 days and a spatial resolution of 300 m at nadir where nadir is defined as the point on earth s surface directly below the satellite data are collected in 21 spectral bands with center wavelengths ranging from 400 to 1020 nanometers nm standard olci level 1b data calibrated top of atmosphere radiances were first obtained from esa through the copernicus program and were then processed to level 2 imagery surface reflectances by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa ocean biology processing group obpg https oceandata sci gsfc nasa gov following urquhart and schaeffer 2020 criteria for satellite pixel inclusion and exclusion satellite pixels were quality flagged and discarded if they contained cloud cover fell along the land water interface were adjacent to a land pixel contained snow or ice or contained mixed land and water signals removing pixels along the land water interface and those adjacent to a land pixel ensures the shallowest portions of most lakes ranging from 300 to 600 m from shore are not considered reducing the possibility of bottom reflectance being measured by the satellite sensor satellite pixels that were not quality flagged and discarded based on these criteria were considered valid this study focuses on the cyanobacteria index product ci cyano the ci cyano algorithm leverages spectral bands centered at 665 nm 681 nm and 709 nm to assess bloom biomass wynne et al 2008 and those centered at 620 nm 665 nm and 681 nm as exclusion criteria to prevent the misidentification of non cyanobacterial blooms as reflectance at 620 nm is sensitive to phycocyanin lunetta et al 2015 graham et al 2008 described potential distributions of cyanobacteria within the water column which included cyanobacteria at a specific depth within the water column cyanobacteria evenly distributed within the water column and cyanobacteria as surface scums surface scums occur when cyanobacteria float on top of the water s surface and have optical properties similar to land vegetation kutser 2009 shi et al 2017 thus in our approach surface scums will likely be quality flagged as mixed pixels and discarded before further analysis instead the ci cyano algorithm characterizes cyanobacteria within the upper layer of the water column including cyanobacteria at depths of up to 2 m in clear water mishra et al 2005 and less than 2 m in more turbid water wynne et al 2010 coffer et al 2020 details the evolution of the ci cyano including the differentiation between cyanobacterial blooms and other algae defined by matthews et al 2012 observations were aggregated into weekly composites preserving the maximum ci cyano value for each pixel the standard ci cyano product was converted to cyanobacterial abundance in units of cells ml as ci cyano 108 as described in lunetta et al 2015 this conversion factor was defined based on a relationship between the satellite derived cyanobacterial index and surface water samples of microcystis spp cell counts in western lake erie throughout this study a bloom detected by satellite imagery is defined as any cyanobacterial abundance that exceeds the detection limit of the sensor which is preliminarily estimated to be between 10 000 and 20 000 cells ml in the united states ci cyano has been validated quantitatively against cyanobacteria cell counts and chlorophyll a across several states including florida ohio rhode island massachusetts new hampshire vermont connecticut and maine clark et al 2017 lunetta et al 2015 from 25 state health advisories in california oregon new york idaho new jersey utah and vermont schaeffer et al 2018 and as presence and absence mishra et al 2021 additionally ci cyano has been successfully demonstrated for state clark et al 2017 urquhart et al 2017 and national coffer et al 2020 2021 assessments of cyanobacterial occurrence within the united states ci cyano has also been used by several states to issue recreational advisories for example the wyoming department of environmental quality issued such recreational advisories at big sandy reservoir wyoming deq 2018a eden reservoir wyoming deq 2018b and pathfinder reservoir wyoming deq 2018c coffer et al 2020 also demonstrated expected seasonality via ci cyano across 46 states early iterations of the ci cyano algorithm have been used for assessing cyanobacterial blooms in lake balaton hungary palmer et al 2015 and the caspian sea moradi 2014 jin et al 2017 leveraged the cyanobacteria index first defined in wynne et al 2008 to assess cyanobacteria presence and absence at lakes taihu and chaohu in china other spectral index algorithms have been used to derive chlorophyll or cyanobacterial biomass based on reflectances in the red through near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the maximum peak height mph algorithm developed using imagery from esa s medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris for four african study sites matthews et al 2012 matthews and odermatt 2015 the maximum chlorophyll index mci also developed using meris imagery but in waters surrounding vancouver island in canada gower et al 2005 and the floating algae index fai developed using imagery from nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis in the western yellow sea near qingdao china hu 2009 there are 2196 lakes and reservoirs across 46 states in the continental united states that can be observed given the spatial resolution of olci fig 1 urquhart and schaeffer 2020 lakes and reservoirs were required to be of sufficient size and shape to accommodate at least one 300 m water only satellite pixel after the exclusion criteria described above these range in size from 1 3 km2 to over 4000 km2 limiting this analysis to relatively large lakes and reservoirs across the united states hereafter lakes and reservoirs will be referred to exclusively as lakes and those lakes that can be observed with 300 m satellite imagery are referred to as observable lakes 2 2 resolvable drinking water intake locations surface intake locations extracted from the safe drinking water information system sdwis database were previously described in clark et al 2017 locations of drinking water intakes for each pws facility are based on information contained in the sdwis database this assigned location will hereafter be referred to as the drinking water intake location or drinking water intake these drinking water intakes were first subset to include just those within 100 m of an observable lake following clark et al 2017 a total of 877 drinking water intake locations were within 100 m of an observable lake these locations were then subset to include just those within 900 m of a valid satellite pixel a slight variation from clark et al 2017 selected to represent a minimum distance of three 300 m pixels in each direction this left 685 drinking water intake locations corresponding to 285 lakes across 44 states fig 1 these remaining 685 drinking water intakes are referred to as resolvable drinking water intakes drinking water intakes that were within 100 m of an observable lake and within 900 m of a valid satellite pixel are referred to as resolvable drinking water intakes drinking water sources refer to the aggregated satellite pixels in an observable lake within the immediate vicinity of the drinking water intake location for each of these resolvable drinking water intake locations source waters were characterized by selecting all valid satellite pixels intersecting or falling within a 900 m buffer of the intake fig 2 2 3 ucmr 4 qualitative responses the u s environmental protection agency epa collects nationally representative finished drinking water data for unregulated contaminants suspected to be present and pose a health risk in drinking water under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr program u s epa 2016b c this monitoring is used by the u s epa to understand the frequency and level of occurrence of unregulated contaminants in the nation s pwss as part of a safe drinking water act mandate every five years the u s epa develops a new list of ucmr contaminants ucmr 4 required monitoring for 30 chemicals between 2018 and 2020 this included monitoring for 10 cyanotoxins in finished water as well as qualitative data collected regarding the presence of an algal bloom and other characteristics in source waters around the same time as the quantitative sample collection cyanotoxin monitoring as part of ucmr 4 was required to be conducted twice a month for each pws for four consecutive months excluding the months of december january and february and was required to be collected during one single year between 2018 and 2020 ucmr 4 cyanotoxin monitoring was required at all large public water systems i e systems serving more than 10 000 customers and a small statistically representative subset of small systems that use surface water as their sources a subset of ucmr 4 responses was obtained from the first quarter of 2020 https www epa gov dwucmr occurrence data unregulated contaminant monitoring rule given the temporal lag between data collected by the pws and data available for distribution this dataset was obtained in april 2020 but only contained data from march 2018 through november 2019 and does not represent all the data collected during that timeframe this study is not utilizing the quantitative ucmr 4 cyanotoxin finished water data instead it utilizes responses provided at the time of finished water monitoring in which the pws was asked preceding the finished water sample collection did you observe an algal bloom in your source waters near the intake only responses to this question of yes no or don t know were considered hereafter these responses will be referred to as ucmr 4 qualitative responses some pwss did not respond while several pwss recorded multiple responses over the time period this resulted in 92 ucmr 4 qualitative responses for comparison to satellite imagery if the pws responded yes they were asked to specify when the algal bloom was observed available responses included the day the ucmr 4 cyanotoxin sample was collected between the day the sample was collected and the past week between the past week and the past month between the past month and the past 12 months and more than a year ago each pws was asked to select all that applied when pwss responded yes this study considered algal blooms observed between the day the cyanotoxin sample was collected and the past month in an effort to include as many ucmr 4 responses as possible including observations between the day the sample was collected and the past month can lead to limitations in the temporal matchup between ucmr 4 qualitative responses and satellite observations however this does not necessarily mean that satellite observations and ucmr 4 responses were one a month apart but sometime within the previous month lunetta et al 2015 found the best correspondence between satellite data and field observations of cyanobacterial abundance was within a 2 week window of the satellite overpass which is similar to the 4 week window used here for cyanobacterial presence and absence additionally it is not possible to confirm that ucmr 4 qualitative responses identified the presence of cyanobacterial blooms specifically rather than algal blooms more generally which could lead to false positive and false negative situations when compared to satellite derived cyanobacteria presence and absence despite potential temporal limitations these visual observation responses provided via ucmr 4 are ideal for satellite comparison given that the satellite signal in our spectral region of interest also only represents the water s surface while not a validation this comparison is useful for assessing satellite derived results against user perception within our target audience of pws managers after identifying the drinking water intake locations corresponding to each ucmr 4 qualitative response intake locations were subset to those identified as resolvable as described in section 2 2 a total of 22 intakes with ucmr 4 responses from march 2018 through november 2019 corresponded to a resolvable drinking water intake location representing 11 lakes across 6 states fig 1 low spatial coverage of ucmr 4 qualitative responses is the result of both sample design and sample reporting while all large surface water systems were required to sample cyanotoxins in finished water as part of ucmr 4 only 800 small systems were required to sample additionally not all pws submitted qualitative source water data as part of their ucmr 4 finished water cyanotoxin sampling drinking water intakes assigned to the systems sampled then needed to correspond to a lake observable with 300 m satellite imagery and fit the selection criteria described in section 2 3 spatial coverage of these locations will likely improve as all ucmr 4 data becomes available 2 4 comparing ucmr 4 qualitative responses to satellite observations satellite data were extracted for each ucmr 4 qualitative response location by taking the average ci cyano value of all valid pixels contained within a 900 m buffer of the drinking water intake as descried in section 2 2 each date associated with the ucmr 4 quantitative sampling was matched to the corresponding satellite weekly composite to assess the agreement between the two datasets two approaches were used first a presence absence agreement matrix was developed to compare on a class by class basis binary satellite data and binary ucmr 4 qualitative responses overall agreement was computed as the number of instances that generated the same response in both satellite data and ucmr 4 qualitative responses normalized to the total number of instances considered the kappa coefficient was computed to indicate how well the two datasets agreed compared to a random assignment of classes cohen 1960 goodman and kruskal 1954 kappa is a ratio between 1 and 1 where higher values indicate better agreement and was computed via the fmsb package in r version 4 0 0 nakazawa 2019 r core team 2020 next the non parametric mann whitney u test was used to assess if cyanobacterial abundance values for ucmr 4 qualitative responses of yes and no were generated from the same population mann and whitney 1947 wilcoxon 1945 a nonparametric approach is required here for several reasons the data are not normally distributed the sample size is relatively small and the satellite observations contain non detects cohen s d was then used to quantify the effect size cohen 1992 via the effsize package in r version 4 0 0 r core team 2020 torchiano 2020 where generally absolute values above 0 5 indicate a large difference between the two means 2 5 assessing bloom frequency at all resolvable drinking water sources to assess the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable source waters near each drinking water intake see fig 2 satellite observations were aggregated into annual detections temporal frequency was computed per pixel following coffer et al 2021 as the proportion of valid satellite pixels that indicate either a detection of cyanobacteria i e those above the detection limit of the sensor or non detection invalid pixels are those with quality flags and were not included in the bloom frequency computation eq 1 in other words bloom frequency is simply the cyanobacteria detected pixels divided by the total number of detect and non detect pixels excluding invalid quality flagged pixels this produces a percentage between 0 and 100 where 0 indicates no bloom was present at that pixel for the given year when satellite imagery was available and 100 indicates a bloom was always present at that pixel for the given year when satellite imagery was available at each drinking water source annual bloom frequency for the year 2019 represented the average bloom frequencies for all pixels contained within a 900 m buffer of each drinking water intake 1 bloom frequency 100 n of pixels with detectable ci cyano n of all valid pixels 2 6 quantifying effect size at all resolvable drinking water source waters to quantify effect size at all resolvable drinking water source waters a γ statistic was used which is conceptually equivalent to cohen s d and has been used for several environmental applications coffer and hestir 2019 henson et al 2010 urquhart et al 2017 in this study this statistic was used to determine the number of observations needed for a trend in the data to be sustained despite the residual variability in the data and can provide insight into how many years of data are needed to increase confidence in an observed change if γ is less than the time period of observations the magnitude of the trend exceeds the residual variability in the data to compute γ cyanobacterial abundance values were first extracted within the previously described 900 m buffer of each drinking water intake cyanobacterial abundance values for all pixels contained in or intersecting this buffer were averaged for each weekly composite satellite image weekly averages were assigned months based on the middle day of the week and monthly averages were computed for june 2016 through april 2020 these monthly averages were used to quantify γ at each intake and those with a γ of less than four years were considered for a trend analysis the γ statistic was computed following eq 2 as 2 γ 1 n y y 2 n 1 m where n is the sample size ŷ represents the residuals of y and m is the thiel sen slope the thiel sen slope determines the magnitude of the trend by computing the slope for all pairs of data and taking their median sen 1968 theil 1992 relatively short time series have been used in previous studies for trend detection kim et al 2007 assessed linear trends in air quality using three and five years of satellite data psilovikos et al 2006 analyzed trends in water quality using three years of field observations to assess short term trends at each drinking water source the nonparametric seasonal mann kendall test for trend and the associated thiel sen slope were computed the seasonal mann kendall test for trend is a variation of the mann kendall test for trend kendall 1955 mann 1945 checking for a monotonic increase or decrease across the time series the trend analysis was performed via the rkt package in r version 4 0 0 marchetto 2017 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 agreement between ucmr 4 qualitative responses and satellite observations of the 92 ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources corresponding to satellite imagery in responding to the question of whether there was an algal bloom preceding the sampling event 8 responded don t know 76 responded no and 8 responded yes those that responded yes indicated this algal bloom was present between the day of quantitative sampling and the past month 72 of the 76 ucmr 4 qualitative responses of no in drinking water sources corresponded to an absence of cyanobacteria in satellite imagery and 7 of the 8 ucmr 4 qualitative responses of yes in drinking water sources corresponded to a presence of cyanobacteria in satellite imagery table 1 thus there were five ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources that disagreed with satellite imagery one in which the ucmr 4 qualitative response in drinking water sources indicated a bloom was present while satellite imagery indicated a bloom was absent and four in which the ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources indicated a bloom was absent and satellite imagery indicated a bloom was present this corresponded to an overall agreement of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 70 in addition to cyanobacterial presence and absence the satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance was analyzed for each of the 92 ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources fig 3 for all ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources in which the observer did not know if an algal bloom was present satellite imagery indicated non detection of cyanobacteria when ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources indicated an algal bloom was not observed median cyanobacterial abundance corresponded to the detection limit of the satellite imagery when ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources indicated an algal bloom was observed median cyanobacterial abundance exceeded 1 200 000 cells ml results of the mann whitney u test and associated cohen s d indicate satellite estimated cyanobacterial abundance corresponding to ucmr 4 qualitative responses of yes and no are not derived from the same population u 82 n 84 cohen s d 4 14 this indicates that visual observations during ucmr 4 monitoring and satellite observations have strong agreement in assessing cyanobacterial occurrence at drinking water source waters 3 2 bloom frequency at drinking water sources for the year 2019 average annual bloom frequency was assessed at all 685 resolvable drinking water sources not just those corresponding to ucmr 4 qualitative responses for each weekly composite an average of 19 satellite pixels were considered within a 900 m buffer of each drinking water intake to compute average annual bloom frequency average bloom frequency in 2019 peaked at 100 meaning that for all valid satellite pixels the average of those closest to the intake always indicated a cyanobacterial bloom was present fig 4 a average bloom frequency reached 100 at source waters in morgan lake new mexico and grand lake ohio commonly referred to as grand lake st mary s throughout the entire year in 2019 despite relatively high average bloom frequency within 900 m at several intakes the majority of the distribution fell below the third quartile at 13 and the median was 2 outliers existed at source waters with an average frequency above 35 the four states with the maximum number of resolvable drinking water sources were selected to demonstrate cyanobacterial frequency in more detail fig 4b similar results can be generated for any boundary including states nations or ecoregions texas is located in the southern united states bordering mexico and the gulf of mexico texas s climate is characterized primarily as subtropical in its central and eastern portions and as arid desert in its western portions new york is located in the northeast united states sharing a border with canada and extending to the atlantic ocean new york s climate is characterized almost entirely as humid continental california is located along the pacific coast and the southern portion of the state also shares a border with mexico most of california is characterized as having a mediterranean climate but some southeastern portions of the state are characterized as desert and semi arid oklahoma is located just north of texas and its climate is primarily characterized as humid subtropical texas contains 130 resolvable intakes whose statewide average bloom frequency was 18 3 in 2019 exceeding the third quartile of all resolvable intakes for the same period of time three source waters had an average bloom frequency of 80 in 2019 while all others were below 70 new york contains 96 resolvable intakes which averaged the lowest statewide bloom frequency in 2019 of these four states at only 1 74 equivalent to the median of all resolvable source waters the resolvable source waters with the highest average bloom frequency in new york were below 20 california contains 75 resolvable intakes that exhibited a statewide average bloom frequency of 3 26 in 2019 two source waters had the highest average frequencies for this state with values of 50 over half of the resolvable source waters in california had an average bloom frequency of 0 for 2019 oklahoma contains 71 resolvable intakes that exhibited a statewide average bloom frequency of 4 63 in 2019 the source waters that exhibited the highest average bloom frequency had a value below 50 and many of the subsequently ranked source waters showed relatively high average bloom frequencies compared to new york and california 3 3 analysis of effect size at drinking water sources effect size was analyzed at all 685 resolvable drinking water sources as described in section 2 6 there were five source waters that were excluded due to low temporal coverage as they did not contain at least four observations for any given month in that time period this left 680 resolvable source waters to include in the analysis of effect size a trend analysis was first applied to average monthly frequencies but no source waters had an effect size indicative of a sustained change i e γ 4 years so this metric was not considered further instead a trend analysis was applied to average satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance values cells ml thus results presented here indicate changes in satellite derived cyanobacterial abundance estimates more data would be needed to identify changes in temporal frequency a time period of four years did not provide sufficient cyanobacterial abundance data to determine a sustained trend amid inherent variability in the data for nearly all resolvable source waters based on the observed variability a median temporal data collection period of just over a decade would be needed to assess trends given the same sampling frequency fig 5 the nature of the γ statistic requires a detectable slope in order for this statistic to be quantified and a relatively small slope will result in a very large γ thus a cutoff on γ of 50 years was selected for fig 5 to focus the analysis on more achievable monitoring time periods which resulted in a subset of 36 intakes being selected for computing the median γ statistic five source waters did exhibit an effect size indicative of a sustained trend from june 2016 through april 2020 γ 4 years but conclusions cannot be drawn regarding changes that may have occurred outside of this time period table 2 fig 6 source waters at morgan lake in new mexico nm increased in average cyanobacterial abundance by 60 per year from 2016 to 2020 and a γ of 3 years indicates that this increase represents a sustained trend source waters at lake overholser in oklahoma ok grand lake in ohio oh choke canyon reservoir in texas tx and lake eufaula ok decreased in cyanobacterial abundance from 2016 to 2020 lake overholser ok decreased by 30 per year and exhibited the lowest γ of the entire dataset requiring only 1 year of observations to draw a conclusion about the observed trend grand lake oh decreased in cyanobacterial abundance by only 10 per year but the γ statistic still supported a sustained trend requiring 3 years of data both choke canyon reservoir tx and lake eufaula ok decreased by 20 per year and required 3 years of observations for the trend to overcome residual variability in the data 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of satellite derived data with field observations this study serves as the first quantitative comparison between satellite remote sensing data and ucmr 4 qualitative responses providing an assessment of two independent approaches for assessing the presence of cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water sources agreement between ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources of algal presence and satellite derived cyanobacterial abundances increases confidence in both the accuracy of pws samplers visual interpretation of algal blooms and the use of satellite imagery for detecting cyanobacteria at surface source waters a kappa coefficient of 0 70 was found between the two datasets kappa coefficients between 0 60 and 0 79 are considered to have a moderate level of agreement mchugh 2012 while 79 responses agreed between the two datasets there were five disagreements however in the absence of field measured cyanobacterial abundance discrepancies between satellite estimated cyanobacterial presence and ucmr 4 qualitative responses cannot be reconciled with complete certainty in four cases ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources recorded no visual observation of an algal bloom but corresponding satellite measurements indicated cyanobacteria detections were present at these four cases at least one of the pixels extracted within a 900 m buffer of the intake had a non detect but other pixels within the 900 m buffer did have detects resulting in the aggregation of these pixels indicating cyanobacteria presence thus the discrepancy could partially be explained by spatial mismatches between the exact visual observations and the 900 m buffer additionally temporal offset between the two datasets could exist in one case ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources recorded a bloom but corresponding satellite measurements indicated non detect for this sample the ucmr 4 qualitative response in drinking water sources to the question preceding the finished water sample collection did you observe an algal bloom in your source waters near the intake was that an algal bloom was observed between the past week and past month a temporal offset could explain this discrepancy or a bloom could have been present below the detection limit of the satellite sensor additionally it is possible to have cyanobacteria with no detectable surface bloom particularly given that cyanobacteria can move horizontally and vertically throughout the water column within hours qi et al 2018 qin et al 2018 a surface bloom could have been present at the time of ucmr 4 data collection but not at the time of satellite overpass as it may have moved within the water column moreover the ability of the satellite to detect picocyanobacteria is still uncertain picocyanobacteria could have been observed during ucmr 4 data collection but not registered through the ci cyano algorithm śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 4 2 large scale assessments of cyanobacterial frequency at source waters monitoring and assessment of cyanobacterial blooms has not been routinely conducted in a nationally consistent manner with adequate spatial and temporal resolutions infrequent field monitoring has been conducted at the national level including the national lakes assessment nla occurring every five years in the united states blocksom et al 2016 regional field monitoring has also been conducted including across 142 chinese lakes and reservoirs over two multi year periods huang et al 2020 field monitoring can be both time and cost intensive while satellite observations offer the potential for increased temporal and spatial resolutions when lakes are of sufficient size and in the absence of cloud cover or snow and ice e g coffer et al 2020 2021 duan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 results presented here indicate that satellite imagery can be an important pre screening tool that drinking water quality managers may use for early detection of cyanobacteria in their drinking water sources cost effective and timely early detection of cyanobacteria in source waters can help inform critical treatment monitoring and management steps from pwss protecting drinking water quality from the risks posed by cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria and improving the quality of finished drinking water to ensure public health however field efforts such as the nla state and local efforts are still needed to validate satellite observations and measure toxins and other parameters not resolvable with satellite imagery particularly in areas not observable using satellite imagery such as the land water interface despite efforts to monitor cyanobacterial blooms across broad spatial and temporal scales monitoring specific to drinking water sources is not routinely collected at the national level in the united states clark et al 2017 used satellite imagery from meris spanning 2008 through 2011 to assess cyanobacterial bloom frequency at source waters in the states of florida and ohio the average cyanobacterial frequency for all resolvable source waters in florida was 30 and for ohio 5 using a different method to extract nearby satellite pixels at each intake and using a different satellite sensor clark et al 2017 found grand lake to have the highest temporal frequency for the state of ohio at 83 from 2008 through 2011 this study presents the first large scale assessment of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance at surface drinking water intakes across the united states national level assessments of cyanobacterial occurrence at drinking water sources have not been conducted through either field or satellite observations upon completion of data reporting ucmr 4 will serve as the first field based dataset of cyanobacteria in source waters across the united states while methods presented here can be used to monitor approximately 700 drinking water sources across 44 states with consistent temporal coverage in the absence of cloud contamination or snow and ice cover 4 3 assessing effect size of cyanobacterial abundance anderson et al 2002 indicated coastal systems in recent decades had increased in occurrence of toxic and otherwise harmful algal blooms but did not provide quantitative evidence of this change it was noted however that this increase could either reflect heightened scientific awareness or an actual increase in the number magnitude or frequency of blooms anderson 1989 a lack of historical data was cited as a limitation for quantifying long term change he et al 2016 also indicated the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater systems is increasing more recently huisman et al 2018 summarized projected increases in cyanobacterial occurrence due to eutrophication rising carbon dioxide levels and changing climatic conditions despite repeated suggestions that cyanobacterial blooms have or will increase few large scale trend analyses have been performed to support this claim using over 200 years of sediment cores from northern hemisphere lakes taranu et al 2015 suggested that cyanobacteria have increased substantially in almost 60 of lakes since the industrial revolution and that cyanobacteria have increased disproportionally compared to other phytoplankton using satellite imagery urquhart et al 2017 analyzed changes in the spatial extent of cyanobacterial blooms from 2008 through 2011 for large lakes in the states of california ohio and florida florida data indicated an increase in spatial extent of blooms but exhibited a γ of 4 1 over the 4 year time series suggesting the observed trend did not quite statistically outweigh residual variability in the data this study found that a median of over 10 years of observations was needed for observed changes to show a sustained trend outside of the residual variability in the data given current sampling frequency for reference the average satellite lifespan was 8 6 years in the 1990 s belward and skøien 2015 and the average water quality field campaign for chlorophyll monitoring lasts approximately 2 5 years belward and skøien 2015 also summarized satellite lifespans for more recent decades but these values were artificially reduced given that many of the sensors considered were at the beginning of their life cycles the average length of water quality field monitoring was found by averaging the difference between start years and end years for all water quality portal https www waterqualitydata us datasets with a characteristic name chlorophyll chlorophyll monitoring was used as a proxy for cyanobacteria monitoring as field measurements for cyanobacteria are often only available through state or local databases u s epa 2020 olci completed its fourth full year of data collection in june 2020 the operational lifespan of sentinel 3a is set to 7 years with consumables available for up to 12 years an identical sensor is housed on esa s sentinel 3b satellite platform launched in 2018 moving forward esa plans to ensure consistent long term coverage through the launch of sentinel 3c and sentinel 3d upon successful launch of all four satellites in the sentinel 3 satellite series mission continuity will then be expected for at least 25 years from the launch of sentinel 3a thus the sentinel 3 satellite constellation offers promise for providing sufficient temporal coverage for defensible quantitative drinking water source trend assessment schaeffer et al 2013 found that mission continuity is critical for end users findings here also highlight the importance of long term monitoring programs both satellite based and field campaigns in order to defend or refute statements regarding large scale changes in cyanobacterial frequency extent and abundance insufficient temporal coverage was a primary concern for this study with nearly all drinking water sources failing to achieve a γ less than the time period of observations additionally the median required time period of 10 04 years was based on an assumed sampling frequency and could be longer if the frequency of observations decreases compared to the reference 2016 through 2020 period used here this supports the need for continued consistent monitoring to better understand long term cyanobacterial bloom trends in drinking water sources the planned constellation of sentinel 3 satellites is expected to improve temporal coverage in the future despite the need for increased temporal coverage source waters at five intakes did exhibit a sustained trend from 2016 to 2020 but these trends cannot be extrapolated outside of this time period and are not indicative of ongoing changes morgan lake is located on the navajo nation in northwest new mexico this source water exhibited the highest possible bloom frequency and was the only source water considered to increase in abundance lake overholser is located in oklahoma city ok and decreased in cyanobacterial abundance from 2016 to 2020 grand lake in western ohio once ranked in the 99th percentile for microcystins in the united states u s epa 2009 while jacquemin et al 2018 found substantial improvements in water quality over the past decade they concluded that this lake s waters remained impaired choke canyon reservoir in southern texas provides drinking water for the city of corpus christi and lake eufaula oklahoma s largest lake provides drinking water to eufaula ok at both of these source waters changes were driven by much lower cyanobacterial abundance values in the last year of observations compared to the first three years temporal patterns at these sites resembled more of a step change rather than a continuous trend but insufficient information exists to determine a potential cause of the sudden decline in cyanobacterial abundances at all sites additional information would be needed to determine drivers of these changes given the short time period considered 4 4 limitations while this study offers the first large scale investigation of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance at drinking water sources across the united states there are several limitations that warrant consideration only drinking water intakes located in or near relatively large lakes were considered and pixels that fell along the shoreline were discarded meaning approximately 80 of all drinking water intakes were not studied when considering a subset of these drinking water intakes for matching with ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources coverage was even lower as ucmr 4 sampling was ongoing through the end of 2020 this study only considered ucmr 4 data reported up to april 2020 and represented a portion of data collected up to november 2019 the estimated pws locations are based on the best available locational data provided by the states in sdwis and are chosen to represent a pws for this national scale analysis in some cases this may cause discrepancies given the 100 m buffer used to assign a lake to each intake applying a similar analysis to finer resolution sensors such as sentinel 2 at 20 m multispectral resolution or landsat 8 at 30 m multispectral resolution could improve spatial coverage sentinel 2 has the potential for quantifying chlorophyll gilerson et al 2010 pahlevan et al 2020 and landsat has shown promise for bloom monitoring ho et al 2017 oyama et al 2015 but cyanobacteria specific algorithms have yet to be validated for large scale applications the meris sensor onboard esa s envisat can also be useful for retrospective analysis with imagery available from 2002 through 2012 a 900 m buffer was selected to characterize source waters at each drinking water intake this distance was chosen to include three 300 m satellite pixels surrounding each intake however these pixels do not perfectly capture the source waters influencing each drinking water intake to determine which 300 m pixels best characterize source waters at each drinking water intake information regarding the bathymetry depth of each intake and the drawdown rate would be required as well as hydrodynamic modeling specific to each system this information is unavailable across all 685 intakes and therefore it is impossible to properly identify which satellite pixels are contributing to drinking water at any given time thus a generalized buffer of 900 m was chosen for consistency across locations and time satellite observations of cyanobacterial frequency or abundance do not represent levels in finished drinking water when investigating cyanobacterial abundance near these intakes it is important to remember that this analysis focuses on source waters only the quality of finished drinking water is a reflection of treatment practices used by the pws in response to changes in intake water quality for example a 2016 report found 43 9 of source waters in ohio to exceed the u s epa health advisory level of 0 3 µg l total microcystins for children and vulnerable populations but only 1 16 of treated drinking water samples exceeded this threshold awwa 2016 demonstrating effective treatment practices for the intakes considered moreover satellite imagery can only detect cyanobacteria not the presence of cyanotoxins stumpf et al 2016a and it is possible for both a visible bloom to be present without cyanotoxins and cyanotoxins to be present without a visible bloom this issue is further complicated by the presence and the possibility of the growth and regrowth of cyanobacteria within the treatment utility potentially leading to toxin or taste and odor production even in the absence of a bloom in the source water almuhtaram et al 2018 greenstein et al 2020 several limitations exist in the acquisition of satellite imagery data gaps exist due to cloud cover sun glint contamination and the presence of snow and ice northern latitude regions are particularly affected by lower data coverage in the winter months coffer et al 2020 although during the cold season proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms is believed to be more limited ibelings et al 2021 however occasional blooms and in some cases cyanotoxins have been noted under ice bertilsson et al 2013 hampton et al 2017 üveges et al 2012 wejnerowski et al 2018 satellite images are acquired mid day and only characterize cyanobacteria at the time of image acquisition however cyanobacterial blooms can change throughout the day and from one day to another the weekly composites used here preserve the week s maximum ci cyano value in an effort to capture any cyanobacterial bloom that may have occurred but no information can be gathered or inferred outside the time of satellite image acquisition additionally difficulties can arise in performing short term trend analyses given limited observations satellites typically cannot detect benthic cyanobacteria except in the case of optically shallow water however benthic systems can contribute to contamination of drinking water sources gaget et al 2017 moreover drinking water intakes can be located at a water s surface or at depths of up to 30 to 40 m hoeger et al 2005 but the satellite signal only represents the top layer of the water column typically up to 2 m for red spectral bands in clear water mishra et al 2005 and less than 2 m in more turbid waters wynne et al 2010 this vertical offset can be important if using this information to inform drinking water management approaches a vertical offset is not accounted for here and is difficult to address given that some facilities have multiple intake depths to accommodate changes in water level and water quality u s epa 2016a 5 conclusions this study used satellite imagery to detect cyanobacteria at nearly 700 drinking water sources across the united states additionally agreement between a subset of 22 of these source waters and visual observations extracted from ucmr 4 qualitative responses indicating the presence or absence of a visible surface algal bloom was analyzed the following conclusions were reached a subset of ucmr 4 qualitative responses in drinking water sources spanning march 2018 through november 2019 and corresponding satellite derived cyanobacteria detect and non detect measurements achieved an overall agreement of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 70 across 84 observations this demonstrates the utility for use of satellite imagery as a complement to ground based measurements for assessing cyanobacterial occurrence at drinking water sources across all resolvable drinking water sources the majority of detectable cyanobacterial bloom frequencies for 2019 averaged less than 35 but several outliers existed at higher frequencies reaching a maximum value of 100 for source waters at two drinking water intakes nearly all source waters analyzed did not have sufficient data for a trend analysis as indicated by effect size statistics that were longer than the time period of observations instead a decade of observations would be needed on average for trends to outweigh residual variability in the data five source waters demonstrated a short term trend from june 2016 through april 2020 with source waters at one intake increasing in cyanobacterial abundance over this time period and source waters at four intakes decreasing in cyanobacterial abundance however conclusions are only valid within the observed time period and cannot be extrapolated to support long term trends at any source waters additional data are needed to determine drivers of these changes declaration of competing interest the

16896,conservation identities of farmers in the maumee river watershed derived from farmer surveys were embedded into a swat watershed model this was done to improve the representation of the heterogeneity among farmers in the decision making process related to the adoption of conservation practices modeled farm operations created with near field level hydrologic response units hrus within the swat model were assigned a modeled primary operator modeled primary operators held unique conservation identities driven by their spatial location within the watershed five pathways of targeting the adoption of subsurface placement of phosphorus and buffer strips to hrus within the watershed were assessed targeting pathways included targeting by hru level phosphorus losses conservation identity of model operators a hybrid approach combining hru level phosphorus losses and conservation identity of the model primary operator managing the hru and a proxy measure for random placement throughout the watershed targeting the placement of subsurface phosphorus application to all agricultural hrus resulted in the greatest reduction in total phosphorus losses 32 versus buffer strips 23 for both conservation practices targeting by hru level total phosphorus losses resulted in the most efficient rate of phosphorus reduction as measured by the ratio of phosphorus reduction to conservation practice adoption rates the hybrid targeting approach closely resembled targeting by phosphorus losses indicating near optimal results can be obtained even when constraining adoption by farmer characteristics these results indicate that by developing management strategies based on a combination of field level information and human operator characteristics a more efficient use of limited resources can be used while achieving near maximal environmental benefits as compared to managing environmental outcomes solely based on field level information graphical abstract image

rivers lakes and oceans across the world deknock et al 2019 this non point source pollution can result in numerous environmental challenges including harmful algal blooms habs paerl et al 2018 and

wolf and klaiber 2017 scavia et al 2017 to lessen the impact agriculture has on nutrient loading to the laurentian great lakes and in particular to lake erie which has been affected by habs of increasing severity since the early 2000s stumpf et al 2016 current policies primarily promote the voluntary adoption of conservation practices cps holland et al 2020 kerr et al 2016 this approach to watershed management ensures that human decision makers are instrumental in the adoption and utilization of cps to improve downstream water quality however research conducted on the watershed scale effectiveness of cps on reducing nutrient losses does not usually consider these human actors and their heterogeneous beliefs and attitudes towards conservation evenson et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 watershed models are a commonly used tool to assess the impact of agricultural management practices on nutrient runoff at larger scales than an individual agricultural field miller et al 2020 liu et al 2017 in the maumee river watershed mrw the largest lake erie watershed and the primary driver of habs in lake erie stumpf et al 2016 maccoux et al 2016 watershed models have evaluated the nutrient reduction benefits of individual and bundled practice cps martin et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 kalcic et al 2016 watershed models have been used to highlight how targeting cps to fields that contribute the greatest amount of nutrients to the watershed outlet can be effective in reducing the impact of agriculture on nutrient and sediment loading martin et al 2021 parajuli et al 2008 while this approach highlights variability in biophysical vulnerability it does not account for the presence of heterogeneous decision makers across agricultural landscapes targeting these hotspots or critical source areas in watershed models is generally a function of landscape characteristics such as slope and soil types with decisions about what and where to implement management practices determined by the modeling team martin et al 2021 xu et al 2019 scavia et al 2017 because landowners and farm operators who manage these hotspots are not equally likely to actually implement the necessary practices in the designated locations these models might over predict the impact of targeting strategies this limitation suggests that rather than targeting cps in watershed models solely based on the landscape characteristics modeling teams could target either 1 by decision maker characteristics such as their attitude towards cps age or gross income or 2 through a combination of landscape and decision maker characteristics to simulate more accurately the probable spatial adoption of cps in a watershed many factors influence agricultural producers beliefs attitudes and actions regarding their field level

farmers in the mrw regarding their land management include a farmer s age education experience farming and conservation identity burnett et al 2018 liu et al 2018 burton 2014 conservation identity is a strong indicator of a farmer s willingness to adopt cps in the present or in the future and has been found to be the most predictive characteristics of future adoption for numerous cps in the mrw burnett et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 farmers who hold greater conservation identities are more likely to adopt cps than farmers with lower conservation identities grounded in identity theory which indicates that person identities reflect individuals understanding of themselves as having particular traits and qualities mcguire et al 2013 conservation identity is a function of the good farmer identity rather than an understanding or perception of their individual role or a cp s role in limiting nutrient loss conservation identity aims to capture how farmers perceive and understand their own role as a farmer and what it means to be a good farmer because identities of farmers are not necessarily linked to the physical characteristics of the fields they manage targeting cp adoption to this farmer characteristic is a more realistic way of assigning cps than solely focusing on land characteristics the soil and water assessment tool swat a common watershed model used in agricultural settings generally ignores socio economic factors in its modeling framework cools et al 2011 integrated modeling frameworks that bridge socio economic factors and watershed models zomorodian et al

although integrated modeling allows socio economic characteristics to be accounted for in watershed models when using swat these models must be externally linked which leads to a series approach to model integration francesconi et al 2016 in this series approach socio economic models are first developed and results from these models are then used to drive inputs for scenario simulations in swat the goals of this work are to describe an approach to embed the characteristics of human operators into a calibrated swat model and evaluate the potential impact of incorporating characteristics of human actors in cp targeting simulations the three objectives of this work are 1 create modeled farm operations 2 assign conservation identities based on a farmer survey to decision makers of the modeled farm operations and 3 compare targeting cp placement based on a combination of field level phosphorus losses and human operator conservation identities to solely targeting by field level phosphorus losses 2 methods 2 1 study area the mrw fig 1 is the largest contributor of phosphorus to lake erie maccoux et al 2016 row crop agriculture dominates the watershed landscape with approximately 80 of the land use in row crop agriculture ohio epa 2010 2 2 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat revision 635 modified according to kalcic et al 2016 is a process based hydrological model that simulates hydrologic and nutrient fluxes within watersheds arnold et al 1998 swat has been used in watersheds across the world including within the great lakes basins martin et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 muenich et al 2016 within the mrw swat has been identified as the most appropriate watershed model among various watershed modeling frameworks gebremarium et al 2014 a recently developed and validated version of swat was used to simulate hydrology and nutrient dynamics within the mrw apostel et al 2021 kast et al 2021 this swat model was satisfactorily calibrated to nutrient and hydrology parameters between 2005 and 2015 at the usgs gauge 04193500 table 1 daily water quality and stream flow data used in calibration and validation were obtained from the national center for water quality research at heidelberg university ncwqr org although the model was calibrated and validated at the single gauge simulation results were compared to edge of field data of fields located upstream within the watershed these comparisons showed the model was able to capture the range of water quality results upstream of the watershed outlet apostel et al 2021 the swat model used in this study consists of 24 256 hydrologic response units hrus the smallest spatial discretization in the modeling framework the mean size of agricultural hrus 84 of hrus in the model is 70 9 ha 175 3 acres comparable to that of the average farm field size in ohio 72 4 ha indiana 106 8 ha and michigan 82 9 ha usda 2017 for further information of model development including near field scale hru delineation and model calibration and validation see apostel et al 2021 2 3 creating modeled farm operations and assigning conservation identities to modeled primary operators 2 3 1 modeled farm operations modeled farm operations mfos approximating farm boundaries of farming operations found within the watershed were created by aggregating agricultural hrus hrus included in each mfo were constrained by the county and model subbasin in which the hrus were located thus allowing non adjacent hrus to be included in a mfo each mfo included between one and five hrus depending on the size of the operation modeled farm operation sizes were stratified within each county according to the percentage of farms in the county between 1 and 179 acres 180 and 499 acres 500 and 999 acres and 1000 or more acres according to the 2017 agricultural census usda 2017 supplementary material table s1 2 3 2 assigning conservation identities to modeled primary operators each mfo was assigned a modeled primary operator mpo who represented the operation s decision maker on farm management practices a survey of farmers within the watershed was used to derive characteristics of farmers in the region burnett et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 conservation identity was measured through seven survey items each on a 5 point likert scale supplementary material table s5 respondents were asked to rate the importance of each item on their personal definition of a good farmer from 0 not at all important to 4 very important burnett et al 2018 mcguire et al 2015 arbuckle et al 2013 the average score given to the seven survey items by the respondent was calculated to be the respondent s conservation identity survey respondents conservation identities were grouped by zip code and aggregated to the county level the maximum mean median and standard deviation of conservation identities among survey respondents were calculated for each county county level distributions of conservation identities derived from this process were used to guide assignments of conservation identities to mpos the existing cp use on each mfo per county in the calibrated swat model was estimated included in this calculation was the use of a cover crop a grassed waterway incorporation of nutrients after application subsurface placement of nutrients and continuous no tillage on each hru within a mfo a standardized metric of cp adoption was created by dividing the number of cps present on a mfo by the number of hrus within the mfo after standardized metrics of cp adoption were calculated for each model farm operation model farm operations and their corresponding cp adoption metric value were segregated by county within each county mfos were ranked from the greatest standardized cp adoption metric to the least rankings of standardized cp adoption metrics among the mfos were used to assign conservation identities of mpos three levels of conservation identities weak moderate and high were assigned based on this standardized cp adoption metric and county level results of conservation identities from the farmer survey supplementary material tables s2 s4 the qualitative descriptors for the three levels of conservation identities were derived from burnett et al 2018 to translate these qualitative categorizations into quantitative values it was assumed that measured values were equally distributed within each level and constrained by the possible ranges of conservation identities from the farmer survey weak conservation identities were assigned a random value between 0 00 and 1 33 moderate conservation identities were assigned a random value between 1 34 and 2 66 high conservation identities were assigned a value between 2 67 and 4 00 this was completed to link equivalent results of the farmer survey directly to the farmer conservation identities applied to mfos i e a mfo with an operator holding a conservation identity of 2 5 would be equivalent to a farmer respondent with a conservation identity score of 2 5 2 4 targeting cps to fields five alternative targeting approaches were used to apportion two separate cps 1 subsurface placement of inorganic phosphorus fertilizer subsurface p and 2 buffer strips throughout the watershed table 2 and fig 2 in each scenario subsurface placement of inorganic phosphorus fertilizer was simulated by placing 99 of the fertilizer mass below the top 1 cm of soil buffer strips were sized at 2 of the field drainage area with 50 being concentrated flow and 25 being fully channelized the first targeting approach selected hrus estimated to have the greatest total phosphorus tp loading rates in the baseline calibrated swat model sometimes referred to as critical source areas evenson et al 2021 supplementary material fig s1 the second targeting approach selected hrus with the least tp loading rates in these two approaches agricultural hrus were rank ordered from largest to smallest tp discharge rates supplementary material fig s2 rank orders with ties were used when two or more hrus had similar tp discharge rates the third targeting approach selected hrus in mfos with mpos that were estimated to have the greatest conservation identities supplementary material fig s3 for this targeting approach conservation identities of mpos were rank ordered from largest to smallest rank orders with ties were used when two or more hrus managed by mpos had similar conservation identities the fourth targeting approach selected hrus with the greatest tp loading rates that were managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities supplementary material fig s4 for this targeting approach each hru rank order from the first and third targeting approaches were summed eleven scenarios that represented increasing adoption rates for each cp were run for each of these targeting approaches cp adoption ranged from the baseline calibrated model adoption rate to 100 adoption on agricultural hrus supplementary material table s6 a one to one line was created for each cp from the adoption endpoints baseline adoption and 100 adoption this one to one line was regarded as a proxy measure of randomly selecting hrus to receive the cp a fifth targeting approach unlike the previous four targeting approaches this scenario assumes that results would lie on the one to one line between the baseline adoption and 100 adoption scenarios and was not run directly in the swat model this proxy measure represented the average results of thousands of simulations in which different sets of hrus were randomly selected to receive the cp and was created in place of simulating a random assignment pathway 3 results 3 1 modeled farm operations and modeled primary operator conservation identities across the watershed 17 297 mfos were created from the 24 256 hrus in the swat model supplementary material tables s1 and s4 putnam county ohio had the largest number of mfos while whitley county indiana had the smallest table 3 the percentage of mfos smaller than 180 acres and greater than 1000 acres varied by county with williams county ohio having the largest number of mfos less than 180 acres and van wert county ohio having the greatest number of mfos larger than 1000 acres supplementary material table s1 modeled primary operators in lucas county ohio had the highest average conservation identity while mpos in henry county ohio had the lowest average conservation identity supplementary material table s3 based on the conservation identity categorization presented in section 2 3 a majority of the mpos across the watershed were assigned a strong conservation identity 77 8 while 21 0 and 1 2 of mpos were assigned moderate and weak conservation identities respectively supplementary material table s2 3 2 targeting the adoption of subsurface phosphorus applications and buffer strips increasing the adoption of subsurface p to 100 of agricultural hrus from its adoption rate in the calibrated baseline 8 7 led to a 31 reduction in march july tp loads and a 48 reduction in march july dissolved reactive phosphorus drp loads fig 3 increasing the adoption of buffer strips to 100 of agricultural hrus from its adoption rate in the calibrated baseline 31 led to a 23 reduction in march july tp loads and a 19 reduction in march july drp loads fig 4 targeting the adoption of both cps to the hrus with the greatest tp loading rates resulted in the highest efficiency phosphorus reduction rate of cp adoption in achieving phosphorus reductions as expected the lowest phosphorus reduction efficiencies were obtained when targeting the adoption of the cps to the hrus with the least tp loading rates targeting both cps to the hrus with the greatest mpo conservation identities resulted in similar phosphorus reduction efficiencies as randomly selecting hrus to receive the cps targeting both cps by combining consideration of hrus with large phosphorus losses and mpos with high conservation identities resulted in the second highest efficiency in achieving phosphorus reductions figs 3 and 4 the two most efficient approaches produced the greatest gains in tp and drp load reduction from the initial increases from baseline adoption in effect for the scenario targeting cps based on high runoff potential each 1 increase in adoption of subsurface p from the baseline 8 7 to 18 5 adoption levels resulted in a decrease of tp loads by 1 when conservation identities were considered alongside high runoff potential each 1 increase in adoption of subsurface p decreased tp loads by 0 77 as adoption rose from 8 7 to 18 2 of agricultural land area this was expected because initially these practices were applied to fields with the greatest losses and thus where they would realize the greatest reductions similar trends were observed for drp reductions for subsurface p and for both tp and drp reductions for buffer strips although the magnitudes of the decreasing phosphorus loading rates differed figs 3 and 4 3 3 impacts of watershed scale cp adoption efficacy in reducing phosphorus losses 3 3 1 targeting adoption to hrus with the greatest total phosphorus loading rates compared to other simulated targeting pathways since adoption rates of 54 5 for subsurface p and 65 5 of buffer strips respectively resulted in the greatest difference in phosphorus reductions between targeting pathways this adoption level was used to compare differences due to targeting options figs 3 and 4 targeting by the least phosphorus loading rates as compared to targeting by the greatest phosphorus loading rates resulted in approximately between 10 and 20 more tp and drp discharged from the watershed targeting by the greatest phosphorus loading rates hrus managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities resulted in approximately between 0 5 and 1 5 more tp and drp discharged from the watershed as compared to targeting by the greatest phosphorus loading rate hrus fig 5 3 3 2 targeting adoption to hrus with high total phosphorus loading rates and to high total phosphorus loading rate hrus managed by modeled primary operators with high conservation identities compared to simulated targeting pathways the adoption rate of subsurface p across the watershed with the largest difference in phosphorus reduction between targeting hrus with the greatest tp losses to those with the greatest tp losses managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities 28 adoption of subsurface p resulted in tp and drp losses differing by 2 7 and 1 9 respectively fig 6 the adoption rate of buffer strips across the watershed with the largest difference in phosphorus reduction between targeting hrus with the greatest tp losses to those with the greatest tp losses managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities 48 adoption of buffer strips resulted in tp and drp losses differing by 2 8 and 1 5 respectively fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 integrating farmer actors in watershed modeling of agricultural systems developing mpos using results from stakeholder surveys and directly embedding them into a watershed model is a novel approach for integrated modeling analyses in particular the approach developed and used in this study is unique for evaluating the efficacy of cp adoption in agriculturally dominated watersheds this approach allowed for representing over 17 000 unique mpos this large number of unique actors or decision makers contrasts with the limited number of actors represented in agent based models abms that have been integrated with watershed models ng et al 2011 integrated an abm with a swat model of the salt creek watershed in central illinois however only 50 farmers were represented in the abm due to the long computational time needed to run the model in ohio s sandusky watershed daloğlu et al 2014 grouped the farmer agents into four farmer types that drove parameters influencing their adoption decisions in the abm although this work developed methods to allow for a large number of unique actors a limitation is that these actors could not interact or learn from one another a benefit common to abms of socio ecological systems lippe et al 2019 daloğlu et al 2014 ng et al 2011 while an abm has not been integrated with a model of the mrw prior research has coupled economic and farmer behavioral attitudes with watershed models liu et al 2020 focused on coupling a behavioral economic model with a swat model of the mrw to assess how increases in cost share payments for cp adoption and fertilizer taxes would affect nutrient losses within the watershed by way of increasing cp adoption martin et al 2021 ran scenarios in swat models of the mrw guided by results from a survey of farmers in the watershed wilson et al 2018 integrated results from a farmer survey taken within the mrw to a swat model of the mrw to assess how changes in farmer efficacies regarding cover crops and subsurface placement of nutrients reduce phosphorus discharge at various adoption levels of filter strips this work improves upon these prior efforts in the mrw to develop a watershed model that includes socio behavioral information of farmers in the watershed while also providing a basis to further simulate how socio behavioral characteristics of farmers in the watershed can affect cp adoption and resulting changes in nutrient discharges through the addition of mfos and mpos 4 2 adoption rates of subsurface p and buffer strips and phosphorus discharges increasing the adoption of subsurface p to 100 resulted in 1 3 times and 2 1 times greater tp and drp reductions from the watershed than by increasing the adoption of buffer strips across the watershed to 100 comparing drp and tp at 100 adoption of subsurface p drp loss reductions were 1 5 times greater than tp loss reduction in contrast drp loss reduction were 1 2 times less than tp loss reduction at 100 adoption of buffer strip indicating that buffer strips are more effective at reducing tp losses than drp losses this result agrees with roberts et al 2012 which found that buffer strips affected tp losses more than drp losses in a variety of locations within the mrw numerous watershed modeling studies have found that placing fertilizer nutrients in the subsurface is the most effective single in field or edge of field practice in reducing nutrient runoff from the watershed at 100 adoption rates martin et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 results from this study confirm this result and show that across a spectrum of adoption rates subsurface placement of p is more effective at reducing phosphorus discharge than buffer strips although subsurface placement of p was the more effective practice at reducing phosphorus discharge from the watershed buffer strips provide additional environmental benefits that may be of interest to landowners and operators these additional benefits include reducing soil erosion providing greater soil moisture contents and stabilizing ditch and river channels cole et al 2020 kavian et al 2018 borin et al 2010 4 3 effectiveness of targeting cp adoption pathways as expected targeting subsurface p and buffer strips to hrus with the greatest tp loading rates resulted in greater decreases in tp and drp discharges from the watershed than randomly applying the cps across the watershed martin et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 and was the most efficient pathway in reducing nutrient losses although this pathway was the most efficient pathway in reducing tp and drp across the watershed limitations such as a lack of knowledge of the locations of these highest p loss fields in the environment affect the practicality of this approach to watershed management targeting the adoption of cps to hrus managed by mpos with high conservation identities and through random selection had similar phosphorus reduction efficiencies one explanation for these similar phosphorus reduction efficiencies is the little relation between farmers conservation identity and runoff from their fields although farmers psychological characteristics related to their identity as a farmer affects the practices used on their farms burnett et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 they cannot greatly influence the physical features of their landscape e g slope or soil type although these two targeting methods showed similar effectiveness in reducing tp and drp losses targeting by conservation identity resulted in slightly more advantageous outcomes this may be due to model development the linking of conservation identities to model farm operations and the systematic selection of hrus with greater amounts of cps present through the targeting method than through the random adoption process 4 4 designing cp adoption programs to improve water quality although targeting the adoption of cps across the watershed by the tp losses from individual fields hrus resulted in the most efficient pathway of reducing tp and drp losses economic social and political challenges exist in prioritizing these fields to receive cps one challenge in targeting cps to these high phosphorus loss fields is identifying their locations although a variety of factors affect phosphorus runoff from agricultural fields such as fertilizer application methods and precipitation endale et al 2019 hanrahan et al 2019 field level characteristics are important in governing nutrient flow dynamics for example fields with high soil test phosphorus values have been found to contribute more phosphorus downstream than fields with low soil test phosphorus values duncan et al 2017 indicating they are potential critical source areas of nutrient losses this field level data is generally proprietary information which can lead to a lack of publicly available knowledge of where these high soil test phosphorus fields are in the landscape because federal cp adoption programs are generally designed on a first come first serve basis talberth et al 2015 farmers with fields with the greatest risk of phosphorus loss may not have the chance or may decide to not enroll in a program economic and social psychological factors contribute to a farmer s willingness to participate in voluntary cp adoption programs yeboah et al 2015 reimer and prokopy 2014 these factors also contribute to the willingness of farmers within the mrw to adopt various cps to reduce phosphorus discharged to lake erie in this setting farmers with higher conservation identities are more likely to adopt various cps burnett et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 thus within the mrw tp and drp loss reductions due to increasing cp adoption rates likely more closely resemble tp and drp reduction pathways as indicated when targeting by mpo conservation identities than the most efficient pathway of targeting by high p loss hrus in the future figs 3 and 4 this likely implies that in agriculturally dominated watersheds more efficient nutrient reduction pathways exist as the amount of phosphorus a field discharges is not the sole factor in a farmer determining whether to adopt a cp to reduce the nutrient discharge however if cp adoption programs whether at the federal state or local level focus on recruiting farmers that have high phosphorus loss fields and who have a strong or high conservation identities similar efficiencies in nutrient reductions can be achieved as by targeting cps only to the greatest phosphorus loss fields figs 3 and 4 an example of this approach to watershed management at the federal level is the western lake erie basin initiative of the united states department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service usda nrcs through this initiative the usda nrcs screens applicants for funding through nrcs environmental quality incentives program eqip with the applicants whose land is fully within the watershed and is vulnerable to nutrient discharge i e higher soil test phosphorus values being given higher ranking for funding nrcs 2016a 2016b 4 5 future work although conservation identity has been shown to be a strong predictor of future cp adoption burnett et al 2018 other socio psychological demographic and economic conditions have been found to affect conservation decisions made by farmers prokopy et al 2019 liu et al 2018 using farmer surveys of the mrw demographic factors such as age and gender and socio psychological factors such as perceived conservation practice effectiveness at reducing nutrient losses can be linked with mpo conservation identities at the county level to add further heterogeneity with these more complete mpos an agent based model can be developed to allow these heterogeneous mpos to interact and learn from each other further economic analyses on the cost effectiveness of programs aimed to capture cp adoption trends presented in the targeting pathways can be completed these economic analyses will provide policy insight for cp adoption programs that are most cost effective in terms of their ability to reduce phosphorus losses from a watershed 5 conclusion with limited financial resources it is critical to develop programs that distribute support for cp adoption in ways that generate greater returns in terms of improved water quality agricultural cp programs that recruit farmers using dual criteria targeting the highest phosphorus loading fields as well as those who are most willing to participate in cp programs can nearly achieve the same phosphorus discharge reduction as programs that focus primarily on placing cps on fields with the greatest phosphorus loss an approach that accounts for behavioral factors in responses to program incentives is likely much more realistic than believing that all farmers are equally likely to implement conservation practices on their fields in the mrw as in other watersheds locations of these high phosphorus discharge fields or high conservation identity farmers are not always known however effective outreach and programming can counteract this gap in knowledge by focusing on farmers who manage fields with higher soil phosphorus values and who hold favorable dispositions towards adopting cps this approach is particularly important in efficiently achieving downstream water quality improvement in schemes that rely on the voluntary adoption of cps as is the case in the mrw and throughout much of the world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16896,conservation identities of farmers in the maumee river watershed derived from farmer surveys were embedded into a swat watershed model this was done to improve the representation of the heterogeneity among farmers in the decision making process related to the adoption of conservation practices modeled farm operations created with near field level hydrologic response units hrus within the swat model were assigned a modeled primary operator modeled primary operators held unique conservation identities driven by their spatial location within the watershed five pathways of targeting the adoption of subsurface placement of phosphorus and buffer strips to hrus within the watershed were assessed targeting pathways included targeting by hru level phosphorus losses conservation identity of model operators a hybrid approach combining hru level phosphorus losses and conservation identity of the model primary operator managing the hru and a proxy measure for random placement throughout the watershed targeting the placement of subsurface phosphorus application to all agricultural hrus resulted in the greatest reduction in total phosphorus losses 32 versus buffer strips 23 for both conservation practices targeting by hru level total phosphorus losses resulted in the most efficient rate of phosphorus reduction as measured by the ratio of phosphorus reduction to conservation practice adoption rates the hybrid targeting approach closely resembled targeting by phosphorus losses indicating near optimal results can be obtained even when constraining adoption by farmer characteristics these results indicate that by developing management strategies based on a combination of field level information and human operator characteristics a more efficient use of limited resources can be used while achieving near maximal environmental benefits as compared to managing environmental outcomes solely based on field level information graphical abstract image

increasing severity since the early 2000s stumpf et al 2016 current policies primarily promote the voluntary adoption of conservation practices cps holland et al 2020 kerr et al 2016 this approach to watershed management ensures that human decision makers are instrumental in the adoption and utilization of cps to improve downstream water quality however research conducted on the watershed scale effectiveness of cps on reducing nutrient losses does not usually consider these human actors and their heterogeneous beliefs and attitudes towards conservation evenson et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 watershed models are a commonly used tool to assess the impact of agricultural management practices on nutrient runoff at larger scales than an individual agricultural field miller et al 2020 liu et

reduction benefits of individual and bundled practice cps martin et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 kalcic et al 2016 watershed models have been used to highlight how targeting cps to fields that contribute the greatest amount of nutrients to the watershed outlet can be effective in reducing the impact of agriculture on nutrient and sediment loading martin et al 2021 parajuli et al 2008 while this approach highlights variability in biophysical vulnerability it does not account for the presence of heterogeneous decision makers across agricultural landscapes targeting these hotspots or critical source areas in watershed models is generally a function of landscape characteristics such as slope and soil types with decisions about what and where to implement management practices determined by the modeling team martin et al 2021 xu et al 2019 scavia et al 2017 because landowners and farm operators who manage these hotspots are not equally likely to actually implement the necessary practices in the designated locations these models might over predict the impact of targeting strategies this limitation suggests that rather than targeting cps in watershed models solely based on the landscape characteristics modeling teams could target either 1 by decision maker characteristics such as their attitude towards cps age or gross income or 2 through a combination of landscape and decision maker characteristics to simulate more accurately the probable spatial adoption of cps in a watershed many factors influence agricultural producers beliefs attitudes and actions regarding their field level

indicates that person identities reflect individuals understanding of themselves as having particular traits and qualities mcguire et al 2013 conservation identity is a function of the good farmer identity rather than an understanding or perception of their individual role or a cp s role in limiting nutrient loss conservation identity aims to capture how farmers perceive and understand their own role as a farmer and what it means to be a good farmer because identities of farmers are not necessarily linked to the physical characteristics of the fields they manage targeting cp adoption to this farmer characteristic is a more realistic way of assigning cps than solely focusing on land characteristics the soil and water assessment tool swat a common watershed model used in agricultural

more acres according to the 2017 agricultural census usda 2017 supplementary material table s1 2 3 2 assigning conservation identities to modeled primary operators each mfo was assigned a modeled primary operator mpo who represented the operation s decision maker on farm management practices a survey of farmers within the watershed was used to derive characteristics of farmers in the region burnett et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 conservation identity was measured through seven survey items each on a 5 point likert scale supplementary material table s5 respondents were asked to rate the importance of each item on their personal definition of a good farmer from 0 not at all important to 4 very important burnett et al 2018 mcguire et al 2015 arbuckle et al 2013 the average score given to the seven survey items by the respondent was calculated to be the respondent s conservation identity survey respondents conservation identities were grouped by zip code and aggregated to the county level the maximum mean median and standard deviation of conservation identities among survey respondents were calculated for each county county level distributions of conservation identities derived from this process were used to guide assignments of conservation identities to mpos the existing cp use on each mfo per county in the calibrated swat model was estimated included in this calculation was the use of a cover crop a grassed waterway incorporation of nutrients after application subsurface placement of nutrients and continuous no tillage on each hru within a mfo a standardized metric of cp adoption was created by dividing the number of cps present on a mfo by the number of hrus within the mfo after standardized metrics of cp adoption were calculated for each model farm operation model farm operations and their corresponding cp adoption metric value were segregated by county within each county mfos were ranked from the greatest standardized cp adoption metric to the least rankings of standardized cp adoption metrics among the mfos were used to assign conservation identities of mpos three levels of conservation identities weak moderate and high were assigned based on this standardized cp adoption metric and county level results of conservation identities from the farmer survey supplementary material tables s2 s4 the qualitative descriptors for the three levels of conservation identities were derived from burnett et al 2018 to translate these qualitative categorizations into quantitative values it was assumed that measured values were equally distributed within each level and constrained by the possible ranges of conservation identities from the farmer survey weak conservation identities were assigned a random value between 0 00 and 1 33 moderate conservation identities were assigned a random value between 1 34 and 2 66 high conservation identities were assigned a value between 2 67 and 4 00 this was completed to link equivalent results of the farmer survey directly to the farmer conservation identities applied to mfos i e a mfo with an operator holding a conservation identity of 2 5 would be equivalent to a farmer respondent with a conservation identity score of 2 5 2 4 targeting cps to fields five alternative targeting approaches were used to apportion two separate cps 1 subsurface placement of inorganic phosphorus fertilizer subsurface p and 2 buffer strips throughout the watershed table 2 and fig 2 in each scenario subsurface placement of inorganic phosphorus fertilizer was simulated by placing 99 of the fertilizer mass below the top 1 cm of soil buffer strips were sized at 2 of the field drainage area with 50 being concentrated flow and 25 being fully channelized the first targeting approach selected hrus estimated to have the greatest total phosphorus tp loading rates in the baseline calibrated swat model sometimes referred to as critical source areas evenson et al 2021 supplementary material fig s1 the second targeting approach selected hrus with the least tp loading rates in these two approaches agricultural hrus were rank ordered from largest to smallest tp discharge rates supplementary material fig s2 rank orders with ties were used when two or more hrus had similar tp discharge rates the third targeting approach selected hrus in mfos with mpos that were estimated to have the greatest conservation identities supplementary material fig s3 for this targeting approach conservation identities of mpos were rank ordered from largest to smallest rank orders with ties were used when two or more hrus managed by mpos had similar conservation identities the fourth targeting approach selected hrus with the greatest tp loading rates that were managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities supplementary material fig s4 for this targeting approach each hru rank order from the first and third targeting approaches were summed eleven scenarios that represented increasing adoption rates for each cp were run for each of these targeting approaches cp adoption ranged from the baseline calibrated model adoption rate to 100 adoption on agricultural hrus supplementary material table s6 a one to one line was created for each cp from the adoption endpoints baseline adoption and 100 adoption this one to one line was regarded as a proxy measure of randomly selecting hrus to receive the cp a fifth targeting approach unlike the previous four targeting approaches this scenario assumes that results would lie on the one to one line between the baseline adoption and 100 adoption scenarios and was not run directly in the swat model this proxy measure represented the average results of thousands of simulations in which different sets of hrus were randomly selected to receive the cp and was created in place of simulating a random assignment pathway 3 results 3 1 modeled farm operations and modeled primary operator conservation identities across the watershed 17 297 mfos were created from the 24 256 hrus in the swat model supplementary material tables s1 and s4 putnam county ohio had the largest number of mfos while whitley county indiana had the smallest table 3 the percentage of mfos smaller than 180 acres and greater than 1000 acres varied by county with williams county ohio having the largest number of mfos less than 180 acres and van wert county ohio having the greatest number of mfos larger than 1000 acres supplementary material table s1 modeled primary operators in lucas county ohio had the highest average conservation identity while mpos in henry county ohio had the lowest average conservation identity supplementary material table s3 based on the conservation identity categorization presented in section 2 3 a majority of the mpos across the watershed were assigned a strong conservation identity 77 8 while 21 0 and 1 2 of mpos were assigned moderate and weak conservation identities respectively supplementary material table s2 3 2 targeting the adoption of subsurface phosphorus applications and buffer strips increasing the adoption of subsurface p to 100 of agricultural hrus from its adoption rate in the calibrated baseline 8 7 led to a 31 reduction in march july tp loads and a 48 reduction in march july dissolved reactive phosphorus drp loads fig 3 increasing the adoption of buffer strips to 100 of agricultural hrus from its adoption rate in the calibrated baseline 31 led to a 23 reduction in march july tp loads and a 19 reduction in march july drp loads fig 4 targeting the adoption of both cps to the hrus with the greatest tp loading rates resulted in the highest efficiency phosphorus reduction rate of cp adoption in achieving phosphorus reductions as expected the lowest phosphorus reduction efficiencies were obtained when targeting the adoption of the cps to the hrus with the least tp loading rates targeting both cps to the hrus with the greatest mpo conservation identities resulted in similar phosphorus reduction efficiencies as randomly selecting hrus to receive the cps targeting both cps by combining consideration of hrus with large phosphorus losses and mpos with high conservation identities resulted in the second highest efficiency in achieving phosphorus reductions figs 3 and 4 the two most efficient approaches produced the greatest gains in tp and drp load reduction from the initial increases from baseline adoption in effect for the scenario targeting cps based on high runoff potential each 1 increase in adoption of subsurface p from the baseline 8 7 to 18 5 adoption levels resulted in a decrease of tp loads by 1 when conservation identities were considered alongside high runoff potential each 1 increase in adoption of subsurface p decreased tp loads by 0 77 as adoption rose from 8 7 to 18 2 of agricultural land area this was expected because initially these practices were applied to fields with the greatest losses and thus where they would realize the greatest reductions similar trends were observed for drp reductions for subsurface p and for both tp and drp reductions for buffer strips although the magnitudes of the decreasing phosphorus loading rates differed figs 3 and 4 3 3 impacts of watershed scale cp adoption efficacy in reducing phosphorus losses 3 3 1 targeting adoption to hrus with the greatest total phosphorus loading rates compared to other simulated targeting pathways since adoption rates of 54 5 for subsurface p and 65 5 of buffer strips respectively resulted in the greatest difference in phosphorus reductions between targeting pathways this adoption level was used to compare differences due to targeting options figs 3 and 4 targeting by the least phosphorus loading rates as compared to targeting by the greatest phosphorus loading rates resulted in approximately between 10 and 20 more tp and drp discharged from the watershed targeting by the greatest phosphorus loading rates hrus managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities resulted in approximately between 0 5 and 1 5 more tp and drp discharged from the watershed as compared to targeting by the greatest phosphorus loading rate hrus fig 5 3 3 2 targeting adoption to hrus with high total phosphorus loading rates and to high total phosphorus loading rate hrus managed by modeled primary operators with high conservation identities compared to simulated targeting pathways the adoption rate of subsurface p across the watershed with the largest difference in phosphorus reduction between targeting hrus with the greatest tp losses to those with the greatest tp losses managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities 28 adoption of subsurface p resulted in tp and drp losses differing by 2 7 and 1 9 respectively fig 6 the adoption rate of buffer strips across the watershed with the largest difference in phosphorus reduction between targeting hrus with the greatest tp losses to those with the greatest tp losses managed by mpos with the greatest conservation identities 48 adoption of buffer strips resulted in tp and drp losses differing by 2 8 and 1 5 respectively fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 integrating farmer actors in watershed modeling of agricultural systems developing mpos using results from stakeholder surveys and directly embedding them into a watershed model is a novel approach for integrated modeling analyses in particular the approach developed and used in this study is unique for evaluating the efficacy of cp adoption in agriculturally dominated watersheds this approach allowed for representing over 17 000 unique mpos this large number of unique actors or decision makers contrasts with the limited number of actors represented in agent based models abms that have been integrated with watershed models ng et al 2011 integrated an abm with a swat model of the salt creek watershed in central illinois however only 50 farmers were represented in the abm due to the long computational time needed to run the model in ohio s sandusky watershed daloğlu et al 2014 grouped the farmer agents into four farmer types that drove parameters influencing their adoption decisions in the abm although this work developed methods to allow for a large number of unique actors a limitation is that these actors could not interact or learn from one another a benefit common to abms of socio ecological systems lippe et al 2019 daloğlu et al 2014 ng et al 2011 while an abm has not been integrated with a model of the mrw prior research has coupled economic and farmer behavioral attitudes with watershed models liu et al 2020 focused on coupling a behavioral economic model with a swat model of the mrw to assess how increases in cost share payments for cp adoption and fertilizer taxes would affect nutrient losses within the watershed by way of increasing cp adoption martin et al 2021 ran scenarios in swat models of the mrw guided by results from a survey of farmers in the watershed wilson et al 2018 integrated results from a farmer survey taken within the mrw to a swat model of the mrw to assess how changes in farmer efficacies regarding cover crops and subsurface placement of nutrients reduce phosphorus discharge at various adoption levels of filter strips this work improves upon these prior efforts in the mrw to develop a watershed model that includes socio behavioral information of farmers in the watershed while also providing a basis to further simulate how socio behavioral characteristics of farmers in the watershed can affect cp adoption and resulting changes in nutrient discharges through the addition of mfos and mpos 4 2 adoption rates of subsurface p and buffer strips and phosphorus discharges increasing the adoption of subsurface p to 100 resulted in 1 3 times and 2 1 times greater tp and drp reductions from the watershed than by increasing the adoption of buffer strips across the watershed to 100 comparing drp and tp at 100 adoption of subsurface p drp loss reductions were 1 5 times greater than tp loss reduction in contrast drp loss reduction were 1 2 times less than tp loss reduction at 100 adoption of buffer strip indicating that buffer strips are more effective at reducing tp losses than drp losses this result agrees with roberts et al 2012 which found that buffer strips affected tp losses more than drp losses in a variety of locations within the mrw numerous watershed modeling studies have found that placing fertilizer nutrients in the subsurface is the most effective single in field or edge of field practice in reducing nutrient runoff from the watershed at 100 adoption rates martin et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 results from this study confirm this result and show that across a spectrum of adoption rates subsurface placement of p is more effective at reducing phosphorus discharge than buffer strips although subsurface placement of p was the more effective practice at reducing phosphorus discharge from the watershed buffer strips provide additional environmental benefits that may be of interest to landowners and operators these additional benefits include reducing soil erosion providing greater soil moisture contents and stabilizing ditch and river channels cole et al 2020 kavian et al 2018 borin et al 2010 4 3 effectiveness of targeting cp adoption pathways as expected targeting subsurface p and buffer strips to hrus with the greatest tp loading rates resulted in greater decreases in tp and drp discharges from the watershed than randomly applying the cps across the watershed martin et al 2021 scavia et al 2017 and was the most efficient pathway in reducing nutrient losses although this pathway was the most efficient pathway in reducing tp and drp across the watershed limitations such as a lack of knowledge of the locations of these highest p loss fields in the environment affect the practicality of this approach to watershed management targeting the adoption of cps to hrus managed by mpos with high conservation identities and through random selection had similar phosphorus reduction efficiencies one explanation for these similar phosphorus reduction efficiencies is the little relation between farmers conservation identity and runoff from their fields although farmers psychological characteristics related to their identity as a farmer affects the practices used on their farms burnett et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 they cannot greatly influence the physical features of their landscape e g slope or soil type although these two targeting methods showed similar effectiveness in reducing tp and drp losses targeting by conservation identity resulted in slightly more advantageous outcomes this may be due to model development the linking of conservation identities to model farm operations and the systematic selection of hrus with greater amounts of cps present through the targeting method than through the random adoption process 4 4 designing cp adoption programs to improve water quality although targeting the adoption of cps across the watershed by the tp losses from individual fields hrus resulted in the most efficient pathway of reducing tp and drp losses economic social and political challenges exist in prioritizing these fields to receive cps one challenge in targeting cps to these high phosphorus loss fields is identifying their locations although a variety of factors affect phosphorus runoff from agricultural fields such as fertilizer application methods and precipitation endale et al 2019 hanrahan et al 2019 field level characteristics are important in governing nutrient flow dynamics for example fields with high soil test phosphorus values have been found to contribute more phosphorus downstream than fields with low soil test phosphorus values duncan et al 2017 indicating they are potential critical source areas of nutrient losses this field level data is generally proprietary information which can lead to a lack of publicly available knowledge of where these high soil test phosphorus fields are in the landscape because federal cp adoption programs are generally designed on a first come first serve basis talberth et al 2015 farmers with fields with the greatest risk of phosphorus loss may not have the chance or may decide to not enroll in a program economic and social psychological factors contribute to a farmer s willingness to participate in voluntary cp adoption programs yeboah et al 2015 reimer and prokopy 2014 these factors also contribute to the willingness of farmers within the mrw to adopt various cps to reduce phosphorus discharged to lake erie in this setting farmers with higher conservation identities are more likely to adopt various cps burnett et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 thus within the mrw tp and drp loss reductions due to increasing cp adoption rates likely more closely resemble tp and drp reduction pathways as indicated when targeting by mpo conservation identities than the most efficient pathway of targeting by high p loss hrus in the future figs 3 and 4 this likely implies that in agriculturally dominated watersheds more efficient nutrient reduction pathways exist as the amount of phosphorus a field discharges is not the sole factor in a farmer determining whether to adopt a cp to reduce the nutrient discharge however if cp adoption programs whether at the federal state or local level focus on recruiting farmers that have high phosphorus loss fields and who have a strong or high conservation identities similar efficiencies in nutrient reductions can be achieved as by targeting cps only to the greatest phosphorus loss fields figs 3 and 4 an example of this approach to watershed management at the federal level is the western lake erie basin initiative of the united states department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service usda nrcs through this initiative the usda nrcs screens applicants for funding through nrcs environmental quality incentives program eqip with the applicants whose land is fully within the watershed and is vulnerable to nutrient discharge i e higher soil test phosphorus values being given higher ranking for funding nrcs 2016a 2016b 4 5 future work although conservation identity has been shown to be a strong predictor of future cp adoption burnett et al 2018 other socio psychological demographic and economic conditions have been found to affect conservation decisions made by farmers prokopy et al 2019 liu et al 2018 using farmer surveys of the mrw demographic factors such as age and gender and socio psychological factors such as perceived conservation practice effectiveness at reducing nutrient losses can be linked with mpo conservation identities at the county level to add further heterogeneity with these more complete mpos an agent based model can be developed to allow these heterogeneous mpos to interact and learn from each other further economic analyses on the cost effectiveness of programs aimed to capture cp adoption trends presented in the targeting pathways can be completed these economic analyses will provide policy insight for cp adoption programs that are most cost effective in terms of their ability to reduce phosphorus losses from a watershed 5 conclusion with limited financial resources it is critical to develop programs that distribute support for cp adoption in ways that generate greater returns in terms of improved water quality agricultural cp programs that recruit farmers using dual criteria targeting the highest phosphorus loading fields as well as those who are most willing to participate in cp programs can nearly achieve the same phosphorus discharge reduction as programs that focus primarily on placing cps on fields with the greatest phosphorus loss an approach that accounts for behavioral factors in responses to program incentives is likely much more realistic than believing that all farmers are equally likely to implement conservation practices on their fields in the mrw as in other watersheds locations of these high phosphorus discharge fields or high conservation identity farmers are not always known however effective outreach and programming can counteract this gap in knowledge by focusing on farmers who manage fields with higher soil phosphorus values and who hold favorable dispositions towards adopting cps this approach is particularly important in efficiently achieving downstream water quality improvement in schemes that rely on the voluntary adoption of cps as is the case in the mrw and throughout much of the world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16897,the continued emergence of bacterial pathogens presenting antimicrobial resistance is widely recognised as a global health threat and recent attention focused on potential environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args freshwater environments such as rivers represent a potential hotspot for args and antibiotic resistant bacteria as they are receiving systems for effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluent also contains low levels of different antimicrobials including antibiotics and biocides sulfonamides are antibacterial chemicals widely used in clinical veterinary and agricultural settings and are frequently detected in sewage sludge and manure in addition to riverine ecosystems the impact of such exposure on arg prevalence and diversity is unknown so the aim of this study was to investigate the release of a sub lethal concentration of the sulfonamide compound sulfamethoxazole smx on the river bacterial microbiome using a flume system this system was a semi natural in vitro flume using river water 30 l and sediment 6 kg with circulation to mimic river flow a combination of omics approaches were conducted to study the impact of smx exposure on the microbiomes within the flumes metagenomic analysis showed that the addition of low concentrations of smx 4 μg l 1 had a limited effect on the bacterial resistome in the water fraction only with no impact observed in the sediment metaproteomics did not show differences in args expression with smx exposure in water overall the river bacterial community was resilient to short term exposure to sub lethal concentrations of smx which mimics the exposure such communities experience downstream of wwtps throughout the year graphical abstract image graphical abstract

in rivers in close proximity to wwtps brechet et al 2014 khan et al 2019 parnanen et al 2019 args are known to frequently transfer between bacteria and to be associated with mobile genetic elements

environment amos et al 2015 gillings et al 2015 ma et al 2017 in addition to arb and args antibiotics are also released in the environment through wastewater effluents and their impact on the microbial community in the environment and spread of args is still unknown currently no global standard regulations or environmental limits are in place for the control of antibiotic pollution and no additional treatment of wastewater effluents is performed unless required by local regulations carraro et al 2016 the majority of antibiotics are not well metabolised in humans and animals therefore they are excreted in the urine and reach the environment via wwtp discharges as well as via application of manure to land andersson and hughes 2012 baietto et al 2014 byrne bailey et al 2009 kummerer 2009 antibiotic concentrations were reported ranging from 10 106 ng l 1 in freshwater environments around the world with low and middle income countries lmics showing the highest concentrations reported for several antibiotics chow et al 2021 fekadu et al 2019 li et al 2018 studies have shown that even though β lactams are the most widely used group of antibiotics in clinics gbaguidi haore et al 2013 who 2018 they are less detected in the environment due to breakdown by β lactamase enzymes that are widely excreted by the microbial community brechet et al 2014 however other antibiotic groups such as fluoroquinolone macrolide and sulfonamides which are more stable were reported at higher concentrations in wastewater effluents and rivers kummerer 2009 zhou et al 2013 sulfonamides are frequently detected in freshwater worldwide with high concentrations reported for lmics where their consumption for clinical purposes is still prevalent aus der beek et al 2016 k oreje k et al 2016

also as animal feed additive raising concerns for their effect on amr selection baran et al 2011 grave et al 2014 regulations have therefore banned their use in animal feed in the last few decades but they are retained for the treatment of animal diseases phe 2014 resistance has been widely observed in the microbial community either through mutations of the chromosomal dhps folp gene or by acquisition of plasmid borne genes sul1 sul2 sul3 and sul4 encoding for alternative drug resistant versions of the dhps enzymes which have lower affinity for sulfonamides achari et al 1997 razavi et

1991 while sul1 and sul4 were found in clinically relevant class 1 integrons typically associated with human pathogens gillings et al 2008 razavi et al 2017 recent in vitro studies have shown that the presence of sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics can select for amr suggesting that this effect could also be happening in natural environments where subinhibitory concentrations occur thus promoting resistance in the natural microbial community gullberg et al 2011 stanton et al 2020 the predicted no effect concentration pnec for resistance selection for sulfamethoxazole smx varies widely from 0 6 to 16 µg l 1 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 le page et al 2018 mortimer et al 2020 our aim was therefore to investigate the effect of a sub lethal concentration of smx in the pnec

served as useful model systems to study pollutants in rivers cook et al 2020a b this is the first report of the use of flume systems as mesocosms for study of smx at sub lethal concentrations on a riverine microbiome the focus was on smx addition at a sub lethal concentration in the range of previously recorded smx measurements in rivers hanamoto et al 2018 vila costa et al 2017 a combination of high throughput qpcr and various omics were used to demonstrate that in general the riverine microbiome was resilient to sublethal challenges with smx 4 µg l 1 but with some enrichment of non targeted resistance mechanisms such as multi drug efflux pumps in the water fraction only 2 methods 2 1 flumes set up river water and sediment were collected downstream of a wwtp form the river sowe

the 24 days experiment the nutrient and chemical properties within the water flumes were tested ph gran alkalinity n nh4 no2 no3 f cl so4 c o2 no significant differences were observed in presence of smx with the exceptions of dissolved sulphate kruskal wallis p 0 001 and chloride kruskal wallis p 0 01 which declined more rapidly in the presence of the antibiotic and the alkalinity which increased over time in presence of smx kruskal wallis p 0 05 fig s1 the initial concentration of smx in the control river water was 127 0 30 4 ng l 1 while the amended flumes showed a concentration 10x higher with 1219 2 584 2 ng l 1 after the addition of the antibiotic a rapid decrease in the level of smx was observed after 3 days with a return to an equal or higher concentration than the initial one after just 7 days fig s1 this pattern in the first 7 days has been observed on several occasions in this system and in similar scaled down systems data not reported after the initial 7 days the smx concentration decreased gradually in the sediment the concentration of smx was initially measured to an average of 48 6 13 2 ng l 1 for both control and amended flumes and it was below the limit of quantification loq 12 0 ng l 1 from time point 3 till the end of the experiment table s1 3 2 microbiome structure microbial community profiling through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed a lower alpha diversity richness and evenness for water samples compared to the sediment kruskal wallis p 0 001 fig s2 the microbiome diversity in both environments did not significantly change over time throughout the experiment nor was it significantly affected by the presence of smx kruskal wallis p value 0 05 the microbiome composition was different between the two environments but within the top 10 represented phyla proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in both environments 50 2 8 7 in water and 33 4 1 6 in sediment fig s3 in sediment the second most abundant phylum was chloroflexi 15 8 1 1 followed by bacteroidetes 10 5 1 4 actinobacteria 9 5 1 4 and firmicutes 6 2 1 0 whereas in the water column the second most abundant phylum was represented by bacteroidetes 15 2 10 5 followed by planctomycetes 6 0 3 3 actinobacteria 4 7 3 2 and nitrospirae 4 7 4 5 fig s3 beta diversity analysis based on bray curtis dissimilarity showed a clear separation between the community composition present in the water and the sediment samples adonis r2 0 36 p 0 001 fig 1 a in particular the water microbiome composition varied across the flumes adonis r2 0 28 p 0 001 and both time and treatment impacted equally on the community diversity adonis r2 0 14 p 0 001 fig 1b conversely the sediment microbiome was more consistent throughout the experiment adonis r2 0 06 p 0 002 and in the presence of smx adonis r2 0 05 p 0 004 fig 1c comparable results were also observed when similarity and phylogenetic relationship between communities were tested fig s4 however to further evaluate the temporal interdependence between taxa amongst the control and smx amended groups nonparametric microbial interdependence analyses which used temporal correlation between taxa were also explored these analyses at the same asv level showed that 31 of the microbial community variation over time was explained by the presence of smx in the water adonis r2 0 31 while only 22 was attributed to smx in the sediment adonis r2 0 22 fig s5 although the microbial interdependence profiles between control and smx groups were not statistically significant p 0 1 the results suggest that sediment microbiome was more resilient to changes than the water microbiome similarly at the metagenome level stronger correlation coefficients were observed between sediment samples compared to the water samples fig s6 differential analysis of the water metagenomes at genus level identified potential general microbial biomarkers characterizing both control and smx microbiomes throughout time for instance the abundance of genera such as nitrospira and legionella significantly increased after 7 days in both control and smx groups overtime while flavobacterium lysobacter phenylobacterium polynucleobacter and methylopumilus decreased fig 2 3 4 microbiome functional analysis in response to smx metagenomic functional analysis showed that the presence of smx did not significantly affect the carbohydrate metabolic pathways in either water or sediment microbiomes although changes were observed overtime in the water microbiome fig s7 the investigation of unique gene functionality by kegg pathways assignation showed that 2 65 of the unique genes of all samples were involved in the biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics and 1 61 were assigned to pathways involved in drug resistance to antimicrobials fig s8 in particular both pathways were more represented in the sediment samples fig 3 a more detailed analysis of the metagenomes functional genes related to drug resistance to antimicrobials using the card database identified args across both water and sediment with efflux pumps conferring multi drugs resistance mdr being the most abundant class followed by fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside fig 4 significant differences in the relative abundance of arg classes were observed between water and sediment metagenomes adonis r2 0 41 p 0 05 for both microbiomes significant changes were observed overtime throughout the experiment adonis water r2 0 2 p 0 007 sediment r2 0 29 p 0 001 but the presence of smx only had a significant impact on the arg prevalence for the water microbiome adonis r2 0 31 p 0 001 table 1 a targeted quantitative analysis of selected args and mges by ht qpcr showed that a total of 139 and 87 args mges out of 380 targets tested were positively identified in water and sediment respectively representing a positive hit of 36 6 and 22 9 table s2 this indicated a higher diversity of args in the water fraction although the prevalence as arg copies bacterial genome equivalent was similar in the two environments fig 5 no significant changes were observed that could be explained by either the presence of smx adonis water r2 0 05 p 0 05 sediment r2 0 02 p 0 05 or time adonis water r2 0 06 p 0 05 sediment r2 0 13 p 0 05 args detection by metagenomics and ht qpcr showed different results for the water microbiome ht qpcr detected low prevalence genes which were not always observed in the metagenomes while due to the limited number of primers used the ht qpcr assays did not detect a great variety of args which were observed in the water metagenomes indeed metagenomics identified a higher diversity of arg targets n 380 compared to the ht qpcr n 101 thus in order to better understand the effect of smx on the water resistome correlation analysis of arg prevalence detected by both methods metagenomics and ht qpcr was explored fig 6 although correlations were not significant for the common antibiotic classes detected by each method individually with the exception for mdr fig s9 the combination of both datasets enabled identification of positive correlations between mdr mlsb fluoroquinolone and amphenicol arg classes with presence of smx in the water microbiome some of these classes mdr and fluoroquinolone also had a strong positive correlation with mges such as integrases and plasmids which did not themselves show a significant correlation to smx the taxonomic distribution of the arg reads detected in the metagenomes showed that the majority were assigned to the proteobacteria phylum suggesting that this phylum is the greatest reservoir for args in the river environment fig s10 within the 812 mags recovered from the water microbiome 4 archaea and 808 bacteria fig s11 22 presented args amongst these mags 14 22 were assigned to proteobacteria including potentially pathogenic genera such as pseudomonas shewanella acinetobacter legionella and environmental relevant genera such as methyloversatilis caedimonas arenimonas and zoogloea the remaining 8 mags containing args were assigned to the actinobacteriota genera mycolicibacterium micropruina and mycobacterium and the chloroflexota and verrucomicrobiota families of uba6265 and opitutaceae respectively table s3 for 9 22 of these mags multiple args were identified providing resistance to multiple drugs such as for the mag related to the human pathogen acinetobacter beijerinckii which showed 9 different genes related to mdr efflux pumps and tetracycline resistance table s3 although the prevalence of args was low in both microbiomes expression of antimicrobial resistance proteins arps was investigated through recovery of metaproteomes sediment metaproteomes proved difficult to recover due to the nature of the sample and co extraction of impurities that could not be separated from the samples thus metaproteomic data were not collected for the sediment microbiome metaproteomic analysis of the water fraction showed that it was possible to detect proteins involved in the resistance to rifampicin elfamycin kirromycin ge2270a and daptomycin some more evenly detected than others fig 7 c however no significant difference in their expression was observed between the control and the smx group t test p 0 001 fig 7a and 7b 4 discussion the replication of freshwater environments such as rivers in the laboratory is difficult and microcosms studies were usually performed on static or shaking systems which only partially resembled the natural environment dynamic characteristics grenni et al 2019 patrolecco et al 2018 tong and xie 2019 vila costa et al 2017 in the current study flumes were set up in closed in vitro systems where water flowed on a sediment bed to better mimic river and environmental conditions the use of a controlled closed system allowed the reduction of impact from different variables such as continuous addition of nutrients xenobiotics and diverse microbiomes to the system we were therefore able to test the effects of sulfamethoxazole smx addition on the riverine microbiome in both the sediment and the water column in semi natural conditions this system has proved to be robust and reliable with limited variation between flumes the introduction of an environmentally relevant concentration of smx 4 μg l 1 did not significantly affect the flume sediment microbiome composition nor did it affect the antimicrobial resistance genes args diversity or prevalence conversely a limited response was observed in the water microbiome showing a correlation between the smx presence with mdr and fluoroquinolone resistance classes but not with sulfonamide resistance args as originally hypothesized the arg classes that did correlate were linked to mobile genetic elements which however did not show a significant correlation with the presence of smx this indicated that the presence of smx did not affect the spreading of args even though an enrichment of selected classes of args might have occurred in the water microbiome in accordance with previous studies corno et al 2014 these results suggest that the release of low levels of smx 4 μg l 1 from wastewater effluents or other sources into the river may have a limited impact on arg selection in the riverine microbiome without necessarily promoting arg spread during short periods of exposure as tested in this study however longer periods of continuous exposure to low concentrations of antibiotics could present completely different outcomes that shape the microbial community resistome a recent river water microcosm study monitored selected arg sulfonamide resistance targets sul1 and sul2 in the microbial community of a biofilm that formed on pebbles in the presence of 1 μg l 1 and 5 μg l 1 smx over 60 days arg prevalence at a low concentration of smx 1 μg l 1 was not affected in the first 30 days of exposure but an increase of args was observed in the following 30 days this led to a hypothesis that adaptation of the indigenous community to degrade the compound was mainly involved in the first half of the experiment thereby providing resistance to smx while the spread of args was promoted in the second half vila costa et al 2017 our study showed an impact of smx on args in the water column as opposed to the sediment and no significant impact on the community diversity in either the water or the sediment fractions possibly the enrichment of mdr efflux pumps in the water column indicates a response to the presence of smx this was observed for both high throughput qpcr ht qpcr and metagenomes and this correlation is probably a reflection of the conservation of these mdr genes so that there is likely to be more correspondence between metagenome detection and primers in the ht qpcr platform the divergence between arg targets detected in the ht qpcr and metagenome was thought to be a result of significant adaptive radiation of the args therefore we recommend metagenome analysis to capture the full diversity of args found in the environment this study is also the first report of antimicrobial resistant protein arp prevalence in a natural riverine environment it was interesting to note that in the protein fraction analysed no dihydropteroate synthase enzymes resistant to sulfonamide were detected confuting our hypothesis that the presence of smx would promote the expression of more proteins related to its resistance in the community it is likely that the arps detected in the water fraction are chromosomally encoded and their expression was not linked or influenced by environmental concentrations of smx the metaproteomic results showed that although smx might have an effect on the microbiome composition at a genetic level the expression of args was not significantly promoted in these conditions although differential sensitivity of these techniques makes comparisons difficult comparison analysis with preliminary results from a pilot study conducted with samples collected in may 2018 table s4 and fig s12 s14 showed a potential effect due to seasonal variability of the starting microbiome used in the flumes experiment the pilot study showed an increase in args related to sulfonamide resistant and mges after exposure to sub lethal concentration of smx however the insufficient ht qpcr data available for this pilot study did not allow us to draw conclusive interpretations in relation to args spreading in the conditions tested the main experiment conducted in 2019 was an attempt to replicate the same conditions but temporal seasonal variation of the microbial community was observed between the studies which may explain the differential impact of smx on the microbial community and the related args present therein indeed it is important to consider that as part of the seasonal variation wwtp effluents will vary dependent on time of the year and infection level in the population this suggests that further studies are needed to assess the effect of sub lethal concentrations of antimicrobials in natural environmental microbiomes collected in different seasons and exposed to different environmental conditions as these might have an impact on their response however it is clear that there is considerable variation in the estimation of the predicted no effect concentration pnec for selection of resistance to sulfonamides mortimer et al 2020 which supports the variation between our pilot study and the study reported here in detail we believe that estimating pnec for resistance selection for environmental microbiomes is extremally challenging and will be subject to considerable variation depending on the large number of variables that determine microbiome functions 5 conclusions this in vitro flume system proved to be a reliable semi natural system to implement further studies on the effects of release of xenobiotics in freshwater natural environments such as rivers mesocosms integrating semi realistic features of rivers will be necessary in further studies to test longer exposure effects to sub lethal concentrations of individual xenobiotics complex combinations of pollutants exist in effluents and this will need to be simulated in future studies integration of these in vitro experiments with monitoring and surveillance studies will help to better predict amr levels in the

16897,the continued emergence of bacterial pathogens presenting antimicrobial resistance is widely recognised as a global health threat and recent attention focused on potential environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args freshwater environments such as rivers represent a potential hotspot for args and antibiotic resistant bacteria as they are receiving systems for effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluent also contains low levels of different antimicrobials including antibiotics and biocides sulfonamides are antibacterial chemicals widely used in clinical veterinary and agricultural settings and are frequently detected in sewage sludge and manure in addition to riverine ecosystems the impact of such exposure on arg prevalence and diversity is unknown so the aim of this study was to investigate the release of a sub lethal concentration of the sulfonamide compound sulfamethoxazole smx on the river bacterial microbiome using a flume system this system was a semi natural in vitro flume using river water 30 l and sediment 6 kg with circulation to mimic river flow a combination of omics approaches were conducted to study the impact of smx exposure on the microbiomes within the flumes metagenomic analysis showed that the addition of low concentrations of smx 4 μg l 1 had a limited effect on the bacterial resistome in the water fraction only with no impact observed in the sediment metaproteomics did not show differences in args expression with smx exposure in water overall the river bacterial community was resilient to short term exposure to sub lethal concentrations of smx which mimics the exposure such communities experience downstream of wwtps throughout the year graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flumes sulfamethoxazole antimicrobial resistance metagenomics metaproteomics pnec 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr has been extensively studied in clinical environments but only in the last decade non clinical environments such as rivers have been recognised as potential hotspots for persistence and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes args between bacterial species singer et al 2016 wellington et al 2013 rivers receive effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and a significant prevalence of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb has been detected in rivers in close proximity to wwtps brechet et al 2014 khan et al 2019 parnanen et al 2019 args are known to frequently transfer between bacteria and to be associated with mobile genetic elements mges which are useful markers to monitor pollution indeed mges such as genes belongings to the class 1 integrons inti1 were identified as a potential proxy for anthropogenic and arg pollution in the environment amos et al 2015 gillings et al 2015 ma et al 2017 in addition to arb and args antibiotics are also released in the environment through wastewater effluents and their impact on the microbial community in the environment and spread of args is still unknown currently no global standard regulations or environmental limits are in place for the control of antibiotic pollution and no additional treatment of wastewater effluents is performed unless required by local regulations carraro et al 2016 the majority of antibiotics are not well metabolised in humans and animals therefore they are excreted in the urine and reach the environment via wwtp discharges as well as via application of manure to land andersson and hughes 2012 baietto et al 2014 byrne bailey et al 2009 kummerer 2009 antibiotic concentrations were reported ranging from 10 106 ng l 1 in freshwater environments around the world with low and middle income countries lmics showing the highest concentrations reported for several antibiotics chow et al 2021 fekadu et al 2019 li et al 2018 studies have shown that even though β lactams are the most widely used group of antibiotics in clinics gbaguidi haore et al 2013 who 2018 they are less detected in the environment due to breakdown by β lactamase enzymes that are widely excreted by the microbial community brechet et al 2014 however other antibiotic groups such as fluoroquinolone macrolide and sulfonamides which are more stable were reported at higher concentrations in wastewater effluents and rivers kummerer 2009 zhou et al 2013 sulfonamides are frequently detected in freshwater worldwide with high concentrations reported for lmics where their consumption for clinical purposes is still prevalent aus der beek et al 2016 k oreje k et al 2016 segura et al 2015 these drugs target both gram positive and gram negative bacteria affecting the dihydropteroate synthase dhps enzymes involved in the folic acid biosynthesis acts as an analogue of paba thus binding dhps an essential precursor for the synthesis of nucleic acids skold 2000 in the clinical setting they have been used more frequently in combination with trimethoprim for the treatment of various urinary tract respiratory skin associated and gastro intestinal infections masters et al 2003 sulfonamides were used on a large scale in animal husbandry not only as treatment but also as animal feed additive raising concerns for their effect on amr selection baran et al 2011 grave et al 2014 regulations have therefore banned their use in animal feed in the last few decades but they are retained for the treatment of animal diseases phe 2014 resistance has been widely observed in the microbial community either through mutations of the chromosomal dhps folp gene or by acquisition of plasmid borne genes sul1 sul2 sul3 and sul4 encoding for alternative drug resistant versions of the dhps enzymes which have lower affinity for sulfonamides achari et al 1997 razavi et al 2017 skold 2000 in particular sul2 and sul3 were reported on small non conjugative plasmids or large transmissible multi resistant plasmids enne et al 2001 perreten and boerlin 2003 radstrom et al 1991 while sul1 and sul4 were found in clinically relevant class 1 integrons typically associated with human pathogens gillings et al 2008 razavi et al 2017 recent in vitro studies have shown that the presence of sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics can select for amr suggesting that this effect could also be happening in natural environments where subinhibitory concentrations occur thus promoting resistance in the natural microbial community gullberg et al 2011 stanton et al 2020 the predicted no effect concentration pnec for resistance selection for sulfamethoxazole smx varies widely from 0 6 to 16 µg l 1 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 le page et al 2018 mortimer et al 2020 our aim was therefore to investigate the effect of a sub lethal concentration of smx in the pnec range for selection of resistance on the microbial community of a riverine environment by use of in vitro flumes to mimic the effect of an antibiotic release event in a river ecosystem flumes have served as useful model systems to study pollutants in rivers cook et al 2020a b this is the first report of the use of flume systems as mesocosms for study of smx at sub lethal concentrations on a riverine microbiome the focus was on smx addition at a sub lethal concentration in the range of previously recorded smx measurements in rivers hanamoto et al 2018 vila costa et al 2017 a combination of high throughput qpcr and various omics were used to demonstrate that in general the riverine microbiome was resilient to sublethal challenges with smx 4 µg l 1 but with some enrichment of non targeted resistance mechanisms such as multi drug efflux pumps in the water fraction only 2 methods 2 1 flumes set up river water and sediment were collected downstream of a wwtp form the river sowe stoneleigh uk in april 2019 and immediately used to set up the flumes which consisted of six individual flumes each containing 6 kg of sediment 3 cm depth riverbed and 30 l of water 12 cm water column over the riverbed to replicate the river environment as previously described by cook et al 2020b each flume 2 36 m length x 0 2 m height x 0 1 m width was made of glass and was connected to a haillea

resistance database card v 3 0 9 using maxquant v 1 6 7 0 perseus v 1 6 2 2 was used for statistical analysis of the label free quantitative lfq values 3 results 3 1 flumes chemical analysis during the 24 days experiment the nutrient and chemical properties within the water flumes were tested ph gran alkalinity n nh4 no2 no3 f cl so4 c o2 no significant differences were observed in presence of smx with the exceptions of dissolved sulphate kruskal wallis p 0 001 and chloride kruskal wallis p 0 01 which declined more rapidly in the presence of the antibiotic and the alkalinity which increased over time in presence of smx kruskal wallis p 0 05 fig s1 the initial concentration of smx in the control river water was 127 0 30 4 ng l 1 while the amended flumes showed a concentration 10x higher with 1219 2 584 2 ng l 1 after the addition of the antibiotic a rapid decrease in the level of smx was observed after 3 days with a return to an equal or higher concentration than the initial one after just 7 days fig s1 this pattern in the first 7 days has been observed on several occasions in this system and in similar scaled down systems data not reported after the initial 7 days the smx concentration decreased gradually in the sediment the concentration of smx was initially measured to an average of 48 6 13 2 ng l 1 for both control and amended flumes and it was below the limit of quantification loq 12 0 ng l 1 from time point 3 till the end of the experiment table s1 3 2 microbiome structure microbial community profiling through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed a lower alpha diversity richness and evenness for water samples compared to the sediment kruskal wallis p 0 001 fig s2 the microbiome diversity in both environments did not significantly change over time throughout the experiment nor was it significantly affected by the presence of smx kruskal wallis p value 0 05 the microbiome composition was different between the two environments but within the top 10 represented phyla proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in both environments 50 2 8 7 in water and 33 4 1 6 in sediment fig s3 in sediment the second most abundant phylum was chloroflexi 15 8 1 1 followed by bacteroidetes 10 5 1 4 actinobacteria 9 5 1 4 and firmicutes 6 2 1 0 whereas in the water column the second most abundant phylum was represented by bacteroidetes 15 2 10 5 followed by planctomycetes 6 0 3 3 actinobacteria 4 7 3 2 and nitrospirae 4 7 4 5 fig s3 beta diversity analysis based on bray curtis dissimilarity showed a clear separation between the community composition present in the water and the sediment samples adonis r2 0 36 p 0 001 fig 1 a in particular the water microbiome composition varied across the flumes adonis r2 0 28 p 0 001 and both time and treatment impacted equally on the community diversity adonis r2 0 14 p 0 001 fig 1b conversely the sediment microbiome was more consistent throughout the experiment adonis r2 0 06 p 0 002 and in the presence of smx adonis r2 0 05 p 0 004 fig 1c comparable results were also observed when similarity and phylogenetic relationship between communities were tested fig s4 however to further evaluate the temporal interdependence between taxa amongst the control and smx amended groups nonparametric microbial interdependence analyses which used temporal correlation between taxa were also explored these analyses at the same asv level showed that 31 of the microbial community variation over time was explained by the presence of smx in the water adonis r2 0 31 while only 22 was attributed to smx in the sediment adonis r2 0 22 fig s5 although the microbial interdependence profiles between control and smx groups were not statistically significant p 0 1 the results suggest that sediment microbiome was more resilient to changes than the water microbiome similarly at the metagenome level stronger correlation coefficients were observed between sediment samples compared to the water samples fig s6 differential analysis of the water metagenomes at genus level identified potential general microbial biomarkers characterizing both control and smx microbiomes throughout time for instance the abundance of genera such as nitrospira and legionella significantly increased after 7 days in both control and smx groups overtime while flavobacterium lysobacter phenylobacterium polynucleobacter and methylopumilus decreased fig 2 3 4 microbiome functional analysis in response to smx metagenomic functional analysis showed that the presence of smx did not significantly affect the carbohydrate metabolic pathways in either water or sediment microbiomes although changes were observed overtime in the water microbiome fig s7 the investigation of unique gene functionality by kegg pathways assignation showed that 2 65 of the unique genes of all samples were involved in the biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics and 1 61 were assigned to pathways involved in drug resistance to antimicrobials fig s8 in particular both pathways were more represented in the sediment samples fig 3 a more detailed analysis of the metagenomes functional genes related to drug resistance to antimicrobials using the card database identified args across both water and sediment with efflux pumps conferring multi drugs resistance mdr being the most abundant class followed by fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside fig 4 significant differences in the relative abundance of arg classes were observed between water and sediment metagenomes adonis r2 0 41 p 0 05 for both microbiomes significant changes were observed overtime throughout the experiment adonis water r2 0 2 p 0 007 sediment r2 0 29 p 0 001 but the presence of smx only had a significant impact on the arg prevalence for the water microbiome adonis r2 0 31 p 0 001 table 1 a targeted quantitative analysis of selected args and mges by ht qpcr showed that a total of 139 and 87 args mges out of 380 targets tested were positively identified in water and sediment respectively representing a positive hit of 36 6 and 22 9 table s2 this indicated a higher diversity of args in the water fraction although the prevalence as arg copies bacterial genome equivalent was similar in the two environments fig 5 no significant changes were observed that could be explained by either the presence of smx adonis water r2 0 05 p 0 05 sediment r2 0 02 p 0 05 or time adonis water r2 0 06 p 0 05 sediment r2 0 13 p 0 05 args detection by metagenomics and ht qpcr showed different results for the water microbiome ht qpcr detected low prevalence genes which were not always observed in the metagenomes while due to the limited number of primers used the ht qpcr assays did not detect a great variety of args which were observed in the water metagenomes indeed metagenomics identified a higher diversity of arg targets n 380 compared to the ht qpcr n 101 thus in order to better understand the effect of smx on the water resistome correlation analysis of arg prevalence detected by both methods metagenomics and ht qpcr was explored fig 6 although correlations were not significant for the common antibiotic classes detected by each method individually with the exception for mdr fig s9 the combination of both datasets enabled identification of positive correlations between mdr mlsb fluoroquinolone and amphenicol arg classes with presence of smx in the water microbiome some of these classes mdr and fluoroquinolone also had a strong positive correlation with mges such as integrases and plasmids which did not themselves show a significant correlation to smx the taxonomic distribution of the arg reads detected in the metagenomes showed that the majority were assigned to the proteobacteria phylum suggesting that this phylum is the greatest reservoir for args in the river environment fig s10 within the 812 mags recovered from the water microbiome 4 archaea and 808 bacteria fig s11 22 presented args amongst these mags 14 22 were assigned to proteobacteria including potentially pathogenic genera such as pseudomonas shewanella acinetobacter legionella and environmental relevant genera such as methyloversatilis caedimonas arenimonas and zoogloea the remaining 8 mags containing args were assigned to the actinobacteriota genera mycolicibacterium micropruina and mycobacterium and the chloroflexota and verrucomicrobiota families of uba6265 and opitutaceae respectively table s3 for 9 22 of these mags multiple args were identified providing resistance to multiple drugs such as for the mag related to the human pathogen acinetobacter beijerinckii which showed 9 different genes related to mdr efflux pumps and tetracycline resistance table s3 although the prevalence of args was low in both microbiomes expression of antimicrobial resistance proteins arps was investigated through recovery of metaproteomes sediment metaproteomes proved difficult to recover due to the nature of the sample and co extraction of impurities that could not be separated from the samples thus metaproteomic data were not collected for the sediment microbiome metaproteomic analysis of the water fraction showed that it was possible to detect proteins involved in the resistance to rifampicin elfamycin kirromycin ge2270a and daptomycin some more evenly detected than others fig 7 c however no significant difference in their expression was observed between the control and the smx group t test p 0 001 fig 7a and 7b 4 discussion the replication of freshwater environments such as rivers in the laboratory is difficult and microcosms studies were usually performed on static or shaking systems which only partially resembled the natural environment dynamic characteristics grenni et al 2019 patrolecco et al 2018 tong and xie 2019 vila costa et al 2017 in the current study flumes were set up in closed in vitro systems where water flowed on a sediment bed to better mimic river and environmental conditions the use of a controlled closed system allowed the reduction of impact from different variables such as continuous addition of nutrients xenobiotics and diverse microbiomes to the system we were therefore able to test the effects of sulfamethoxazole smx addition on the riverine microbiome in both the sediment and the water column in semi natural conditions this system has proved to be robust and reliable with limited variation between flumes the introduction of an environmentally relevant concentration of smx 4 μg l 1 did not significantly affect the flume sediment microbiome composition nor did it affect the antimicrobial resistance genes args diversity or prevalence conversely a limited response was observed in the water microbiome showing a correlation between the smx presence with mdr and fluoroquinolone resistance classes but not with sulfonamide resistance args as originally hypothesized the arg classes that did correlate were linked to mobile genetic elements which however did not show a significant correlation with the presence of smx this indicated that the presence of smx did not affect the spreading of args even though an enrichment of selected classes of args might have occurred in the water microbiome in accordance with previous studies corno et al 2014 these results suggest that the release of low levels of smx 4 μg l 1 from wastewater effluents or other sources into the river may have a limited impact on arg selection in the riverine microbiome without necessarily promoting arg spread during short periods of exposure as tested in this study however longer periods of continuous exposure to low concentrations of antibiotics could present completely different outcomes that shape the microbial community resistome a recent river water microcosm study monitored selected arg sulfonamide resistance targets sul1 and sul2 in the microbial community of a biofilm that formed on pebbles in the presence of 1 μg l 1 and 5 μg l 1 smx over 60 days arg prevalence at a low concentration of smx 1 μg l 1 was not affected in the first 30 days of exposure but an increase of args was observed in the following 30 days this led to a hypothesis that adaptation of the indigenous community to degrade the compound was mainly involved in the first half of the experiment thereby providing resistance to smx while the spread of args was promoted in the second half vila costa et al 2017 our study showed an impact of smx on args in the water column as opposed to the sediment and no significant impact on the community diversity in either the water or the sediment fractions possibly the enrichment of mdr efflux pumps in the water column indicates a response to the presence of smx this was observed for both high throughput qpcr ht qpcr and metagenomes and this correlation is probably a reflection of the conservation of these mdr genes so that there is likely to be more correspondence between metagenome detection and primers in the ht qpcr platform the divergence between arg targets detected in the ht qpcr and metagenome was thought to be a result of significant adaptive radiation of the args therefore we recommend metagenome analysis to capture the full diversity of args found in the environment this study is also the first report of antimicrobial resistant protein arp prevalence in a natural riverine environment it was interesting to note that in the protein fraction analysed no dihydropteroate synthase enzymes resistant to sulfonamide were detected confuting our hypothesis that the presence of smx would promote the expression of more proteins related to its resistance in the community it is likely that the arps detected in the water fraction are chromosomally encoded and their expression was not linked or influenced by environmental concentrations of smx the metaproteomic results showed that although smx might have an effect on the microbiome composition at a genetic level the expression of args was not significantly promoted in these conditions although differential sensitivity of these techniques makes comparisons difficult comparison analysis with preliminary results from a pilot study conducted with samples collected in may 2018 table s4 and fig s12 s14 showed a potential effect due to seasonal variability of the starting microbiome used in the flumes experiment the pilot study showed an increase in args related to sulfonamide resistant and mges after exposure to sub lethal concentration of smx however the insufficient ht qpcr data available for this pilot study did not allow us to draw conclusive interpretations in relation to args spreading in the conditions tested the main experiment conducted in 2019 was an attempt to replicate the same conditions but temporal seasonal variation of the microbial community was observed between the studies which may explain the differential impact of smx on the microbial community and the related args present therein indeed it is important to consider that as part of the seasonal variation wwtp effluents will vary dependent on time of the year and infection level in the population this suggests that further studies are needed to assess the effect of sub lethal concentrations of antimicrobials in natural environmental microbiomes collected in different seasons and exposed to different environmental conditions as these might have an impact on their response however it is clear that there is considerable variation in the estimation of the predicted no effect concentration pnec for selection of resistance to sulfonamides mortimer et al 2020 which supports the variation between our pilot study and the study reported here in detail we believe that estimating pnec for resistance selection for environmental microbiomes is extremally challenging and will be subject to considerable variation depending on the large number of variables that determine microbiome functions 5 conclusions this in vitro flume system proved to be a reliable semi natural system to implement further studies on the effects of release of xenobiotics in freshwater natural environments such as rivers mesocosms integrating semi realistic features of rivers will be necessary in further studies to test longer exposure effects to sub lethal concentrations of individual xenobiotics complex combinations of pollutants exist in effluents and this will need to be simulated in future studies integration of these in vitro experiments with monitoring and surveillance studies will help to better predict amr levels in the

analysis of water from hospital 3a indicated significant spikes in chloride concentration as high as 1780 mg l from a baseline average of 100 200 mg l at all other processing locations additionally sample turbidity was visually noted to be unusually low for primary municipal wastewater and samples were observed to have a free chlorine smell correspondingly total chemical oxygen demand averaged 173 mg l in hospital 3a samples compared to average anticipated values greater than 500 mg l in typical primary municipal wastewater indicating substantial oxidation of the wastewater prior to sample collection inspection of building schematics showed that hospital 3a contained wastewater from a medical reprocessing facility within the hospital likely causing the observed spike in chloride concentration as well as apparent free chlorine the presence of a strong oxidant in the form of chlorine bleach in samples from hospital 3a presents a high probability of degradation of sars cov 2 in

during the study period during the period of observation cases identified in the city of calgary remained relatively stable from august at 40 60 new cases day 3 1 4 6 incident cases 100 000 residents per day until mid october when they began to increase peaking in mid december at 600 700 cases day 46 7 54 4 incident cases 100 000 residents per day the absolute number of people in area hospitals on contact droplet precautions generally mirrored community incident data supplemental fig 3s 4 discussion hospital associated outbreaks of covid 19 are increasingly being reported early data suggests that patients with hospital acquired covid 19 may fare worse than those with community acquired disease experiencing longer hospital stays but not increased mortality carter et al 2020 this observation balances the opposing impacts of increased co morbidities and medical acuity in hospitalized individuals on one hand with the potential for earlier detection and more rapid supportive care treatment on the other preventing hospital associated transmission of covid 19 is challenging for a myriad of reasons harada et al 2020 in addition to its highly infectious nature accurate identification triage and effective isolation of cases is exceedingly difficult while covid 19 has a typical incubation period of 5 7 days it can take as long as 14 days to manifest such that identifying evolving symptoms in previously admitted patients is challenging backer et al 2020 wang et al 2020 furthermore up to 40 of individuals including patients and hcw may be asymptomatic pauci symptomatic or pre symptomatic each just as likely to transmit infection as symptomatic individuals arons et al 2020 johansson et al 2021 yanes lane et al 2020 despite rigorous infection control protocols hospital acquired infections continue to occur novel strategies to understand the epidemiology of sars cov 2 in hospitals are therefore urgently required one such strategy may be the monitoring of hospital wastewater gonçalves et al 2021 to date most wastewater based sars cov 2 rna surveillance has focused on monitoring community burden of disease by sampling wwtp ahmed et al 2020a d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 wannigama et al 2021 more recently moving sampling upstream in the wastewater network closer to patients is actively being explored the most granular data comes from single facility assessments passive wastewater surveillance could hold promise as an early warning strategy adaptable to both low and high risk facilities wong et al 2021 showed the utility of wastewater surveillance for the detection of sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewaters of a high risk apartment buildings similarly others have used wastewater sars cov 2 surveillance to monitor resident populations of university dormitories to aid in active case finding including those that were asymptomatic gibas et al 2021 importantly if an incipient signal is detected in facility wide wastewater samples in building plumbing systems can be strategically sampled in a nested manner in order to confirm an outbreak location here we demonstrate that both the frequency of positive samples and the abundance of sars cov 2 rna in hospital wastewater systems correlated with increasing hospitalized cases analogous to wwtp levels correlating with the covid 19 community diagnosed cases ahmed et al 2020a d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 this was most evident using raw sars cov 2 cq values but was also evident when normalized against pmmov levels we observed the n1 region of the nucleocapsid gene to be more sensitive than n 2 and e so low as to be dropped from our protocol other groups have reported similar trends in that the n1 target is the most sensitive marker in wwtp studies medema et al 2020 and cruise ships ahmed et al 2020b recently other study showed a positive correlation as well between the prevalent cases covid 19 with the sars cov 2 rna signal in the wastewater in a major hospital in the city of toledo oh usa that at the time of the study was known to be treating covid 19 patients spurbeck et al 2021 despite nosocomial cases and outbreaks representing a small fraction of the overall population of patients hospitalized with covid 19 these events were discernable by wastewater testing the natural history of sars cov 2 rna presence in the gastrointestinal tract remains incompletely understood gupta et al 2020 ling et al 2020 although some studies have addressed the sars cov 2 rna load dynamics in fecal samples cevik et al 2021 huang et al 2020 tan et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 changes in fecal viral loads over the course of the disease is still not well understood extrapolating from our hospital based wastewater data it appears that peak fecal viral shedding may occur prior to around symptom onset given the congruence of wastewater rna signal and nosocomial cases and outbreaks identified in hospitals based on the rapid decline in wastewater signal thereafter it is likely that fecal sars cov 2 rna drops significantly after initial presentation indeed early in the pandemic when fewer patients with covid 19 were hospitalized wastewater samples routinely tested negative this critical observation suggests that wastewater based monitoring of sars cov 2 may be most sensitive for identifying acutely occurring incident cases accordingly wastewater based monitoring of individual high risk facilities i e hospitals nursing homes and industrial meat plants providing more granular data through to wwtp may have great merit a key limitation to the identification of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples relative to clinical samples e g swabs is the massive volume of water in which samples are diluted this necessitates sample concentration while procedures for the efficient recovery of non enveloped viruses exist researchers continue to search for satisfactory protocols for enveloped viruses such as sars cov 2 alygizakis et al 2021 many groups have explored ways to improve the sensitivity of wastewater sars cov 2 detection diagnostic platforms with improved sensitivity and more impervious to impurities in the wastewater matrix i e digital droplet rt pcr also show considerable promise falzone et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 sampling in the proximal sewershed may lead to day to day variance resulting in signal noise this is particularly true for single facility studies where potential extremes in individual virus shedding could confound results limited data suggests significant variations in fecal viral load occur from 103 4 to 107 6 cheung et al 2020 this is a key challenge that remains to be solved if wastewater data is to be used in a meaningful way similarly issues arise with attempts to normalize sars cov 2 based on the contributing population we chose to use the pmmov as a fecal biomarker to control for variations in fecal loading a particular risk when sampling takes place upstream in the sewershed while this marker has been validated in wwtp samples where large and diverse populations contribute to sewage kitajima et al 2018 hospitals are a much smaller collection of individuals and variations in pmmov excretion owing to differences in diet could have a much larger impact colson et al 2010 by capturing longitudinal data from three tertiary care hospitals 2100 inpatient beds we have demonstrated that passive wastewater monitoring is indeed possible at a range of hospital facilities whereas hospital 1 and hospital 2 had a single municipal access point enabling surveillance of the entire facility hospital 3 required three locations to capture fully as patients were frequently moved from one unit building to another either based on attending services geographic location covid positive patient cohorting or need for intensive care support attributing sars cov 2 signal in the wastewater of this facility was more complicated but nonetheless correlations were evident furthermore while nursing staff is often assigned to individual units many allied health workers and physicians work or consult throughout the entire facility if passive wastewater monitoring is to be adapted for other aspects of nosocomial surveillance i e antibiotic consumption emergence of antimicrobial resistant organisms etc a keen insight into the collection network is required there are limitations of our work that merit discussion given the complexity involved in sample collection we were limited to twice weekly sampling knowing how quickly sars cov 2 can spread and outbreaks can occur a daily monitoring strategy would have much greater capacity to identify and mitigate secondary cases of covid 19 incident cases are likely to be clinically diagnosed in hospital far faster than in other high risk facilities owing to greater resources and heightened suspicion potentially leading to an even greater lead time associated with a positive wastewater signal of outbreaks than observed herein hospitals pose unique challenges in wastewater monitoring owing to these facilities high use of chemical disinfectants and detergents zotesso et al 2017 that could interfere with molecular assays this may explain why 3 6 of our samples spiked controls and pmmov were not detected by rt qpcr to minimize the risk of false negatives rigorous protocols that use internal controls such as our bcov spike are necessary the role of pcr inhibitors in the wastewater matrix within the proximal sewershed is an area that deserves considerable study if this field is to expand wastewater based monitoring can only effectively monitor those individuals that contribute fecal matter to the sewershed importantly hospitalized patients those most vulnerable to covid 19 adverse events are often unable to self toilet rather these sick and often elderly individuals are dependent on continence aids adult diapers sanitary pads and nursing cleanup this results in fecal matter from these individuals being disposed into biohazard solid waste accordingly wastewater based sampling could miss between 10 and 20 of patients in general hospital patients condon et al 2019 toba et al 1996 this proportion is expected to be even higher in intensive care units where immobilization necessitated through ventilatory support further heightens toileting assistance requirements adapting wastewater surveillance technology to other high risk settings like long term care will encounter this same limitation finally tracking workers through passive wastewater monitoring poses inherent challenges there is data that suggests that 52 56 of employees are uncomfortable defecating at work bennet 2019 mackenzie 2016 5 conclusion in a five month observational study we were able to detect sars cov 2 from the wastewater of calgary s three largest tertiary care hospitals the rate of sars cov 2 wastewater test positivity and rna abundance increased over time concomitant with the increasing proportion of patients hospitalized with covid 19 despite persistent low levels of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater resulting from patients being treated for and recovering from covid 19 acquired in the community we detected spikes attributable to hospital acquired infections and outbreaks this study reveals that wastewater based monitoring of sars cov 2 rna holds promise for early detection monitoring and containment of incident infections credit authorship contribution statement nicole acosta formal analysis

analysis of water from hospital 3a indicated significant spikes in chloride concentration as high as 1780 mg l from a baseline average of 100 200 mg l at all other processing locations additionally sample turbidity was visually noted to be unusually low for primary municipal wastewater and samples were observed to have a free chlorine smell correspondingly total chemical oxygen demand averaged 173 mg l in hospital 3a samples compared to average anticipated values greater than 500 mg l in typical primary municipal wastewater indicating substantial oxidation of the wastewater prior to sample collection inspection of building schematics showed that hospital 3a contained wastewater from a medical reprocessing facility within the hospital likely causing the observed spike in chloride concentration as well as apparent free chlorine the presence of a strong oxidant in the form of chlorine bleach in samples from hospital 3a presents a high probability of degradation of sars cov 2 in

during the study period during the period of observation cases identified in the city of calgary remained relatively stable from august at 40 60 new cases day 3 1 4 6 incident cases 100 000 residents per day until mid october when they began to increase peaking in mid december at 600 700 cases day 46 7 54 4 incident cases 100 000 residents per day the absolute number of people in area hospitals on contact droplet precautions generally mirrored community incident data supplemental fig 3s 4 discussion hospital associated outbreaks of covid 19 are increasingly being reported early data suggests that patients with hospital acquired covid 19 may fare worse than those with community acquired disease experiencing longer hospital stays but not increased mortality carter et al 2020 this observation balances the opposing impacts of increased co morbidities and medical acuity in hospitalized individuals on one hand with the potential for earlier detection and more rapid supportive care treatment on the other preventing hospital associated transmission of covid 19 is challenging for a myriad of reasons harada et al 2020 in addition to its highly infectious nature accurate identification triage and effective isolation of cases is exceedingly difficult while covid 19 has a typical incubation period of 5 7 days it can take as long as 14 days to manifest such that identifying evolving symptoms in previously admitted patients is challenging backer et al 2020 wang et al 2020 furthermore up to 40 of individuals including patients and hcw may be asymptomatic pauci symptomatic or pre symptomatic each just as likely to transmit infection as symptomatic individuals arons et al 2020 johansson et al 2021 yanes lane et al 2020 despite rigorous infection control protocols hospital acquired infections continue to occur novel strategies to understand the epidemiology of sars cov 2 in hospitals are therefore urgently required one such strategy may be the monitoring of hospital wastewater gonçalves et al 2021 to date most wastewater based sars cov 2 rna surveillance has focused on monitoring community burden of disease by sampling wwtp ahmed et al 2020a d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 wannigama et al 2021 more recently moving sampling upstream in the wastewater network closer to patients is actively being explored the most granular data comes from single facility assessments passive wastewater surveillance could hold promise as an early warning strategy adaptable to both low and high risk facilities wong et al 2021 showed the utility of wastewater surveillance for the detection of sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewaters of a high risk apartment buildings similarly others have used wastewater sars cov 2 surveillance to monitor resident populations of university dormitories to aid in active case finding including those that were asymptomatic gibas et al 2021 importantly if an incipient signal is detected in facility wide wastewater samples in building plumbing systems can be strategically sampled in a nested manner in order to confirm an outbreak location here we demonstrate that both the frequency of positive samples and the abundance of sars cov 2 rna in hospital wastewater systems correlated with increasing hospitalized cases analogous to wwtp levels correlating with the covid 19 community diagnosed cases ahmed et al 2020a d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 this was most evident using raw sars cov 2 cq values but was also evident when normalized against pmmov levels we observed the n1 region of the nucleocapsid gene to be more sensitive than n 2 and e so low as to be dropped from our protocol other groups have reported similar trends in that the n1 target is the most sensitive marker in wwtp studies medema et al 2020 and cruise ships ahmed et al 2020b recently other study showed a positive correlation as well between the prevalent cases covid 19 with the sars cov 2 rna signal in the wastewater in a major hospital in the city of toledo oh usa that at the time of the study was known to be treating covid 19 patients spurbeck et al 2021 despite nosocomial cases and outbreaks representing a small fraction of the overall population of patients hospitalized with covid 19 these events were discernable by wastewater testing the natural history of sars cov 2 rna presence in the gastrointestinal tract remains incompletely understood gupta et al 2020 ling et al 2020 although some studies have addressed the sars cov 2 rna load dynamics in fecal samples cevik et al 2021 huang et al 2020 tan et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 changes in fecal viral loads over the course of the disease is still not well understood extrapolating from our hospital based wastewater data it appears that peak fecal viral shedding may occur prior to around symptom onset given the congruence of wastewater rna signal and nosocomial cases and outbreaks identified in hospitals based on the rapid decline in wastewater signal thereafter it is likely that fecal sars cov 2 rna drops significantly after initial presentation indeed early in the pandemic when fewer patients with covid 19 were hospitalized wastewater samples routinely tested negative this critical observation suggests that wastewater based monitoring of sars cov 2 may be most sensitive for identifying acutely occurring incident cases accordingly wastewater based monitoring of individual high risk facilities i e hospitals nursing homes and industrial meat plants providing more granular data through to wwtp may have great merit a key limitation to the identification of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples relative to clinical samples e g swabs is the massive volume of water in which samples are diluted this necessitates sample concentration while procedures for the efficient recovery of non enveloped viruses exist researchers continue to search for satisfactory protocols for enveloped viruses such as sars cov 2 alygizakis et al 2021 many groups have explored ways to improve the sensitivity of wastewater sars cov 2 detection diagnostic platforms with improved sensitivity and more impervious to impurities in the wastewater matrix i e digital droplet rt pcr also show considerable promise falzone et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 sampling in the proximal sewershed may lead to day to day variance resulting in signal noise this is particularly true for single facility studies where potential extremes in individual virus shedding could confound results limited data suggests significant variations in fecal viral load occur from 103 4 to 107 6 cheung et al 2020 this is a key challenge that remains to be solved if wastewater data is to be used in a meaningful way similarly issues arise with attempts to normalize sars cov 2 based on the contributing population we chose to use the pmmov as a fecal biomarker to control for variations in fecal loading a particular risk when sampling takes place upstream in the sewershed while this marker has been validated in wwtp samples where large and diverse populations contribute to sewage kitajima et al 2018 hospitals are a much smaller collection of individuals and variations in pmmov excretion owing to differences in diet could have a much larger impact colson et al 2010 by capturing longitudinal data from three tertiary care hospitals 2100 inpatient beds we have demonstrated that passive wastewater monitoring is indeed possible at a range of hospital facilities whereas hospital 1 and hospital 2 had a single municipal access point enabling surveillance of the entire facility hospital 3 required three locations to capture fully as patients were frequently moved from one unit building to another either based on attending services geographic location covid positive patient cohorting or need for intensive care support attributing sars cov 2 signal in the wastewater of this facility was more complicated but nonetheless correlations were evident furthermore while nursing staff is often assigned to individual units many allied health workers and physicians work or consult throughout the entire facility if passive wastewater monitoring is to be adapted for other aspects of nosocomial surveillance i e antibiotic consumption emergence of antimicrobial resistant organisms etc a keen insight into the collection network is required there are limitations of our work that merit discussion given the complexity involved in sample collection we were limited to twice weekly sampling knowing how quickly sars cov 2 can spread and outbreaks can occur a daily monitoring strategy would have much greater capacity to identify and mitigate secondary cases of covid 19 incident cases are likely to be clinically diagnosed in hospital far faster than in other high risk facilities owing to greater resources and heightened suspicion potentially leading to an even greater lead time associated with a positive wastewater signal of outbreaks than observed herein hospitals pose unique challenges in wastewater monitoring owing to these facilities high use of chemical disinfectants and detergents zotesso et al 2017 that could interfere with molecular assays this may explain why 3 6 of our samples spiked controls and pmmov were not detected by rt qpcr to minimize the risk of false negatives rigorous protocols that use internal controls such as our bcov spike are necessary the role of pcr inhibitors in the wastewater matrix within the proximal sewershed is an area that deserves considerable study if this field is to expand wastewater based monitoring can only effectively monitor those individuals that contribute fecal matter to the sewershed importantly hospitalized patients those most vulnerable to covid 19 adverse events are often unable to self toilet rather these sick and often elderly individuals are dependent on continence aids adult diapers sanitary pads and nursing cleanup this results in fecal matter from these individuals being disposed into biohazard solid waste accordingly wastewater based sampling could miss between 10 and 20 of patients in general hospital patients condon et al 2019 toba et al 1996 this proportion is expected to be even higher in intensive care units where immobilization necessitated through ventilatory support further heightens toileting assistance requirements adapting wastewater surveillance technology to other high risk settings like long term care will encounter this same limitation finally tracking workers through passive wastewater monitoring poses inherent challenges there is data that suggests that 52 56 of employees are uncomfortable defecating at work bennet 2019 mackenzie 2016 5 conclusion in a five month observational study we were able to detect sars cov 2 from the wastewater of calgary s three largest tertiary care hospitals the rate of sars cov 2 wastewater test positivity and rna abundance increased over time concomitant with the increasing proportion of patients hospitalized with covid 19 despite persistent low levels of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater resulting from patients being treated for and recovering from covid 19 acquired in the community we detected spikes attributable to hospital acquired infections and outbreaks this study reveals that wastewater based monitoring of sars cov 2 rna holds promise for early detection monitoring and containment of incident infections credit authorship contribution statement nicole acosta formal analysis

16899,soot nanoparticles snps undergo aging processes in aqueous systems altering their physicochemical properties and affecting their fate and transport this study investigated the aging effects via ultraviolet irradiation on aggregation kinetics of snps in water the results showed that compared to fresh snps those irradiated for 1 day aggregated more easily in nacl and cacl2 solutions with reduction of critical coagulation concentrations by 72 and 40 respectively similar phenomena were found in additional six electrolyte solutions and snps irradiated for 3 days had no measurable difference in aggregation rate the aggregation enhancement of irradiated snps was more prominent at low electrolyte concentrations and ph 4 however in the presence of macromolecules irradiated snps could be stabilized against aggregation via steric hindrance with strength of bovine serum albumin humic acid alginate fulvic acid whereas alginate further destabilized aged snps via calcium bridging the fitted hamaker constant increased from 7 8 10 20 fresh to 1 2 10 19 j 7 day irradiated suggesting that decarboxylation during irradiation may weaken electrical repulsion and enhance van der waals attraction promoting aggregation these results demonstrated the vital role of uv induced aging in fate and transport of snps in wet environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords black carbon surface water photolytic aging colloidal stability hamaker constant environmental macromolecule 1 introduction soot particles are carbonaceous particulate matter produced annually at 8 million tons from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass during which simple hydrocarbons grow into soot nanoparticles snps with dimension 100 nm kerr 2013 murray and tirthankar 2018 these snps are ubiquitous in wet water containing environments including surface water raindrops and clouds with short atmospheric lifetimes snps continuously enter aquatic environments in large amounts through deposition e g 70 tg c year 1 on the global ocean and fluvial discharge fang et al 2016 mari et al 2014 they are key pollutants and also are strong adsorbents for toxic contaminants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals dandajeh et al 2017 davidson et al 2005 possessing various adverse health effects the presence of snps in water bodies can act as pollutant carriers nguyen and ball 2006 affect nutrient transport shiu et al 2014 interact with biological species mari et al 2014 and impact the global carbon cycle schmidt 2004 the impacts of snps in wet environments are closely related to their unique nano sizes highly condensed structure and large specific surface area which are strongly dependent upon their aggregation states under different aqueous conditions schnitzler et al 2014 meanwhile these strong light adsorbing snps are often referred to as black carbon bc booth and bellouin 2015 chen and huang 2017 which likely undergo photochemical aging processes when exposed to ultraviolet uv irradiation that may change their physicochemical properties ward et al 2014 wittbom et al 2014 xu et al 2017 therefore understanding the aggregation behaviors of snps in water under the influence of uv irradiation is crucial for evaluating their environmental fate and transport and potential risks to date only few studies have assessed the aggregation process of snps or bc nanoparticles nps in wet environments it was previously shown that the aggregation kinetics of fresh diesel snps were variously affected by solution chemistry chen and huang 2017 and macromolecules chen et al 2019 with their aggregation behaviors generally following the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory li et al 2021 another study reported that sunlight irradiation enhanced the colloidal stability of dissolved bc dbc by increasing its negative surface charge and hydrophilicity xu et al 2017 yet such effect on aggregation kinetics of refractory bc particulates such as soot remains unknown a recent study investigated the chemical aging effect of no2 on the aggregation and adsorption behaviors on micron sized soot with the presence of natural organic matter nom sigmund et al 2019 however uv irradiation may have strong impacts on snps as they are frequently exposed to and could efficiently absorb sunlight in wet environments the photolytically aged snps should presumably exhibit aggregation kinetics distinctly different from fresh snps in water prior research on uv influenced particle aggregation focused on manufactured carbonaceous nps cnps regardless of the fact that they are present in aquatic environments with concentrations 104 to 107 times lower than bc nps koelmans et al 2009 for instance qu et al 2010 reported that uv irradiation inhibited aggregation of fullerene nc60 nps due to increased negative charge and reduced hydrophobicity while enhanced aggregation of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts by decarboxylation hwang et al 2013 other studies of photochemical processing on soot were conducted in clouds showing effects of increased hygroscopicity ma et al 2013 wei et al 2017 wittbom et al 2014 enhanced reactivity with o3 and nox monge et al 2010 zelenay et al 2011 and aggregate restructuring from chainlike shape to compact structure that absorbs sunlight more efficiently adachi et al 2010 mikhailov et al 2006 nevertheless it remains unclear how uv irradiation would affect the aggregation kinetics of snps in water governed by interparticle interactions the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of uv irradiation on aggregation kinetics of snps in wet environments diesel particulate matter representing one of the most environmentally relevant anthropogenic types of soot was selected zhang et al 2008 solar irradiation was simulated with uva under natural intensity for various durations 0 7 d because it is the major uv emission reaching the earth surface liu et al 2019 the aggregation kinetics of variously aged snps were examined under different solution and macromolecule conditions using time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls technique solutions containing monovalent 0 01 2 m of nacl kcl nano3 na2so4 or nh4cl or divalent 0 001 0 2 m cacl2 mgcl2 or bacl2 electrolytes at ph 3 10 represented typical conditions in natural wet environments petosa et al 2010 four representative macromolecules included suwannee river humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa as two nom models one bovine serum albumin bsa protein and one sodium alginate alg polysaccharide these macromolecules were selected for comparison because they are ubiquitously present in surface water saleh et al 2010 and clouds zhao et al 2013 with distinct chemical structures and properties for instance ha represents a hydrophobic and semi rigid nom while fa is relatively less hydrophobic alg represents a hydrophilic and semi flexible polysaccharide and bsa is hydrophobic and globular possessing a protein tertiary structure liu et al 2020 physicochemical characterizations for determining the attachment efficiency zeta ζ potential surface composition and hydrophobicity were coupled with theoretical fitting for calculating the hamaker constant and interparticle force to elucidate the aging and aggregation mechanisms of snps our results indicate that uv irradiation significantly enhanced aggregation and reduced hydrophobicity of snps in water which may have strong influence on their environmental fate and transport as well as ecological and health effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the snps standard reference material 1650b purchased from national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md represent particulate matter emitted from heavy duty diesel engines and have reference value for basic physicochemical properties nist 2013 the snp stock suspension was prepared at 20 mg l which was later diluted to 10 mg l when initiating aggregation experiments this latter concentration was about twice the highest value 5 5 mg l of soot concentrations in natural wet environments table s1 it was chosen in our previous studies chen and huang 2017 chen et al 2019 and by others chowdhury et al 2013 to ensure the detection accuracy of tr dls technique for measuring aggregation kinetics of cnps monovalent and divalent electrolyte solutions were prepared at 0 01 2 and 0 001 0 2 m respectively at ph 3 10 these solution conditions are commonly chosen to simulate those in wet environments including freshwater rivers and streams seawater and cloud water table s2 for studying aggregation kinetics of nps petosa et al 2010 the influence of 4 macromolecules at typical environmental concentrations i e total organic carbon toc contents of 1 5 and 10 mg c l on the stability of fresh and aged snps were investigated in nacl 60 and 200 mm and cacl2 2 and 6 mm solutions these ionic levels were selected such that the effect of macromolecules on snp aggregation could be observed the preparation methods for snp electrolyte and macromolecule solutions are described in s1 1 of the supplementary material 2 2 irradiation experiments the irradiation experiment was carried out in a kl ghx 1d photoreactor shanghai kezhen instrument co ltd equipped with a uv lamp λ 365 50 nm fig s1a liu et al 2019 qu et al 2010 the uv lamp provided a constant light intensity of approximately 2 mw cm2 after absorption by the quartz sample cell as measured with a radiometer st 510 sentry optronics corp taiwan which was comparable to the light intensity reaching the ground level on a sunny day in guangzhou guangdong china 23 9 27 5400 n 113 21 27 2988 e fig s1b separate batches of 100 ml aqueous samples containing 20 mg l snps adjusted to ph 6 were added into each quartz sample cell sealed with parafilm placed on the merry go round photoreactor surrounding the uv lamp and slowly stirred to ensure uniform light exposure the photoreactor was maintained at 25 0 1 c with circulation of condensing water throughout the experiment samples continuously irradiated in the photoreactor for 0 25 6 h 0 35 8 4 h 0 5 12 h 1 3 5 and 7 d were withdrawn and stored in the dark before measurement water loss due to evaporation during irradiation was compensated with milli q water note that these experimentally continuous irradiation durations could be corrected to natural irradiation durations which correspond to about 1 1 4 2 4 12 20 and 28 d considering the alternation of days and nights table s3 2 3 characterizations the mean initial intensity weighted z averaged hydrodynamic diameters d h0 with polydispersity index pdi values of snps in milli q water were determined with dynamic light scattering dls technique using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk which was also employed for measuring the ζ potentials fresh and aged snp suspensions were filtered for characterizations the filtered particles were examined with transmission electron microscope optical contact angle measuring device fourier transform infrared ftir spectra scanning electron microscope elemental analysis and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the filtrate was analyzed with toc analyzer high performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ion chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr spectrometer the contents of titratable functional groups on fresh and aged snps were determined by potentiometric titration the above detailed characterization methods are described in s1 2 of the supplementary material 2 4 aggregation kinetics the increase in particle size over time for snps under different solution conditions was measured with tr dls following previous methods s1 3 of the supplementary material chen and huang 2017 the initial aggregation rate constant k is positively correlated with the change in intensity weighted hydrodynamic diameter d h over time t and is negatively correlated with the initial snp concentration n 0 of 10 mg l li et al 2021 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where k is the slope determined as the ratio of the difference between 1 5d h0 and d h0 over the elapsed time so that the early stage t 0 aggregation kinetics could be determined for those aggregation experiments with final d h values below 1 5d h0 the slope was still determined by extrapolating a straight line through all data points the attachment efficiency ɑ ranging from 0 no aggregation to 1 fast or diffusion limited aggregation was determined to construct the stability curves since all experiments ensured a constant n 0 of 10 mg l snps ɑ was calculated by normalizing k under different solution conditions by the slope obtained under diffusion limited k fast aggregation conditions li et al 2021 2 α k k f a s t 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 1 n 0 f a s t d d h t d t t 0 f a s t d d h t d t t 0 d d h t d t t 0 f a s t the critical coagulation concentrations ccc value which represents the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited fast aggregation was determined for each stability profile by empirical fitting using eq s1 in general a higher ccc value indicates stronger colloidal stability of particles against aggregation the experimental α values for fresh and irradiated snps were used to fit the theoretical α calculated based on the dlvo theory eqs s2 s10 from which their hamaker constants through water interaction a sws with the subscripts representing soot water soot could be derived the detailed fitting procedures are described in s1 4 of the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of irradiation time the hydrodynamic size distribution curve of fresh snps shifted slightly to the left after uv irradiation while all curves remained monodispersed fig s2a the d h0 of fresh snps 164 1 1 5 nm decreased slightly by 5 67 after 7 day irradiation 154 8 1 6 nm while the distribution pdi0d 0 205 0 028 stayed relatively unchanged pdi7d 0 212 0 019 fig s2b consistently the transmission fig s3 and scanning electron microscope fig s4 images showed that their sizes decreased by 13 5 and 6 7 respectively after 7 day irradiation the results are similar with other cnps e g cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 and nc60 qu et al 2010 that underwent minor change in morphology and size after irradiation at the onset of uv irradiation the ζ potential results shifted upwards in both nacl and cacl2 solutions and such effect increased with irradiation time fig 1 a b for instance the ζ potentials under freshwater conditions decreased by 16 from 35 57 uv 0 d to 29 82 mv uv 7 d at 1 mm nacl and by 20 from 26 43 uv 0 d to 21 02 mv uv 7 d at 0 01 mm cacl2 most snps remained negatively charged except that positive ζ potentials started to appear at cacl2 concentrations 10 mm and irradiation time 12 h fig 1b our previous study demonstrated that snps acquired negative surface charge from deprotonation of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl and hydroxyl groups chen and huang 2017 therefore the observed charge neutralization effect upon uv irradiation may be related to photochemical transformation of the snp surface functionalities hwang et al 2013 as addressed later fig 1c d show that the ccc values significantly decreased with longer irradiation time indicating that the irradiated snps had a weaker colloidal stability and underwent faster particle aggregation in electrolyte solution compared with fresh snps the stability curves of irradiated snps in nacl and cacl2 solutions continuously shifted to the left with extended irradiation time until 1 3 d however prolonged irradiation resulted in overlapping of stability curves more illustrative effect of uv irradiation on snps can be observed in the aggregation profiles fig s5a b for instance the d h of fresh snps only increased to 363 nm after 20 min in 100 mm nacl whereas irradiated snps underwent faster aggregation with d h increased up to 800 nm after irradiation 1 d fig s5a similar effect was also observed at 1 mm cacl2 except that no further increase of aggregation rate appeared after irradiation 3 d fig s5b the ccc values as a function of irradiation time fig 1c d were fitted in fig s5c showing linear negative correlations within 1 d in nacl r 2 0 9250 and 3 d in cacl2 r 2 0 8491 the promotion effect on snp aggregation disappeared after 3 day irradiation until which the ccc values were reduced from 145 to 33 mm nacl by 77 and from 3 5 to 1 3 mm cacl2 by 63 this result correlated with the reduced ζ potentials of aged snps which also showed major changes in the first 3 d of irradiation fig 1a b in comparison our study also shows that irradiation under xenon lamp emitting longer wavelength 380 780 nm than uva 365 50 nm did not induce apparent effect on the ζ potential or attachment efficiency of snps in electrolyte solutions fig s6 previous studies reported that sunlight irradiation may promote or inhibit the aggregation of other cnps which are compared with snps in table s4 similar to this study uva irradiation on cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 and uvc irradiation on reduced graphene oxide he et al 2019 also promoted the aggregation of these cnps contrarily the aggregation of nc60 lee et al 2009 and mwcnts czech et al 2015 after uvc irradiation and the aggregation of dbc xu et al 2017 after xenon lamp irradiation were inhibited in particular more complex phenomena were observed for nc60 qu et al 2010 which underwent slower aggregation in nacl solution but faster aggregation in cacl2 solution after uva irradiation in this study since the aggregation enhancement of irradiated snps was the most significant after continuous irradiation for 1 and 3 d in nacl and cacl2 solution respectively fig 1c d the following experiments only focused on the 7 day irradiated snps to examine the prolonged irradiation effect it should also be noted that the critical durations of continuous irradiation for 1 and 3 d in our experiments could be corrected to 4 and 12 d respectively under natural conditions considering the alternation of days and nights table s3 3 2 aggregation kinetics of aged snps in various electrolyte solutions the ζ potentials of fresh and 7 day irradiated snps were determined in various concentrations of monovalent nacl kcl nano3 na2so4 and nh4cl and divalent cacl2 mgcl2 and bacl2 electrolyte solutions at ph 6 fig s7 the results show that the ζ potential of snps was strongly influenced by uv irradiation and cationic valence but not by the types of cation or anion the trends of ζ potential for fresh snps shifted upwards after uv irradiation in all electrolyte solutions such reduction in negative charge due to uv irradiation was more obvious at lower electrolyte concentrations relevant to freshwater and cloud water conditions e g 10 mm monovalent and 0 1 mm divalent salts than in seawater and estuary environments table s2 corresponding to the above ζ potential results fig 2 a b show that uv irradiation promoted snp aggregation in 8 types of electrolyte solutions by reducing their negative charge the stability curves of fresh snps all shifted to the left after 7 day irradiation with their ccc values decreased by 61 74 table s5 for both fresh and aged snps the cationic valence was the only influencing factor of electrolyte composition on their aggregation rates since the stability curves generally overlapped for different monovalent or divalent electrolytes in particular the ccc values of fresh or aged snps in na2so4 were about half of those in other monovalent salts as na2so4 possesses two na cations the schulze hardy rule predicts that the ccc is proportional to z 6 z is the counterion valence for surfaces of high charge density to z 2 for surfaces with low charge density petosa et al 2010 as shown in table s6 the power terms were 4 5 5 6 for fresh snps and 4 3 5 7 for 7 day irradiated snps in 8 electrolytes therefore both fresh and aged snps exhibited aggregation behaviors in agreement with the schulze hardy rule which holds for indifferent electrolytes that do not form any specific interactions with the particle surface this result indicates that all 8 electrolytes induced aggregation of fresh and aged snps only via electrostatic interactions in contrast to the aged nc60 qu et al 2010 and tio2 zhang et al 2016 nps which violated the schulze hardy rule due to specific interactions of ca2 with carboxyl groups formed during uv irradiation comparison on the aggregation rates of fresh and 7 day irradiated snps in nacl solutions having different ph showed that uv irradiation promoted snp aggregation more significantly under neutral and basic conditions than under acidic condition figs 2c d and s8c d for fresh snps their aggregation rates in nacl increased with decreasing ph as in accordance with previous reports fig 2c chen and huang 2017 chowdhury et al 2013 smith et al 2009 meanwhile their stability curves distributed widely over the ph range fig s8c however the aggregation rates of 7 day irradiated snps were similar under different ph conditions fig 2c yielding overlapped stability curves in fig s8d although the ccc values had linear correlations with ph for both fresh r 2 0 9748 and aged r 2 0 8490 snps in nacl solution the fitting slope of aged snps 3 706 was 10 times shallower than that of fresh snps 37 82 fig 2d moreover after 7 day irradiation the ccc value of fresh snps was lowered by 82 from 300 to 55 mm nacl at ph 10 and by 21 from 48 to 38 mm nacl at ph 4 yet it remained relatively unchanged at ph 3 table s5 these results of aggregation rates corresponded to the ζ potential analysis on fresh and 7 day irradiated snps in nacl solutions having different ph fig s8a b it shows that the range of ζ potentials 42 31 5 50 mv for fresh snps at various ph became narrower after uv irradiation 38 15 5 94 mv for 7 day irradiated snps therefore uv irradiation would reduce the sensitivity of the colloidal stability of snps to the change in solution ph overall the above results indicate that considering only the effects of electrolyte and ph table s2 uv irradiation may increase the tendency of snps to aggregate in neutral clouds and freshwater but less likely in acidic or saline environments 3 3 aggregation kinetics of aged snps in the presence of macromolecules the influence of four macromolecules on colloidal stability of fresh and aged snps was investigated at two concentration levels of nacl and cacl2 solutions figs 3 and s9 the reduction percentages of α due to macromolecules 0 vs 10 mg c l under different conditions are compared in table s7 the results show that ha significantly retarded the aggregation of both fresh and aged snps in four electrolyte solutions i e 60 and 200 mm nacl and 2 and 6 mm cacl2 the stabilization effect was enhanced with increasing ha concentration and was stronger for aged snps the greatest difference between the stabilization of fresh and aged snps by ha was observed at 60 mm nacl fig s9c as α was reduced by 50 for fresh snps while by 98 for 7 day irradiated snps at 10 mg c l ha table s7 this suggests that the promoted aggregation of aged snps by uv irradiation could be stabilized with ha this result was likely due to the steric hindrance effect imparted by ha adsorbed onto particle surfaces of snps liu et al 2019 and other cnps as previously reported saleh et al 2008 2010 zhang et al 2013 the electrostatic repulsion promoted by ha may also contribute to stabilization enhancement as the ζ potentials of most snps became more negative with addition of ha the stabilization effect of ha on both fresh and aged snps in both nacl and cacl2 solutions was consistent with the results reported for nc60 qu et al 2010 compared with ha fa having lower hydrophobicity and molecular weight zhang et al 2013 induced much weaker stabilization on both fresh and aged snps at high ionic concentration levels i e 200 mm nacl and 6 mm cacl2 fig 3 only one noticeable reduction in aggregation rate was found for fresh snps at 6 mm cacl2 and 1 mg c l fa which was likely attributed to the most enhanced ζ potential the stabilization by fa became important on aged snps at lower ionic concentration levels e g 60 mm nacl and 2 mm cacl2 fig s9 as α was reduced by up to 86 with 10 mg c l fa in comparison the reduction percentage was 38 at high ionic concentration levels i e 200 mm nacl and 6 mm cacl2 table s7 the result suggests that the aggregation of aged snps could only be effectively stabilized by fa at low ionic concentrations among all the tested macromolecules bsa exhibited the strongest stabilization effect on both fresh and aged snps in nacl and cacl2 solutions figs 3 and s9 indicating its important role in the stability of snps especially after uv irradiation as α 0 1 generally suggests negligible aggregation the presence of only 1 mg c l bsa effectively inhibited all aggregation even for the uv irradiated snps at high ionic concentrations about 100 reduction of aggregation rate was achieved at 10 mg c l bsa under all experimental conditions table s7 it has been reported that bsa effectively stabilized snps chen et al 2019 and other nps including swnts saleh et al 2010 and aunps bhirde et al 2014 because of its compact globular structure that imparted the greatest adsorption and long range steric repulsive forces compared with other three macromolecules with relatively linear structures the current results show that such stabilization effect remained prominent for photolytically aged snps the reduced negative ζ potentials of snps in the presence of bsa was related to its spontaneous adsorption onto particle surface during which incorporation of sodium and calcium cations from solution and dehydration of amino acids in bsa occurred norde and giacomelli 2000 the presence of alg in 200 and 60 mm nacl solutions resulted in slight stabilization of both fresh and aged snps fig 3 the stabilization effect due to steric hindrance in nacl solutions followed the order of bsa ha alg fa which was consistent with previous studies and was originated from their difference in molecular structure and hydrophobicity huangfu et al 2013 liu et al 2019 saleh et al 2010 much stronger stabilization of aged snps 85 reduction of α was observed at 60 mm nacl compared to fresh snps 28 reduction of α table s7 at 6 mm cacl2 which was above the ccc values of both fresh 3 5 mm and 7 day irradiated 1 2 mm snps alg exhibited strong destabilization effect as α was greater than unity fig 3d it was likely due to molecular bridging between ca2 with the guluronic acid blocks of alg to form gel networks davis et al 2003 which significantly promoted snp aggregation however distinct phenomenon was observed at 2 mm cacl2 which was below the ccc of fresh snps but above that of aged snps fig s9d instead of forming alg gel that promotes snp aggregation alg stabilized fresh snps at 2 mm cacl2 by up to 68 table s7 while exerted negligible effect on aged snps this result indicates that alg bridging only appears at ca2 concentration above its ccc which would be lowered by uv irradiation therefore under this circumstance uv irradiation increased the likelihood of alg bridging that significantly destabilized snps otherwise in all nacl solutions or at calcium concentration below its ccc value alg would exert a reverse effect by stabilizing both fresh and aged snps 3 4 change in hamaker constant of snps after uv irradiation fig 4 a shows that the dlvo theoretical curves generally fitted through the measured aggregation data for both fresh and uv irradiated snps indicating that they exhibited aggregation kinetics predictable from dlvo theory this result was consistent with previous studies that the aggregation behavior of other nps including cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 tio2 zhang et al 2016 and nanoplastics liu et al 2019 still followed the dlvo theory after uv irradiation nevertheless minor deviations existed among the dlvo prediction and experimental data especially at nacl concentrations below the ccc of fresh 145 mm and 7 day irradiated 38 mm snps fig 4a similar discrepancy was previously reported for fresh snps li et al 2021 which was attributed to their partially aggregated structure and non spherical shapes figs s2 s4 that violated the spherical assumption of dlvo theory the dlvo fitting process yielded the hamaker constants for fresh snps and snps irradiated for 6 h 8 4 h 12 h and 7 d in aqueous medium a sws as 7 6 10 21 9 9 10 21 1 8 10 20 2 2 10 20 and 2 4 10 20 j respectively fig 4a the fitted a sws values gradually increased with prolonged uv irradiation time the irradiation for 7 d significantly increased the hamaker constant of snps by 68 which then enhanced van der waals attraction energy v a according to eq s5 considering that r h only decreased by 5 67 after irradiation fig s2 the enhanced v a and the weakened electrical repulsion energy v r jointly contributed to the faster aggregation of snps after uv irradiation as the hamaker constant only relates to material property israelachvili 1991 it implies that uv irradiation induced structural change of snps as revealed later with physicochemical characterizations by inputting a sws to eq s10 the hamaker constants for fresh and 7 day irradiated diesel snps in vacuum a ss where the subscripts represent soot soot were calculated as 7 8 10 20 and 1 2 10 19 j respectively these values cover the range of a ss reported in the literature for flame formed soot particles 9 5 10 20 to 1 0 10 19 j de falco et al 2015 di stasio et al 2002 and fresh diesel soot particles 9 7 10 20 j chen and huang 2017 in addition the fitted a sws 7 6 10 21 j and a ss 7 8 10 20 j values for fresh snps were very close to their recent report of 7 8 10 21 and 7 9 10 20 j respectively li et al 2021 it is also noted that opposite result was observed on nanoplastics whose hamaker constant was reduced after uv irradiation under similar conditions liu et al 2019 the derived hamaker constants for fresh and 7 day irradiated snps were used to predict their microscopic interaction energy v t as a function of particle separation distance at different nacl concentrations fig 4b the results show that v t for both fresh and 7 day irradiated snps was mostly positive at 1 and 20 mm nacl indicating strong v r in the reaction limited regime that prevented aggregation the negative v t at close separation 1 nm represents primary minimum due to strong v a causing irreversible aggregation elimelech et al 1995 the analyses supported our previous discussion that 7 day irradiated snps had lower v t than fresh snps because of the binary effect from the charge screening that reduced v r and the increased hamaker constant that enhanced v a the increase of nacl concentration to the ccc for fresh 145 mm and 7 day irradiated 38 mm snps resulted in the energy barrier approaching zero where v r was completely diminished while v a dominated chen and huang 2017 secondary minimum appeared under this condition where unstable and reversible aggregation occurred further increase of electrolyte concentration resulted in v t approaching the pure v a with the 7 day irradiated snps being more sensitive than fresh snps which reveals the important role of uv irradiation on stability of snps in wet environments 3 5 photolytic aging mechanisms to elucidate the photolytic aging mechanisms the particle and solution phases of fresh and irradiated snps were thoroughly characterized their xps spectra are presented in fig s10 with the relative intensities of fitted carbon and oxygen containing functional groups compiled in table 1 coupling the analysis of c 1 s and o 1 s xps spectra the surfaces of both fresh and aged snps mainly contained c o coh co c c6h5 and ch3 after 7 day irradiation the c o and coh groups decreased by 6 7 and 5 5 respectively this is consistent with the ftir analysis fig 4c which shows significant decrease of oh at 3410 cm 1 and carboxyl coh at 1107 cm 1 after irradiation meanwhile the elemental contents of o and h analyzed with elemental analysis and xps also decreased for aged snps table s8 these results suggest that hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh groups had detached from snps possibly due to the attack of reactive oxygen groups ros e g 1o2 during uv irradiation eqs 3 5 fu et al 2016 during uv irradiation snps may generate ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 in the suspension as described by eq 3 the carbonyl containing structures on snps may be involved in the generation of 1o2 both the ftir fig 4c and o 1 s xps table 1 analyses showed decrease of c o on snps after irradiation the uv irradiation may break the carbonyl group c o to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 at exited state which was also reported for dissolved black carbon fu et al 2016 3 under the attack of ros including singlet oxygen hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh groups were detached from snps into solution as shown by the ftir fig 4c xps table 1 and 1h nmr table 1 analyses similar decarboxylation effect induced by uv irradiation has been reported for cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 meanwhile the aromatic rings were cleaved to form aliphatic hydrocarbons on snps leading to decreased hydrophobicity the above reactions could be described with eq 4 which was supported by the ftir fig 4c xps table 1 1h nmr table 1 and contact angle analyses fig s12 and was also observed for dissolved black carbon xu et al 2017 the detached carboxyl structures from snps formed small organic acids such as oxalic acid eq 5 which was detected in solution and contributed to the increased toc content fig s11 4 5 consistently 1h nmr analysis shows that the percentage of protons attached to oxygen and nitrogen i e heteroatom substituted decreased by half from 85 2 to 46 8 after irradiation table 1 as the content of nitrogen was minimal 3 table s8 the 1h nmr result also indicates that uv irradiation reduced functional groups such as oh and cooh on snps this is consistent with the decarboxylation of cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 but is contrary to dbc xu et al 2017 and nc60 lee et al 2009 taylor et al 1991 which acquired more oxygen containing functional groups after light irradiation as our prior research found that snps mainly acquire negative surface charge from oh and cooh chen and huang 2017 their lost induced by uv irradiation had resulted in the less negative ζ potentials thus enhancing the aggregation of aged snps the potentiometric titration results are presented in fig 4d which shows that both fresh and 7 day irradiated snps contained acidic functional groups as they consumed more naoh than the blanks meanwhile 14 6 more naoh was required to titrate the suspension containing 7 day irradiated snps compared with fresh snps during measurement both the particles and solution were simultaneously titrated for fresh snps oh and cooh on particle surface would deprotonate into solution acting as ph buffers that consumed naoh chen and huang 2017 however decarboxylation occurred on aged snps leading to formation of organic acids e g c2h2o4 in solution eq 5 and the corresponding increase in toc content with prolonged irradiation fig s11 lee et al 2009 this contributed to the right shift of titration curve for aged snps nevertheless the concentrations measured for inorganic anions and heavy metals in solutions filtering out snps at different aging status showed insignificant change table s9 indicating no release of these ions from snps fig s12 indicates that snps became less hydrophobic after uv irradiation as their contact angles with water decreased by 14 from 131 9 0 8 to 113 9 0 5 table s10 this result conflicts with the reduction in oxygen containing functional groups which should have led to increased hydrophobicity the contradiction may be explained by the change in carbon bonds induced by uv irradiation as shown in table 1 the c 1 s xps spectra indicates that the aromatic carbon decreased by 1 whereas ch3 increased by 0 8 meanwhile the 1h nmr shows significant reduction of aromatic h by 40 6 and increase of ch2 and ch by 82 2 the ftir analysis fig 4c also reveals the decreased aromatic c c and c o peaks at 1598 1627 cm 1 the disappearance of aromatic ch peaks at 568 671 cm 1 and the enhanced ch3 and ch2 peaks at 2920 and 2850 cm 1 respectively fang et al 2015 fanning and vannice 1993 the above characterizations suggest that light irradiation cleaved aromatic rings and generated aliphatic hydrocarbons on snps eq 4 as also had been found for dbc xu et al 2017 this process significantly reduced the aromaticity of snps which overcame the effect of decarboxylation leading to an overall decreased hydrophobicity for aged snps 4 conclusions the results from this study suggest that the aggregation of snps in water may be affected by the complex interplay among uv irradiation solution chemistry and macromolecules fresh snps were significantly destabilized by uva irradiation due to its binary effects that weakened v r and enhanced v a meanwhile aromatic ring cleavage attributed to irradiation decreased their hydrophobicity aggregation of snps after various durations 0 7 d of uva irradiation all followed the dlvo theory allowing for model prediction for their transport in aqueous systems irradiation by uva on fresh snps for above 1 under experimental condition or 4 d under natural condition may significantly promote their aggregation in neutral freshwater and clouds whereas such effect may be weakened under acidic conditions macromolecules could stabilize both fresh and aged snps with the order of bsa ha alg fa while uv irradiation may increase the likelihood of alg bridging with ca2 that further destabilize aged snps in comparison snps were much more sensitive to uva irradiation compared to the longer wavelength irradiation by xenon lamp which did not induce apparent effect on stability of snps supplementary material supplementary

16899,soot nanoparticles snps undergo aging processes in aqueous systems altering their physicochemical properties and affecting their fate and transport this study investigated the aging effects via ultraviolet irradiation on aggregation kinetics of snps in water the results showed that compared to fresh snps those irradiated for 1 day aggregated more easily in nacl and cacl2 solutions with reduction of critical coagulation concentrations by 72 and 40 respectively similar phenomena were found in additional six electrolyte solutions and snps irradiated for 3 days had no measurable difference in aggregation rate the aggregation enhancement of irradiated snps was more prominent at low electrolyte concentrations and ph 4 however in the presence of macromolecules irradiated snps could be stabilized against aggregation via steric hindrance with strength of bovine serum albumin humic acid alginate fulvic acid whereas alginate further destabilized aged snps via calcium bridging the fitted hamaker constant increased from 7 8 10 20 fresh to 1 2 10 19 j 7 day irradiated suggesting that decarboxylation during irradiation may weaken electrical repulsion and enhance van der waals attraction promoting aggregation these results demonstrated the vital role of uv induced aging in fate and transport of snps in wet environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords black carbon surface water photolytic aging colloidal stability hamaker constant environmental macromolecule 1 introduction soot particles are carbonaceous particulate matter produced annually at 8 million tons from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass during which simple hydrocarbons grow into soot nanoparticles snps with dimension 100 nm kerr 2013 murray and tirthankar 2018 these snps are ubiquitous in wet water containing environments including surface water raindrops and clouds with short atmospheric lifetimes snps continuously enter aquatic environments in large amounts through deposition e g 70 tg c year 1 on the global ocean and fluvial discharge fang et al 2016 mari et al 2014 they are key pollutants and also are strong adsorbents for toxic contaminants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals dandajeh et al 2017 davidson et al 2005 possessing various adverse health effects the presence of snps in water bodies can act as pollutant carriers nguyen and ball 2006 affect nutrient transport shiu et al 2014 interact with biological species mari et al 2014 and impact the global carbon cycle schmidt 2004 the impacts of snps in wet environments are closely related to their unique nano sizes highly condensed structure and large specific surface area which are strongly dependent upon their aggregation states under different aqueous conditions schnitzler et al 2014 meanwhile these strong light adsorbing snps are often referred to as black carbon bc booth and bellouin 2015 chen and huang 2017 which likely undergo photochemical aging processes when exposed to ultraviolet uv irradiation that may change their physicochemical properties ward et al 2014 wittbom et al 2014 xu et al 2017 therefore understanding the aggregation behaviors of snps in water under the influence of uv irradiation is crucial for evaluating their environmental fate and transport and potential risks to date only few studies have assessed the aggregation process of snps or bc nanoparticles nps in wet environments it was previously shown that the aggregation kinetics of fresh diesel snps were variously affected by solution chemistry chen and huang 2017 and macromolecules chen et al 2019 with their aggregation behaviors generally following the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory li et al 2021 another study reported that sunlight irradiation enhanced the colloidal stability of dissolved bc dbc by increasing its negative surface charge and hydrophilicity xu et al 2017 yet such effect on aggregation kinetics of refractory bc particulates such as soot remains unknown a recent study investigated the chemical aging effect of no2 on the aggregation and adsorption behaviors on micron sized soot with the presence of natural organic matter nom sigmund et al 2019 however uv irradiation may have strong impacts on snps as they are frequently exposed to and could efficiently absorb sunlight in wet environments the photolytically aged snps should presumably exhibit aggregation kinetics distinctly different from fresh snps in water prior research on uv influenced particle aggregation focused on manufactured carbonaceous nps cnps regardless of the fact that they are present in aquatic environments with concentrations 104 to 107 times lower than bc nps koelmans et al 2009 for instance qu et al 2010 reported that uv irradiation inhibited aggregation of fullerene nc60 nps due to increased negative charge and reduced hydrophobicity while enhanced aggregation of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts by decarboxylation hwang et al 2013 other studies of photochemical processing on soot were conducted in clouds showing effects of increased hygroscopicity ma et al 2013 wei et al 2017 wittbom et al 2014 enhanced reactivity with o3 and nox monge et al 2010 zelenay et al 2011 and aggregate restructuring from chainlike shape to compact structure that absorbs sunlight more efficiently adachi et al 2010 mikhailov et al 2006 nevertheless it remains unclear how uv irradiation would affect the aggregation kinetics of snps in water governed by interparticle interactions the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of uv irradiation on aggregation kinetics of snps in wet environments diesel particulate matter representing one of the most environmentally relevant anthropogenic types of soot was selected zhang et al 2008 solar irradiation was simulated with uva under natural intensity for various durations 0 7 d because it is the major uv emission reaching the earth surface liu et al 2019 the aggregation kinetics of variously aged snps were examined under different solution and macromolecule conditions using time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls technique solutions containing monovalent 0 01 2 m of nacl kcl nano3 na2so4 or nh4cl or divalent 0 001 0 2 m cacl2 mgcl2 or bacl2 electrolytes at ph 3 10 represented typical conditions in natural wet environments petosa et al 2010 four representative macromolecules included suwannee river humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa as two nom models one bovine serum albumin bsa protein and one sodium alginate alg polysaccharide these macromolecules were selected for comparison because they are ubiquitously present in surface water saleh et al 2010 and clouds zhao et al 2013 with distinct chemical structures and properties for instance ha represents a hydrophobic and semi rigid nom while fa is relatively less hydrophobic alg represents a hydrophilic and semi flexible polysaccharide and bsa is hydrophobic and globular possessing a protein tertiary structure liu et al 2020 physicochemical characterizations for determining the attachment efficiency zeta ζ potential surface composition and hydrophobicity were coupled with theoretical fitting for calculating the hamaker constant and interparticle force to elucidate the aging and aggregation mechanisms of snps our results indicate that uv irradiation significantly enhanced aggregation and reduced hydrophobicity of snps in water which may have strong influence on their environmental fate and transport as well as ecological and health effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the snps standard reference material 1650b purchased from national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md represent particulate matter emitted from heavy duty diesel engines and have reference value for basic physicochemical properties nist 2013 the snp stock suspension was prepared at 20 mg l which was later diluted to 10 mg l when initiating aggregation experiments this latter concentration was about twice the highest value 5 5 mg l of soot concentrations in natural wet environments table s1 it was chosen in our previous studies chen and huang 2017 chen et al 2019 and by others chowdhury et al 2013 to ensure the detection accuracy of tr dls technique for measuring aggregation kinetics of cnps monovalent and divalent electrolyte solutions were prepared at 0 01 2 and 0 001 0 2 m respectively at ph 3 10 these solution conditions are commonly chosen to simulate those in wet environments including freshwater rivers and streams

contents of 1 5 and 10 mg c l on the stability of fresh and aged snps were investigated in nacl 60 and 200 mm and cacl2 2 and 6 mm solutions these ionic levels were selected such that the effect of macromolecules on snp aggregation could be observed the preparation methods for snp electrolyte and macromolecule solutions are described in s1 1 of the supplementary material 2 2 irradiation experiments the irradiation experiment was carried out in a kl ghx 1d photoreactor shanghai kezhen instrument co ltd equipped with a uv lamp λ 365 50 nm fig s1a liu et al 2019 qu et al 2010 the uv lamp provided a constant light intensity of approximately 2 mw cm2 after absorption by the quartz sample cell as measured with a radiometer st 510 sentry optronics corp taiwan which was comparable to the light intensity reaching the ground level on a sunny day in guangzhou guangdong china 23 9 27 5400 n 113 21 27 2988 e fig s1b separate batches of 100 ml aqueous samples containing 20 mg l snps adjusted to ph 6 were added into each quartz sample cell sealed with parafilm placed on the merry go round photoreactor surrounding the uv lamp and slowly stirred to ensure uniform light exposure the photoreactor was maintained at 25 0 1 c with circulation of condensing water throughout the experiment samples continuously irradiated in the photoreactor for 0 25 6 h 0 35 8 4 h 0 5 12 h 1 3 5 and 7

durations could be corrected to natural irradiation durations which correspond to about 1 1 4 2 4 12 20 and 28 d considering the alternation of days and nights table s3 2 3 characterizations the mean initial intensity weighted z averaged hydrodynamic diameters d h0 with polydispersity index pdi values of snps in milli q water were determined with dynamic light scattering dls technique using a

previous methods s1 3 of the supplementary material chen and huang 2017 the initial aggregation rate constant k is positively correlated with the change in intensity weighted hydrodynamic diameter d h over time t and is negatively correlated with the initial snp concentration n 0 of 10 mg l li et al 2021 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where k is the slope determined as the ratio of the difference between 1 5d h0 and d h0 over the elapsed time so that the early stage t 0 aggregation kinetics could be determined for those aggregation experiments with final d h values below 1 5d h0 the slope was still determined by extrapolating a straight line through all data points the attachment efficiency ɑ ranging from 0 no aggregation to 1 fast or diffusion limited aggregation was determined to construct the stability curves since all experiments ensured a constant n 0 of 10 mg l snps ɑ was calculated by normalizing k under different solution conditions by the slope obtained under diffusion

concentrations ccc value which represents the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited fast aggregation was determined for each stability profile by empirical fitting using eq s1 in general a higher ccc value indicates stronger colloidal stability of particles against aggregation the experimental α values for fresh and irradiated snps were used to fit the theoretical α calculated based on the dlvo theory eqs s2 s10 from which their hamaker constants through water interaction a sws with the subscripts representing soot water soot could be derived the detailed fitting procedures are described in s1 4 of the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of irradiation time the hydrodynamic size distribution curve of fresh snps shifted slightly to the left after uv irradiation while all curves remained monodispersed fig s2a the d h0 of fresh snps 164 1 1 5 nm decreased slightly by 5 67 after 7 day irradiation 154 8 1 6 nm while the distribution pdi0d 0 205 0 028 stayed relatively unchanged pdi7d 0 212 0 019 fig s2b consistently the transmission fig s3 and scanning electron microscope fig s4 images showed that their sizes decreased by 13 5 and 6 7 respectively after 7 day irradiation the results are similar with other cnps e g cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 and nc60 qu et al 2010 that underwent minor change in morphology and size after irradiation at the onset of uv irradiation the ζ potential results shifted upwards in both nacl and cacl2 solutions and such effect increased with irradiation time fig 1 a b for instance the ζ potentials under freshwater conditions decreased by 16 from 35 57 uv 0 d to 29 82 mv uv 7 d at 1 mm nacl and by 20 from 26 43 uv 0 d to 21 02 mv uv 7 d at 0 01 mm cacl2 most snps remained negatively charged except that positive ζ potentials started to appear at cacl2 concentrations 10 mm and irradiation time 12 h fig 1b our previous study demonstrated that snps acquired negative surface charge from deprotonation of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl and hydroxyl groups chen and huang 2017 therefore the observed charge neutralization effect upon uv irradiation may be related to photochemical transformation of the snp surface functionalities hwang et al 2013 as addressed later fig 1c d show that the ccc values significantly decreased with longer irradiation time indicating that the irradiated snps had a weaker colloidal stability and underwent faster particle aggregation in electrolyte solution compared with fresh snps the stability curves of irradiated snps in nacl and cacl2 solutions continuously shifted to the left with extended irradiation time until 1 3 d however prolonged irradiation resulted in overlapping of stability curves more illustrative effect of uv irradiation on snps can be observed in the aggregation profiles fig s5a b for instance the d h of fresh snps only increased to 363 nm after 20 min in 100 mm nacl whereas irradiated snps underwent faster aggregation with d h increased up to 800 nm after irradiation 1 d fig s5a similar effect was also observed at 1 mm cacl2 except that no further increase of aggregation rate appeared after irradiation 3 d fig s5b the ccc values as a function of irradiation time fig 1c d were fitted in fig s5c showing linear negative correlations within 1 d in nacl r 2 0 9250 and 3 d in cacl2 r 2 0 8491 the promotion effect on snp aggregation disappeared after 3 day irradiation until which the ccc values were reduced from 145 to 33 mm nacl by 77 and from 3 5 to 1 3 mm cacl2 by 63 this result correlated with the reduced ζ potentials of aged snps which also showed major changes in the first 3 d of irradiation fig 1a b in comparison our study also shows that irradiation under xenon lamp emitting longer wavelength 380 780 nm than uva 365 50 nm did not induce apparent effect on the ζ potential or attachment efficiency of snps in electrolyte solutions fig s6 previous studies reported that sunlight irradiation may promote or inhibit the aggregation of other cnps which are compared with snps in table s4 similar to this study uva irradiation on cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 and uvc irradiation on reduced graphene oxide he et al 2019 also promoted the aggregation of these cnps contrarily the aggregation of nc60 lee et al 2009 and mwcnts czech et al 2015 after uvc irradiation and the aggregation of dbc xu et al 2017 after xenon lamp irradiation were inhibited in particular more complex phenomena were observed for nc60 qu et al 2010 which underwent slower aggregation in nacl solution but faster aggregation in cacl2 solution after uva irradiation in this study since the aggregation enhancement of irradiated snps was the most significant after continuous irradiation for 1 and 3 d in nacl and cacl2 solution respectively fig 1c d the following experiments only focused on the 7 day irradiated snps to examine the prolonged irradiation effect it should also be noted that the critical durations of continuous irradiation for 1 and 3 d in our experiments could be corrected to 4 and 12 d respectively under natural conditions considering the alternation of days and nights table s3 3 2 aggregation kinetics of aged snps in various electrolyte solutions the ζ potentials of fresh and 7 day irradiated snps were determined in various concentrations of monovalent nacl kcl nano3 na2so4 and nh4cl and divalent cacl2 mgcl2 and bacl2 electrolyte solutions at ph 6 fig s7 the results show that the ζ potential of snps was strongly influenced by uv irradiation and cationic valence but not by the types of cation or anion the trends of ζ potential for fresh snps shifted upwards after uv irradiation in all electrolyte solutions such reduction in negative charge due to uv irradiation was more obvious at lower electrolyte concentrations relevant to freshwater and cloud water conditions e g 10 mm monovalent and 0 1 mm divalent salts than in seawater and estuary environments table s2 corresponding to the above ζ potential results fig 2 a b show that uv irradiation promoted snp aggregation in 8 types of electrolyte solutions by reducing their negative charge the stability curves of fresh snps all shifted to the left after 7 day irradiation with their ccc values decreased by 61 74 table s5 for both fresh and aged snps the cationic valence was the only influencing factor of electrolyte composition on their aggregation rates since the stability curves generally overlapped for different monovalent or divalent electrolytes in particular the ccc values of fresh or aged snps in na2so4 were about half of those in other monovalent salts as na2so4 possesses two na cations the schulze hardy rule predicts that the ccc is proportional to z 6 z is the counterion valence for surfaces of high charge density to z 2 for surfaces with low charge density petosa et al 2010 as shown in table s6 the power terms were 4 5 5 6 for fresh snps and 4 3 5 7 for 7 day irradiated snps in 8 electrolytes therefore both fresh and aged snps exhibited aggregation behaviors in agreement with the schulze hardy rule which holds for indifferent electrolytes that do not form any specific interactions with the particle surface this result indicates that all 8 electrolytes induced aggregation of fresh and aged snps only via electrostatic interactions in contrast to the aged nc60 qu et al 2010 and tio2 zhang et al 2016 nps which violated the schulze hardy rule due to specific interactions of ca2 with carboxyl groups formed during uv irradiation comparison on the aggregation rates of fresh and 7 day irradiated snps in nacl solutions having different ph showed that uv irradiation promoted snp aggregation more significantly under neutral and basic conditions than under acidic condition figs 2c d and s8c d for fresh snps their aggregation rates in nacl increased with decreasing ph as in accordance with previous reports fig 2c chen and huang 2017 chowdhury et al 2013 smith et al 2009 meanwhile their stability curves distributed widely over the ph range fig s8c however the aggregation rates of 7 day irradiated snps were similar under different ph conditions fig 2c yielding overlapped stability curves in fig s8d although the ccc values had linear correlations with ph for both fresh r 2 0 9748 and aged r 2 0 8490 snps in nacl solution the fitting slope of aged snps 3 706 was 10 times shallower than that of fresh snps 37 82 fig 2d moreover after 7 day irradiation the ccc value of fresh snps was lowered by 82 from 300 to 55 mm nacl at ph 10 and by 21 from 48 to 38 mm nacl at ph 4 yet it remained relatively unchanged at ph 3 table s5 these results of aggregation rates corresponded to the ζ potential analysis on fresh and 7 day irradiated snps in nacl solutions having different ph fig s8a b it shows that the range of ζ potentials 42 31 5 50 mv for fresh snps at various ph became narrower after uv irradiation 38 15 5 94 mv for 7 day irradiated snps therefore uv irradiation would reduce the sensitivity of the colloidal stability of snps to the change in solution ph overall the above results indicate that considering only the effects of electrolyte and ph table s2 uv irradiation may increase the tendency of snps to aggregate in neutral clouds and freshwater but less likely in acidic or saline environments 3 3 aggregation kinetics of aged snps in the presence of macromolecules the influence of four macromolecules on colloidal stability of fresh and aged snps was investigated at two concentration levels of nacl and cacl2 solutions figs 3 and s9 the reduction percentages of α due to macromolecules 0 vs 10 mg c l under different conditions are compared in table s7 the results show that ha significantly retarded the aggregation of both fresh and aged snps in four electrolyte solutions i e 60 and 200 mm nacl and 2 and 6 mm cacl2 the stabilization effect was enhanced with increasing ha concentration and was stronger for aged snps the greatest difference between the stabilization of fresh and aged snps by ha was observed at 60 mm nacl fig s9c as α was reduced by 50 for fresh snps while by 98 for 7 day irradiated snps at 10 mg c l ha table s7 this suggests that the promoted aggregation of aged snps by uv irradiation could be stabilized with ha this result was likely due to the steric hindrance effect imparted by ha adsorbed onto particle surfaces of snps liu et al 2019 and other cnps as previously reported saleh et al 2008 2010 zhang et al 2013 the electrostatic repulsion promoted by ha may also contribute to stabilization enhancement as the ζ potentials of most snps became more negative with addition of ha the stabilization effect of ha on both fresh and aged snps in both nacl and cacl2 solutions was consistent with the results reported for nc60 qu et al 2010 compared with ha fa having lower hydrophobicity and molecular weight zhang et al 2013 induced much weaker stabilization on both fresh and aged snps at high ionic concentration levels i e 200 mm nacl and 6 mm cacl2 fig 3 only one noticeable reduction in aggregation rate was found for fresh snps at 6 mm cacl2 and 1 mg c l fa which was likely attributed to the most enhanced ζ potential the stabilization by fa became important on aged snps at lower ionic concentration levels e g 60 mm nacl and 2 mm cacl2 fig s9 as α was reduced by up to 86 with 10 mg c l fa in comparison the reduction percentage was 38 at high ionic concentration levels i e 200 mm nacl and 6 mm cacl2 table s7 the result suggests that the aggregation of aged snps could only be effectively stabilized by fa at low ionic concentrations among all the tested macromolecules bsa exhibited the strongest stabilization effect on both fresh and aged snps in nacl and cacl2 solutions figs 3 and s9 indicating its important role in the stability of snps especially after uv irradiation as α 0 1 generally suggests negligible aggregation the presence of only 1 mg c l bsa effectively inhibited all aggregation even for the uv irradiated snps at high ionic concentrations about 100 reduction of aggregation rate was achieved at 10 mg c l bsa under all experimental conditions table s7 it has been reported that bsa effectively stabilized snps chen et al 2019 and other nps including swnts saleh et al 2010 and aunps bhirde et al 2014 because of its compact globular structure that imparted the greatest adsorption and long range steric repulsive forces compared with other three macromolecules with relatively linear structures the current results show that such stabilization effect remained prominent for photolytically aged snps the reduced negative ζ potentials of snps in the presence of bsa was related to its spontaneous adsorption onto particle surface during which incorporation of sodium and calcium cations from solution and dehydration of amino acids in bsa occurred norde and giacomelli 2000 the presence of alg in 200 and 60 mm nacl solutions resulted in slight stabilization of both fresh and aged snps fig 3 the stabilization effect due to steric hindrance in nacl solutions followed the order of bsa ha alg fa which was consistent with previous studies and was originated from their difference in molecular structure and hydrophobicity huangfu et al 2013 liu et al 2019 saleh et al 2010 much stronger stabilization of aged snps 85 reduction of α was observed at 60 mm nacl compared to fresh snps 28 reduction of α table s7 at 6 mm cacl2 which was above the ccc values of both fresh 3 5 mm and 7 day irradiated 1 2 mm snps alg exhibited strong destabilization effect as α was greater than unity fig 3d it was likely due to molecular bridging between ca2 with the guluronic acid blocks of alg to form gel networks davis et al 2003 which significantly promoted snp aggregation however distinct phenomenon was observed at 2 mm cacl2 which was below the ccc of fresh snps but above that of aged snps fig s9d instead of forming alg gel that promotes snp aggregation alg stabilized fresh snps at 2 mm cacl2 by up to 68 table s7 while exerted negligible effect on aged snps this result indicates that alg bridging only appears at ca2 concentration above its ccc which would be lowered by uv irradiation therefore under this circumstance uv irradiation increased the likelihood of alg bridging that significantly destabilized snps otherwise in all nacl solutions or at calcium concentration below its ccc value alg would exert a reverse effect by stabilizing both fresh and aged snps 3 4 change in hamaker constant of snps after uv irradiation fig 4 a shows that the dlvo theoretical curves generally fitted through the measured aggregation data for both fresh and uv irradiated snps indicating that they exhibited aggregation kinetics predictable from dlvo theory this result was consistent with previous studies that the aggregation behavior of other nps including cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 tio2 zhang et al 2016 and nanoplastics liu et al 2019 still followed the dlvo theory after uv irradiation nevertheless minor deviations existed among the dlvo prediction and experimental data especially at nacl concentrations below the ccc of fresh 145 mm and 7 day irradiated 38 mm snps fig 4a similar discrepancy was previously reported for fresh snps li et al 2021 which was attributed to their partially aggregated structure and non spherical shapes figs s2 s4 that violated the spherical assumption of dlvo theory the dlvo fitting process yielded the hamaker constants for fresh snps and snps irradiated for 6 h 8 4 h 12 h and 7 d in aqueous medium a sws as 7 6 10 21 9 9 10 21 1 8 10 20 2 2 10 20 and 2 4 10 20 j respectively fig 4a the fitted a sws values gradually increased with prolonged uv irradiation time the irradiation for 7 d significantly increased the hamaker constant of snps by 68 which then enhanced van der waals attraction energy v a according to eq s5 considering that r h only decreased by 5 67 after irradiation fig s2 the enhanced v a and the weakened electrical repulsion energy v r jointly contributed to the faster aggregation of snps after uv irradiation as the hamaker constant only relates to material property israelachvili 1991 it implies that uv irradiation induced structural change of snps as revealed later with physicochemical characterizations by inputting a sws to eq s10 the hamaker constants for fresh and 7 day irradiated diesel snps in vacuum a ss where the subscripts represent soot soot were calculated as 7 8 10 20 and 1 2 10 19 j respectively these values cover the range of a ss reported in the literature for flame formed soot particles 9 5 10 20 to 1 0 10 19 j de falco et al 2015 di stasio et al 2002 and fresh diesel soot particles 9 7 10 20 j chen and huang 2017 in addition the fitted a sws 7 6 10 21 j and a ss 7 8 10 20 j values for fresh snps were very close to their recent report of 7 8 10 21 and 7 9 10 20 j respectively li et al 2021 it is also noted that opposite result was observed on nanoplastics whose hamaker constant was reduced after uv irradiation under similar conditions liu et al 2019 the derived hamaker constants for fresh and 7 day irradiated snps were used to predict their microscopic interaction energy v t as a function of particle separation distance at different nacl concentrations fig 4b the results show that v t for both fresh and 7 day irradiated snps was mostly positive at 1 and 20 mm nacl indicating strong v r in the reaction limited regime that prevented aggregation the negative v t at close separation 1 nm represents primary minimum due to strong v a causing irreversible aggregation elimelech et al 1995 the analyses supported our previous discussion that 7 day irradiated snps had lower v t than fresh snps because of the binary effect from the charge screening that reduced v r and the increased hamaker constant that enhanced v a the increase of nacl concentration to the ccc for fresh 145 mm and 7 day irradiated 38 mm snps resulted in the energy barrier approaching zero where v r was completely diminished while v a dominated chen and huang 2017 secondary minimum appeared under this condition where unstable and reversible aggregation occurred further increase of electrolyte concentration resulted in v t approaching the pure v a with the 7 day irradiated snps being more sensitive than fresh snps which reveals the important role of uv irradiation on stability of snps in wet environments 3 5 photolytic aging mechanisms to elucidate the photolytic aging mechanisms the particle and solution phases of fresh and irradiated snps were thoroughly characterized their xps spectra are presented in fig s10 with the relative intensities of fitted carbon and oxygen containing functional groups compiled in table 1 coupling the analysis of c 1 s and o 1 s xps spectra the surfaces of both fresh and aged snps mainly contained c o coh co c c6h5 and ch3 after 7 day irradiation the c o and coh groups decreased by 6 7 and 5 5 respectively this is consistent with the ftir analysis fig 4c which shows significant decrease of oh at 3410 cm 1 and carboxyl coh at 1107 cm 1 after irradiation meanwhile the elemental contents of o and h analyzed with elemental analysis and xps also decreased for aged snps table s8 these results suggest that hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh groups had detached from snps possibly due to the attack of reactive oxygen groups ros e g 1o2 during uv irradiation eqs 3 5 fu et al 2016 during uv irradiation snps may generate ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 in the suspension as described by eq 3 the carbonyl containing structures on snps may be involved in the generation of 1o2 both the ftir fig 4c and o 1 s xps table 1 analyses showed decrease of c o on snps after irradiation the uv irradiation may break the carbonyl group c o to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 at exited state which was also reported for dissolved black carbon fu et al 2016 3 under the attack of ros including singlet oxygen hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh groups were detached from snps into solution as shown by the ftir fig 4c xps table 1 and 1h nmr table 1 analyses similar decarboxylation effect induced by uv irradiation has been reported for cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 meanwhile the aromatic rings were cleaved to form aliphatic hydrocarbons on snps leading to decreased hydrophobicity the above reactions could be described with eq 4 which was supported by the ftir fig 4c xps table 1 1h nmr table 1 and contact angle analyses fig s12 and was also observed for dissolved black carbon xu et al 2017 the detached carboxyl structures from snps formed small organic acids such as oxalic acid eq 5 which was detected in solution and contributed to the increased toc content fig s11 4 5 consistently 1h nmr analysis shows that the percentage of protons attached to oxygen and nitrogen i e heteroatom substituted decreased by half from 85 2 to 46 8 after irradiation table 1 as the content of nitrogen was minimal 3 table s8 the 1h nmr result also indicates that uv irradiation reduced functional groups such as oh and cooh on snps this is consistent with the decarboxylation of cooh mwcnts hwang et al 2013 but is contrary to dbc xu et al 2017 and nc60 lee et al 2009 taylor et al 1991 which acquired more oxygen containing functional groups after light irradiation as our prior research found that snps mainly acquire negative surface charge from oh and cooh chen and huang 2017 their lost induced by uv irradiation had resulted in the less negative ζ potentials thus enhancing the aggregation of aged snps the potentiometric titration results are presented in fig 4d which shows that both fresh and 7 day irradiated snps contained acidic functional groups as they consumed more naoh than the blanks meanwhile 14 6 more naoh was required to titrate the suspension containing 7 day irradiated snps compared with fresh snps during measurement both the particles and solution were simultaneously titrated for fresh snps oh and cooh on particle surface would deprotonate into solution acting as ph buffers that consumed naoh chen and huang 2017 however decarboxylation occurred on aged snps leading to formation of organic acids e g c2h2o4 in solution eq 5 and the corresponding increase in toc content with prolonged irradiation fig s11 lee et al 2009 this contributed to the right shift of titration curve for aged snps nevertheless the concentrations measured for inorganic anions and heavy metals in solutions filtering out snps at different aging status showed insignificant change table s9 indicating no release of these ions from snps fig s12 indicates that snps became less hydrophobic after uv irradiation as their contact angles with water decreased by 14 from 131 9 0 8 to 113 9 0 5 table s10 this result conflicts with the reduction in oxygen containing functional groups which should have led to increased hydrophobicity the contradiction may be explained by the change in carbon bonds induced by uv irradiation as shown in table 1 the c 1 s xps spectra indicates that the aromatic carbon decreased by 1 whereas ch3 increased by 0 8 meanwhile the 1h nmr shows significant reduction of aromatic h by 40 6 and increase of ch2 and ch by 82 2 the ftir analysis fig 4c also reveals the decreased aromatic c c and c o peaks at 1598 1627 cm 1 the disappearance of aromatic ch peaks at 568 671 cm 1 and the enhanced ch3 and ch2 peaks at 2920 and 2850 cm 1 respectively fang et al 2015 fanning and vannice 1993 the above characterizations suggest that light irradiation cleaved aromatic rings and generated aliphatic hydrocarbons on snps eq 4 as also had been found for dbc xu et al 2017 this process significantly reduced the aromaticity of snps which overcame the effect of decarboxylation leading to an overall decreased hydrophobicity for aged snps 4 conclusions the results from this study suggest that the aggregation of snps in water may be affected by the complex interplay among uv irradiation solution chemistry and macromolecules fresh snps were significantly destabilized by uva irradiation due to its binary effects that weakened v r and enhanced v a meanwhile aromatic ring cleavage attributed to irradiation decreased their hydrophobicity aggregation of snps after various durations 0 7 d of uva irradiation all followed the dlvo theory allowing for model prediction for their transport in aqueous systems irradiation by uva on fresh snps for above 1 under experimental condition or 4 d under natural condition may significantly promote their aggregation in neutral freshwater and clouds whereas such effect may be weakened under acidic conditions macromolecules could stabilize both fresh and aged snps with the order of bsa ha alg fa while uv irradiation may increase the likelihood of alg bridging with ca2 that further destabilize aged snps in comparison snps were much more sensitive to uva irradiation compared to the longer wavelength irradiation by xenon lamp which did not induce apparent effect on stability of snps supplementary material supplementary
