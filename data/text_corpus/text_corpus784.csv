3920,the development of early warning systems ewss is a key element for the effective mitigation of flash flood impacts emergency managers and other end users increasingly recognise the benefit of tools that automatically translate the forecasted flash flood hazard e g expressed in terms of peak discharge or return period into the expected socio economic impacts e g the affected population while previous studies aimed at forecasting flash flood impacts at local or regional scales this paper presents a simple approach for estimating in real time the flash flood impacts at pan european scale the proposed method named reaffine is designed to be integrated into an ews for end users operating over large spatial domains e g across regions or countries reaffine uses the pan european flash flood hazard estimates from the ericha system to retrieve the potentially flooded areas from the national flood maps generated in the framework of the eu floods directive by combining the potentially flooded areas with socio economic exposure information reaffine estimates in real time the exposed population and critical infrastructures for two catastrophic flash flood events affecting europe in recent years reaffine has demonstrated the capability to identify impacts over large spatial scales also at sub regional level the method has mostly been able to locate the areas and municipalities where the most important impacts occurred the results also show that the performance is sensitive to the quality of the rainfall estimates that drive the hazard estimation and to the comprehensiveness of the employed flood maps keywords flash flood impact forecasting early warning radar rainfall continental scale 1 introduction flash floods ffs hereafter are one of the most devastating natural hazards in europe causing numerous casualties barredo 2007 petrucci et al 2019 terti et al 2017 and tremendous economic losses eea 2010 gaume et al 2009 munich re 2017 paprotny et al 2018 this type of flooding is characterized by intense downpours in small to medium sized often mountainous catchments leading to a short response time between the rainfall and the discharge peak in the stream network in the range of minutes to a few hours the sudden event onset often hinders a timely flood response e g in form of evacuations or road closures and is the main reason for the high socio economic impacts caused by ffs eea 2010 sene 2013 spitalar et al 2014 early warning systems ewss aim to extend the time span available for applying flood response measures and are therefore considered to bear the highest potential for effectively reducing ff impacts eea 2010 the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction unisdr 2015a demands a leap in the development and availability of ewss by 2030 many countries already dispose of ff ewss that translate observed and forecasted rainfall into the expected response in the stream network i e the ff hazard real time and operational examples were demonstrated for instance in areas in the united states clark et al 2014 georgakakos 2006 switzerland liechti et al 2013 zappa et al 2008 spain corral et al 2009 versini et al 2014 france javelle et al 2010 2016 and italy corral et al 2019 laiolo et al 2014 silvestro et al 2011 for reviews including more examples see alfieri et al 2012 2019 gourley et al 2014 hapuarachchi et al 2011 or li et al 2018 at european scale two systems have been delivering for several years ff hazard forecasts to end users across the continent eric european runoff index based on climatology alfieri and thielen 2015 raynaud et al 2015 and ericha european rainfall induced hazard assessment park et al 2017 2019 both systems compute their warnings by comparing observed and forecasted basin aggregated rainfall to thresholds derived from climatology ericha uses fixed rainfall thresholds whereas eric dynamically updates the thresholds in function of the current catchment conditions e g soil moisture the two systems are complementary while eric uses numerical weather prediction nwp precipitation forecasts as input to assess the ff hazard for the coming five days the ericha system generates high resolution 1 km and 15 min warnings for the next few hours using radar based rainfall observations and nowcasts the systems mentioned above predict the hazard component of ffs expressed e g in terms of the peak discharge or return period in the stream network to estimate the potential impacts of a forecasted ff it is necessary to combine the hazard forecasts with socio economic exposure and vulnerability information e g the locations of settlements or critical infrastructures in the current practice emergency managers usually do this combination non automatically and based on personal experience which is time consuming and results in subjective decisions merz et al 2020 wmo 2015 tools that automatically translate the hazard forecasts into the expected impacts can speed up the decision process and reduce subjectivity ultimately leading to an improved flood response taylor et al 2018 unisdr 2015b prior efforts to automatically forecast ff impacts showed promising results the existing approaches forecast the impacts in terms of qualitative ff severity levels calianno et al 2013 saint martin et al 2016 the number of inundated properties le bihan et al 2017 effects on the road network versini et al 2010 vincendon et al 2016 flooded critical infrastructures ritter et al 2020 and affected population and direct economic losses ritter et al 2020 silvestro et al 2019 these methods require exposure and vulnerability datasets in very high resolution as a reference ritter et al 2020 used a resolution of 25 m over the region of catalonia northeast spain the real time application of such high resolution approaches over larger areas is computationally challenging which is the main reason why they have been limited to local or regional domains to today a method that forecasts ff impacts over large domains e g across regions or countries does not exist but it would be beneficial in two ways firstly it would extend the coverage of ff impact forecasts to areas where no such decision support is available yet e g many european countries secondly it would offer a more transboundary perspective on potential ff impacts which can be useful for end users operating on the international level such as transboundary river catchment authorities or the emergency response coordination centre ercc of the european union emerton et al 2016 merz et al 2020 thielen et al 2009 ward et al 2015 the european flood awareness system efas already includes a forecast of the impacts of fluvial floods in european catchments larger than 500 km2 the rapid risk assessment dottori et al 2017 complementing this system with a method detecting the impacts of ffs in the smaller basins across europe would significantly extend the available decision support in this work we build on the ff impact forecasting method reaffirm real time assessment of flash flood impacts a regional high resolution method ritter et al 2020 and we propose an approach that is applicable at european scale named reaffine real time assessment of flash flood impacts at pan european scale the proposed method estimates the potential ff impacts across europe by complementing hazard simulations from the ericha system with components that account for the socio economic exposure of the areas at risk reaffine integrates a variety of datasets available throughout the eu e g flood maps or population density maps which enables a homogeneous impact estimation across borders the method is adapted to real time conditions and designed to be integrated into an ews with pan european coverage the following section2 provides a detailed description of reaffine its individual components and how it has been applied using the available datasets in section3 the method is demonstrated on two recent ff events that caused numerous fatalities and widespread economic losses and the resulting impact estimates are compared to post event observations from various information sources finally in section4 we draw some general conclusions and point towards potential future developments 2 the reaffine method the objective of this study is to enhance the decision support during ffs for end users operating over large spatial scales we propose the method reaffine which estimates in real time the socio economic impacts of ffs across europe this is achieved through the application of three modules fig 1 1 the hazard module assesses the ff hazard in real time for this purpose we have chosen the ericha system section2 1 that simulates the ff hazard level along a gridded drainage network over europe based on radar rainfall observations 2 the flood map module section 2 2 transforms the ff hazard levels in the drainage network into hazard levels in the floodplains in reaffine this is done based on the national flood maps generated by the member states through the implementation of the european floods directive european commission 2007 3 the impact assessment module section 2 3 translates the hazard levels in the floodplains into socio economic impacts in reaffine the impacts are assessed in terms of potentially affected population and critical infrastructures in the floodplains based on pan european exposure information the following subsections describe the details of the three modules of reaffine outlining the individual steps of the method and the necessary preprocessing of the employed datasets an overview of the spatial and temporal resolutions used by the reaffine components is provided in table 1 in practice the chain of reaffine modules is triggered every 15 min i e every time new rainfall inputs become available fig 1 on a standard server the overall computing time from the opera radar composites to the impact outputs amounts to about 90 s table 1 a such short latency does not significantly delay the transmission of the outputs to the end user and thus the emergency response 2 1 flash flood hazard estimation the ericha system at european scale for estimating the ff hazard we have employed the ericha system corral et al 2019 park et al 2017 2019 which was implemented in real time at european scale in the framework of the eponymous research project ericha www crahi upc edu ericha since 2017 the ericha ff hazard nowcasts have been displayed on the online platform of the european flood awareness system www efas eu en flash flood indicators where they have been used for operational decision support by water agencies and emergency services operating at regional national and international level the ericha system generates ff hazard nowcasts for european streams with drainage areas of 5 2000 km2 the main dynamic input for the ericha system consists of real time radar rainfall composites from opera operational program for the exchange of weather radar information www eumetnet eu opera these composites provide precipitation estimates covering all of europe in high resolution 2 km 15 min from these rainfall estimates the ericha system calculates the basin aggregated rainfall amounts over a gridded drainage network in 1 km resolution to determine the ff hazard the basin aggregated rainfall amounts are compared to basin aggregated intensity duration thresholds adapted from those used by the eumetnet project meteoalarm www meteoalarm eu the result is the estimated hazard level in the drainage network in colour code yellow orange red representing low medium high hazard levels see fig 2 a for an example 2 2 flood map module the goal of the flood map module is to identify in real time the potentially flooded areas to achieve this a connection is created between the ff hazard levels generated by the ericha system section2 1 and the national flood maps produced in the framework of the eu floods directive european commission 2007 following the regional approach of ritter et al 2020 this connection is established based on the minimum distance between the ericha drainage network cells and the inundated areas in the flood maps each floodplain section is assigned to the nearest ericha drainage network cell when operating at european scale however a few adjustments are necessary the flood maps of the member states were created using a variety of hydraulic modelling approaches for an overview see european commission 2015a not only the modelling approaches but also the specifications of the flood maps vary considerably across the eu alfieri et al 2014 dottori et al 2021 for instance there are no common guidelines regarding the return periods modelled by the member states de moel et al 2009 european commission 2015b priest et al 2016 even within countries the chosen return periods can vary between regions e g in germany where the federal states are responsible for creating the maps to achieve a certain homogeneity across europe we have used in each location the flood map of the highest available return period e g in spain the map of t 500 years see fig 2b as a proxy of the maximum possible flood extent hereafter referred to as the floodplain to make use of the high resolution information contained in the floodplain maps we have chosen to preprocess the maps as follows first the floodplain geometries have been rasterised to a grid of 25 m resolution as also done by the regional high resolution method of ritter et al 2020 this gridded high resolution floodplain is used for preprocessing the exposure layers details follow in section2 3 then the gridded high resolution floodplain has been upscaled to 1 km resolution the 1 km cells containing floodplains are hereafter referred to as floodplain cells see fig 2b and are used in the real time calculations to establish the link between the floodplains and the ericha drainage network each floodplain cell has been assigned by minimum distance to the nearest ericha drainage network cell s fig 2a c illustrates how the flood map module uses this assignment in real time operation if the ericha system identifies a ff hazard in a drainage network cell fig 2a the hazard level is automatically transmitted to all the floodplain cells assigned to this drainage network cell the result is a map showing hazard levels in the potentially affected floodplains fig 2c 2 3 impact assessment module the aim of the impact assessment module is to estimate the socio economic ff impacts in real time for this purpose it combines the hazard levels in the floodplains generated by the flood map module section 2 2 with information on socio economic exposure in reaffine impacts are estimated in terms of the potentially affected population section2 3 1 and critical infrastructures section2 3 2 to provide the end user with a situational overview of the areas with the highest potential impacts reaffine also summarises the simulation results at the level of administrative regions section2 3 3 2 3 1 impact on population this component of the impact assessment module estimates in real time the impact on the population by counting the population potentially exposed to the hazard levels in the floodplain generated by the flood map module section2 2 as a base for this step we have used the population density map of freire et al 2016 covering all of europe in 100 m resolution for the application in reaffine the original dataset has been preprocessed offline as follows first the resolution of the dataset has been increased to 25 m using nearest neighbour interpolation then population density values outside the floodplains have been removed using the gridded high resolution floodplain map described in section2 2 finally the 25 m cells have been upscaled to 1 km resolution to match the grid of the floodplain cells this process of downscaling cropping upscaling allows to determine offline in high resolution the population potentially exposed to flooding in each floodplain cell before aggregating this information to a resolution that is suitable for real time simulations at european scale in real time operation reaffine uses the preprocessed population exposure map to estimate the impact on the population in addition to counting the population potentially exposed to ff hazard more detail follows in section2 3 3 the potential impact the on population is also mapped in real time this is done by means of an impact matrix fig 3 that combines in each 1 km cell the three floodplain hazard levels fig 2c with three population exposure classes low 1 99 people km2 medium 100 999 people km2 and high 1000 and more people km2 these thresholds are arbitrary and have been manually adjusted the result of applying the impact matrix is a map showing in each 1 km cell the population impact in terms of three qualitative impact levels low medium high see fig 2d for an example 2 3 2 impact on critical infrastructures cis reaffine estimates the ff impact on critical infrastructures cis by counting in real time the cis potentially exposed to the hazard levels in the floodplains this is done based on a ci dataset extracted from openstreetmaps in the frame of the project global exposure data for risk assessment giovando et al 2020 in reaffine we have included education facilities ef health facilities hf and mass gathering sites mg and it is planned to add other ci types that will become available soon with european coverage e g roads and railways each of the three ci layers has been preprocessed offline in high resolution first only the cis inside the gridded high resolution floodplains see section 2 2 have been kept in the inventory to maintain only the cis potentially exposed to flooding then the numbers and types of cis have been counted in each 1 km floodplain cell in real time operation reaffine retrieves the numbers and types of cis in all floodplain cells where the flood map module section 2 2 identified a floodplain hazard the result is a list of the exposed cis in each floodplain cell 2 3 3 regional impact summary when monitoring the real time impact estimates at large spatial scales it can be difficult and time consuming for the end user to identify the areas with the highest potential impacts to assist in this task reaffine summarises the simulated impacts described in sections2 3 1 and 2 3 2 for each time step at the level of administrative regions to ensure a homogeneous region size across country borders we have used the combination of nuts 2 e g in germany and nuts 3 regions e g in spain proposed by dottori et al 2017 for the impact aggregation as illustrated in table 2 reaffine summarises for each region the following information i the overall exposed population i e the sum of people potentially affected by any of the three floodplain hazard levels ii totals of exposed population and cis listed separately for each of the three floodplain hazard levels and iii the regional impact level which is assigned as the maximum floodplain hazard level affecting population or cis in the impact summary table 2 the regions are sorted in descending order of overall exposed population amounts point i of the above list to direct the attention of the end user towards the regions with the highest numbers of potentially affected people to complement the impact summary the regional impacts are also mapped fig 4 the regions are coloured according to the maximum floodplain hazard level affecting the population or cis point iii of the above list this is done to also highlight high hazard levels that affect only small amounts of population or cis since the localised nature of ffs can pose a potentially fatal risk to a very limited area 3 results we have applied reaffine to two ff events of recent years that caused numerous fatalities and billions of euros in economic losses the elvira storm in central europe in spring 2016 and a cut off low dana in spain in autumn 2019 in this section we demonstrate the performance of reaffine for these two events in germany and spain using the national flood maps of these two countries bfg 2020 ign 2020 the simulated ff impacts presented in this section have been generated by running reaffine on rainfall observations rather than forecasts this has been done to minimise external uncertainties and focus on the method s capabilities and limitations of translating ff hazards into impacts to evaluate the performance of the method the simulation results have been compared with the impacts reported by civil protection authorities insurance companies news agencies and social media such flood impact observations are inherently subject to high uncertainties e g brouwer et al 2017 ritter et al 2020 and they typically contain impacts not only from ffs but also from other flood types that reaffine is not designed to detect this impedes a fully fair quantitative comparison between the simulated and the reported impacts and therefore the results in this study have been evaluated mostly from a qualitative point of view while inspecting the reaffine outputs in the following subsections it is necessary to keep in mind that the primary objective of the method is to estimate ff impacts from a large scale perspective across regions or countries the detection of more accurate impact locations and magnitudes is the aim of the regional high resolution approaches mentioned in section1 3 1 event 1 the low pressure system elvira in central europe in 2016 from the end of may to early june 2016 the stationary low pressure system elvira induced large rainfall amounts across central europe the most significant impacts occurred in germany and france while in france mostly large rivers overflowed their banks e g the seine in paris the situation in germany was characterised by numerous slow moving and fast evolving convective cells that caused severe ffs and pluvial floods across the country piper et al 2016 according to munich re 2017 the overall economic damages in germany amounted to 2 6 billion euros and a total of ten people lost their lives due to the floods the most devastating ffs occurred on 29 may in the village of braunsbach in the stuttgart region bronstert et al 2018 bronstert et al 2017 and on 01 june in simbach am inn niederbayern where five people died lfu 2016 tum 2017 fig 5 shows the accumulated precipitation for the most intense period of the elvira storm in germany 29 may 03 june 2016 it can be seen that the real time adjusted opera radar rainfall using the method of park et al 2019 corresponds reasonably well to the rainfall accumulations measured by the synop raingauges wmo 2016 the real time adjusted radar rainfall maps 2 km and 15 min resolution have been used as input for reaffine over the entire duration of the event this resulted in the simulated impacts summarised in table 3 and fig 6 a reaffine detected impacts in 35 of the 38 german nuts 2 regions i e all except berlin hamburg and schleswig holstein the regions with the most severe simulated impacts correspond reasonably well to those of the reported impacts table 3 and fig 6 in the 20 regions with the highest simulated impacts impacts were also reported in reality either by the european severe weather database eswd www eswd eu or through the tweets collected by global flood monitor www globalfloodmonitor org de bruijn et al 2018 2019 among the overall 38 german regions we have identified 31 with both simulated and reported impacts 4 with simulated but no reported impacts and 2 with reported but no simulated impacts in some regions the magnitudes of the simulated impacts do not correspond very well to the magnitude of the reported impacts for instance the amounts of exposed population seem to be overestimated in the regions of dusseldorf 609704 koln 186201 and darmstadt 133399 table 3 this is due to the rhine river passing through these regions with an extremely wide floodplain up to 25 km in the dusseldorf region a significant share of the rhine s floodplain is assigned to several small tributaries rather than to the rhine itself since reaffine s flood map module operates based on the minimum distance between floodplains and assigned streams as explained in section 2 2 in some of these tributaries the ericha system estimated low to medium ff hazard resulting in widespread floodplain hazard levels and thus overestimated impacts in these three regions with an exposed population of almost 194000 the region of stuttgart has been correctly identified as one of the most severely impacted by the storm table 3 however reaffine did not detect any population exposed to high hazard in this region this does not seem to be in line with the three fatalities table 3 and the ff in the village of braunsbach with a return period clearly above 100 years bronstert et al 2018 the reason for the underestimation of the impact magnitude in the stuttgart region is that the radar did not fully capture the extreme rainfall intensities in the small convective cells for instance in the small catchment upstream of braunsbach 6 km2 the real time adjusted radar fig 5a estimated rainfall accumulations of 46 54 mm in 24 h 29 september 08 00 utc 30 september 08 00 utc whereas bronstert et al 2018 reconstructed a value of 135 153 mm for an almost identical time period due to the underestimated rainfall intensities the ericha ff hazard did not exceed the medium level in braunsbach and thus reaffine did not detect any population exposed to a high hazard in three locations in germany reaffine identified populations exposed to high hazard levels table 3 and fig 6a in the town of ilmenau thuringen that suffered severe flash floods deutsche welle 2016 reaffine estimated 1061 people exposed to high hazard table 3 furthermore 348 people exposed to high hazard were identified in the village of obernzenn mittelfranken table 3 that also experienced severe flooding nürnberger presse 2016 lastly also in niederbayern which was the most affected region with seven fatalities and economic losses of around 1 25 billion euros lfu 2016 reaffine identified population exposed to high hazard table 3 to add more quantitative components to the evaluation we have also analysed the results at the level of the 401 districts in germany nuts 3 regions table 4 for reference we have considered that impacts occurred in those districts with either tweets or eswd reports in 29 4 of the german districts impacts were both simulated and reported whereas false alarms affected 48 6 of the districts i e impacts were simulated in many cases with weak signals but no tweets or eswd reports were issued in those districts table 4 finally impacts were missed in 4 of the districts these results translate to a high probability of detection of pod 0 89 and a critical success index of csi 0 36 the relatively low csi is the consequence of the high number of false alarms which are partly due to the inherent incompleteness of impact observations especially in areas that experienced only minor impacts for an impression of the high uncertainties in the impact datasets see the discrepancies between the eswd reports and the tweets in figs 6b and 7 to evaluate the simulation results at even smaller spatial scales we take a closer look at the most severely affected region of niederbayern as a reference for the simulated impacts we have used the impact observations from twitter and the european severe weather database previously shown in fig 6b and additionally the regional flood observations from the bavarian environment agency lfu 2016 the ericha system simulated widespread ff hazard in the drainage network across niederbayern fig 7a the ff hazard signals appear in most of the locations with impact evidences from eswd lfu or tweets on the other hand also large areas without reported impacts show ff hazard e g the rural north eastern part of the region in the town of simbach am inn which suffered unprecedented flooding with five fatalities lfu 2016 tum 2017 the ericha ff hazard in the simbach stream 30 km2 did not exceed the medium level fig 7a the underestimation of the hazard in this location is due to a breach of a road embankment upstream of the town lfu 2016 tum 2017 which significantly increased the real flood magnitude in simbach am inn based on the ericha ff hazard in the drainage network fig 7a the flood map module section2 2 estimated the hazard levels in the floodplains shown in fig 7b floodplain hazard signals are present in many of the reported impact locations especially in the most severely affected areas such as simbach am inn fig 7b furthermore widespread ericha ff hazard signals in areas where no significant impacts occurred e g in the north east of the region fig 7a did not transform into floodplain hazard due to the lack of flood maps in these rural areas fig 7b on the other hand also in some locations with reported impacts the flood map module did not transform the ericha ff hazard into floodplain hazard this can occur for two reasons in some locations the responsible authorities did not create flood maps due to the low however existing socio economic exposure of the areas near the streams see for instance the disappearance of the high hazard level in the small stream 28 km2 near the village of rattenberg in fig 7 in other locations e g in herrngiersdorf fig 7 the reported impacts were not caused by ffs but by surface runoff outside the floodplains pluvial flooding lfu 2016 to summarise the results of the elvira storm the impact estimates from a large scale perspective corresponded relatively well to the observed regional impacts fig 6 at sub regional scale the underlying uncertainty sources of the method became more apparent e g the accuracy of the rainfall estimates or the coverage of the flood maps nevertheless reaffine succeeded to detect the regions of the most severe impacts e g niederbayern although the simulation results presented in this section have been aggregated over the full event duration it should be noted that the timing of the simulated impacts in the most affected locations approximately coincided with the onsets of the floods for instance the medium hazard levels around simbach am inn appeared about 1 h before the first flooding in the town was reported lfu 2016 3 2 event 2 the dana event of 2019 in spain in september 2019 a cut off low in spain commonly known as dana depresión aislada en niveles altos martín león 2003 promoted the development of long lasting convective systems that affected large parts of the country along the south eastern mediterranean coast rainfall accumulations of up to 461 mm in 24 h caused numerous ffs and a severe river flood in the downstream part of the segura catchment see e g biener camacho and prieto cerdán 2019 ercca 2019 garcía et al 2020 seven people lost their lives over 6000 were evacuated dgpce 2019 and the overall economic losses were estimated to exceed 2 2 billion euros aon 2019 in contrast to the elvira storm of spring 2016 section 3 1 the accuracy of the real time adjusted opera radar rainfall for the dana event was relatively low fig 8 a and b the radar located in murcia had a malfunction during an important period of the event resulting in a significant underestimation of the rainfall amounts to mitigate this underestimation for the analysis of this event we have a posteriori applied the radar raingauge blending method of velasco forero et al 2009 also described by cassiraga et al 2020 using the hourly observations of the raingauge network of the spanish state meteorological agency the resulting improved rainfall accumulations are shown in fig 8c and d using the blended rainfall maps as input reaffine identified impacts in 14 of the 48 spanish nuts 3 regions in the domain the regions with the highest simulated impacts fig 9 a correspond very well to those reported by the spanish insurance compensation consortium ccs 2020 and the spanish directorate general for civil protection and emergencies dgpce 2019 fig 9b this is confirmed by the quantitative comparison of simulated and reported impacts table 5 reaffine correctly identified murcia and alicante as the most severely affected regions in the region of malaga the relatively high simulated impacts are the result of a local rainfall overestimation caused by a systematic interference of the signal of the almeria radar visible in the accumulations in fig 8c and d of the overall 20 regions with insured losses greater than 10 thousand euros table 6 reaffine identified impacts in 14 which corresponds to a relatively high probability of detection of pod 0 70 in combination with 0 false alarms this resulted in a high critical success index of csi 0 70 table 6 fig 10 shows the part of spain that was most severely affected by the dana storm the ericha system detected significant ff hazard in almost all of the impact locations documented by the spanish civil protection the media or the twitter crowdsourcing fig 10a moreover the red hazard levels appear mostly in the areas where the density of reported impacts is highest in the great majority of the locations where the civil protection carried out rescues or evacuations the flood map module expanded the hazard signals from the ericha system fig 10a into the floodplains fig 10b furthermore in many rural areas where no impacts occurred hazard signals did not transform into floodplain hazard due to the lack of flood maps e g in the north east of the alicante region however also in a few locations with reported impacts ff hazard levels were not translated into floodplain hazard for instance near the border between alicante and albacete where two persons died on a flooded country road the medium hazard level disappeared because no flood maps are available for the small rural stream 31 km2 fig 10 the impact assessment module combined the floodplain hazard fig 10b with the population exposure resulting in the population impact levels shown in fig 11 the locations with high population impact coincide very well with the areas where the spanish civil protection reported the most important ff impacts dgpce 2019 in the severely affected towns of ontinyent upstream catchment area 160 km2 mogente 862 km2 and almansa 365 km2 in the north of fig 11 as well as in los alcazares 101 km2 and torre pacheco 15 km2 in the south along the segura river the impacts appear underestimated judging from the density of flood observations however the impact processes in this area were strongly dominated by the exceptional fluvial flooding in the segura river affecting more than 5000 ha of the floodplain erccb 2019 reaffine is not designed to detect the fluvial flood component originating from the segura river since the ericha system assesses the ff hazard only in the catchments smaller than 2000 km2 whereas the drainage area of the segura at the most severely affected location is about 15000 km2 in summary the performance of reaffine for this dana event is highly satisfactory the regional impact estimates table 5 and fig 9 correlate exceptionally well with the reported impacts also at sub regional scale reaffine accurately identified the areas where the most severe impacts were observed fig 11 in addition also the timing of the signals corresponded well with the flood occurrences e g the time of the simulated impacts in fig 2d matched the approximate peak times of the floods in los alcazares and torre pacheco however for the simulation of this event the uncertainty in the rainfall inputs has been minimised a posteriori in real time operation impact estimates with lower accuracies should be expected due to the quality of the rainfall inputs 4 conclusions this study introduces a novel method named reaffine for assessing flash flood impacts in real time at pan european scale until now real time flash flood impact assessments were limited to local or regional applications e g le bihan et al 2017 calianno et al 2013 ritter et al 2020 silvestro et al 2019 due to the high computational cost of these high resolution approaches reaffine addresses this challenge by operating in real time at lower resolution 1 km while the required high resolution information 25 m is incorporated through offline preprocessing the method is designed to be integrated into a pan european flash flood early warning system ews to provide operational decision support for emergency services and other end users operating over large spatial domains e g national or european civil protection mechanisms or transboundary catchment authorities the method consists of three main elements first a hazard module the ericha system corral et al 2019 park et al 2017 park et al 2019 transforms rainfall inputs into estimates of the flash flood hazard over a gridded drainage network covering all of europe secondly a flood map module uses the national flood maps created through the eu floods directive european commission 2007 to expand the flash flood hazard into the floodplains lastly an impact assessment module combines the estimated hazard in the floodplains with socio economic exposure information to identify the potentially affected population and critical infrastructures the structure of the method allows for the integration of additional exposure and vulnerability layers for instance the dynamic population density maps from the enact project batista e silva et al 2017 or the harci eu critical infrastructure grids batista e silva et al 2019 could be included to further enhance the impact estimation reaffine has been tested for two severe flash flood events affecting europe in recent years the capability of the method to identify impacts over large spatial scales has been demonstrated the simulation results generally corresponded well to the impacts reported by various validation sources however it has been found that a number of factors influence the performance of the method some of them due to inaccuracies in the employed datasets hereafter referred to as uncertainties others due to assumptions and methodological choices made by the components of reaffine hereafter referred to as limitations rainfall inputs the quality of the rainfall inputs is one of the most significant factors affecting the accuracy of the simulated flash flood impacts confirming the findings of ritter et al 2020 although being improved through the method of park et al 2019 the real time opera radar rainfall remains subject to high uncertainties these uncertainties can be mitigated by blending the radar rainfall with raingauge observations as done for the second event section3 2 however at european scale this technique is not yet available in real time due to the hurdles described by park et al 2019 in this study rainfall observations have been used as input to minimise external uncertainties and focus on the translation of rainfall inputs into socio economic impacts for usage in operational conditions it would be beneficial to employ also rainfall forecasts as inputs e g from radar nowcasting to increase the anticipation time of the warnings to quantify the benefits of using rainfall forecasts it would be important to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the influence of this additional uncertainty source on the accuracy of the warnings ericha flash flood hazard estimation given a sufficiently high quality of the rainfall inputs the ericha system appeared to provide reliable flash flood hazard estimates using the radar raingauge blending as rainfall input as done in the second event section3 2 the areas with the highest simulated hazard levels corresponded well to the areas where the most severe flash floods occurred in comparison the hazard estimates in the first event section3 1 showed a lower accuracy likely due to the higher uncertainty in the rainfall inputs compare the quality scores of the rainfall inputs in figs 5b and 8d the purely rainfall based hazard estimation not accounting for potentially important factors such as pre event soil moisture can result in underestimated or overestimated hazards in wet or dry catchments respectively in the two analysed extreme events this limitation has not been apparent but it is expected to have a larger influence during events of lower magnitudes see e g corral et al 2019 grillakis et al 2016 ritter et al 2020 flood map module the added value of applying the national flood maps for a refined hazard estimation is twofold firstly it expands the hazard signals into the floodplains and thus enhances the identification of potentially affected areas secondly the hazard signals are condensed to the parts of the stream network where flood maps are available which are by definition the areas where the national authorities identified significant flood risks european commission 2007 the resulting hazard levels in the floodplains concentrate on the high risk areas and are thus potentially easier to interpret for the end user however in both analysed events we have observed occasional gaps in the flood maps in streams that are small but do represent a significant risk similarly as found by ritter et al 2020 in such streams the application of the flood maps can lead to the removal of the hazard signal and thus in an underestimation of the impacts near rivers with large floodplains e g the rhine and the danube in the first event section3 1 the application of the flood maps can cause an overestimation of impacts reaffine assigns significant parts of the large floodplains to small tributaries resulting in simulated flash flood impacts where flood risks are mostly due to the large rivers in the future this limitation could be mitigated if the national authorities provide the flood extents separately for each stream as already done e g in some basins in spain ign 2020 instead of merging the flooded areas from large rivers and their tributaries a less effective but intermediate mitigation measure of this limitation could be to filter the simulation results of reaffine by applying a mask of the large river floodplains e g using the efas flood maps for rivers with catchment areas larger than 500 km2 dottori et al 2021 impact assessment module combining the hazard levels in the floodplains with socio economic exposure information enabled a quantitative estimation of the potentially affected population and critical infrastructures for each region the magnitudes of these regional impact estimates mostly corresponded to those reported by various validation sources at sub regional level the distributed population impact levels resulting from the application of the impact matrix mostly succeeded to point out the towns that suffered the most important impacts for instance in the second event section3 2 a high population impact was simulated for almost all of the towns where the civil protection carried out rescues or evacuations due to flash floods dgpce 2019 the presented results of the two flood events have illustrated some of the capabilities and limitations of the method the results of the second event section 3 2 have recently been compared to those obtained using a regional high resolution method and the results showed a high agreement ritter et al 2021a however it would be important to test reaffine also over a continuous time period e g 1 2 years and systematically evaluate the results e g using contingency tables a full evaluation would require testing the method in an operational setting and gathering feedback from the end users regarding the usefulness of the method for operational decision making as illustrated by both of the analysed events flood impacts are often the result of a combination of different flood types in the first event section3 1 pluvial floods exacerbated the impacts induced by the flash floods while in the second event section3 2 a coinciding fluvial flood in the segura river was responsible for a significant share of the losses for these so called compound events e g zscheischler et al 2018 zscheischler et al 2020 the flood type specific forecasting methods traditionally developed by the scientific community are unable to detect the overall impacts merz et al 2020 the decision support for the end users could be significantly improved by integrating different flood type specific methods into an overall flood impact forecast this idea has been explored in a separate study ritter et al 2021b that assessed the compound impacts of the second event section3 2 using a combination of two methods designed for flash floods ritter et al 2020 and river floods dottori et al 2017 in a recently published comprehensive review on impact forecasting methods merz et al 2020 concluded that impact forecasting tends to be more context specific than hazard forecasting in some cases first order estimates providing order of magnitude statements might suffice to support rescue operations in the very aftermath of the disaster in other cases detailed and location specific information about the expected impacts might be required to trigger specific emergency measures such as evacuating a hospital while the existing regional flash flood impact forecasting methods may serve as decision support for location specific emergency measures even up to the detail of site specific warnings see landaverde et al 2020 reaffine is capable of providing order of magnitude estimates from a large scale perspective this represents a significant complement to the existing decision support in particular for end users operating at larger spatial scales reaffine is ready for implementation in a pan european ews in this study the impact simulations in germany and spain have been analysed but the prerequisites for applying the method are met throughout the eu the ericha flash flood hazard system is already implemented in real time across europe and the employed socio economic exposure layers cover the entire continent including additional countries in reaffine is relatively simple only the national flood maps are required for the preprocessing of the exposure layers see section 2 and an increasing number of european countries share their flood maps on the inspire platform https inspire ec europa eu such initiatives for standardising and sharing data across borders pave the way towards future developments of forecasting solutions over large spatial scales in the context of reaffine the harmonisation of historical rainfall records and commonly defined return periods for the creation of the national flood maps would allow for further enhancements of the method for instance it would enable fully quantitative real time assessments of affected population critical infrastructures and

3920,the development of early warning systems ewss is a key element for the effective mitigation of flash flood impacts emergency managers and other end users increasingly recognise the benefit of tools that automatically translate the forecasted flash flood hazard e g expressed in terms of peak discharge or return period into the expected socio economic impacts e g the affected population while previous studies aimed at forecasting flash flood impacts at local or regional scales this paper presents a simple approach for estimating in real time the flash flood impacts at pan european scale the proposed method named reaffine is designed to be integrated into an ews for end users operating over large spatial domains e g across regions or countries reaffine uses the pan european flash flood hazard estimates from the ericha system to retrieve the potentially flooded areas from the national flood maps generated in the framework of the eu floods directive by combining the potentially flooded areas with socio economic exposure information reaffine estimates in real time the exposed population and critical infrastructures for two catastrophic flash flood events affecting europe in recent years reaffine has demonstrated the capability to identify impacts over large spatial scales also at sub regional level the method has mostly been able to locate the areas and municipalities where the most important impacts occurred the results also show that the performance is sensitive to the quality of the rainfall estimates that drive the hazard estimation and to the comprehensiveness of the employed flood maps keywords flash flood impact forecasting early warning radar rainfall continental scale 1 introduction flash floods ffs hereafter are one of the most devastating natural hazards in europe causing numerous casualties barredo 2007 petrucci et al 2019 terti et al 2017 and tremendous economic losses eea 2010 gaume et al 2009 munich re 2017 paprotny et al 2018 this type of flooding is characterized by intense downpours in small to medium sized often mountainous catchments leading to a short response time between the rainfall and the discharge peak in the stream network in the range of minutes to a few hours the sudden event onset often hinders a timely flood response e g in form of evacuations or road closures and is the main reason for the high socio economic impacts caused by ffs eea 2010 sene 2013 spitalar et al 2014 early warning systems ewss aim to extend the time span available for applying flood response measures and are therefore considered to bear the highest potential for effectively reducing ff impacts eea 2010 the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction unisdr 2015a demands a leap in the development and availability of ewss by 2030 many countries already dispose of ff ewss that translate observed and forecasted rainfall into the expected response in the stream network i e the ff hazard real time and operational examples were demonstrated for instance in areas in the united states clark et al 2014 georgakakos 2006 switzerland liechti et al 2013 zappa et al 2008 spain corral et al 2009 versini et al 2014 france javelle et al 2010 2016 and italy corral et al 2019 laiolo et al 2014 silvestro et al 2011 for reviews including more examples see alfieri et al 2012 2019 gourley et al 2014 hapuarachchi et al 2011 or li et al 2018 at european scale two systems have been delivering for several years ff hazard forecasts to end users across the continent eric european runoff index based on climatology alfieri and thielen 2015 raynaud et al 2015 and ericha european rainfall induced hazard assessment park et al 2017 2019 both systems compute their warnings by comparing observed and forecasted basin aggregated rainfall to thresholds derived from climatology ericha uses fixed rainfall thresholds whereas eric dynamically updates the thresholds in function of the current catchment conditions e g soil moisture the two systems are complementary while eric uses numerical weather prediction nwp precipitation forecasts as input to assess the ff hazard for the coming five days the ericha system generates high resolution 1 km and 15 min warnings for the next few hours using radar based rainfall observations and nowcasts the systems mentioned above predict the hazard component of ffs expressed e g in terms of the peak discharge or return period in the stream network to estimate the potential impacts of a forecasted ff it is necessary to combine the hazard forecasts with socio economic exposure and vulnerability information e g the locations of settlements or critical infrastructures in the current practice emergency managers usually do this combination non automatically and based on personal experience which is time consuming and results in subjective decisions merz et al 2020 wmo 2015 tools that automatically translate the hazard forecasts into the expected impacts can speed up the decision process and reduce subjectivity ultimately leading to an improved flood response taylor et al 2018 unisdr 2015b prior efforts to automatically forecast ff impacts showed promising results the existing approaches forecast the impacts in terms of qualitative ff severity levels calianno et al 2013 saint martin et al 2016 the number of inundated properties le bihan et al 2017 effects on the road network versini et al 2010 vincendon et al 2016 flooded critical infrastructures ritter et al 2020 and affected population and direct economic losses ritter et al 2020 silvestro et al 2019 these methods require exposure and vulnerability datasets in very high resolution as a reference ritter et al 2020 used a resolution of 25 m over the region of catalonia northeast spain the real time application of such high resolution approaches over larger areas is computationally challenging which is the main reason why they have been limited to local or regional domains to today a method that forecasts ff impacts over large domains e g across regions or countries does not exist but it would be beneficial in two ways firstly it would extend the coverage of ff impact forecasts to areas where no such decision support is available yet e g many european countries secondly it would offer a more transboundary perspective on potential ff impacts which can be useful for end users operating on the international level such as transboundary river catchment authorities or the emergency response coordination centre ercc of the european union emerton et al 2016 merz et al 2020 thielen et al 2009 ward et al 2015 the european flood awareness system efas already includes a forecast of the impacts of fluvial floods in european catchments larger than 500 km2 the rapid risk assessment dottori et al 2017 complementing this system with a method detecting the impacts of ffs in the smaller basins across europe would significantly extend the available decision support in this work we build on the ff impact forecasting method reaffirm real time assessment of flash flood impacts a regional high resolution method ritter et al 2020 and we propose an approach that is applicable at european scale named reaffine real time assessment of flash flood impacts at pan european scale the proposed method estimates the potential ff impacts across europe by complementing hazard simulations from the ericha system with components that account for the socio economic exposure of the areas at risk reaffine integrates a variety of datasets available throughout the eu e g flood maps or population density maps which enables a homogeneous impact estimation across borders the method is adapted to real time conditions and designed to be integrated into an ews with pan european coverage the following section2 provides a detailed description of reaffine its individual components and how it has been applied using the available datasets in section3 the method is demonstrated on two recent ff events that caused numerous fatalities and widespread economic losses and the resulting impact estimates are compared to post event observations from various information sources finally in section4 we draw some general conclusions and point towards potential future developments 2 the reaffine method the objective of this study is to enhance the decision support during ffs for end users operating over large spatial scales we propose the method reaffine which estimates in real time the socio economic impacts of ffs across europe this is achieved through the application of three modules fig 1 1 the hazard module assesses the ff hazard in real time for this purpose we have chosen the ericha system section2 1 that simulates the ff hazard level along a gridded drainage network over europe based on radar rainfall observations 2 the flood map module section 2 2 transforms the ff hazard levels in the drainage network into hazard levels in the floodplains in reaffine this is done based on the national flood maps generated by the member states through the implementation of the european floods directive european commission 2007 3 the impact assessment module section 2 3 translates the hazard levels in the floodplains into socio economic impacts in reaffine the impacts are assessed in terms of potentially affected population and critical infrastructures in the floodplains based on pan european exposure information the following subsections describe the details of the three modules of reaffine outlining the individual steps of the method and the necessary preprocessing of the employed datasets an overview of the spatial and temporal resolutions used by the reaffine components is provided in table 1 in practice the chain of reaffine modules is triggered every 15 min i e every time new rainfall inputs become available fig 1 on a standard server the overall computing time from the opera radar composites to the impact outputs amounts to about 90 s table 1 a such short latency does not significantly delay the transmission of the outputs to the end user and thus the emergency response 2 1 flash flood hazard estimation the ericha system at european scale for estimating the ff hazard we have employed the ericha system corral et al 2019 park et al 2017 2019 which was implemented in real time at european scale in the framework of the eponymous research project ericha www crahi upc edu ericha since 2017 the ericha ff hazard nowcasts have been displayed on the online platform of the european flood awareness system www efas eu en flash flood indicators where they have been used for operational decision support by water agencies and emergency services operating at regional national and international level the ericha system generates ff hazard nowcasts for european streams with drainage areas of 5 2000 km2 the main dynamic input for the ericha system consists of real time radar rainfall composites from opera operational program for the exchange of weather radar information www eumetnet eu opera these composites provide precipitation estimates covering all of europe in high resolution 2 km 15 min from these rainfall estimates the ericha system calculates the basin aggregated rainfall amounts over a gridded drainage network in 1 km resolution to determine the ff hazard the basin aggregated rainfall amounts are compared to basin aggregated intensity duration thresholds adapted from those used by the eumetnet project meteoalarm www meteoalarm eu the result is the estimated hazard level in the drainage network in colour code yellow orange red representing low medium high hazard levels see fig 2 a for an example 2 2 flood map module the goal of the flood map module is to identify in real time the potentially flooded areas to achieve this a connection is created between the ff hazard levels generated by the ericha system section2 1 and the national flood maps produced in the framework of the eu floods directive european commission 2007 following the regional approach of ritter et al 2020 this connection is established based on the minimum distance between the ericha drainage network cells and the inundated areas in the flood maps each floodplain section is assigned to the nearest ericha drainage network cell when operating at european scale however a few adjustments are necessary the flood maps of the member states were created using a variety of hydraulic modelling approaches for an overview see european commission 2015a not only the modelling approaches but also the specifications of the flood maps vary considerably across the eu alfieri et al 2014 dottori et al 2021 for instance there are no common guidelines regarding the return periods modelled by the member states de moel et al 2009 european commission 2015b priest et al 2016 even within countries the chosen return periods can vary between regions e g in germany where the federal states are responsible for creating the maps to achieve a certain homogeneity across europe we have used in each location the flood map of the highest available return period e g in spain the map of t 500 years see fig 2b as a proxy of the maximum possible flood extent hereafter referred to as the floodplain to make use of the high resolution information contained in the floodplain maps we have chosen to preprocess the maps as follows first the floodplain geometries have been rasterised to a grid of 25 m resolution as also done by the regional high resolution method of ritter et al 2020 this gridded high resolution floodplain is used for preprocessing the exposure layers details follow in section2 3 then the gridded high resolution floodplain has been upscaled to 1 km resolution the 1 km cells containing floodplains are hereafter referred to as floodplain cells see fig 2b and are used in the real time calculations to establish the link between the floodplains and the ericha drainage network each floodplain cell has been assigned by minimum distance to the nearest ericha drainage network cell s fig 2a c illustrates how the flood map module uses this assignment in real time operation if the ericha system identifies a ff hazard in a drainage network cell fig 2a the hazard level is automatically transmitted to all the floodplain cells assigned to this drainage network cell the result is a map showing hazard levels in the potentially affected floodplains fig 2c 2 3 impact assessment module the aim of the impact assessment module is to estimate the socio economic ff impacts in real time for this purpose it combines the hazard levels in the floodplains generated by the flood map module section 2 2 with information on socio economic exposure in reaffine impacts are estimated in terms of the potentially affected population section2 3 1 and critical infrastructures section2 3 2 to provide the end user with a situational overview of the areas with the highest potential impacts reaffine also summarises the simulation results at the level of administrative regions section2 3 3 2 3 1 impact on population this component of the impact assessment module estimates in real time the impact on the population by counting the population potentially exposed to the hazard levels in the floodplain generated by the flood map module section2 2 as a base for this step we have used the population density map of freire et al 2016 covering all of europe in 100 m resolution for the application in reaffine the original dataset has been preprocessed offline as follows first the resolution of the dataset has been increased to 25 m using nearest neighbour interpolation then population density values outside the floodplains have been removed using the gridded high resolution floodplain map described in section2 2 finally the 25 m cells have been upscaled to 1 km resolution to match the grid of the floodplain cells this process of downscaling cropping upscaling allows to determine offline in high resolution the population potentially exposed to flooding in each floodplain cell before aggregating this information to a resolution that is suitable for real time simulations at european scale in real time operation reaffine uses the preprocessed population exposure map to estimate the impact on the population in addition to counting the population potentially exposed to ff hazard more detail follows in section2 3 3 the potential impact the on population is also mapped in real time this is done by means of an impact matrix fig 3 that combines in each 1 km cell the three floodplain hazard levels fig 2c with three population exposure classes low 1 99 people km2 medium 100 999 people km2 and high 1000 and more people km2 these thresholds are arbitrary and have been manually adjusted the result of applying the impact matrix is a map showing in each 1 km cell the population impact in terms of three qualitative impact levels low medium high see fig 2d for an example 2 3 2 impact on critical infrastructures cis reaffine estimates the ff impact on critical infrastructures cis by counting in real time the cis potentially exposed to the hazard levels in the floodplains this is done based on a ci dataset extracted from openstreetmaps in the frame of the project global exposure data for risk assessment giovando et al 2020 in reaffine we have included education facilities ef health facilities hf and mass gathering sites mg and it is planned to add other ci types that will become available soon with european coverage e g roads and railways each of the three ci layers has been preprocessed offline in high resolution first only the cis inside the gridded high resolution floodplains see section 2 2 have been kept in the inventory to maintain only the cis potentially exposed to flooding then the numbers and types of cis have been counted in each 1 km floodplain cell in real time operation reaffine retrieves the numbers and types of cis in all floodplain cells where the flood map module section 2 2 identified a floodplain hazard the result is a list of the exposed cis in each floodplain cell 2 3 3 regional impact summary when monitoring the real time impact estimates at large spatial scales it can be difficult and time consuming for the end user to identify the areas with the highest potential impacts to assist in this task reaffine summarises the simulated impacts described in sections2 3 1 and 2 3 2 for each time step at the level of administrative regions to ensure a homogeneous region size across country borders we have used the combination of nuts 2 e g in germany and nuts 3 regions e g in spain proposed by dottori et al 2017 for the impact aggregation as illustrated in table 2 reaffine summarises for each region the following information i the overall exposed population i e the sum of people potentially affected by any of the three floodplain hazard levels ii totals of exposed population and cis listed separately for each of the three floodplain hazard levels and iii the regional impact level which is assigned as the maximum floodplain hazard level affecting population or cis in the impact summary table 2 the regions are sorted in descending order of overall exposed population amounts point i of the above list to direct the attention of the end user towards the regions with the highest numbers of potentially affected people to complement the impact summary the regional impacts are also mapped fig 4 the regions are coloured according to the maximum floodplain hazard level affecting the population or cis point iii of the above list this is done to also highlight high hazard levels that affect only small amounts of population or cis since the localised nature of ffs can pose a potentially fatal risk to a very limited area 3 results we have applied reaffine to two ff events of recent years that caused numerous fatalities and billions of euros in economic losses the elvira storm in central europe in spring 2016 and a cut off low dana in spain in autumn 2019 in this section we demonstrate the performance of reaffine for these two events in germany and spain using the national flood maps of these two countries bfg 2020 ign 2020 the simulated ff impacts presented in this section have been generated by running reaffine on rainfall observations rather than forecasts this has been done to minimise external uncertainties and focus on the method s capabilities and limitations of translating ff hazards into impacts to evaluate the performance of the method the simulation results have been compared with the impacts reported by civil protection authorities insurance companies news agencies and social media such flood impact observations are inherently subject to high uncertainties e g brouwer et al 2017 ritter et al 2020 and they typically contain impacts not only from ffs but also from other flood types that reaffine is not designed to detect this impedes a fully fair quantitative comparison between the simulated and the reported impacts and therefore the results in this study have been evaluated mostly from a qualitative point of view while inspecting the reaffine outputs in the following subsections it is necessary to keep in mind that the primary objective of the method is to estimate ff impacts from a large scale perspective across regions or countries the detection of more accurate impact locations and magnitudes is the aim of the regional high resolution approaches mentioned in section1 3 1 event 1 the low pressure system elvira in central europe in 2016 from the end of may to early june 2016 the stationary low pressure system elvira induced large rainfall amounts across central europe the most significant impacts occurred in germany and france while in france mostly large rivers overflowed their banks e g the seine in paris the situation in germany was characterised by numerous slow moving and fast evolving convective cells that caused severe ffs and pluvial floods across the country piper et al 2016 according to munich re 2017 the overall economic damages in germany amounted to 2 6 billion euros and a total of ten people lost their lives due to the floods the most devastating ffs occurred on 29 may in the village of braunsbach in the stuttgart region bronstert et al 2018 bronstert et al 2017 and on 01 june in simbach am inn niederbayern where five people died lfu 2016 tum 2017 fig 5 shows the accumulated precipitation for the most intense period of the elvira storm in germany 29 may 03 june 2016 it can be seen that the real time adjusted opera radar rainfall using the method of park et al 2019 corresponds reasonably well to the rainfall accumulations measured by the synop raingauges wmo 2016 the real time adjusted radar rainfall maps 2 km and 15 min resolution have been used as input for reaffine over the entire duration of the event this resulted in the simulated impacts summarised in table 3 and fig 6 a reaffine detected impacts in 35 of the 38 german nuts 2 regions i e all except berlin hamburg and schleswig holstein the regions with the most severe simulated impacts correspond reasonably well to those of the reported impacts table 3 and fig 6 in the 20 regions with the highest simulated impacts impacts were also reported in reality either by the european severe weather database eswd www eswd eu or through the tweets collected by global flood monitor www globalfloodmonitor org de bruijn et al 2018 2019 among the overall 38 german regions we have identified 31 with both simulated and reported impacts 4 with simulated but no reported impacts and 2 with reported but no simulated impacts in some regions the magnitudes of the simulated impacts do not correspond very well to the magnitude of the reported impacts for instance the amounts of exposed population seem to be overestimated in the regions of dusseldorf 609704 koln 186201 and darmstadt 133399 table 3 this is due to the rhine river passing through these regions with an extremely wide floodplain up to 25 km in the dusseldorf region a significant share of the rhine s floodplain is assigned to several small tributaries rather than to the rhine itself since reaffine s flood map module operates based on the minimum distance between floodplains and assigned streams as explained in section 2 2 in some of these tributaries the ericha system estimated low to medium ff hazard resulting in widespread floodplain hazard levels and thus overestimated impacts in these three regions with an exposed population of almost 194000 the region of stuttgart has been correctly identified as one of the most severely impacted by the storm table 3 however reaffine did not detect any population exposed to high hazard in this region this does not seem to be in line with the three fatalities table 3 and the ff in the village of braunsbach with a return period clearly above 100 years bronstert et al 2018 the reason for the underestimation of the impact magnitude in the stuttgart region is that the radar did not fully capture the extreme rainfall intensities in the small convective cells for instance in the small catchment upstream of braunsbach 6 km2 the real time adjusted radar fig 5a estimated rainfall accumulations of 46 54 mm in 24 h 29 september 08 00 utc 30 september 08 00 utc whereas bronstert et al 2018 reconstructed a value of 135 153 mm for an almost identical time period due to the underestimated rainfall intensities the ericha ff hazard did not exceed the medium level in braunsbach and thus reaffine did not detect any population exposed to a high hazard in three locations in germany reaffine identified populations exposed to high hazard levels table 3 and fig 6a in the town of ilmenau thuringen that suffered severe flash floods deutsche welle 2016 reaffine estimated 1061 people exposed to high hazard table 3 furthermore 348 people exposed to high hazard were identified in the village of obernzenn mittelfranken table 3 that also experienced severe flooding nürnberger presse 2016 lastly also in niederbayern which was the most affected region with seven fatalities and economic losses of around 1 25 billion euros lfu 2016 reaffine identified population exposed to high hazard table 3 to add more quantitative components to the evaluation we have also analysed the results at the level of the 401 districts in germany nuts 3 regions table 4 for reference we have considered that impacts occurred in those districts with either tweets or eswd reports in 29 4 of the german districts impacts were both simulated and reported whereas false alarms affected 48 6 of the districts i e impacts were simulated in many cases with weak signals but no tweets or eswd reports were issued in those districts table 4 finally impacts were missed in 4 of the districts these results translate to a high probability of detection of pod 0 89 and a critical success index of csi 0 36 the relatively low csi is the consequence of the high number of false alarms which are partly due to the inherent incompleteness of impact observations especially in areas that experienced only minor impacts for an impression of the high uncertainties in the impact datasets see the discrepancies between the eswd reports and the tweets in figs 6b and 7 to evaluate the simulation results at even smaller spatial scales we take a closer look at the most severely affected region of niederbayern as a reference for the simulated impacts we have used the impact observations from twitter and the european severe weather database previously shown in fig 6b and additionally the regional flood observations from the bavarian environment agency lfu 2016 the ericha system simulated widespread ff hazard in the drainage network across niederbayern fig 7a the ff hazard signals appear in most of the locations with impact evidences from eswd lfu or tweets on the other hand also large areas without reported impacts show ff hazard e g the rural north eastern part of the region in the town of simbach am inn which suffered unprecedented flooding with five fatalities lfu 2016 tum 2017 the ericha ff hazard in the simbach stream 30 km2 did not exceed the medium level fig 7a the underestimation of the hazard in this location is due to a breach of a road embankment upstream of the town lfu 2016 tum 2017 which significantly increased the real flood magnitude in simbach am inn based on the ericha ff hazard in the drainage network fig 7a the flood map module section2 2 estimated the hazard levels in the floodplains shown in fig 7b floodplain hazard signals are present in many of the reported impact locations especially in the most severely affected areas such as simbach am inn fig 7b furthermore widespread ericha ff hazard signals in areas where no significant impacts occurred e g in the north east of the region fig 7a did not transform into floodplain hazard due to the lack of flood maps in these rural areas fig 7b on the other hand also in some locations with reported impacts the flood map module did not transform the ericha ff hazard into floodplain hazard this can occur for two reasons in some locations the responsible authorities did not create flood maps due to the low however existing socio economic exposure of the areas near the streams see for instance the disappearance of the high hazard level in the small stream 28 km2 near the village of rattenberg in fig 7 in other locations e g in herrngiersdorf fig 7 the reported impacts were not caused by ffs but by surface runoff outside the floodplains pluvial flooding lfu 2016 to summarise the results of the elvira storm the impact estimates from a large scale perspective corresponded relatively well to the observed regional impacts fig 6 at sub regional scale the underlying uncertainty sources of the method became more apparent e g the accuracy of the rainfall estimates or the coverage of the flood maps nevertheless reaffine succeeded to detect the regions of the most severe impacts e g niederbayern although the simulation results presented in this section have been aggregated over the full event duration it should be noted that the timing of the simulated impacts in the most affected locations approximately coincided with the onsets of the floods for instance the medium hazard levels around simbach am inn appeared about 1 h before the first flooding in the town was reported lfu 2016 3 2 event 2 the dana event of 2019 in spain in september 2019 a cut off low in spain commonly known as dana depresión aislada en niveles altos martín león 2003 promoted the development of long lasting convective systems that affected large parts of the country along the south eastern mediterranean coast rainfall accumulations of up to 461 mm in 24 h caused numerous ffs and a severe river flood in the downstream part of the segura catchment see e g biener camacho and prieto cerdán 2019 ercca 2019 garcía et al 2020 seven people lost their lives over 6000 were evacuated dgpce 2019 and the overall economic losses were estimated to exceed 2 2 billion euros aon 2019 in contrast to the elvira storm of spring 2016 section 3 1 the accuracy of the real time adjusted opera radar rainfall for the dana event was relatively low fig 8 a and b the radar located in murcia had a malfunction during an important period of the event resulting in a significant underestimation of the rainfall amounts to mitigate this underestimation for the analysis of this event we have a posteriori applied the radar raingauge blending method of velasco forero et al 2009 also described by cassiraga et al 2020 using the hourly observations of the raingauge network of the spanish state meteorological agency the resulting improved rainfall accumulations are shown in fig 8c and d using the blended rainfall maps as input reaffine identified impacts in 14 of the 48 spanish nuts 3 regions in the domain the regions with the highest simulated impacts fig 9 a correspond very well to those reported by the spanish insurance compensation consortium ccs 2020 and the spanish directorate general for civil protection and emergencies dgpce 2019 fig 9b this is confirmed by the quantitative comparison of simulated and reported impacts table 5 reaffine correctly identified murcia and alicante as the most severely affected regions in the region of malaga the relatively high simulated impacts are the result of a local rainfall overestimation caused by a systematic interference of the signal of the almeria radar visible in the accumulations in fig 8c and d of the overall 20 regions with insured losses greater than 10 thousand euros table 6 reaffine identified impacts in 14 which corresponds to a relatively high probability of detection of pod 0 70 in combination with 0 false alarms this resulted in a high critical success index of csi 0 70 table 6 fig 10 shows the part of spain that was most severely affected by the dana storm the ericha system detected significant ff hazard in almost all of the impact locations documented by the spanish civil protection the media or the twitter crowdsourcing fig 10a moreover the red hazard levels appear mostly in the areas where the density of reported impacts is highest in the great majority of the locations where the civil protection carried out rescues or evacuations the flood map module expanded the hazard signals from the ericha system fig 10a into the floodplains fig 10b furthermore in many rural areas where no impacts occurred hazard signals did not transform into floodplain hazard due to the lack of flood maps e g in the north east of the alicante region however also in a few locations with reported impacts ff hazard levels were not translated into floodplain hazard for instance near the border between alicante and albacete where two persons died on a flooded country road the medium hazard level disappeared because no flood maps are available for the small rural stream 31 km2 fig 10 the impact assessment module combined the floodplain hazard fig 10b with the population exposure resulting in the population impact levels shown in fig 11 the locations with high population impact coincide very well with the areas where the spanish civil protection reported the most important ff impacts dgpce 2019 in the severely affected towns of ontinyent upstream catchment area 160 km2 mogente 862 km2 and almansa 365 km2 in the north of fig 11 as well as in los alcazares 101 km2 and torre pacheco 15 km2 in the south along the segura river the impacts appear underestimated judging from the density of flood observations however the impact processes in this area were strongly dominated by the exceptional fluvial flooding in the segura river affecting more than 5000 ha of the floodplain erccb 2019 reaffine is not designed to detect the fluvial flood component originating from the segura river since the ericha system assesses the ff hazard only in the catchments smaller than 2000 km2 whereas the drainage area of the segura at the most severely affected location is about 15000 km2 in summary the performance of reaffine for this dana event is highly satisfactory the regional impact estimates table 5 and fig 9 correlate exceptionally well with the reported impacts also at sub regional scale reaffine accurately identified the areas where the most severe impacts were observed fig 11 in addition also the timing of the signals corresponded well with the flood occurrences e g the time of the simulated impacts in fig 2d matched the approximate peak times of the floods in los alcazares and torre pacheco however for the simulation of this event the uncertainty in the rainfall inputs has been minimised a posteriori in real time operation impact estimates with lower accuracies should be expected due to the quality of the rainfall inputs 4 conclusions this study introduces a novel method named reaffine for assessing flash flood impacts in real time at pan european scale until now real time flash flood impact assessments were limited to local or regional applications e g le bihan et al 2017 calianno et al 2013 ritter et al 2020 silvestro et al 2019 due to the high computational cost of these high resolution approaches reaffine addresses this challenge by operating in real time at lower resolution 1 km while the required high resolution information 25 m is incorporated through offline preprocessing the method is designed to be integrated into a pan european flash flood early warning system ews to provide operational decision support for emergency services and other end users operating over large spatial domains e g national or european civil protection mechanisms or transboundary catchment authorities the method consists of three main elements first a hazard module the ericha system corral et al 2019 park et al 2017 park et al 2019 transforms rainfall inputs into estimates of the flash flood hazard over a gridded drainage network covering all of europe secondly a flood map module uses the national flood maps created through the eu floods directive european commission 2007 to expand the flash flood hazard into the floodplains lastly an impact assessment module combines the estimated hazard in the floodplains with socio economic exposure information to identify the potentially affected population and critical infrastructures the structure of the method allows for the integration of additional exposure and vulnerability layers for instance the dynamic population density maps from the enact project batista e silva et al 2017 or the harci eu critical infrastructure grids batista e silva et al 2019 could be included to further enhance the impact estimation reaffine has been tested for two severe flash flood events affecting europe in recent years the capability of the method to identify impacts over large spatial scales has been demonstrated the simulation results generally corresponded well to the impacts reported by various validation sources however it has been found that a number of factors influence the performance of the method some of them due to inaccuracies in the employed datasets hereafter referred to as uncertainties others due to assumptions and methodological choices made by the components of reaffine hereafter referred to as limitations rainfall inputs the quality of the rainfall inputs is one of the most significant factors affecting the accuracy of the simulated flash flood impacts confirming the findings of ritter et al 2020 although being improved through the method of park et al 2019 the real time opera radar rainfall remains subject to high uncertainties these uncertainties can be mitigated by blending the radar rainfall with raingauge observations as done for the second event section3 2 however at european scale this technique is not yet available in real time due to the hurdles described by park et al 2019 in this study rainfall observations have been used as input to minimise external uncertainties and focus on the translation of rainfall inputs into socio economic impacts for usage in operational conditions it would be beneficial to employ also rainfall forecasts as inputs e g from radar nowcasting to increase the anticipation time of the warnings to quantify the benefits of using rainfall forecasts it would be important to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the influence of this additional uncertainty source on the accuracy of the warnings ericha flash flood hazard estimation given a sufficiently high quality of the rainfall inputs the ericha system appeared to provide reliable flash flood hazard estimates using the radar raingauge blending as rainfall input as done in the second event section3 2 the areas with the highest simulated hazard levels corresponded well to the areas where the most severe flash floods occurred in comparison the hazard estimates in the first event section3 1 showed a lower accuracy likely due to the higher uncertainty in the rainfall inputs compare the quality scores of the rainfall inputs in figs 5b and 8d the purely rainfall based hazard estimation not accounting for potentially important factors such as pre event soil moisture can result in underestimated or overestimated hazards in wet or dry catchments respectively in the two analysed extreme events this limitation has not been apparent but it is expected to have a larger influence during events of lower magnitudes see e g corral et al 2019 grillakis et al 2016 ritter et al 2020 flood map module the added value of applying the national flood maps for a refined hazard estimation is twofold firstly it expands the hazard signals into the floodplains and thus enhances the identification of potentially affected areas secondly the hazard signals are condensed to the parts of the stream network where flood maps are available which are by definition the areas where the national authorities identified significant flood risks european commission 2007 the resulting hazard levels in the floodplains concentrate on the high risk areas and are thus potentially easier to interpret for the end user however in both analysed events we have observed occasional gaps in the flood maps in streams that are small but do represent a significant risk similarly as found by ritter et al 2020 in such streams the application of the flood maps can lead to the removal of the hazard signal and thus in an underestimation of the impacts near rivers with large floodplains e g the rhine and the danube in the first event section3 1 the application of the flood maps can cause an overestimation of impacts reaffine assigns significant parts of the large floodplains to small tributaries resulting in simulated flash flood impacts where flood risks are mostly due to the large rivers in the future this limitation could be mitigated if the national authorities provide the flood extents separately for each stream as already done e g in some basins in spain ign 2020 instead of merging the flooded areas from large rivers and their tributaries a less effective but intermediate mitigation measure of this limitation could be to filter the simulation results of reaffine by applying a mask of the large river floodplains e g using the efas flood maps for rivers with catchment areas larger than 500 km2 dottori et al 2021 impact assessment module combining the hazard levels in the floodplains with socio economic exposure information enabled a quantitative estimation of the potentially affected population and critical infrastructures for each region the magnitudes of these regional impact estimates mostly corresponded to those reported by various validation sources at sub regional level the distributed population impact levels resulting from the application of the impact matrix mostly succeeded to point out the towns that suffered the most important impacts for instance in the second event section3 2 a high population impact was simulated for almost all of the towns where the civil protection carried out rescues or evacuations due to flash floods dgpce 2019 the presented results of the two flood events have illustrated some of the capabilities and limitations of the method the results of the second event section 3 2 have recently been compared to those obtained using a regional high resolution method and the results showed a high agreement ritter et al 2021a however it would be important to test reaffine also over a continuous time period e g 1 2 years and systematically evaluate the results e g using contingency tables a full evaluation would require testing the method in an operational setting and gathering feedback from the end users regarding the usefulness of the method for operational decision making as illustrated by both of the analysed events flood impacts are often the result of a combination of different flood types in the first event section3 1 pluvial floods exacerbated the impacts induced by the flash floods while in the second event section3 2 a coinciding fluvial flood in the segura river was responsible for a significant share of the losses for these so called compound events e g zscheischler et al 2018 zscheischler et al 2020 the flood type specific forecasting methods traditionally developed by the scientific community are unable to detect the overall impacts merz et al 2020 the decision support for the end users could be significantly improved by integrating different flood type specific methods into an overall flood impact forecast this idea has been explored in a separate study ritter et al 2021b that assessed the compound impacts of the second event section3 2 using a combination of two methods designed for flash floods ritter et al 2020 and river floods dottori et al 2017 in a recently published comprehensive review on impact forecasting methods merz et al 2020 concluded that impact forecasting tends to be more context specific than hazard forecasting in some cases first order estimates providing order of magnitude statements might suffice to support rescue operations in the very aftermath of the disaster in other cases detailed and location specific information about the expected impacts might be required to trigger specific emergency measures such as evacuating a hospital while the existing regional flash flood impact forecasting methods may serve as decision support for location specific emergency measures even up to the detail of site specific warnings see landaverde et al 2020 reaffine is capable of providing order of magnitude estimates from a large scale perspective this represents a significant complement to the existing decision support in particular for end users operating at larger spatial scales reaffine is ready for implementation in a pan european ews in this study the impact simulations in germany and spain have been analysed but the prerequisites for applying the method are met throughout the eu the ericha flash flood hazard system is already implemented in real time across europe and the employed socio economic exposure layers cover the entire continent including additional countries in reaffine is relatively simple only the national flood maps are required for the preprocessing of the exposure layers see section 2 and an increasing number of european countries share their flood maps on the inspire platform https inspire ec europa eu such initiatives for standardising and sharing data across borders pave the way towards future developments of forecasting solutions over large spatial scales in the context of reaffine the harmonisation of historical rainfall records and commonly defined return periods for the creation of the national flood maps would allow for further enhancements of the method for instance it would enable fully quantitative real time assessments of affected population critical infrastructures and

3921,wetlands are important components of many large river systems some basin scale hydrological models do include explicit sub models to deal with wetland impacts but one of the key challenges is to estimate appropriate parameter values to represent the channel wetland exchange processes a combined modelling approach is applied in this study and involves the use of the detailed daily time step lisflood fp hydraulic model to improve the understanding of channel wetland exchange dynamics and to quantify the wetland parameters of a basin scale hydrological model while there remain many uncertainties associated with a lack of sufficient validation data the lisflood fp results largely reflect the physical characteristics of the two floodplains the luangwa and barotse in the zambezi river basin the lisflood fp results were also used to estimate the wetland parameters of the basin scale hydrological model with greater confidence and improved the downstream simulations results albeit marginally the results suggest that the influence of the floodplain on the monthly luangwa flow regime is minimal whereas the barotse floodplain significantly attenuates the high flows and regulates the low flows of the upper zambezi river the approach implemented in this study presents an important step towards the improvements of water resource assessments modelling for research and practical purposes in data scarce river basins however further work is required to refine the model setup using additional field information related to exchange dynamics as well as high quality remote sensing data keywords africa channel wetland exchanges hydrological models hydraulic models 1 introduction there are many large african river basins that contain substantial wetland areas tooth et al 2002 hughes et al 2014 and these wetlands are known to have impacts on the flow regimes of downstream rivers kashaigili et al 2006 moore et al 2008 beilfuss 2012 upstream water resources developments whether consumptive storage and abstractions for agriculture or domestic industrial water supply or non consumptive hydro power are also known to impact on the hydrology and ecological functioning of the wetlands themselves schuijt 2002 schuyt 2005 kashaigili et al 2006 mwakalila 2011 wamulume et al 2011 grundling et al 2013 mcclain 2013 matthew and day 2014 however the exact quantitative nature of these impacts is largely unknown luan and zhou 2013 for various reasons the first and perhaps most obvious reason is that there are very few data sets available for large african river basins that can be used to directly quantify the impacts this includes a lack of river flow data and a lack of data on the extent and volume of inundation during different river discharges there may be situations where river sections upstream or downstream of the wetland areas are gauged but there are almost no situations where both upstream and downstream reaches are monitored a further problem with many of the available streamflow gauging records is that it is not always possible to access the raw stage and station rating curve data and only processed mean daily flow are made available to potential users and in some cases only monthly volumes the rating curves themselves are not always reliable pappenberger et al 2006 di baldassarre and montanari 2009 domeneghetti et al 2012 mcmillan et al 2012 and are often extrapolated with a great deal of uncertainty to provide the high flow estimates that are of primary concern in understanding and modelling water exchanges between the river channels and the wetland areas apart from the data availability issues there are also different types of wetlands within many large african river basins even a casual perusal of google earth imagery reveals two main different types of wetlands some are large rounded basins through which the main river channel flows for example lukanga swamps in the kafue river basin zambia usangu wetlands in the great ruaha river basin tanzania but which also may contain a number of distributed secondary channels that will inevitably affect the inundation return drainage and evaporation loss characteristics of the wetlands the other main type is linear floodplains many exhibiting the classical geomorphological features associated with floodplains migrating across valley floors abandoned channels ridges and swales of previous sedimentary deposits these floodplains can be found on many of the large rivers in africa including the zambezi luangwa and kafue rivers in zambia the cubango and okavango rivers in angola and the mara rufiji and kilombero rivers in tanzania two of the key issues for these wetland types are the proportion of the floodplain surface that lies below the present day channel and their degree of hydraulic connectivity to the channel hughes 1980 lewin and hughes 1980 hughes et al 2014 this initial very broad and simplistic classification of wetlands does not address their geomorphological genesis and totally ignores many of the detailed characteristics that might affect the channel wetland water exchange processes and the dynamics of wetland inundation lewin and ashworth 2014 the objectives of this study were to i improve the understanding of channel wetland water exchange dynamics for different wetland types and ii identify and evaluate appropriate modelling tools that can be used for solving a range of water resource problems including upstream development impacts on wetland inundation dynamics effects of wetland inundation dynamics on downstream flow regimes and the impacts of wetland flooding hazards on local communities this paper details the application of a combined modelling approach to simulate the impacts of the luangwa and barotse floodplains on the downstream flow regimes of the luangwa and zambezi rivers in zambia the combined modelling approach has been applied in different studies including biancamaria et al 2009 rayburg and thoms 2009 bravo et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 wen et al 2013 and komi et al 2017 schumann et al 2013 use a hydrological model to generate floodplain inflows and used a hydraulic model to simulate the inundation extents in the lower zambezi floodplain whereas lisflood hydrological model was used to simulate floodplain inflows and the lisflood fp hydraulic model to generate inundation extents in the oti river by komi et al 2017 moreover wen et al 2013 use a hydrodynamic model to generate inputs for the hydrological model to investigate the impacts of water management on wetland inflows and inundation extents in macquarie marshes australia rayburg and thoms 2009 incorporated hydraulic and hydrological models to predict the inundation characteristics in the narran river floodplain in australia the authors of these studies highlighted the challenges in developing models in data large floodplains mainly data scarcity and low accuracy however the results still indicate a possibility of getting promising results if the available global data are effectively used this paper reports on the study that use a hydraulic model to generate inputs for the basin scale hydrological model in data scarce river basins 2 the study basin available data and inevitable uncertainties the two study areas are both ramsar sites within the zambezi river basin the luangwa river drains eastern zambia and is a tributary of the zambezi river with the confluence located just upstream of cahora bassa reservoir it has a gauging station at 30 217oe and 14 967os with a catchment area of 142 690 km2 while the wetland is represented by a floodplain of approximately 340 km in length fig 1a the total valley bottom area is some 2 700 km2 with a width varying between 5 and 12 km the total catchment area of the upstream rivers flowing into the wetland is 17 207 km2 while tributary inflows to the floodplain add a further catchment area of 58 391 km2 and are evenly distributed along its length and on both sides the zambezi river enters the barotse floodplain a few kilometres after its confluence with the lungue bungo tributary fig 1b while the downstream end of the main part of the floodplain is approximately 50 km upstream of ngonye falls several rivers join the zambezi within the barotse including the luanguinga luena lungue bungo and the kabompo fig 1 b with the first being gauged at 22 7oe 15os for the period 1958 2003 the catchments of these rivers are characterised by small plains and flatlands such as the lungue bungo river floodplain and the lui river floodplain timberlake 2000 being the second largest floodplain in the zambezi river basin the barotse drains about 320 000 km2 and is approximately 240 km long and 40 km wide rainfall in these two basins is highly controlled by the movement of the inter tropical convergent zone itcz which occurs when the moist congo air mass encounters the humid air from the south east trade winds beilfuss and dos santos 2001 musambachime 2016 three dominant climatic seasons exist cool dry april to august hot dry september to october and warm wet november to april seasons winsemius et al 2008 nyirenda et al 2013 in the luangwa the northern headwaters and some of the north western tributaries receive more than 1 000 mm y 1 mean annual rainfall while the lower parts receive less than 800 mm y 1 similarly in the upper zambezi rainfall decreases from between 1 100 1 230 mm y 1 in the upper areas to 760 950 mm y 1 in the floodplain and the downstream areas the mean average annual potential evapotranspiration is between 1 450 and 1 750 mm y 1 for both basins the rainfall and runoff response are strongly seasonal and the observed long term flow data suggest a mean annual runoff response of around 18 000 106 m3 y 1 equivalent to 126 mm y 1 for the whole luangwa river basin and approximately 37 000 106 m3 y 1 for the zambezi river at the gauging station located near ngonye falls in general the two river basins are poorly gauged and both climatic and basin physical characteristics data were obtained from global datasets long term monthly rainfall data were obtained from http www cru uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 3 22 cru ts v 3 22 harris et al 2014 and satellite daily rainfall data were sourced from ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov fews fewsdata africa arc2 bin arc2 novella and thiaw 2013 mean monthly potential evapotranspiration data were derived from the international water management institute s iwmi climatic data portal the estimates being based on penman monteith evapotranspiration the topography and slope distributions were derived from the srtm 90 m resolution dataset farr and kobrick 2000 and land cover from the usgs land cover dataset usgs lci broxton et al 2014 the soilgrids 1 km dataset hengl et al 2014 was used to evaluate the distribution of the soil types found in the two selected basins it is acknowledged that there are many unresolved uncertainties related to these data sources see for example beck et al 2017 3 modelling methods 3 1 appropriate modelling tools the choice of modelling tools for assessing wetland impacts within large african basins is largely constrained by the availability of data to force the models the pitman 1973 rainfall runoff model has been used successfully for a wide range of water resource assessment purposes in many parts of sub saharan africa hughes 2013 in recent years it has been modified to include catchment scale processes that were not represented in the original model one of which is a channel wetland exchange function hughes et al 2014 the fact that the model has a low spatial and temporal resolution is often considered an advantage in areas where data are scarce and often have large uncertainty increasing the resolution rarely improves model results due to the mismatch between the model resolution and the available data hughes 2015 with respect to the main sub basin rainfall runoff responses found across many large africa basins experience suggests that the model is sufficiently flexible to be able to successfully simulate these responses under a wide range of different climate and physiographic characteristics this experience includes studies in southern africa hughes et al 2010 tirivarombo and hughes 2011 kapangaziwiri et al 2012 hughes et al 2014 eastern africa tumbo and hughes 2015 and central africa tshimanga and hughes 2014 however when it comes to processes for which we have little understanding and even less data such as the channel wetland exchange processes it is difficult to determine whether the structure and parameter values used for a specific site are appropriate even if there is a satisfactory simulation compared with a downstream streamflow gauging record tumbo and hughes 2015 report an example using the great ruaha river where even with multiple headwater gauging records and gauges below the usangu wetlands the main wetland affecting this basin there remained substantial uncertainty in the ability of the model to simulate the correct result for the right reason kirchner 2006 a detailed hydrodynamic model that includes hydraulic routing of flows across relatively flat wetland surfaces represents a higher resolution approach to understanding and modelling the inundation dynamics an example of such a model is lisflood fp which has been applied in various parts of africa including the lower zambezi delta schumann et al 2013 the inner niger delta zahera 2011 neal et al 2012 coulthard et al 2013 the blue nile yan et al 2015 the logone floodplain in cameroon fernández et al 2016 the oti river floodplain komi et al 2017 and a significant number of studies outside africa such as the amazon river floodplain trigg et al 2009 trigg et al 2012 de almeida and bates 2013 trigg et al 2013 rudorff et al 2014a 2014b wood et al 2016 there are of course similar models but they all share the same constraints of requiring large amounts of high resolution data e g topography and boundary condition discharges for their successful application fortunately there are global datasets available that can provide the majority of the topographic data required even if in certain wetland situations there are some uncertainties about the ability of the data to fully represent the topographical detail required by the models providing the hydrological boundary conditions inflow hydrographs and water levels at the required resolution daily flow sequences as the maximum time interval is a much more difficult problem to overcome with currently existing data it is also important to recognise that the required skill levels and model setup and run times are far greater for a hydrodynamic model such as lisflood fp than for a coarse scale model such as pitman 3 2 a combined modelling approach given the constraints posed by the application of either model this study proposes a combined approach that attempts to maximise the benefits of using the pitman or a similar coarse scale rainfall runoff model and the lisflood fp subgrid version models together the approach is summarised in fig 2 and the key concept is to make use of the detailed outputs of the lisflood fp model inundated area and volume during example seasonal flooding events of different magnitudes to quantify the parameters of the pitman wetland sub model detailed descriptions of the models used including the month to daily disaggregation method are not included here as they have already been published in hughes 2013 neal et al 2012 and hughes and slaughter 2015 the wetland sub model incorporated into the pitman model hughes et al 2014 and tumbo and hughes 2015 is less well documented in the literature and therefore a summary of the sub model parameters and algorithms are provided in table 1 to help in understanding the links between the hydrological and hydraulic models the pitman model is initially used to establish monthly time series of upstream and tributary inflows to the wetlands given that these are not available from gauged data the monthly inflows are disaggregated to daily time series using a simple method based on daily rainfall hughes and slaughter 2015 and these represent the upstream boundary conditions for the lisflood fp model to limit the run time of the lisflood fp model and because the available daily rainfall data are relatively short the disaggregation focused on generating daily flows for two sequences of three years representing average and above wet average seasonal flow conditions the outputs from the lisflood fp model storage and downstream flows are then used to guide the re quantification of the wetland parameters of the pitman model after which it is re run and the monthly simulations compared with any available observed downstream flow data two versions of the pitman model are used in this study the single run and structured uncertainty versions the single run version uses a single parameter set that is typically based on manual calibration and the model outputs are assessed using graphical comparisons with any observed data as well as several statistical objective functions hughes et al 2010 the advantage of the single run version is that all the time series of the model state variables including wetland storage and evaporative losses can be investigated the structured uncertainty version uses simple monte carlo random sampling from a priori parameter ranges i e upper and lower bounds to generate up to 10000 output ensembles hughes et al 2010 behavioural parameter sets can then be identified by comparing individual ensembles with the available observed data using the same statistical objective functions that are used in the single run version hughes et al 2010 kapangaziwiri et al 2012 the disaggregation approach associated with the pitman model hughes and slaughter 2015 uses daily rainfall data to generate a times series of antecedent daily rainfall a monthly to daily flow duration curve conversion equation and a quantile mapping process to generate daily flows from the pitman simulated monthly flows one of the key uncertainties in the combined approach is that the pitman model is initially calibrated against the limited observed streamflow data in both areas most of the upstream flows are not gauged and the model is calibrated against the total basin response below the wetlands and clearly includes the wetland effects as fig 3 illustrates these can only be properly understood after the lisflood fp model has been applied therefore it is inevitable that the simulated inflows to the wetland that are generated by the pitman model and the daily disaggregation process include many uncertainties associated with the initial setup of the pitman model unfortunately these uncertainties cannot be resolved in the absence of observed data for the tributary inflows to the wetlands a further key issue is whether the simple structure of the pitman wetland sub model is capable of reproducing the relationships between monthly inflow volumes and inundation storage volumes during the rising and falling limbs including the hysteretic patterns of seasonal hydrographs linked to this question is whether the outputs of lisflood fp can be interpreted to quantify the parameters of the pitman wetland sub model the key questions are as follows is the concept of a channel flow threshold for inundation initiation qthresh in table 1 acceptable and can the lisflood fp outputs be used to quantify this parameter is the simple concept of a fixed proportion of inflow contributing to wetland storage qprop in table 1 acceptable is the approach used to calculate return flows based on a non linear relationship with wetland storage in excess of a residual storage parameter sres in table 1 acceptable and can this approach be used to represent the same hysteretic patterns demonstrated by the lisflood fp model at the monthly time scale can the pitman wetland sub model represent the inflow storage outflow conditions predicted by the lisflood fp model under different extremes of seasonal inflows i e dry and wet years while the majority of the uncertainties in the combined modelling approach lie with the structure and parameterisation of the pitman model and the approach used to disaggregate the simulated monthly flows to daily time series using daily satellite rainfall data there are some key uncertainties associated with the application of the lisflood fp model itself the first is whether the available dem data are of sufficient resolution to define the major flow paths and storage areas within the wetlands the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data rodriguez et al 2006 have been applied in many large african wetlands neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 domeneghetti 2016 although the vertical error has minimal impacts on lowlands including wetlands patro et al 2009 bates et al 2014 mukolwe et al 2015 there could be some spurious pixels pixels with some local variations as well as the biases related to vegetation that affect the flow computations moreover in some situations the channel flow paths are too small to be adequately represented by the dem data the second key uncertainty lies in the definition of the location size width and depth shape and hydraulic characteristics slope and roughness of the river channels flowing through the wetland these are typically not adequately defined by the srtm data and need to be approximated using other information inevitably the definition of the channels will be critical for the quantification of the channel hydraulic transmission properties the channel bankfull capacity in different parts of the wetland and the value of qthresh table 1 for the total wetland adequately representing the flood celerity characteristics of the channel system will affect the initiation of inundation in different parts of the wetland at the beginning of the wet season and therefore also the value of qthresh these uncertainties are also difficult to resolve as there are only limited satellite data available to validate the lisflood fp simulated flood extents largely because of excessive cloud coverage during the main flooding season 4 application to the luangwa river basin 4 1 quantifying wetland inflows using the pitman model in the absence of any observed flow data for the headwaters and tributaries of the luangwa river basin it was necessary to make some assumptions about how the main runoff generating parameters would vary between the sub basins contributing to the flow at the downstream gauging station fig 3a these were largely based on topographic variations and the assumption that steeper catchments would generate higher and more sustained runoff responses the wetland sub model was excluded from the initial pitman model setup meaning that any attenuation effects of the wetland that are represented in the downstream observed data are included in the simulated upstream inflows given the uncertainties in the month to daily disaggregation approach this is not expected to substantially affect the lisflood fp simulations when the disaggregated flows are used as boundary conditions several model runs of the pitman uncertainty version were used to establish appropriate parameter values for the single run model table 2 and fig 4 indicate that the simulation results are not very good but at least acceptable with nash coefficients greater than 0 5 the monthly flow simulations for the period october 2000 to september 2013 were disaggregated to daily flows using parameter values suggested by hughes and slaughter 2015 the same parameters were used for all the sub basins but the results cannot be validated because there are no observed daily flows however the model captured the duration of the wet season peak flows reported by other researchers adhikari et al 2010 especially for the year 2007 and 2010 given that the main intention was to obtain representative daily flow hydrographs to be used as inflows into the lisflood fp the results were considered appropriate to be used as intended 4 2 lisflood fp setup and results the floodplain was divided into three sections with the outflows from the upper section being used as the inflow boundary conditions to the next downstream section and three simulations were done separately the srtm dem 90 m data used to represent the topography was filtered using a low pass filter in arcgis 10 2 software to reduce spurious pixel effects local variations before it was applied in the model setup the river network and sample width values were digitised and estimated from google earth imagery respectively this was a decision after an initial assessment of the andreadis et al 2013 dataset which was found to over generalise the width values and locations for most tributary channels channel bankfull depths were automatically computed in the model from the channel width values provided as model inputs using relationships between hydraulic geometry and catchment area park 1977 the values of the scale r and power p parameters that define the bankfull depths were set to reflect the actual width and depth values for each river network a fixed value of p was used i e the model default value of p 0 76 whereas a given range of parameter r was used it is not straightforward to establish appropriate values for the channel cn and floodplain roughness cf while they are not expected to be spatially uniform in reality there are no data available to establish spatial variations and uniform values table 2 were used in all three floodplain sections established depending on the land cover and channel characteristics using the guidelines suggested by chow 1959 the disaggregated daily flows were used as upstream or tributary boundary conditions and an assumption of normal depth depth at which the water surface slope is assumed to be parallel to the channel bed slope was used as a downstream boundary condition the period october 2005 to september 2007 was used to represent wet seasonal conditions while october 2011 to september 2013 represents normal conditions simulated outflows from the three wetland sections could not be validated no observed data but simulated inundation extents were partially validated using the limited observations of inundation extents from landsatlook images while a large part of the floodplain gets fully inundated around february to early march the images covering this period were largely obscured by cloud cover especially on the upper part of the floodplain results have indicated that inundations of the low lying areas during the wet season are well simulated fig 5 maximum 7 day inundation extents and volumes were in the range of 400 700 km2 and 900 1 500 m3 106 respectively maximum inundation areas in the lower section of the floodplain are smaller compared to the other floodplain sections fig 6 and this is related to the narrower floodplain in this section the storage inflow and area storage relationships for each 7 day simulation results form a nearly closed anti clockwise hysteresis behaviour fig 6 and the magnitude of the hysteresis curves is higher in the wet year than in the dry years the difference between inflows and outflows in the luangwa floodplain suggesting that the attenuation effect is very minimal and the lag between the inflows and outflows is also small few days 4 3 quantification of wetland parameters and re set of the pitman model the full details on how the pitman wetland parameters are calibrated are not included here but can be found in makungu 2020 while fig 7 illustrates the degree of correspondence between the simulated storage and outflow volumes for the two models using the results based on a single floodplain unit most of the estimated parameter values table 3 reflect the characteristics of the floodplain the low values of the channel spill factor notably in the lower section reflect the deep main channel with relatively low volumes of water spilling into the floodplain area these wetland parameters together with the initially established pitman model parameters were used to reset the model for the entire basin the return flow parameters were set to allow the spills from the channel and drainage back to the channel to occur simultaneously because the exchanges between the floodplain and the channels are assumed to occur in both directions some of the parameters initially established have been modified when the wetland sub model parameters were included in the model setup to achieve the best calibration results the inclusion of the wetland function in the pitman model improved the simulations although the difference is quite minimal fig 4 however it was also noted that on a monthly time scale the lisflood fp results suggest quite small levels of seasonal peak attenuation and low hysteresis confirming that impacts on downstream flow are likely to be small at this time scale 5 application to the upper zambezi river basin 5 1 initial pitman model setup and results the entire basin was divided into 10 sub basins fig 3b among which two are gauged with reliable data one upstream tributary and the zambezi river downstream of the barotse floodplain wetland inflows were simulated using the pitman model and the simulations at the downstream gauge were acceptable but not good table 2 and fig 8 the monthly flows were disaggregated using the same approach applied in the luangwa river basin with similar parameters it was only possible to check the validity of the daily flow simulations against the duration of high flow peaks in 2004 2007 2009 and 2010 reported by other sources such as adhikari et al 2010 and long et al 2014 5 2 lisflood fp setup and results the barotse floodplain was simulated as a single unit and the detailed characteristics are not reported here but can be found in makungu 2020 the srtm 90 m dem and techniques used to obtain the river network and width values were the same as used in the luangwa the simulated outflows from the wetland were calibrated using the available daily flows for the ngonye falls gauging station data bp9 which is located a few kilometres below the floodplain outlet compared with the available landsat images the simulated inundation extents are reasonably good most of the meander cuts and isolated channels are filled with water as expected except in the upper part of the floodplain makungu 2020 moreover comparison between simulated inundation extents and the observed extents from the global surface water explorer dataset by pekel et al 2016 indicate some agreements except areas adjacent to the zambezi river expected to be inundated are not well presented in this dataset fig 9 the 7 day maximum inundation extents and volume are in the range of 5 000 6 000 km2 and 6 000 12 000 m3 106 respectively and are observed between late april to early may in the middle and lower sections fig 10 the area storage and storage inflow relationships form a counter clockwise hysteresis loop but the relationships are quite complex due to multiple inflow peaks fig 10 this suggests that the interaction between the barotse floodplain and the river channels is very complex the curves have indicated that large volumes of water are stored in the floodplain the difference between simulated daily inflows and outflows suggests that the barotse floodplain system has a greater potential than the luangwa floodplain to attenuate flows the output hydrographs are smoothed and the high peaks are significantly reduced fig 11 while the comparisons between observed and simulated downstream daily flows in fig 12 show that some of the high peaks and the flow patterns are well captured by the model although the record is short over estimated flows especially in the rising and falling limbs could be related to the uncertainties in the simulated wetland inflows 5 3 quantification of wetland parameters and reset of the pitman model fig 13 illustrates the results of the wetland sub model parameter calibration comparing the simulated storage and outflow volumes for the two models the parameters quantified from the lisflood fp model reflect the known characteristics of the barotse floodplain table 3 a large value of wetland residual volume 800 m3 106 reflects the volume of water remaining in the isolated channels and backwater depressions found in the middle and lower parts of the floodplain during the dry season however this is relatively small compared to the total amount of storage in the entire floodplain 11 000 m3 106 the full details on how the wetland parameters are estimated and calibrated in the spreadsheet are not included here but can be found in makungu 2020 after including the lisflood fp calibrated wetland parameters and re calibrating the whole pitman model there is an improvement in the simulated flows table 2 and fig 8 the results indicate that the influence of the barotse floodplain on both high and low flows in the upper zambezi river basin is substantial and this is consistent with reports from other studies world bank 2010 mccartney et al 2013 cai et al 2016 6 discussions and conclusions the importance of including wetland processes in hydrological modelling of large river basins has been discussed by hughes et al 2014 previous applications of the pitman model in different river basins indicated some improvements in the model simulations tshimanga and hughes 2014 tumbo and hughes 2015 when the wetland sub model was included however some of the wetland parameters were difficult to estimate because most of the hydrological processes in wetlands are not well known the application of the detailed hydraulic model lisflood fp in this study improved the understanding of the floodplain dynamics to some extent however future studies should consider using high quality remote sensing data to setup and validate the model the area storage and storage inflow hysteresis curves suggest that the interactions between the river channels and the floodplains can be very complex especially in large floodplains the complexity of the storage inflow hysteresis curves in the two floodplains is exacerbated during the rising limb due to the presence of multiple flow peaks especially in the barotse floodplain the anticlockwise hysteresis curves reflect the characteristics of the river floodplain systems that have been reported in similar systems e g rudorff et al 2014a chen et al 2015 zhang and werner 2015 as expected the hysteresis curves suggest that the hysteresis effects increase with flood magnitude during wet seasons of greater magnitude the extent and volume of inundation are greater and this results in greater hysteresis as it takes a longer time for the water to return to the river attenuation effects and lag time is high in the barotse the flow lag time three to four weeks is observed similar and close to what reported by other researchers beilfuss 2012 zuijdgeest et al 2016 the difference in attenuation effects between the two floodplains could be attributed to their structure differences in the barotse hydraulic conductivity is very low indicating poor interactions between the floodplain and the main channel but in the luangwa the hydraulic conductivity is high supporting the movement of water from and to the channel the application of the lisflood fp model improves the understanding of the dynamics of wetland processes even though there remains a relatively high degree of uncertainty related to how the model was set up for the two floodplains i e the data inputs and parameters used the srtm 90 m dem used was not free from vegetation bias which could affect the simulation results because vegetation height affect general propagation of flooding water and inundation dynamics in the model domain future studies should consider using vegetation free dem available e g yamazaki et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 to improve model simulations for instance the modified srtm dem by zhao et al 2018 reduced the significant bias to nearly zero value similarly yamazaki et al 2017 significantly improve the srtm dem to support better results when this dem used in floodplain modelling some parameters such as channel and floodplain roughness are difficult to estimate and were assumed to be spatially uniform the wetland inflows used as upstream boundary conditions are also uncertain and the assumption of normal depth as a downstream boundary condition could also be a source of uncertainty especially for the luangwa where the floodplain was divided into three sections a backwater effect could occur in these floodplains but was not considered in the model setup the initial assessment of the estimated channel network and width values from the simple global river bankfull width and depth dataset andreadis et al 2013 revealed some substantial disagreements with width values estimated from google earth imagery particularly for some of the tributary inflow channels the width values and channel locations were found to be over generalised moreover simulated inundation extents in some of the low lying areas expected to be inundated adjacent to the zambezi river in the barotse floodplain are not captured in the dataset by pekel et al 2016 fig 9 the global datasets are therefore not recommended for use without further validation using alternative sources calibrating the wetland sub model parameters using the outputs from lisflood fp proved to be a relatively straightforward task for both floodplains figs 7 and 13 most of the parameters are identifiable as they affect different aspects of the time series of outflow and storage volume timing attenuation recession etc the a and b parameters in the area volume relationship can be obtained directly from the area and volume information generated by lisflood fp although it is clear that this relationship changes slightly between the rising and falling limbs of the wet season qthresh and qprop are associated with the initiation and early wet season rate of inundation while the residual wetland volume can be identified from the volumes simulated by lisflood fp at the end of the wet season the most difficult parameters to establish are the aa and bb values in the return flow equation as well as whether the return flows should be further restricted when the channel is still spilling the best results were obtained for the luangwa floodplain without this restriction suggesting that return flows can occur simultaneously with overbank flooding consistent with a floodplain whose structure allows for high hydraulic conductivity between the floodplain storage and the channel lewin and hughes 1980 this characteristic also contributes to the relatively low level of hysteresis in the inflow storage relationship and relatively small downstream attenuation impacts while the attenuation effects and hysteresis are much higher for the barotse floodplain the best results were also obtained without the additional return flow restriction and this result is ascribed to greater relative storage volume and possibly lower degree of hydraulic connection between the main channel and some parts of the floodplain ongoing work suggests that the dynamics of other types of wetland i e non floodplain types such as the lukanga swamps and kafue flats in the kafue river basin as well as the usangu wetlands in the great ruaha river basin are better simulated with the return flow restriction included in the model the combined modelling approach used in this study demonstrates the benefits of using a detailed hydraulic model to improve the parameterisation of the basin scale hydrological model the basin scale model can be applied with longer simulation periods largely due to the greater availability of monthly rainfall data compared to daily this is an important issue in water resources management as longer time series are better able to show up periods of extended dry periods that have to be catered for in decision making ultimately it would be very useful if the approach described here could be applied to a representative group of different wetland types to establish guidelines for quantifying the pitman parameters based on the physical wetland properties it would not be subsequently necessary to setup and run the lisflood fp model for every individual wetland however as with many other hydrologically or water resources related questions pertaining to the data scarce areas of africa the data that are available to achieve this objective

3921,wetlands are important components of many large river systems some basin scale hydrological models do include explicit sub models to deal with wetland impacts but one of the key challenges is to estimate appropriate parameter values to represent the channel wetland exchange processes a combined modelling approach is applied in this study and involves the use of the detailed daily time step lisflood fp hydraulic model to improve the understanding of channel wetland exchange dynamics and to quantify the wetland parameters of a basin scale hydrological model while there remain many uncertainties associated with a lack of sufficient validation data the lisflood fp results largely reflect the physical characteristics of the two floodplains the luangwa and barotse in the zambezi river basin the lisflood fp results were also used to estimate the wetland parameters of the basin scale hydrological model with greater confidence and improved the downstream simulations results albeit marginally the results suggest that the influence of the floodplain on the monthly luangwa flow regime is minimal whereas the barotse floodplain significantly attenuates the high flows and regulates the low flows of the upper zambezi river the approach implemented in this study presents an important step towards the improvements of water resource assessments modelling for research and practical purposes in data scarce river basins however further work is required to refine the model setup using additional field information related to exchange dynamics as well as high quality remote sensing data keywords africa channel wetland exchanges hydrological models hydraulic models 1 introduction there are many large african river basins that contain substantial wetland areas tooth et al 2002 hughes et al 2014 and these wetlands are known to have impacts on the flow regimes of downstream rivers kashaigili et al 2006 moore et al 2008 beilfuss 2012 upstream water resources developments whether consumptive storage and abstractions for agriculture or domestic industrial water supply or non consumptive hydro power are also known to impact on the hydrology and ecological functioning of the wetlands themselves schuijt 2002 schuyt 2005 kashaigili et al 2006 mwakalila 2011 wamulume et al 2011 grundling et al 2013 mcclain 2013 matthew and day 2014 however the exact quantitative nature of these impacts is largely unknown luan and zhou 2013 for various reasons the first and perhaps most obvious reason is that there are very few data sets available for large african river basins that can be used to directly quantify the impacts this includes a lack of river flow data and a lack of data on the extent and volume of inundation during different river discharges there may be situations where river sections upstream or downstream of the wetland areas are gauged but there are almost no situations where both upstream and downstream reaches are monitored a further problem with many of the available streamflow gauging records is that it is not always possible to access the raw stage and station rating curve data and only processed mean daily flow are made available to potential users and in some cases only monthly volumes the rating curves themselves are not always reliable pappenberger et al 2006 di baldassarre and montanari 2009 domeneghetti et al 2012 mcmillan et al 2012 and are often extrapolated with a great deal of uncertainty to provide the high flow estimates that are of primary concern in understanding and modelling water exchanges between the river channels and the wetland areas apart from the data availability issues there are also different types of wetlands within many large african river basins even a casual perusal of google earth imagery reveals two main different types of wetlands some are large rounded basins through which the main river channel flows for example lukanga swamps in the kafue river basin zambia usangu wetlands in the great ruaha river basin tanzania but which also may contain a number of distributed secondary channels that will inevitably affect the inundation return drainage and evaporation loss characteristics of the wetlands the other main type is linear floodplains many exhibiting the classical geomorphological features associated with floodplains migrating across valley floors abandoned channels ridges and swales of previous sedimentary deposits these floodplains can be found on many of the large rivers in africa including the zambezi luangwa and kafue rivers in zambia the cubango and okavango rivers in angola and the mara rufiji and kilombero rivers in tanzania two of the key issues for these wetland types are the proportion of the floodplain surface that lies below the present day channel and their degree of hydraulic connectivity to the channel hughes 1980 lewin and hughes 1980 hughes et al 2014 this initial very broad and simplistic classification of wetlands does not address their geomorphological genesis and totally ignores many of the detailed characteristics that might affect the channel wetland water exchange processes and the dynamics of wetland inundation lewin and ashworth 2014 the objectives of this study were to i improve the understanding of channel wetland water exchange dynamics for different wetland types and ii identify and evaluate appropriate modelling tools that can be used for solving a range of water resource problems including upstream development impacts on wetland inundation dynamics effects of wetland inundation dynamics on downstream flow regimes and the impacts of wetland flooding hazards on local communities this paper details the application of a combined modelling approach to simulate the impacts of the luangwa and barotse floodplains on the downstream flow regimes of the luangwa and zambezi rivers in zambia the combined modelling approach has been applied in different studies including biancamaria et al 2009 rayburg and thoms 2009 bravo et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 wen et al 2013 and komi et al 2017 schumann et al 2013 use a hydrological model to generate floodplain inflows and used a hydraulic model to simulate the inundation extents in the lower zambezi floodplain whereas lisflood hydrological model was used to simulate floodplain inflows and the lisflood fp hydraulic model to generate inundation extents in the oti river by komi et al 2017 moreover wen et al 2013 use a hydrodynamic model to generate inputs for the hydrological model to investigate the impacts of water management on wetland inflows and inundation extents in macquarie marshes australia rayburg and thoms 2009 incorporated hydraulic and hydrological models to predict the inundation characteristics in the narran river floodplain in australia the authors of these studies highlighted the challenges in developing models in data large floodplains mainly data scarcity and low accuracy however the results still indicate a possibility of getting promising results if the available global data are effectively used this paper reports on the study that use a hydraulic model to generate inputs for the basin scale hydrological model in data scarce river basins 2 the study basin available data and inevitable uncertainties the two study areas are both ramsar sites within the zambezi river basin the luangwa river drains eastern zambia and is a tributary of the zambezi river with the confluence located just upstream of cahora bassa reservoir it has a gauging station at 30 217oe and 14 967os with a catchment area of 142 690 km2 while the wetland is represented by a floodplain of approximately 340 km in length fig 1a the total valley bottom area is some 2 700 km2 with a width varying between 5 and 12 km the total catchment area of the upstream rivers flowing into the wetland is 17 207 km2 while tributary inflows to the floodplain add a further catchment area of 58 391 km2 and are evenly distributed along its length and on both sides the zambezi river enters the barotse floodplain a few kilometres after its confluence with the lungue bungo tributary fig 1b while the downstream end of the main part of the floodplain is approximately 50 km upstream of ngonye falls several rivers join the zambezi within the barotse including the luanguinga luena lungue bungo and the kabompo fig 1 b with the first being gauged at 22 7oe 15os for the period 1958 2003 the catchments of these rivers are characterised by small plains and flatlands such as the lungue bungo river floodplain and the lui river floodplain timberlake 2000 being the second largest floodplain in the zambezi river basin the barotse drains about 320 000 km2 and is approximately 240 km long and 40 km wide rainfall in these two basins is highly controlled by the movement of the inter tropical convergent zone itcz which occurs when the moist congo air mass encounters the humid air from the south east trade winds beilfuss and dos santos 2001 musambachime 2016 three dominant climatic seasons exist cool dry april to august hot dry september to october and warm wet november to april seasons winsemius et al 2008 nyirenda et al 2013 in the luangwa the northern headwaters and some of the north western tributaries receive more than 1 000 mm y 1 mean annual rainfall while the lower parts receive less than 800 mm y 1 similarly in the upper zambezi rainfall decreases from between 1 100 1 230 mm y 1 in the upper areas to 760 950 mm y 1 in the floodplain and the downstream areas the mean average annual potential evapotranspiration is between 1 450 and 1 750 mm y 1 for both basins the rainfall and runoff response are strongly seasonal and the observed long term flow data suggest a mean annual runoff response of around 18 000 106 m3 y 1 equivalent to 126 mm y 1 for the whole luangwa river basin and approximately 37 000 106 m3 y 1 for the zambezi river at the gauging station located near ngonye falls in general the two river basins are poorly gauged and both climatic and basin physical characteristics data were obtained from global datasets long term monthly rainfall data were obtained from http www cru uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 3 22 cru ts v 3 22 harris et al 2014 and satellite daily rainfall data were sourced from ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov fews fewsdata africa arc2 bin arc2 novella and thiaw 2013 mean monthly potential evapotranspiration data were derived from the international water management institute s iwmi climatic data portal the estimates being based on penman monteith evapotranspiration the topography and slope distributions were derived from the srtm 90 m resolution dataset farr and kobrick 2000 and land cover from the usgs land cover dataset usgs lci broxton et al 2014 the soilgrids 1 km dataset hengl et al 2014 was used to evaluate the distribution of the soil types found in the two selected basins it is acknowledged that there are many unresolved uncertainties related to these data sources see for example beck et al 2017 3 modelling methods 3 1 appropriate modelling tools the choice of modelling tools for assessing wetland impacts within large african basins is largely constrained by the availability of data to force the models the pitman 1973 rainfall runoff model has been used successfully for a wide range of water resource assessment purposes in many parts of sub saharan africa hughes 2013 in recent years it has been modified to include catchment scale processes that were not represented in the original model one of which is a channel wetland exchange function hughes et al 2014 the fact that the model has a low spatial and temporal resolution is often considered an advantage in areas where data are scarce and often have large uncertainty increasing the resolution rarely improves model results due to the mismatch between the model resolution and the available data hughes 2015 with respect to the main sub basin rainfall runoff responses found across many large africa basins experience suggests that the model is sufficiently flexible to be able to successfully simulate these responses under a wide range of different climate and physiographic characteristics this experience includes studies in southern africa hughes et al 2010 tirivarombo and hughes 2011 kapangaziwiri et al 2012 hughes et al 2014 eastern africa tumbo and hughes 2015 and central africa tshimanga and hughes 2014 however when it comes to processes for which we have little understanding and even less data such as the channel wetland exchange processes it is difficult to determine whether the structure and parameter values used for a specific site are appropriate even if there is a satisfactory simulation compared with a downstream streamflow gauging record tumbo and hughes 2015 report an example using the great ruaha river where even with multiple headwater gauging records and gauges below the usangu wetlands the main wetland affecting this basin there remained substantial uncertainty in the ability of the model to simulate the correct result for the right reason kirchner 2006 a detailed hydrodynamic model that includes hydraulic routing of flows across relatively flat wetland surfaces represents a higher resolution approach to understanding and modelling the inundation dynamics an example of such a model is lisflood fp which has been applied in various parts of africa including the lower zambezi delta schumann et al 2013 the inner niger delta zahera 2011 neal et al 2012 coulthard et al 2013 the blue nile yan et al 2015 the logone floodplain in cameroon fernández et al 2016 the oti river floodplain komi et al 2017 and a significant number of studies outside africa such as the amazon river floodplain trigg et al 2009 trigg et al 2012 de almeida and bates 2013 trigg et al 2013 rudorff et al 2014a 2014b wood et al 2016 there are of course similar models but they all share the same constraints of requiring large amounts of high resolution data e g topography and boundary condition discharges for their successful application fortunately there are global datasets available that can provide the majority of the topographic data required even if in certain wetland situations there are some uncertainties about the ability of the data to fully represent the topographical detail required by the models providing the hydrological boundary conditions inflow hydrographs and water levels at the required resolution daily flow sequences as the maximum time interval is a much more difficult problem to overcome with currently existing data it is also important to recognise that the required skill levels and model setup and run times are far greater for a hydrodynamic model such as lisflood fp than for a coarse scale model such as pitman 3 2 a combined modelling approach given the constraints posed by the application of either model this study proposes a combined approach that attempts to maximise the benefits of using the pitman or a similar coarse scale rainfall runoff model and the lisflood fp subgrid version models together the approach is summarised in fig 2 and the key concept is to make use of the detailed outputs of the lisflood fp model inundated area and volume during example seasonal flooding events of different magnitudes to quantify the parameters of the pitman wetland sub model detailed descriptions of the models used including the month to daily disaggregation method are not included here as they have already been published in hughes 2013 neal et al 2012 and hughes and slaughter 2015 the wetland sub model incorporated into the pitman model hughes et al 2014 and tumbo and hughes 2015 is less well documented in the literature and therefore a summary of the sub model parameters and algorithms are provided in table 1 to help in understanding the links between the hydrological and hydraulic models the pitman model is initially used to establish monthly time series of upstream and tributary inflows to the wetlands given that these are not available from gauged data the monthly inflows are disaggregated to daily time series using a simple method based on daily rainfall hughes and slaughter 2015 and these represent the upstream boundary conditions for the lisflood fp model to limit the run time of the lisflood fp model and because the available daily rainfall data are relatively short the disaggregation focused on generating daily flows for two sequences of three years representing average and above wet average seasonal flow conditions the outputs from the lisflood fp model storage and downstream flows are then used to guide the re quantification of the wetland parameters of the pitman model after which it is re run and the monthly simulations compared with any available observed downstream flow data two versions of the pitman model are used in this study the single run and structured uncertainty versions the single run version uses a single parameter set that is typically based on manual calibration and the model outputs are assessed using graphical comparisons with any observed data as well as several statistical objective functions hughes et al 2010 the advantage of the single run version is that all the time series of the model state variables including wetland storage and evaporative losses can be investigated the structured uncertainty version uses simple monte carlo random sampling from a priori parameter ranges i e upper and lower bounds to generate up to 10000 output ensembles hughes et al 2010 behavioural parameter sets can then be identified by comparing individual ensembles with the available observed data using the same statistical objective functions that are used in the single run version hughes et al 2010 kapangaziwiri et al 2012 the disaggregation approach associated with the pitman model hughes and slaughter 2015 uses daily rainfall data to generate a times series of antecedent daily rainfall a monthly to daily flow duration curve conversion equation and a quantile mapping process to generate daily flows from the pitman simulated monthly flows one of the key uncertainties in the combined approach is that the pitman model is initially calibrated against the limited observed streamflow data in both areas most of the upstream flows are not gauged and the model is calibrated against the total basin response below the wetlands and clearly includes the wetland effects as fig 3 illustrates these can only be properly understood after the lisflood fp model has been applied therefore it is inevitable that the simulated inflows to the wetland that are generated by the pitman model and the daily disaggregation process include many uncertainties associated with the initial setup of the pitman model unfortunately these uncertainties cannot be resolved in the absence of observed data for the tributary inflows to the wetlands a further key issue is whether the simple structure of the pitman wetland sub model is capable of reproducing the relationships between monthly inflow volumes and inundation storage volumes during the rising and falling limbs including the hysteretic patterns of seasonal hydrographs linked to this question is whether the outputs of lisflood fp can be interpreted to quantify the parameters of the pitman wetland sub model the key questions are as follows is the concept of a channel flow threshold for inundation initiation qthresh in table 1 acceptable and can the lisflood fp outputs be used to quantify this parameter is the simple concept of a fixed proportion of inflow contributing to wetland storage qprop in table 1 acceptable is the approach used to calculate return flows based on a non linear relationship with wetland storage in excess of a residual storage parameter sres in table 1 acceptable and can this approach be used to represent the same hysteretic patterns demonstrated by the lisflood fp model at the monthly time scale can the pitman wetland sub model represent the inflow storage outflow conditions predicted by the lisflood fp model under different extremes of seasonal inflows i e dry and wet years while the majority of the uncertainties in the combined modelling approach lie with the structure and parameterisation of the pitman model and the approach used to disaggregate the simulated monthly flows to daily time series using daily satellite rainfall data there are some key uncertainties associated with the application of the lisflood fp model itself the first is whether the available dem data are of sufficient resolution to define the major flow paths and storage areas within the wetlands the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data rodriguez et al 2006 have been applied in many large african wetlands neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 domeneghetti 2016 although the vertical error has minimal impacts on lowlands including wetlands patro et al 2009 bates et al 2014 mukolwe et al 2015 there could be some spurious pixels pixels with some local variations as well as the biases related to vegetation that affect the flow computations moreover in some situations the channel flow paths are too small to be adequately represented by the dem data the second key uncertainty lies in the definition of the location size width and depth shape and hydraulic characteristics slope and roughness of the river channels flowing through the wetland these are typically not adequately defined by the srtm data and need to be approximated using other information inevitably the definition of the channels will be critical for the quantification of the channel hydraulic transmission properties the channel bankfull capacity in different parts of the wetland and the value of qthresh table 1 for the total wetland adequately representing the flood celerity characteristics of the channel system will affect the initiation of inundation in different parts of the wetland at the beginning of the wet season and therefore also the value of qthresh these uncertainties are also difficult to resolve as there are only limited satellite data available to validate the lisflood fp simulated flood extents largely because of excessive cloud coverage during the main flooding season 4 application to the luangwa river basin 4 1 quantifying wetland inflows using the pitman model in the absence of any observed flow data for the headwaters and tributaries of the luangwa river basin it was necessary to make some assumptions about how the main runoff generating parameters would vary between the sub basins contributing to the flow at the downstream gauging station fig 3a these were largely based on topographic variations and the assumption that steeper catchments would generate higher and more sustained runoff responses the wetland sub model was excluded from the initial pitman model setup meaning that any attenuation effects of the wetland that are represented in the downstream observed data are included in the simulated upstream inflows given the uncertainties in the month to daily disaggregation approach this is not expected to substantially affect the lisflood fp simulations when the disaggregated flows are used as boundary conditions several model runs of the pitman uncertainty version were used to establish appropriate parameter values for the single run model table 2 and fig 4 indicate that the simulation results are not very good but at least acceptable with nash coefficients greater than 0 5 the monthly flow simulations for the period october 2000 to september 2013 were disaggregated to daily flows using parameter values suggested by hughes and slaughter 2015 the same parameters were used for all the sub basins but the results cannot be validated because there are no observed daily flows however the model captured the duration of the wet season peak flows reported by other researchers adhikari et al 2010 especially for the year 2007 and 2010 given that the main intention was to obtain representative daily flow hydrographs to be used as inflows into the lisflood fp the results were considered appropriate to be used as intended 4 2 lisflood fp setup and results the floodplain was divided into three sections with the outflows from the upper section being used as the inflow boundary conditions to the next downstream section and three simulations were done separately the srtm dem 90 m data used to represent the topography was filtered using a low pass filter in arcgis 10 2 software to reduce spurious pixel effects local variations before it was applied in the model setup the river network and sample width values were digitised and estimated from google earth imagery respectively this was a decision after an initial assessment of the andreadis et al 2013 dataset which was found to over generalise the width values and locations for most tributary channels channel bankfull depths were automatically computed in the model from the channel width values provided as model inputs using relationships between hydraulic geometry and catchment area park 1977 the values of the scale r and power p parameters that define the bankfull depths were set to reflect the actual width and depth values for each river network a fixed value of p was used i e the model default value of p 0 76 whereas a given range of parameter r was used it is not straightforward to establish appropriate values for the channel cn and floodplain roughness cf while they are not expected to be spatially uniform in reality there are no data available to establish spatial variations and uniform values table 2 were used in all three floodplain sections established depending on the land cover and channel characteristics using the guidelines suggested by chow 1959 the disaggregated daily flows were used as upstream or tributary boundary conditions and an assumption of normal depth depth at which the water surface slope is assumed to be parallel to the channel bed slope was used as a downstream boundary condition the period october 2005 to september 2007 was used to represent wet seasonal conditions while october 2011 to september 2013 represents normal conditions simulated outflows from the three wetland sections could not be validated no observed data but simulated inundation extents were partially validated using the limited observations of inundation extents from landsatlook images while a large part of the floodplain gets fully inundated around february to early march the images covering this period were largely obscured by cloud cover especially on the upper part of the floodplain results have indicated that inundations of the low lying areas during the wet season are well simulated fig 5 maximum 7 day inundation extents and volumes were in the range of 400 700 km2 and 900 1 500 m3 106 respectively maximum inundation areas in the lower section of the floodplain are smaller compared to the other floodplain sections fig 6 and this is related to the narrower floodplain in this section the storage inflow and area storage relationships for each 7 day simulation results form a nearly closed anti clockwise hysteresis behaviour fig 6 and the magnitude of the hysteresis curves is higher in the wet year than in the dry years the difference between inflows and outflows in the luangwa floodplain suggesting that the attenuation effect is very minimal and the lag between the inflows and outflows is also small few days 4 3 quantification of wetland parameters and re set of the pitman model the full details on how the pitman wetland parameters are calibrated are not included here but can be found in makungu 2020 while fig 7 illustrates the degree of correspondence between the simulated storage and outflow volumes for the two models using the results based on a single floodplain unit most of the estimated parameter values table 3 reflect the characteristics of the floodplain the low values of the channel spill factor notably in the lower section reflect the deep main channel with relatively low volumes of water spilling into the floodplain area these wetland parameters together with the initially established pitman model parameters were used to reset the model for the entire basin the return flow parameters were set to allow the spills from the channel and drainage back to the channel to occur simultaneously because the exchanges between the floodplain and the channels are assumed to occur in both directions some of the parameters initially established have been modified when the wetland sub model parameters were included in the model setup to achieve the best calibration results the inclusion of the wetland function in the pitman model improved the simulations although the difference is quite minimal fig 4 however it was also noted that on a monthly time scale the lisflood fp results suggest quite small levels of seasonal peak attenuation and low hysteresis confirming that impacts on downstream flow are likely to be small at this time scale 5 application to the upper zambezi river basin 5 1 initial pitman model setup and results the entire basin was divided into 10 sub basins fig 3b among which two are gauged with reliable data one upstream tributary and the zambezi river downstream of the barotse floodplain wetland inflows were simulated using the pitman model and the simulations at the downstream gauge were acceptable but not good table 2 and fig 8 the monthly flows were disaggregated using the same approach applied in the luangwa river basin with similar parameters it was only possible to check the validity of the daily flow simulations against the duration of high flow peaks in 2004 2007 2009 and 2010 reported by other sources such as adhikari et al 2010 and long et al 2014 5 2 lisflood fp setup and results the barotse floodplain was simulated as a single unit and the detailed characteristics are not reported here but can be found in makungu 2020 the srtm 90 m dem and techniques used to obtain the river network and width values were the same as used in the luangwa the simulated outflows from the wetland were calibrated using the available daily flows for the ngonye falls gauging station data bp9 which is located a few kilometres below the floodplain outlet compared with the available landsat images the simulated inundation extents are reasonably good most of the meander cuts and isolated channels are filled with water as expected except in the upper part of the floodplain makungu 2020 moreover comparison between simulated inundation extents and the observed extents from the global surface water explorer dataset by pekel et al 2016 indicate some agreements except areas adjacent to the zambezi river expected to be inundated are not well presented in this dataset fig 9 the 7 day maximum inundation extents and volume are in the range of 5 000 6 000 km2 and 6 000 12 000 m3 106 respectively and are observed between late april to early may in the middle and lower sections fig 10 the area storage and storage inflow relationships form a counter clockwise hysteresis loop but the relationships are quite complex due to multiple inflow peaks fig 10 this suggests that the interaction between the barotse floodplain and the river channels is very complex the curves have indicated that large volumes of water are stored in the floodplain the difference between simulated daily inflows and outflows suggests that the barotse floodplain system has a greater potential than the luangwa floodplain to attenuate flows the output hydrographs are smoothed and the high peaks are significantly reduced fig 11 while the comparisons between observed and simulated downstream daily flows in fig 12 show that some of the high peaks and the flow patterns are well captured by the model although the record is short over estimated flows especially in the rising and falling limbs could be related to the uncertainties in the simulated wetland inflows 5 3 quantification of wetland parameters and reset of the pitman model fig 13 illustrates the results of the wetland sub model parameter calibration comparing the simulated storage and outflow volumes for the two models the parameters quantified from the lisflood fp model reflect the known characteristics of the barotse floodplain table 3 a large value of wetland residual volume 800 m3 106 reflects the volume of water remaining in the isolated channels and backwater depressions found in the middle and lower parts of the floodplain during the dry season however this is relatively small compared to the total amount of storage in the entire floodplain 11 000 m3 106 the full details on how the wetland parameters are estimated and calibrated in the spreadsheet are not included here but can be found in makungu 2020 after including the lisflood fp calibrated wetland parameters and re calibrating the whole pitman model there is an improvement in the simulated flows table 2 and fig 8 the results indicate that the influence of the barotse floodplain on both high and low flows in the upper zambezi river basin is substantial and this is consistent with reports from other studies world bank 2010 mccartney et al 2013 cai et al 2016 6 discussions and conclusions the importance of including wetland processes in hydrological modelling of large river basins has been discussed by hughes et al 2014 previous applications of the pitman model in different river basins indicated some improvements in the model simulations tshimanga and hughes 2014 tumbo and hughes 2015 when the wetland sub model was included however some of the wetland parameters were difficult to estimate because most of the hydrological processes in wetlands are not well known the application of the detailed hydraulic model lisflood fp in this study improved the understanding of the floodplain dynamics to some extent however future studies should consider using high quality remote sensing data to setup and validate the model the area storage and storage inflow hysteresis curves suggest that the interactions between the river channels and the floodplains can be very complex especially in large floodplains the complexity of the storage inflow hysteresis curves in the two floodplains is exacerbated during the rising limb due to the presence of multiple flow peaks especially in the barotse floodplain the anticlockwise hysteresis curves reflect the characteristics of the river floodplain systems that have been reported in similar systems e g rudorff et al 2014a chen et al 2015 zhang and werner 2015 as expected the hysteresis curves suggest that the hysteresis effects increase with flood magnitude during wet seasons of greater magnitude the extent and volume of inundation are greater and this results in greater hysteresis as it takes a longer time for the water to return to the river attenuation effects and lag time is high in the barotse the flow lag time three to four weeks is observed similar and close to what reported by other researchers beilfuss 2012 zuijdgeest et al 2016 the difference in attenuation effects between the two floodplains could be attributed to their structure differences in the barotse hydraulic conductivity is very low indicating poor interactions between the floodplain and the main channel but in the luangwa the hydraulic conductivity is high supporting the movement of water from and to the channel the application of the lisflood fp model improves the understanding of the dynamics of wetland processes even though there remains a relatively high degree of uncertainty related to how the model was set up for the two floodplains i e the data inputs and parameters used the srtm 90 m dem used was not free from vegetation bias which could affect the simulation results because vegetation height affect general propagation of flooding water and inundation dynamics in the model domain future studies should consider using vegetation free dem available e g yamazaki et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 to improve model simulations for instance the modified srtm dem by zhao et al 2018 reduced the significant bias to nearly zero value similarly yamazaki et al 2017 significantly improve the srtm dem to support better results when this dem used in floodplain modelling some parameters such as channel and floodplain roughness are difficult to estimate and were assumed to be spatially uniform the wetland inflows used as upstream boundary conditions are also uncertain and the assumption of normal depth as a downstream boundary condition could also be a source of uncertainty especially for the luangwa where the floodplain was divided into three sections a backwater effect could occur in these floodplains but was not considered in the model setup the initial assessment of the estimated channel network and width values from the simple global river bankfull width and depth dataset andreadis et al 2013 revealed some substantial disagreements with width values estimated from google earth imagery particularly for some of the tributary inflow channels the width values and channel locations were found to be over generalised moreover simulated inundation extents in some of the low lying areas expected to be inundated adjacent to the zambezi river in the barotse floodplain are not captured in the dataset by pekel et al 2016 fig 9 the global datasets are therefore not recommended for use without further validation using alternative sources calibrating the wetland sub model parameters using the outputs from lisflood fp proved to be a relatively straightforward task for both floodplains figs 7 and 13 most of the parameters are identifiable as they affect different aspects of the time series of outflow and storage volume timing attenuation recession etc the a and b parameters in the area volume relationship can be obtained directly from the area and volume information generated by lisflood fp although it is clear that this relationship changes slightly between the rising and falling limbs of the wet season qthresh and qprop are associated with the initiation and early wet season rate of inundation while the residual wetland volume can be identified from the volumes simulated by lisflood fp at the end of the wet season the most difficult parameters to establish are the aa and bb values in the return flow equation as well as whether the return flows should be further restricted when the channel is still spilling the best results were obtained for the luangwa floodplain without this restriction suggesting that return flows can occur simultaneously with overbank flooding consistent with a floodplain whose structure allows for high hydraulic conductivity between the floodplain storage and the channel lewin and hughes 1980 this characteristic also contributes to the relatively low level of hysteresis in the inflow storage relationship and relatively small downstream attenuation impacts while the attenuation effects and hysteresis are much higher for the barotse floodplain the best results were also obtained without the additional return flow restriction and this result is ascribed to greater relative storage volume and possibly lower degree of hydraulic connection between the main channel and some parts of the floodplain ongoing work suggests that the dynamics of other types of wetland i e non floodplain types such as the lukanga swamps and kafue flats in the kafue river basin as well as the usangu wetlands in the great ruaha river basin are better simulated with the return flow restriction included in the model the combined modelling approach used in this study demonstrates the benefits of using a detailed hydraulic model to improve the parameterisation of the basin scale hydrological model the basin scale model can be applied with longer simulation periods largely due to the greater availability of monthly rainfall data compared to daily this is an important issue in water resources management as longer time series are better able to show up periods of extended dry periods that have to be catered for in decision making ultimately it would be very useful if the approach described here could be applied to a representative group of different wetland types to establish guidelines for quantifying the pitman parameters based on the physical wetland properties it would not be subsequently necessary to setup and run the lisflood fp model for every individual wetland however as with many other hydrologically or water resources related questions pertaining to the data scarce areas of africa the data that are available to achieve this objective

3922,understanding hydrological changes especially those of snow and or glacier melt induced floods is vital for early flood warnings in alpine regions however there is limited information available regarding warming induced changes in hydrological and flooding processes in high mountain regions owing to data scarcity and inadequate considerations within hydrological models this study aims to improve streamflow and flood simulations in three high mountain headwater catchments of the tarim river in northwest china an improved scheme for calculating glacier melt gm2 was coupled in the variable infiltration capacity model named vic gm2 driven by bias corrected meteorological data vic gm2 exhibited good performance as evidenced by ns kge and pbias values between the simulated and observed daily streamflow ranging from 0 69 to 0 79 0 70 to 0 81 and 2 68 to 19 6 respectively in addition annual contributions of glacier melt and snow melt to total streamflow were greater than 80 and less than 16 among the three catchments respectively the flood characteristics were inconsistent among the three catchments except that flooding mainly occurred in summer the maf mean annual flood in the yarkand river was largest followed by that in the yurungkax river and the qaraqash river the fpot frequency of peak over threshold and fq99 frequency of q99 times year fluctuated within 1 1 75 and 0 25 1 in the three catchments respectively this study provides references for understanding cryosphere hydrological processes and quantifying the contribution of different components i e glacier melt snow melt and rainfall to streamflow under a changing climate in the upper tarim river keywords streamflow flood characteristics simulation glacier melt contribution upper tarim river 1 introduction as the largest inland river in china and fifth largest in the world the tarim river originates in high mountains and plays a vital role in ecosystem development agricultural irrigation residential expansion and industrial production in the northwest region hagg et al 2007 sorg et al 2012 however as the water resources in the tarim river mainly originate from mountain sourced water fang et al 2018 and are reserved by glaciers and ice caps that are easily disturbed by a changing climate the upper tarim river basin s streamflow is primarily concentrated in the warm season resulting in seasonal flooding that threatens agricultural production residential safety and property and public infrastructure stability akhtar et al 2008 kang et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 in addition the hydrological process of the tarim river basin is complex chen 2014 including not only precipitation evapotranspiration infiltration groundwater and runoff but also glacier and snow melt in the upper reaches irrigation water intake and reservoir regulation in the lower reaches however hydrological processes in the alpine region of the tarim river basin are poorly understood due to data scarcity and extreme climate zhang et al 2012 therefore improving the understanding of hydrological processes in the upper tarim river will help the surrounding areas better cope with the above mentioned risks brought by climate change duethmann et al 2019 huss 2011 nepal et al 2014 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2020b researchers have implemented hydrological models to investigate the complex hydrological processes on mountainous glacierized catchments around the world li et al 2019 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018b nepal 2016 nolin et al 2010 soncini et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b including studies focusing on the main headwaters of the tarim river duethmann et al 2015 he et al 2015 the amudarya wang et al 2016 the syrdarya gan et al 2015 and the himalayan region immerzeel and bierkens 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 these studies have used different hydrological models such as xinanjiang zhao 1980 zhao 1992 tank sugawara 1979 gr4j nepal et al 2017 flexg gao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 hbv braun et al 1993 konz et al 2007 soil and water assessment tool swat douglas mankin et al 2010 wang et al 2019 j2000 krause 2002 shen et al 2018 weather research and forecasting hydrology wrf hydro arnault et al 2019 xie et al 2020 and variable infiltration capacity vic dang et al 2020 liang et al 1994 however many hydrological processes are simplified or ignored in hydrological models which are the main obstacles to developing hydrological simulations in the headwaters of the tarim river biskop et al 2016 ragettli et al 2013 for instance lumped hydrological models such as xinanjiang and gr4j simplify the entire watershed into a whole making it difficult to describe the spatial information of hydro physical and land surface processes in a changing environment distributed hydrological models such as swat and vic ignore or simplify glacier snow accumulation melt and their dynamic processes in the glacierized headwater catchments of the tarim river the lack of observational data and the omission of glacier melt processes have been major sources of uncertainty in previous studies chen et al 2017 dou et al 2011 liu et al 2012 xu et al 2016 in existing studies glacier melt was excluded chen et al 2017 shen et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the distribution of streamflow components was not solved liu et al 2011a sun et al 2015 and the vic model was less integrated with a glacier melt module chandel and ghosh 2021 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 and ren et al 2018 used a mass and energy balance model to calculate the glacier melt and coupled it to the vic model these schemes are data intensive and difficult to investigate on a large spatial scale and in a data limited region chandel and ghosh 2021 the degree day model hock et al 2005 can better solve the problem that hydrological models cannot calculate glacier melt and it is easy to implement chandel and ghosh 2021 integrated a degree day model with the vic model and validated the output with observed streamflow in five river basins in the himalayas however this study did not fully consider the effect of seasonal changes on the degree day factor zhang et al 2013 used the vic model coupled with a degree day model for simulating glacier melt based on an area weighted factor from 1961 to 1999 the study did not take the changes in glacier coverage into consideration lutz et al 2014 used the same melt factors for different catchments over the entire himalayan region and thus increased the uncertainties of the results therefore a revised hydrological model that takes the above limitations into account needs to be explored to fully understand streamflow and flood characteristics in the upper tarim river in addition the lack of adequate observational data in high mountains is another difficult problem horak et al 2019 li et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 with the development of remote sensing technology and data assimilation satellite based and reanalysis based meteorological datasets can partly overcome data scarcity in hydrological simulations de lima and lovejoy 2015 kim et al 2019 liu et al 2018a monaghan et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 however the limitations of meteorological datasets in terms of accuracy and temporal resolution will increase the uncertainties of hydrological model inputs wang et al 2020a therefore meteorological datasets should be bias corrected before use especially in mountainous regions gao et al 2012 many studies have further improved the quality of different meteorological data based on regional geographical conditions i e elevation longitude and latitude duethmann et al 2013 hu and franzke 2020 tong et al 2020 outside our study area however due to limited observed data and complex topographical characteristics the reliability and suitability of gridded products have not been completely resolved and still need to be explored for forcing hydrological models in the upper tarim river in view of the mentioned restrictions the overall objectives of this study are to improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations and to understand the processes and evolution mechanisms of floods in the upper tarim river to achieve these goals a hydrological model coupled with a revised scheme to calculate glacier melt was developed the glacier hydrological model incorporates precipitation gradient lapse rate glacier coverage changes and separate degree day factors with seasonal changes moreover the contributions of different components i e rainfall snow and glacier melt to streamflow and flood characteristics were identified in three headwater catchments of the tarim river although this study is somewhat preliminary due to limited data availability it is of great importance for better understanding the hydrological processes in the upper tarim river this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data employed in our study section 3 introduces bias correction methods of meteorological datasets improvements and implementations of the coupled glacier hydrological model and flood characteristic indices section 4 presents the results and discussions and section 5 presents our conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study focuses on three headwater catchments within the domain of 34 50 n 38 18 n and 74 28 e 81 41 e with elevations between 1278 and 8538 m of the tarim river which originate in the kunlun mountains in northwest china the three catchments are the yarkand river yark qaraqash river qara and yurungkax river yuru with control hydrological stations kaqun wuluwati ulwat and tongguziluk tgzlk respectively the location and basic information of the three catchments are shown and described in fig 1 and table 1 the three catchments have a continental semiarid climate the annual average precipitation is approximately 400 mm chen 2014 in the three catchments the precipitation varies greatly between months and mainly occurs from april to august precipitation in the southern mountainous regions is more abundant than that in the northern regions the glacier coverages of the three catchments are 14 12 yark 11 3 qara and 23 46 yuru according to observations from the kaqun ulwat and tgzlk stations the annual average streamflows of the three catchments are 206 m3 s 69 m3 s and 71 m3 s respectively as streamflow is concentrated in summer flood events frequently occur during this period 2 2 data in this study daily precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed data at nine weather stations were collected from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn daily streamflow observations in the three catchments were obtained from the xinjiang tarim river

inventories guo et al 2015 and represents changes in glacier coverage in the three catchments from 1979 to 2003 3 methods 3 1 comparison and correction of precipitation and temperature datasets gridded precipitation and temperature products always show varying degrees of uncertainty due to terrain conditions vegetation coverage patterns human activities and other factors at the regional scale to assess the applicability of the gridded precipitation and temperature products we compared them against observations from nine weather stations at a daily scale in the upper tarim river basin we finally selected the aphrodite precipitation and cmfd temperature datasets based on their performances table 2 moreover aphrodite has been reported to underestimate precipitation in mountainous regions krysanova et al 2015 shea et al 2015 and cmfd temperature data have the potential to fill data gaps in alpine regions after bias correction xie et al 2017 chen 2014 and sun and su 2020 reported that precipitation and temperature vary with altitudinal gradients caused by orographic effects uncertainties will increase due to the poor meteorological input for glacierized basins where meteorological data are often scarce we therefore corrected the aphrodite precipitation and cmfd temperature datasets based on the precipitation gradient pg indicating that the rate of annual precipitation increase was 13 7 mm 100 m from 1979 to 2008 in our study area as shown in fig 2 a and lapse rate lr indicating that the rate of temperature decrease was 5 c km from 1979 to 2008 in our study area as shown in fig 2b considering the relationship of annual average precipitation fig 2a r 2 0 77 and annual average temperature fig 2b r 2 0 82 with elevation considering the strong correlation between daily average temperature and maximum minimum temperature lr can also be used to correct maximum minimum temperature datasets we calculated daily precipitation and daily temperature using the following equations in the three catchments pc i p i p i p annual j e i e w p g i 1 2 n 1 tc i t i e i e w l r b i a s i 1 2 n 2 where pc i and p i are the bias corrected daily

hydrological model that describes surface and subsurface hydrological processes at the grid scale and is widely used to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological processes worldwide dan et al 2012 heidari et al 2020 lu et al 2018 it takes snow and frozen soil into consideration but currently does not consider the processes of glacier melt which results in poor streamflow simulations in catchments with high glacier coverage a glacier melt module is essential when streamflow is simulated over the upper tarim river in this study we coupled two glacier melt schemes into the vic model to improve streamflow and flood simulations and thus obtained two hydrological models vic gm1 and vic gm2 the scheme to calculate glacier melt for vic gm1 used the classic degree day model on a daily basis hock et al 2005 and was widely used to compensate for the lack of glacier melt in hydrological models chandel and ghosh 2021 fang et al 2018 luo et al 2013 singh et al 2021 sun and su 2020 zhang et al 2013 the degree day factor for glacier melt is calculated by a sinusoidal function to represent its seasonal change eq 5 more detailed information can be found in braun et al 1993 r g m i i 1 2

the glacier melt in grid i in mm r is the percentage of glacier coverage in every grid d g is the degree day factor for glacier melt in mm day c t av is the daily average temperature in c t gmlt is the threshold for glacier melt in c and is equal to 0 b gmlt 6 and b gmlt 12 are the melt factors for june 21 and december 21 in mm day c and both need to be calibrated in the vic gm1 model and n is the day of year however the scheme to calculate glacier melt of vic gm1 did not fully consider the effect of seasonal changes on the degree day factor the degree to which the degree day factor changes across seasons will vary greatly between regions therefore we redefined the relationship between degree day factors and months in the upper tarim river we rearranged the chronological order and found that the multiyear averaged monthly streamflow has a good quartic polynomial relationship with the month the r2 of the normalized result is greater than 0 98 at the three catchments as shown in fig 3 as the streamflow in the tarim river mainly originated from mountainous regions and was highly correlated with glacier melt fang et al 2018 we migrated this quartic polynomial relationship to the relationship between the degree day factor and seasonal changes we also take the refreezing ratio of glacier melt into consideration and calculate glacier melt in grid i using the following calculations m i r 1 f r d g t av t gmlt w h e n t av t gmlt 0 e l s e 6 d g b gmlt a x 4 b x 3 cx 2 d x e x t 7 t 8 x t 5 e l s e 7 where f r is the refreezing ratio of glacier melt and needs to be calibrated in the vic gm2 model b gmlt is the multiyear average melting factor of the glacier and needs to be calibrated in the vic gm2 model mm day c a b c d and e correspond to the coefficients of each quartic polynomial in fig 3 and t is the month to which t av belongs in contrast to the vic gm1 model which uses a sinusoidal function to represent the seasonal change in the degree day factor we developed the vic gm2 model which uses a quartic polynomial function to calculate the glacier melt on a daily basis we considered glacier coverage changes and used separate melt factors for different catchments to better clarify the applicability of the revised model we made a detailed comparison of the simulation results of the three models vic vic gm1 and vic gm2 in section 4 2 3 3 model setting calibration and validation we set the temporal resolution and spatial resolution of the vic gm model developed in this study as daily and 0 25 respectively the soil and meteorological data required by the vic model are listed in section 2 2 we chose 1979 1980 as the warm up period to obtain a good initial state the calibration period and validation period were set to 1981 1987 and 2001 2003 observed streamflow data for 1988 2000 are missing referring to previous research on the calibration strategy of vic in the tarim river basin hao et al 2015 li et al 2016 we selected six vic parameters infiltration parameter b three base flow parameters ds dmax ws and soil depth dp1 and dp2 and two glacier melt module parameters refreezing ratio f r and multiyear average melting factor b gmlt of glaciers for calibration detailed information on the calibrated parameters is listed in table 3 the performance of the vic model was assessed by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and percentage bias pbias ns indicates the degree of deviation between the simulated and observed values when ns approached 1 the simulated values were closer to the observed values when kge approached 1 the fitting results of the flood process were better pbias reflects the dataset system error degree and the optimal value of pbias is 0 these three statistical indicators were calculated by using the equations shown below ns 1 i 1 n q o q s 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 8 kge 1 q s q o 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 r 1 2 9 pbias i 1 n q s q o i 1 n

simulated and observed streamflow and r represents pearson s correlation coefficient between the observed streamflow and simulated streamflow generally when ns is greater than or equal to 0 5 the simulation results are good when ns is greater than or equal to 0 65 the simulation results are very good moriasi et al 2007 the calibration in this study adopted an automatic random sampling method ns kge and pbias were used to evaluate the results and calibration continued until the three indicators no longer increased the number of iterations was greater than 2000 the optimal calibrated parameters are shown in table 3 3 4 flood characteristics indices to unravel the flood characteristics in this study we chose indictors including the mean annual flood maf guo et al 2014 and 99 quantile daily streamflow q99 and applied the peaks over threshold pot approach hirsch and archfield 2015 the maf value obtained from daily maximum streamflow for every year represented the flood magnitude whereas pot and q99 identified the flood frequency and extreme flood events to avoid repetitively counting the same flood event twice or more we used the method of lang et al 1999 as shown in equation 11 to identify consecutive flood events with the pot method all large flood events can be efficiently identified and small flood events are neglected wang et al 2017 we set the baseline period and comparison period as 1981 1987 and 2001 2003 respectively θ 5 l n a 11 where θ is the interval time between two flood events day and a represents the catchment area km2 if the interval days between consecutive flood events did not meet θ it was judged as one flood event 4 results and discussion 4 1 improvement of bias corrected gridded precipitation and temperature data we first bias corrected the aphrodite based on the precipitation gradient fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the annual average precipitation was between 44 32 mm and 158 73 mm while fig 4 b shows that it was between 161 98 mm and 616 48 mm after bias correction and increased by 117 66 mm to 457 75 mm relative to the uncorrected data precipitation mainly occurred in may august accounting for 51 of the precipitation in the whole year this point matches sun and zhang 2018 which reported a maximum of four consecutive months of precipitation accounting for more than 50 of the whole year in the upper tarim river basin the bias corrected annual average precipitation in the three headwater catchments was 462 21 mm and increased by 365 38 mm relative to the uncorrected data over the whole study area the result matched those of chen 2014 which showed an annual average precipitation of approximately 400 mm in our study area precipitation mainly occurred in the southern alpine regions the bias corrected aphrodite dataset provided a plausible estimation of rainy season and annual precipitation and a clear improvement in simulating streamflow the bias corrected precipitation is more representative than the original precipitation over the three headwater catchments given the complex topographical characteristics however most of the stations used to calculate pg are located at low altitudes less than 2200 m which may lead to some uncertainties in bias corrected precipitation in alpine regions and thus in hydrological simulations previous studies have reported cmfd underestimated overestimated temperatures in mountainous regions of northwest china qin et al 2021 rao et al 2019 the lapse rate is a key parameter for obtaining reliable temperatures at high altitudes immerzeel et al 2014 ragettli et al 2014 many researches have used the lapse rate to bias correct temperature datasets and obtained reliable results chandel and ghosh 2021 ren et al 2018 shen et al 2018 we therefore bias corrected the cmfd temperature based on the lapse rate fig 4 c and e show that the annual maximum minimum temperature was between 5 08 c and 4 58 c 16 14 c and 5 8 c while fig 4 d and f show that it was between 6 67 c and 25 06 c 18 44 c and 3 08 c the results matched those of kan et al 2018 which reported that annual maximum minimum temperature is greater lower than 15 c 16 3 c in this region the highest temperature occurred in july while the lowest temperature occurred in january the annual average temperature in the three catchments was 1 52 c according to the bias corrected datasets low temperatures in the alpine regions caused precipitation to mainly exist in the form of snowfall the spatial distribution of the bias corrected temperature data could better reflect the characteristics of the lower temperature in the south mountainous area than in the north area more importantly accurate estimates of temperature are vital to hydrological simulations especially in catchments dominated by mountain sourced water after bias correction the temperature data can be used to calculate the glacier snow melt and the contributions of glacier snow to the total streamflow more accurately 4 2 performance of the vic gm model forced by the bias corrected meteorological data and set parameters based on optimum values see table 3 the streamflow simulations of vic gm1 coupled with the classic method to calculate glacier melt vic gm2 coupled with our revised method to calculate glacier melt and vic not coupled with the glacier melt module were obtained figs 5 and 6 show the streamflow simulated by three modelling schemes at daily and monthly scales from 1981 2003 table 4 shows the detailed performance metrics of simulated streamflow obtained by vic gm1 and vic at the three hydrological stations for calibration 1981 1987 and validation 2001 2003 at daily and monthly scales on a daily scale the vic gm2 simulated streamflow showed very good agreement with the observed streamflow with ns kge and pbias values ranging from 0 69 to 0 79 0 70 to 0 81 and 2 68 to 19 6 respectively compared to vic gm1 and vic the accuracy of vic gm2 improved obviously as evidenced by the ns kge between the simulated and observed data ranging from 0 28 to 0 56 0 32 to 0 52 and 0 73 to 1 01 0 74 to 1 46 during the calibration period and 0 31 to 0 36 0 42 to 0 53 and 0 72 to 0 77 0 83 to 0 84 during the validation period respectively on a monthly scale the simulated streamflow of vic gm2 exhibited a very good performance with ns values ranging from 0 86 to 0 92 kge values ranging from 0 71 to 0 94 and pbias values ranging from 2 7 to 19 8 during the calibration and validation periods the simulation accuracy of vic gm2 also increased significantly compared to vic gm1 and vic table 4 at the monthly scale in addition we found that vic gm1 increased the length of time for glacier melting leading to earlier glacier melting and later glacier accumulation times vic gm2 could better match the time of glacier melting and accumulation the application of hydrological models in watersheds dominated by glacier snow melt will be strongly disturbed by various uncertainties the quality of the input datasets the structure parameters of the hydrological model and the limited knowledge of hydrological regimes chen et al 2017 montanari et al 2009 nepal et al 2014 ragettli et al 2013 shea et al 2015 to reduce the impact of the uncertainties mentioned above on the performance of the hydrological model we bias corrected the input datasets section 3 1 improved the model structure section 3 2 and optimized the parameters section 3 3 the results in table 4 suggest that the glacier melt module plays an important role in the catchments dominated by glacier melt of the tarim river basin the scheme of calculating glacier melt by considering the degree day model is obviously better than that under which it is not considered the results in figs 5 and 6 suggest that our improved scheme of calculating glacier melt is obviously better than that using the classic degree day model although our improved scheme does not have a more detailed physical mechanism than methods based on energy balance algorithms it is simple to implement and effectively improves glacier hydrological simulations in the upper tarim river although we defined plausible parameter ranges based on previous studies hao et al 2015 li et al 2016 and optimized the values by running models more than 2000 times different parameter sets might lead to the same simulation results being unavoidable as suggested by beven and freer 2001 therefore it is best to use the behavioral parameter ensemble to represent hydrological regimes based on calibration and uncertainty analysis shen et al 2018 4 3 contribution of glacier melt to streamflow identifying the contribution of different components i e rainfall snow and glacier melt to total streamflow is a challenge we used the coupled glacier hydrological model vic gm2 to separate different components and quantify their contributions to total streamflow fig 7 indicates that glacier melt contributes the most in summer followed by autumn with a value above 80 during summer and autumn for all three catchments the contribution of glacier melt to annual streamflow is 84 2 for yark which is consistent with ren et al 2018 who reported that the contribution of glacier runoff to annual total flow ranged between 63 and 87 based on observations in a nearby basin muji the contribution of glacier melt to annual streamflow is largest in yuru due to its larger glacier coverage 23 46 in contrast the contribution of snowmelt is less than that of glacier melt in all catchments and constitutes a high proportion in winter and spring snowmelt is larger in yark due to the higher temperature observed here than at qara and yuru the contribution of rainfall to annual streamflow is largest in qara with a value of 8 4 fig 4 shows that precipitation is mainly distributed in alpine regions and exists in the form of snow due to the low temperature which is not conducive to the ablation of glaciers and snow therefore the glacier melt that contributed to total streamflow mainly came from relatively low altitude areas the large amount of simulated glacier melt suggests that cryosphere hydrological processes play an important role in the headwater catchments of the tarim river in addition oasis based agriculture in downstream areas consumes a large amount of water and is highly dependent on surface streamflow which is primarily generated by mountain sourced glacier melt as climate warming intensifies glacier melt occurs earlier liu et al 2011b which may reduce water availability when oasis based agricultural water demand is high we believe these results could help us better understand mountain hydrology and conduct water resource management in the middle and lower reaches 4 4 flood characteristics we first assessed the performance of vic gm2 in capturing flood events and then analysed the flood characteristics of the study area table 5 indicates that vic gm2 performs better in capturing flood events the fq99 frequency of q99 of obs and sim are equal in the three headwater catchments during the baseline period 1981 1987 the difference in pot and fpot between obs and sim during all periods is small there are still some shortcomings in the extreme value simulation during the year maf in table 5 but it does not affect the analysis of flood magnitude see fig 8 fig 8 shows that the maf mainly occurs in summer and is close between the observed and simulated flood events the difference in maf values between obs and sim is due to the influence of outliers the simulation results of flood magnitudes modelled by vic gm2 are satisfactory overall fig 8 indicates that streamflow varies greatly in different seasons and floods mainly occur in summer combined with the information in figs 6 and 7 we know that the floods in this area are mainly caused by glacier melt in yark maf is largest compared with the other two catchments fpot ranges from 1 to 1 75 times per year with maximum value occurring in 1997 2000 and the trend of fq99 is similar to that of fpot fig 9 in qara fpot ranges from 1 to 1 5 times per year and has shown a decreasing trend in recent years however fq99 has increased rapidly from 0 occurrences per year in 1989 1992 to 1 occurrence per year in 1997 2003 in yuru the fpot trend has slightly increased since 1993 reaching 1 33 times per year in 2001 2003 fpot generally shows a relatively stable state while fq99 has risen to 0 67 occurrences per year since 1989 in yuru consistent with sun and zhang 2018 as global warming intensifies glacier melt which is greatly affected by temperature luo et al 2013 may increase the fq99 and future glacial lake outburst flood risks zheng et al 2021 in these three catchments 4 5 uncertainty one limitation of this study was the availability and highly uneven spatial coverage of meteorological datasets which make it difficult to constrain flood simulations in alpine regions of the tarim river basin although the bias corrected precipitation and temperature data performed well as a whole the focus on changes in complex mountains could have missed some subregional features although the linear regression results are similar to shen et al 2018 who reported that pg was 15 mm 100 m year and lr was 4 8 c km from 1961 to 2011 in the upper tarim river basin uncertainties may arise in quantifying the relationship between annual average precipitation temperature and elevation due to most weather stations are distributed in low altitude areas fig 2 due to the scarcity of observational data and complex topographical characteristics precise estimates of precipitation and temperature in the headwater catchments of the tarim river are not yet available considering these constraints we need to deploy more sites at high altitudes in future research to reduce the uncertainty caused by the uneven distribution of observation sites moreover it is well known that the hydrological simulation results in alpine regions are always poor huss et al 2008 nepal et al 2014 glacial melting which plays an important role in the generation of streamflow makes the sensitivity analysis of total streamflow complex although we coupled a revised glacier melt scheme into the vic model and significantly improved streamflow and flood simulations the contribution of glacier melt to the total streamflow may be uncertain furthermore we analyse the influence of glacier melt contribution to the streamflow simulation results to provide references for optimizing hydrological simulations in alpine regions of the tarim river basin fig 10 shows the trend of ns with increasing glacier melt contribution at the daily scale for the calibration period as the contribution of glacier melt increases ns shows a slow increase first and then a sharp decline in kaqun and ulwat it also shows a steady state first followed by a sharp increase and finally a sharp decline at tgzlk when the contribution of glacier melt equals 0 86 0 88 and 0 997 during the calibration period the simulation results of these three catchments perform best when the contribution of glacier melt ranges from 0 80 to 0 90 0 86 to 0 96 and 0 995 to 0 997 the results simulated by vic gm2 at kaqun ulwat and tgzlk respectively are very good ns 0 65 these uncertainties in streamflow give us a better idea of variations in streamflow 5 summary and conclusions in this study we assessed the applicability of six precipitation and temperature datasets and bias corrected the suitable dataset to obtain the most reliable hydrological model inputs a revised glacier melt scheme was coupled in the vic model vic gm2 in addition we used the optimized hydrological model to analyse the contributions of rainfall snow and glacier melt moreover we analysed the flood characteristics based on the simulation results overall after comparison with other datasets the aphrodite precipitation and cmfd temperature data were selected to be bias corrected by pg 13 7 mm 100 m year and lr 5 c km to enhance their performance and improve streamflow simulation the bias corrected meteorological forcing shows better performance in the three catchments driven by the bias corrected meteorological datasets the revised model vic gm2 showed good performance compared with vic gm1 vic gm2 also performed better in capturing flood events the annual contribution of glacier melt to total streamflow exceeded 80 among the three catchments the contribution of snow melt was relatively less than that of glacier melt to annual streamflow in all catchments but constituted a high proportion in winter and spring floods mainly occurred in summer owing to a greater amount of warming induced glacier melt glacial melt which is greatly affected by temperature may increase the fq99 in these three catchments due to intensified global warming our work provides a reference for quantifying the contributions of different components i e rainfall snow and glacier melt and understanding the flood mechanisms of basin headwaters more works need to be explored to comprehensively evaluate the changes in floods dominated by different components and systematically assess the impact of floods on population and economy in future scenarios credit authorship contribution statement ning wang conceptualization methodology

3922,understanding hydrological changes especially those of snow and or glacier melt induced floods is vital for early flood warnings in alpine regions however there is limited information available regarding warming induced changes in hydrological and flooding processes in high mountain regions owing to data scarcity and inadequate considerations within hydrological models this study aims to improve streamflow and flood simulations in three high mountain headwater catchments of the tarim river in northwest china an improved scheme for calculating glacier melt gm2 was coupled in the variable infiltration capacity model named vic gm2 driven by bias corrected meteorological data vic gm2 exhibited good performance as evidenced by ns kge and pbias values between the simulated and observed daily streamflow ranging from 0 69 to 0 79 0 70 to 0 81 and 2 68 to 19 6 respectively in addition annual contributions of glacier melt and snow melt to total streamflow were greater than 80 and less than 16 among the three catchments respectively the flood characteristics were inconsistent among the three catchments except that flooding mainly occurred in summer the maf mean annual flood in the yarkand river was largest followed by that in the yurungkax river and the qaraqash river the fpot frequency of peak over threshold and fq99 frequency of q99 times year fluctuated within 1 1 75 and 0 25 1 in the three catchments respectively this study provides references for understanding cryosphere hydrological processes and quantifying the contribution of different components i e glacier melt snow melt and rainfall to streamflow under a changing climate in the upper tarim river keywords streamflow flood characteristics simulation glacier melt contribution upper tarim river 1 introduction as the largest inland river in china and fifth largest in the world the tarim river originates in high mountains and plays a vital role in ecosystem development agricultural irrigation residential expansion and industrial production in the northwest region hagg et al 2007 sorg et al 2012 however as the water resources in the tarim river mainly originate from mountain sourced water fang et al 2018 and are reserved by glaciers and ice caps that are easily disturbed by a changing climate the upper tarim river basin s streamflow is primarily concentrated in the warm season resulting in seasonal flooding that threatens agricultural production residential safety and property and public infrastructure stability akhtar et al 2008 kang et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 in addition the hydrological process of the tarim river basin is complex chen 2014 including not only precipitation evapotranspiration infiltration groundwater and runoff but also glacier and snow melt in the upper reaches irrigation water intake and reservoir regulation in the lower reaches however hydrological processes in the alpine region of the tarim river basin are poorly understood due to data scarcity and extreme climate zhang et al 2012 therefore improving the understanding of hydrological processes in the upper tarim river will help the surrounding areas better cope with the above mentioned risks brought by climate change duethmann et al 2019 huss 2011 nepal et al 2014 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2020b researchers have implemented hydrological models to investigate the complex hydrological processes on mountainous glacierized catchments around the world li et al 2019 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018b nepal 2016 nolin et al 2010 soncini et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b including studies focusing on the main headwaters of the tarim river duethmann et al 2015 he et al 2015 the amudarya wang et al 2016 the syrdarya gan et al 2015 and the himalayan region immerzeel and bierkens 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 these studies have used different hydrological models such as xinanjiang zhao 1980 zhao 1992 tank sugawara 1979 gr4j nepal et al 2017 flexg gao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 hbv braun et al 1993 konz et al 2007 soil and water assessment tool swat douglas mankin et al 2010 wang et al 2019 j2000 krause 2002 shen et al 2018 weather research and forecasting hydrology wrf hydro arnault et al 2019 xie et al 2020 and variable infiltration capacity vic dang et al 2020 liang et al 1994 however many hydrological processes are simplified or ignored in hydrological models which are the main obstacles to developing hydrological simulations in the headwaters of the tarim river biskop et al 2016 ragettli et al 2013 for instance lumped hydrological models such as xinanjiang and gr4j simplify the entire watershed into a whole making it difficult to describe the spatial information of hydro physical and land surface processes in a changing environment distributed hydrological models such as swat and vic ignore or simplify glacier snow accumulation melt and their dynamic processes in the glacierized headwater catchments of the tarim river the lack of observational data and the omission of glacier melt processes have been major sources of uncertainty in previous studies chen et al 2017 dou et al 2011 liu et al 2012 xu et al 2016 in existing studies glacier melt was excluded chen et al 2017 shen et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the distribution of streamflow components was not solved liu et al 2011a sun et al 2015 and the vic model was less integrated with a glacier melt module chandel and ghosh 2021 ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 and ren et al 2018 used a mass and energy balance model to calculate the glacier melt and coupled it to the vic model these schemes are data intensive and difficult to investigate on a large spatial scale and in a data limited region chandel and ghosh 2021 the degree day model hock et al 2005 can better solve the problem that hydrological models cannot calculate glacier melt and it is easy to implement chandel and ghosh 2021 integrated a degree day model with the vic model and validated the output with observed streamflow in five river basins in the himalayas however this study did not fully consider the effect of seasonal changes on the degree day factor zhang et al 2013 used the vic model coupled with a degree day model for simulating glacier melt based on an area weighted factor from 1961 to 1999 the study did not take the changes in glacier coverage into consideration lutz et al 2014 used the same melt factors for different catchments over the entire himalayan region and thus increased the uncertainties of the results therefore a revised hydrological model that takes the above limitations into account needs to be explored to fully understand streamflow and flood characteristics in the upper tarim river in addition the lack of adequate observational data in high mountains is another difficult problem horak et al 2019 li et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 with the development of remote sensing technology and data assimilation satellite based and reanalysis based meteorological datasets can partly overcome data scarcity in hydrological simulations de lima and lovejoy 2015 kim et al 2019 liu et al 2018a monaghan et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 however the limitations of meteorological datasets in terms of accuracy and temporal resolution will increase the uncertainties of hydrological model inputs wang et al 2020a therefore meteorological datasets should be bias corrected before use especially in mountainous regions gao et al 2012 many studies have further improved the quality of different meteorological data based on regional geographical conditions i e elevation longitude and latitude duethmann et al 2013 hu and franzke 2020 tong et al 2020 outside our study area however due to limited observed data and complex topographical characteristics the reliability and suitability of gridded products have not been completely resolved and still need to be explored for forcing hydrological models in the upper tarim river in view of the mentioned restrictions the overall objectives of this study are to improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations and to understand the processes and evolution mechanisms of floods in the upper tarim river to achieve these goals a hydrological model coupled with a revised scheme to calculate glacier melt was developed the glacier hydrological model incorporates precipitation gradient lapse rate glacier coverage changes and separate degree day factors with seasonal changes moreover the contributions of different components i e rainfall snow and glacier melt to streamflow and flood characteristics were identified in three headwater catchments of the tarim river although this study is somewhat preliminary due to limited data availability it is of great importance for better understanding the hydrological processes in the upper tarim river this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data employed in our study section 3 introduces bias correction methods of meteorological datasets improvements and implementations of the coupled glacier hydrological model and flood characteristic indices section 4 presents the results and discussions and section 5 presents our conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study focuses on three headwater catchments within the domain of 34 50 n 38 18 n and 74 28 e 81 41 e with elevations between 1278 and 8538 m of the tarim river which originate in the kunlun mountains in northwest china the three catchments are the yarkand river yark qaraqash river qara and yurungkax river yuru with control hydrological stations kaqun wuluwati ulwat and tongguziluk tgzlk respectively the location and basic information of the three catchments are shown and described in fig 1 and table 1 the three catchments have a continental semiarid climate the annual average precipitation is approximately 400 mm chen 2014 in the three catchments the precipitation varies greatly between months and mainly occurs from april to august precipitation in the southern mountainous regions is more abundant than that in the northern regions the glacier coverages of the three catchments are 14 12 yark 11 3 qara and 23 46 yuru according to observations from the kaqun ulwat and tgzlk stations the annual average streamflows of the three catchments are 206 m3 s 69 m3 s and 71 m3 s respectively as streamflow is concentrated in summer flood events frequently occur during this period 2 2 data in this study daily precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed data at nine

inventories guo et al 2015 and represents changes in glacier coverage in the three catchments from 1979 to 2003 3 methods 3 1 comparison and correction of precipitation and temperature datasets gridded precipitation and temperature products always show varying degrees of uncertainty due to terrain conditions vegetation coverage patterns human activities and other factors at the regional scale to assess the applicability of the gridded precipitation and temperature products we compared them against observations from nine weather stations at a daily scale in the upper tarim river basin we finally selected the aphrodite precipitation and cmfd temperature datasets based on their performances table 2 moreover aphrodite has been reported to underestimate precipitation in mountainous regions krysanova et al 2015 shea et al 2015 and cmfd temperature data have the potential to fill data gaps in alpine regions after bias correction xie et al 2017 chen 2014 and sun and su 2020 reported that precipitation and temperature vary with altitudinal gradients caused by orographic effects uncertainties will increase due to the poor meteorological input for glacierized basins where meteorological data are often scarce we therefore corrected the aphrodite precipitation and cmfd temperature datasets based on the precipitation gradient pg indicating that the rate of annual precipitation increase was 13 7 mm 100 m from 1979 to 2008 in our study area as shown in fig 2 a and lapse rate lr indicating that the rate of temperature decrease was 5 c km from 1979 to 2008 in our study area as shown in fig 2b considering the relationship of annual average precipitation fig 2a r 2 0 77 and annual average temperature fig 2b r 2 0 82 with elevation considering the strong correlation between daily average temperature and maximum minimum temperature lr can also be used to correct maximum minimum temperature datasets we calculated daily precipitation and daily temperature using the following equations in the three catchments pc i p i p i p annual j e i e w p g i 1 2 n 1 tc i t i e i e w l r b i a s i 1 2 n 2 where pc i and p i are the bias corrected daily

the cmfd temperature data and nine independent temperature weather stations 3 2 coupled glacier hydrological model the vic model gou et al 2020 liang et al 1994 is a macroscale distributed hydrological model that describes surface and subsurface hydrological processes at the grid scale and is widely used to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological processes worldwide dan et al 2012 heidari et al 2020 lu et al 2018 it takes snow and frozen soil into consideration but currently does not consider the processes of glacier melt which results in poor streamflow simulations in catchments with high glacier coverage a glacier melt module is essential when streamflow is simulated over the upper tarim river in this study we coupled two glacier melt schemes into the vic model to improve streamflow and flood simulations and thus obtained two hydrological models vic gm1 and vic gm2 the scheme to calculate glacier melt for vic gm1 used the classic degree day model on a daily basis hock et al 2005 and was widely used to compensate for the lack of glacier melt in hydrological models chandel and ghosh 2021 fang et al 2018 luo et al 2013 singh et al 2021 sun and su 2020 zhang et al 2013 the degree day factor for glacier melt is calculated by a sinusoidal function to represent its seasonal change eq 5 more detailed information can be found in braun et al 1993 r g m i i 1 2 n 3 m i r d g t av t gmlt w h e n t av t gmlt 0 e l s e 4 d g b gmlt 6 b gmlt 12 2 b gmlt 6 b gmlt 12 2 s i n 2 π 365 n 81 5 where r g is the total amount of the glacier melt in the basin in mm m i is the glacier melt in grid i in mm r is the percentage of glacier coverage in every grid d g is the degree day factor for glacier melt in mm day c t av is the daily average temperature in c t gmlt is the threshold for glacier melt in c and is equal to 0 b gmlt 6 and b gmlt 12 are the melt factors for june 21 and december 21 in mm day c and both need to be calibrated in the vic gm1 model and n is the day of year however the scheme to calculate glacier melt of vic gm1 did not fully consider the effect of seasonal changes on the degree day factor the degree to which the degree day factor changes across seasons will vary greatly between regions therefore we redefined the relationship between degree day factors and months in the upper tarim river we rearranged the chronological order and found that the multiyear averaged monthly streamflow has a good quartic polynomial relationship with the month the r2 of the normalized result is greater than 0 98 at the three catchments as shown in fig 3 as the streamflow in the tarim river mainly originated from mountainous regions and was highly correlated with glacier melt fang et al 2018 we migrated this quartic polynomial relationship to the relationship between the degree day factor and seasonal changes we also take the refreezing ratio of glacier melt into consideration and calculate glacier melt in grid i using the following calculations m i r 1 f r d g t av t gmlt w h e n t av t gmlt 0 e l s e 6 d g b gmlt a x 4 b x 3 cx 2 d x e x t 7 t 8 x t 5 e l s e 7 where f r is the refreezing ratio of glacier melt and needs to be calibrated in the vic gm2 model b gmlt is the multiyear average melting factor of the glacier and needs to be calibrated in the vic gm2 model mm day c a b c d and e correspond to the coefficients of each quartic polynomial in fig 3 and t is the month to which t av belongs in contrast to the vic gm1 model which uses a sinusoidal function to represent the seasonal change in the degree day factor we developed the vic gm2 model which uses a quartic polynomial function to calculate the glacier melt on a daily basis we considered glacier coverage changes and used separate melt factors for different catchments to better clarify the applicability of the revised model we made a detailed comparison of the simulation results of the three models vic vic gm1 and vic gm2 in section 4 2 3 3 model setting calibration and validation we set the temporal resolution and spatial resolution of the vic gm model developed in this study as daily and 0 25 respectively the soil and meteorological data required by the vic model are listed in section 2 2 we chose 1979 1980 as the warm up period to obtain a good initial state the calibration period and validation period were set to 1981 1987 and 2001 2003 observed streamflow data for 1988 2000 are missing referring to previous research on the calibration strategy of vic in the tarim river basin hao et al 2015 li et al 2016 we selected six vic parameters infiltration parameter b three base flow parameters ds dmax ws and soil depth dp1 and dp2 and two glacier melt module parameters refreezing ratio f r and multiyear average melting factor b gmlt of glaciers for calibration detailed information on the calibrated parameters is listed in table 3 the performance of the vic model was assessed by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and percentage bias pbias ns indicates the degree of deviation between the simulated and observed values when ns approached 1 the simulated values were closer to the observed values when kge approached 1 the fitting results of the flood process were better pbias reflects the dataset system error degree and the optimal value of pbias is 0 these three statistical indicators were calculated by using the equations shown below ns 1 i 1 n q o q s 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 8 kge 1 q s q o 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 r 1 2 9 pbias i 1 n q s q o i 1 n q o 100 10 where q o is the observed streamflow q s is the simulated streamflow q o is the average observed streamflow q s is the average simulated streamflow μ s and μ o are the variance of the simulated and observed streamflow and r represents pearson s correlation coefficient between the observed streamflow and simulated streamflow generally when ns is greater than or equal to 0 5 the simulation results are good when ns is greater than or equal to 0 65 the simulation results are very good moriasi et al 2007 the calibration in this study adopted an automatic random sampling method ns kge and pbias were used to evaluate the results and calibration continued until the three indicators no longer increased the number of iterations was greater than 2000 the optimal calibrated parameters are shown in table 3 3 4 flood characteristics indices to unravel the flood characteristics in this study we chose indictors including the mean annual flood maf guo et al 2014 and 99 quantile daily streamflow q99 and applied the peaks over threshold pot approach hirsch and archfield 2015 the maf value obtained from daily maximum streamflow for every year represented the flood magnitude whereas pot and q99 identified the flood frequency and extreme flood events to avoid repetitively counting the same flood event twice or more we used the method of lang et al 1999 as shown in equation 11 to identify consecutive flood events with the pot method all large flood events can be efficiently identified and small flood events are neglected wang et al 2017 we set the baseline period and comparison period as 1981 1987 and 2001 2003 respectively θ 5 l n a 11 where θ is the interval time between two flood events day and a represents the catchment area km2 if the interval days between consecutive flood events did not meet θ it was judged as one flood event 4 results and discussion 4 1 improvement of bias corrected gridded precipitation and temperature data we first bias corrected the aphrodite based on the precipitation gradient fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the annual average precipitation was between 44 32 mm and 158 73 mm while fig 4 b shows that it was between 161 98 mm and 616 48 mm after bias correction and increased by 117 66 mm to 457 75 mm relative to the uncorrected data precipitation mainly occurred in may august accounting for 51 of the precipitation in the whole year this point matches sun and zhang 2018 which reported a maximum of four consecutive months of precipitation accounting for more than 50 of the whole year in the upper tarim river basin the bias corrected annual average precipitation in the three headwater catchments was 462 21 mm and increased by 365 38 mm relative to the uncorrected data over the whole study area the result matched those of chen 2014 which showed an annual average precipitation of approximately 400 mm in our study area precipitation mainly occurred in the southern alpine regions the bias corrected aphrodite dataset provided a plausible estimation of rainy season and annual precipitation and a clear improvement in simulating streamflow the bias corrected precipitation is more representative than the original precipitation over the three headwater catchments given the complex topographical characteristics however most of the stations used to calculate pg are located at low altitudes less than 2200 m which may lead to some uncertainties in bias corrected precipitation in alpine regions and thus in hydrological simulations previous studies have reported cmfd underestimated overestimated temperatures in mountainous regions of northwest china qin et al 2021 rao et al 2019 the lapse rate is a key parameter for obtaining reliable temperatures at high altitudes immerzeel et al 2014 ragettli et al 2014 many researches have used the lapse rate to bias correct temperature datasets and obtained reliable results chandel and ghosh 2021 ren et al 2018 shen et al 2018 we therefore bias corrected the cmfd temperature based on the lapse rate fig 4 c and e show that the annual maximum minimum temperature was between 5 08 c and 4 58 c 16 14 c and 5 8 c while fig 4 d and f show that it was between 6 67 c and 25 06 c 18 44 c and 3 08 c the results matched those of kan et al 2018 which reported that annual maximum minimum temperature is greater lower than 15 c 16 3 c in this region the highest temperature occurred in july while the lowest temperature occurred in january the annual average temperature in the three catchments was 1 52 c according to the bias corrected datasets low temperatures in the alpine regions caused precipitation to mainly exist in the form of snowfall the spatial distribution of the bias corrected temperature data could better reflect the characteristics of the lower temperature in the south mountainous area than in the north area more importantly accurate estimates of temperature are vital to hydrological simulations especially in catchments dominated by mountain sourced water after bias correction the temperature data can be used to calculate the glacier snow melt and the contributions of glacier snow to the total streamflow more accurately 4 2 performance of the vic gm model forced by the bias corrected meteorological data and set parameters based on optimum values see table 3 the streamflow simulations of vic gm1 coupled with the classic method to calculate glacier melt vic gm2 coupled with our revised method to calculate glacier melt and vic not coupled with the glacier melt module were obtained figs 5 and 6 show the streamflow simulated by three modelling schemes at daily and monthly scales from 1981 2003 table 4 shows the detailed performance metrics of simulated streamflow obtained by vic gm1 and vic at the three hydrological stations for calibration 1981 1987 and validation 2001 2003 at daily and monthly scales on a daily scale the vic gm2 simulated streamflow showed very good agreement with the observed streamflow with ns kge and pbias values ranging from 0 69 to 0 79 0 70 to 0 81 and 2 68 to 19 6 respectively compared to vic gm1 and vic the accuracy of vic gm2 improved obviously as evidenced by the ns kge between the simulated and observed data ranging from 0 28 to 0 56 0 32 to 0 52 and 0 73 to 1 01 0 74 to 1 46 during the calibration period and 0 31 to 0 36 0 42 to 0 53 and 0 72 to 0 77 0 83 to 0 84 during the validation period respectively on a monthly scale the simulated streamflow of vic gm2 exhibited a very good performance with ns values ranging from 0 86 to 0 92 kge values ranging from 0 71 to 0 94 and pbias values ranging from 2 7 to 19 8 during the calibration and validation periods the simulation accuracy of vic gm2 also increased significantly compared to vic gm1 and vic table 4 at the monthly scale in addition we found that vic gm1 increased the length of time for glacier melting leading to earlier glacier melting and later glacier accumulation times vic gm2 could better match the time of glacier melting and accumulation the application of hydrological models in watersheds dominated by glacier snow melt will be strongly disturbed by various uncertainties the quality of the input datasets the structure parameters of the hydrological model and the limited knowledge of hydrological regimes chen et al 2017 montanari et al 2009 nepal et al 2014 ragettli et al 2013 shea et al 2015 to reduce the impact of the uncertainties mentioned above on the performance of the hydrological model we bias corrected the input datasets section 3 1 improved the model structure section 3 2 and optimized the parameters section 3 3 the results in table 4 suggest that the glacier melt module plays an important role in the catchments dominated by glacier melt of the tarim river basin the scheme of calculating glacier melt by considering the degree day model is obviously better than that under which it is not considered the results in figs 5 and 6 suggest that our improved scheme of calculating glacier melt is obviously better than that using the classic degree day model although our improved scheme does not have a more detailed physical mechanism than methods based on energy balance algorithms it is simple to implement and effectively improves glacier hydrological simulations in the upper tarim river although we defined plausible parameter ranges based on previous studies hao et al 2015 li et al 2016 and optimized the values by running models more than 2000 times different parameter sets might lead to the same simulation results being unavoidable as suggested by beven and freer 2001 therefore it is best to use the behavioral parameter ensemble to represent hydrological regimes based on calibration and uncertainty analysis shen et al 2018 4 3 contribution of glacier melt to streamflow identifying the contribution of different components i e rainfall snow and glacier melt to total streamflow is a challenge we used the coupled glacier hydrological model vic gm2 to separate different components and quantify their contributions to total streamflow fig 7 indicates that glacier melt contributes the most in summer followed by autumn with a value above 80 during summer and autumn for all three catchments the contribution of glacier melt to annual streamflow is 84 2 for yark which is consistent with ren et al 2018 who reported that the contribution of glacier runoff to annual total flow ranged between 63 and 87 based on observations in a nearby basin muji the contribution of glacier melt to annual streamflow is largest in yuru due to its larger glacier coverage 23 46 in contrast the contribution of snowmelt is less than that of glacier melt in all catchments and constitutes a high proportion in winter and spring snowmelt is larger in yark due to the higher temperature observed here than at qara and yuru the contribution of rainfall to annual streamflow is largest in qara with a value of 8 4 fig 4 shows that precipitation is mainly distributed in alpine regions and exists in the form of snow due to the low temperature which is not conducive to the ablation of glaciers and snow therefore the glacier melt that contributed to total streamflow mainly came from relatively low altitude areas the large amount of simulated glacier melt suggests that cryosphere hydrological processes play an important role in the headwater catchments of the tarim river in addition oasis based agriculture in downstream areas consumes a large amount of water and is highly dependent on surface streamflow which is primarily generated by mountain sourced glacier melt as climate warming intensifies glacier melt occurs earlier liu et al 2011b which may reduce water availability when oasis based agricultural water demand is high we believe these results could help us better understand mountain hydrology and conduct water resource management in the middle and lower reaches 4 4 flood characteristics we first assessed the performance of vic gm2 in capturing flood events and then analysed the flood characteristics of the study area table 5 indicates that vic gm2 performs better in capturing flood events the fq99 frequency of q99 of obs and sim are equal in the three headwater catchments during the baseline period 1981 1987 the difference in pot and fpot between obs and sim during all periods is small there are still some shortcomings in the extreme value simulation during the year maf in table 5 but it does not affect the analysis of flood magnitude see fig 8 fig 8 shows that the maf mainly occurs in summer and is close between the observed and simulated flood events the difference in maf values between obs and sim is due to the influence of outliers the simulation results of flood magnitudes modelled by vic gm2 are satisfactory overall fig 8 indicates that streamflow varies greatly in different seasons and floods mainly occur in summer combined with the information in figs 6 and 7 we know that the floods in this area are mainly caused by glacier melt in yark maf is largest compared with the other two catchments fpot ranges from 1 to 1 75 times per year with maximum value occurring in 1997 2000 and the trend of fq99 is similar to that of fpot fig 9 in qara fpot ranges from 1 to 1 5 times per year and has shown a decreasing trend in recent years however fq99 has increased rapidly from 0 occurrences per year in 1989 1992 to 1 occurrence per year in 1997 2003 in yuru the fpot trend has slightly increased since 1993 reaching 1 33 times per year in 2001 2003 fpot generally shows a relatively stable state while fq99 has risen to 0 67 occurrences per year since 1989 in yuru consistent with sun and zhang 2018 as global warming intensifies glacier melt which is greatly affected by temperature luo et al 2013 may increase the fq99 and future glacial lake outburst flood risks zheng et al 2021 in these three catchments 4 5 uncertainty one limitation of this study was the availability and highly uneven spatial coverage of meteorological datasets which make it difficult to constrain flood simulations in alpine regions of the tarim river basin although the bias corrected precipitation and temperature data performed well as a whole the focus on changes in complex mountains could have missed some subregional features although the linear regression results are similar to shen et al 2018 who reported that pg was 15 mm 100 m year and lr was 4 8 c km from 1961 to 2011 in the upper tarim river basin uncertainties may arise in quantifying the relationship between annual average precipitation temperature and elevation due to most weather stations are distributed in low altitude areas fig 2 due to the scarcity of observational data and complex topographical characteristics precise estimates of precipitation and temperature in the headwater catchments of the tarim river are not yet available considering these constraints we need to deploy more sites at high altitudes in future research to reduce the uncertainty caused by the uneven distribution of observation sites moreover it is well known that the hydrological simulation results in alpine regions are always poor huss et al 2008 nepal et al 2014 glacial melting which plays an important role in the generation of streamflow makes the sensitivity analysis of total streamflow complex although we coupled a revised glacier melt scheme into the vic model and significantly improved streamflow and flood simulations the contribution of glacier melt to the total streamflow may be uncertain furthermore we analyse the influence of glacier melt contribution to the streamflow simulation results to provide references for optimizing hydrological simulations in alpine regions of the tarim river basin fig 10 shows the trend of ns with increasing glacier melt contribution at the daily scale for the calibration period as the contribution of glacier melt increases ns shows a slow increase first and then a sharp decline in kaqun and ulwat it also shows a steady state first followed by a sharp increase and finally a sharp decline at tgzlk when the contribution of glacier melt equals 0 86 0 88 and 0 997 during the calibration period the simulation results of these three catchments perform best when the contribution of glacier melt ranges from 0 80 to 0 90 0 86 to 0 96 and 0 995 to 0 997 the results simulated by vic gm2 at kaqun ulwat and tgzlk respectively are very good ns 0 65 these uncertainties in streamflow give us a better idea of variations in streamflow 5 summary and conclusions in this study we assessed the applicability of six precipitation and temperature datasets and bias corrected the suitable dataset to obtain the most reliable hydrological model inputs a revised glacier melt scheme was coupled in the vic model vic gm2 in addition we used the optimized hydrological model to analyse the contributions of rainfall snow and glacier melt moreover we analysed the flood characteristics based on the simulation results overall after comparison with other datasets the aphrodite precipitation and cmfd temperature data were selected to be bias corrected by pg 13 7 mm 100 m year and lr 5 c km to enhance their performance and improve streamflow simulation the bias corrected meteorological forcing shows better performance in the three catchments driven by the bias corrected meteorological datasets the revised model vic gm2 showed good performance compared with vic gm1 vic gm2 also performed better in capturing flood events the annual contribution of glacier melt to total streamflow exceeded 80 among the three catchments the contribution of snow melt was relatively less than that of glacier melt to annual streamflow in all catchments but constituted a high proportion in winter and spring floods mainly occurred in summer owing to a greater amount of warming induced glacier melt glacial melt which is greatly affected by temperature may increase the fq99 in these three catchments due to intensified global warming our work provides a reference for quantifying the contributions of different components i e rainfall snow and glacier melt and understanding the flood mechanisms of basin headwaters more works need to be explored to comprehensively evaluate the changes in floods dominated by different components and systematically assess the impact of floods on population and economy in future scenarios credit authorship contribution statement ning wang conceptualization methodology

3923,human interventions hi are significantly affecting the land surface hydrological cycle and thus altering the occurrence of hydrological drought so far however how hi affect the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is still unclear in this study we proposed a quantitative diagnosis framework and assessed the impacts of hi on drought propagation across varying scales over the typical reservoir dominant daling river basin drb in china in which the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi were utilized to identify the meteorological drought md and hydrological drought hd respectively our results show that the in situ streamflow records were found with an evident turning point around 2003 coincident with the operation of the largest reservoir in drb under the influence of reservoir operation the hd frequency saw an obvious intensification and the correlations between md and hd exhibited a decreasing tendency especially during the wet season the seasonality of drought propagation changed significantly for both up downstream and md hd as indicated by the advance of drought events from autumn to summer and the aggravation of autumn drought the reservoir operation changed the hd events characteristics by increasing the drought duration and severity our results highlight the strong aggravating effect of reservoirs on drought propagation keywords drought propagation meteorological drought hydrological drought reservoir impacts standardized drought index 1 introduction drought is usually classified into three categories depending on the affected components meteorological drought referred to as md hereafter precipitation deficiency agricultural drought soil moisture deficiency and hydrological drought referred to as hd negative anomalies in surface and subsurface water mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 md is the starting of a drought event and develops quickly while hd is commonly caused by the continuation of md the transition of md to hd is called drought propagation due to the physical relationship between the atmosphere and the terrestrial hydrological cycle a close correlation is expected between the md and hd guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 understanding the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is of critical significance to timely capture drought evolutions and assess its associated impacts which will largely benefit accurate drought early warning and risk mitigation so far considerable efforts have been devoted to characterizing drought propagation and exploring its potential influence factors e g climatic conditions and catchment characteristics at regional scale apurv et al 2017 barker et al 2016 han et al 2019 huang et al 2016 van loon and laaha 2015 for instance van loon and laaha 2015 investigated the controls on drought propagation in australia and the results suggested the streamflow drought deficit is governed by a combination of meteorological forcing and physiographic catchment characteristics in which the storage in soils aquifers lakes etc is important han et al 2019 found the increased soil moisture is the main driving force to accelerate drought propagation from md to groundwater drought in the pearl river basin china consequently the terrestrial hydrological processes are highly influential on drought propagation however drought propagation in these previous studies was usually viewed as a natural phenomenon without consideration of human related water shortage in the past few decades human interventions hi have taken place at local or regional scales including land use and land cover change lucc water withdraws from surface water or groundwater for irrigation dams and reservoirs to control the timing of streamflow dong et al 2019 leng et al 2015 wada et al 2013 these hi are known to significantly impact water cycle and thus exacerbate or alleviate drought conditions leng et al 2015 veldkamp et al 2017 wada et al 2013 through altering key water cycle fields primarily streamflow across varying spatial and temporal scales such as between upstream and downstream areas to date the impacts of reservoir or reservoir system regulation on hd have attracted increasing attention because it can directly alter the natural flow regime and provide additional resilience to the variability of water availability yu et al 2019 investigated the impacts of three gorges reservoirs tgr on the downstream hydrological extremes and found that tgr s operation can lead to more severe downstream drought during the period from middle summer to middle winter rangecroft et al 2016 showed a positive effect of reservoirs in alleviating hd by reducing drought frequency duration and intensity though it was not evident for major multi year drought zhang et al 2014 highlighted that the reservoir functions have reduced the drought frequency but extended the duration however these previous efforts were mainly dedicated to quantifying the effects of reservoir regulation on hd characteristics with a focus on the difference between the river downstream and upstream hd how drought propagation from md to hd and the seasonality and event characteristics have been altered by the operation of reservoirs is still unclear this study aims to analyze the changing features of drought under the influence of intensifying reservoir operation and explore how the reservoir system alters drought propagation process from two aspects seasonality and event characteristics a novel framework is developed to examine the impacts of reservoir operation on drought propagation from upstream to downstream and from md to hd the results of this study can advance our understanding of the role of reservoirs in regulating drought propagation and thus greatly benefit drought diagnosis assessment and early warning 2 approaches 2 1 study area the daling river basin drb located in the drought prone region in northeast china is a typical high managed basin with a high intensity reservoir network it covers a drainage area of 23048 km2 40 42 n 118 121 e fig 1 it belongs to the arid area in north temperate with an obvious continental climate the annual average temperature is 7 8 8 9 and the annual average precipitation is 430 630 mm the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is extremely uneven the rainy season lasts from june to september accounting for 77 9 of annual precipitation the spatial distribution of precipitation shows a decreasing tendency from south to north due to the long sunshine duration the evaporation in drb is high the annual mean evaporation in chaoyang station is 1958 9 mm which is about 4 times of annual mean precipitation 474 14 mm according to the database of the hydrological bureau of liaoning province there are 44 reservoirs with a combined storage capacity of 6 6 billion m3 in the drb among them four are characterized as large reservoirs with a capacity large than 100 million m3 which are marked in fig 1 the characteristics of the four large reservoirs are summarized in table 1 these reservoirs play an important role in water management for flood control drought resistance irrigation water supply and hydropower generation it is worth noting that baishi reservoir which is the largest reservoir in the drb with a total storage capacity of 1645 106m3 25 of the combined storage capacity in the drb was built in 1995 but started operation in 2000 baishi reservoir is the main water regulating structure in the basin controlling a draining area of 17649 km2 77 of the drb the main purpose of baishi reservoir is to control flood and supply water for chaoyang city the inter annual variation of inflow outflow and storage percentage during its operational period is also presented in fig 1 the seasonal pattern of outflow was significantly altered by reservoir operation compared with inflow with a high flow season in july ahead of time for about 2 months the variation of storage followed the change of inflow and outflow which decreased during the dry periods and increased during the wet season 2 2 data and methods 2 2 1 data the monthly streamflow records from 1980 to 2017 of the 12 hydrological stations in the drb see fig 1 were obtained from the hydrological bureau of liaoning province the four main stations habaqi chaoyang yixian and linghai located in the mainstream were selected as representative stations the monthly inflow outflow and storage data of the four large reservoirs were also obtained besides monthly precipitation data from 1980 to 2017 at the 40 rain stations were collected from the meteorological bureau of liaoning province the average precipitation of the sub basins was calculated using the arithmetic mean of the rain stations located in the sub basins controlled by the four representative stations all the original data of the hydrological and meteorological stations passed the homogenization test 2 2 2 methods this study presented a simple framework to evaluate the impacts of reservoir operation on drought propagation based on the observed hydrometeorological variables which comprised four main steps fig 2 2 2 2 1 division of the natural and influence periods the monthly streamflow series were divided into two sub series based on change point detection and the corresponding study period was divided into a natural and disturbed period the streamflow series of the natural period is considered as a relatively stationary series that is only affected by climate change while the streamflow series of the disturbed period are influenced by both climate change and anthropogenic activities the change point was compared with the historical process of reservoir construction in the drb and the key reservoirs which altered the hd characteristics were determined the mann kendall noted as m k test was used to detect the change point of the hydrological variables the calculation details can refer to fathian et al 2014 and gerstengarbe and werner 1999 the intersection of uf and ub within the confidence interval indicates the beginning of a significant step change point 2 2 2 2 calculation of drought indices in this study the monthly precipitation and streamflow data were used to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi at different timescales 1 3 6 9 12 24 months the spi and ssi series were separated into natural and disturbed series according to the results of change point detection based on the m k test the spi thomas b mckee 1993 was used to characterize the md at different time scales using long term 30 years precipitation data different time scales of spi represent dry or wet conditions for different periods the short time scale of spi e g the one and three month scales of the spi were called spi1 and spi3 respectively better reflects the short term dry wet conditions while the long term time scale of spi e g spi12 spi24 describes the cumulative precipitation anomalies of a consecutive long period the ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 was employed to measure hd in this research because its calculation procedures are similar to those of spi a comparison was made between spi and ssi to investigate the propagation from md to hd the detailed calculation steps of spi and ssi were reported in thomas b mckee 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2011 a previous study reported that the pearson type iii distribution fitted the long term precipitation and streamflow data well at different time scales in northeastern china li et al 2014 hence the multiple timescales of spi and ssi i e 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month were calculated using the pearson type iii distribution based on the monthly precipitation and streamflow records from 1980 to 2017 2 2 2 3 comparison of drought characteristics between the natural and disturbed periods the comparison was conducted based on the spi ssi series during the natural and disturbed periods through correlation analysis and frequency analysis to reveal the seasonal and multi time scale propagation characteristics the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was employed to determine the correlation between spi and ssi at different timescales li et al 2020 the pcc value ranges from 1 to 1 positive pcc indicates a positive correlation and vice versa the greater the absolute value of pcc the stronger the correlation is da silva et al 2016 2 2 2 4 determination of reservoir impacts on drought propagation the impacts of the key reservoirs on drought propagation from upstream to downstream and from md to hd were evaluated by calculating the percentage change between the natural disturbed and standalone reservoir regulated scenarios the impacts analysis was conducted from two perspectives drought events characteristics extracted by run theory and seasonal characteristics represented by average monthly spi3 ssi3 the reservoir operation affects the drought propagation from upstream to downstream and from md to hd to quantify the impacts from these two perspectives the percentage changes from downstream to upstream and from hd to md were calculated we designed a simple algorithm to separate the impacts of reservoir operation as follows the natural difference between the md and hd relative to the key reservoir was quantified during the natural period identified by the change point detection and the corresponding results represent the natural propagation from md to hd this percentage change is expected as a natural value without reservoir operation for the disturbed period the percentage change of hd relative to md was calculated as follows md h d ssi s p i s p i 100 the disturbed difference during the disturbed period was quantified using the same formula and the result represents the actual change of the disturbed period this change consists of the natural part and the reservoir regulated part from md to hd the natural difference natural and the disturbed difference disturbed were compared to generate the standalone reservoir regulated percentage change from md to hd during the disturbed period reservoir r e g u l a t e d disturbed natural natural 100 the above is the calculation steps of the impacts on propagation from md to hd the reservoir impacts on propagation from upstream to downstream can be obtained similarly based on the comparison of upstream and downstream ssi series considering that there is no obvious change in meteorological variables i g precipitation and temperature the algorithm above does not take the impacts of climate change into consideration meteorological variables analysis can be found in supplementary materials in other words the differences between the natural and disturbed periods are recognized as the effects of reservoir operation to quantify reservoir impacts on drought characteristics the frequency of drought events the mean and maximum value of drought duration and severity during the natural and disturbed period were calculated based on the run theory yevjevich 1969 and a fixed drought threshold 0 5 run theory is an approach used for the extraction of drought events and their characteristics the negative run in which the drought index remains below a truncation level is considered as a drought event the duration of a drought event was defined as the period during which the drought index remains below the pre set drought threshold the severity is the accumulated magnitude of the drought index during the duration the characteristics of md and hd events were extracted based on the spi and ssi series respectively besides the monthly mean spi and ssi were calculated to reflect the seasonal characteristics of drought 3 results 3 1 to separate the natural and disturbed periods fig 3 shows the trend and change point in the monthly streamflow of the four main hydrological stations located in the mainstream of drb the streamflow into the outlet of the drb linghai station has decreased significantly at a speed of 0 57 m3 s yr 1 from 1980 to 2017 the m k test showed that the intersection of uf and ub curves occurred in 2006 at 0 05 significance level similar results were obtained from the other three main stations with an obvious change point detected between 2003 and 2007 among the four stations the sudden changes of streamflow in chaoyang and linghai were more pronounced the intersection of uf and ub within the confidence lines the variations in monthly streamflow of the upstream habaqi midstream chaoyang and yixian and downstream linghai indicated that a remarkable and dramatic change has occurred in the drb which greatly increased the decay rate of streamflow since the change points of different stations varied from 2003 and 2007 a relatively natural period from 1980 to 2003 before reservoir regulation period and the disturbed period from 2007 to 2017 after reservoir regulation period over the drb were defined in this case besides the change point analysis for streamflow the abrupt analysis of precipitation and temperature was also conducted no significant abrupt was detected from the precipitation and temperature series the trend of meteorological variables showed almost no change before and after the reservoir regulation period indicating that the climate drivers maybe not the main reason for abrupt of streamflow see detailed results in the supplementary materials the streamflow turned to attenuation and the change point occurred several years after the start operation of baishi reservoir 2000 the occurrence of streamflow record abrupt change is well consistent with the emergence of baishi reservoir which is the largest human activity project in the drb moreover the streamflow of the upstream station chaoyang station was consistent with the inflow of baishi reservoir while the streamflow of the downstream station yixian station was consistent with the release flow of the reservoir see supplementary materials which indicated the spatial mutation of the hydrological process these analyses suggest that the regulation of baishi reservoir is the dominant factor that significantly altering the streamflow characteristics in comparison with other anthropogenic factors e g urbanization water supply etc therefore baishi reservoir was selected as the representative reservoir for the following reservoir impacts analysis 3 2 comparison analysis between md and hd characteristics during the natural and disturbed periods the cumulative distribution frequency of spi3 and ssi3 at the four main stations during the natural and disturbed periods are plotted in fig 4 overall the frequency distributions of spi stayed stable from the natural to the disturbed period in the four stations for the upstream habaqi and chaoyang stations the spi frequency curve during the natural period showed low values 4 3 while the spi during the disturbed period was higher without the low values that implied the remission of md after 2007 at the upstream of the drb for the downstream yixian and linghai stations the spi frequency basically stayed the same during the natural and disturbed periods compared with spi the ssi frequency differed significantly before and after the change point during the natural period the ssi frequency was lower than the spi frequency at all stations especially for the value range of 1 1 during the disturbed period however the ssi frequency increased significantly compared with the spi frequency ranging from 2 to 0 indicating the obvious intensification of hd under the impacts of human activity different from the upstream station a low ssi value of 4 3 i e extreme hd was detected at the downstream stations yixian and linghai suggesting more severe hd than upstream which indicated the reservoir increased the extreme hd frequency in the downstream the comparison of spi and ssi during the two periods suggested that human activities aggravated hd the frequency variation of spi depended on the evolution of precipitation from the natural to the disturbed period which represented the impacts of climate change on drought jenkins and warren 2015 consistent with precipitation abrupt analysis see supplementary materials the frequency curve of ssi was influenced by both climate change and human activity the different changing patterns between md and hd frequency during the two periods implied that the impacts of climate change on drought were weak while the influence of human activity on drought was substantial the results of the intra annual pcc between the spi and ssi time series at different timescales 1 3 6 9 12 24 month during the two periods are given in fig 5 the x axis represents the different intra annual months january february december while the y axis represents the multiple timescales of spi ssi the colored bar represents the pcc between the spi and ssi where red indicates a higher pcc and green indicates a lower pcc the up down arrows represent an increase decrease in the pcc values during the disturbed period compared to the natural period the pcc between the spi and ssi during the natural period showed a pronounced seasonal pattern higher pcc 0 7 was observed at short timescales 1 and 3 month from june to september while at long timescales 12 and 24 month higher pcc occurred almost all year round comparing the disturbed period with the natural period showed a decrease of the short timescale pcc 1 3 6 month timescale during the wet season may to september and an increase during the dry season october to april especially at the linghai station outlet of the drb that was reasonable since the reservoir usually reduced or stopped releasing water to protect downstream areas from flooding during the flood season may to september which can significantly affect the short time correlation between atmosphere and surface wu et al 2018 as for the long timescale pcc 12 24 month timescale a decrease was observed all year round at the four stations in general the correlations between the spi and ssi in the drb have decreased significantly especially at the 1 and 3 month scale during the wet season therefore only the spi3 ssi3 results were presented in the following sections comparing the correlation coefficients between chaoyang station and yixian station the influence of baishi reservoir on the correlation between md and hd can be inferred during the natural period the correlation patterns of the two stations are similar for the disturbed period the correlation pattern in the yixian station saw a significant decrease at 9 12 and 24 month timescale during january to june compared with that of chaoyang station that reveals baishi reservoir decreased the correlation of downstream between md and hd at a long timescale and in the dry season 3 3 quantifying reservoir operation influence on drought propagation 3 3 1 drought propagation process under the impacts of reservoir based on previous analysis baishi reservoir was selected for further investigations of the reservoir impacts on drought propagation the spi and ssi series at yixian station downstream of baishi reservoir representing md and hd are illustrated in fig 6 a baishi reservoir started operation in 2000 which was marked on the x axis the drought events identified by the fixed threshold were also shown consistent with the results in fig 4 the variations of spi3 before and after 2000 were steady and the number of md events almost remained the same however the ssi3 showed a decreasing trend after 2000 the number of hd events significantly increased baishi reservoir reduced the ssi values aggravated hd and altered the relationship between md and hd on the other hand the hd based on ssi3 propagation from upstream chaoyang station to downstream yixian station of baishi reservoir is also shown in fig 6 b before 2000 the upstream and downstream ssi matched well with several drought events occurring at the same time after 2000 drought became worse at both the upstream and downstream stations however the drought events which occurred at the same time showed inconsistent patterns in terms of duration and severity three drought events during 2011 2015 occurred only downstream due to the impacts of reservoir impoundment 3 3 2 influence on seasonal characteristics reservoir impacts on drought were quantified based on the percentage change under different conditions the percentage changes of multi year monthly average ssi3 from upstream chaoyang to downstream yixian under the pre defined three conditions are shown in fig 7 a the changes based on the natural data showed a relatively balanced distribution which was relatively lower in the wet season march to august but higher in the dry season september to february in contrast the monthly percentage changes under the disturbed condition saw an increase in the wet season may to july and a decrease in the dry season november april the reservoir effects lead to a seasonal change direction from the natural to the disturbed condition by aggravating summer and autumn hd and extenuating winter and spring hd downstream the maximum percentage change 229 occurred in december while the minimum 455 occurred in june since the major purpose of baishi reservoir is flood control baishi reservoir generally diminished the natural seasonal variability of the flow regime by reducing the high flow during the flooding season in summer and increasing the low flow during the dry season in winter thereby the downstream drought intensity has amplified in summer and autumn but decreased in winter and spring the percentage changes of multi year monthly average spi3 ssi3 representing drought propagation from md to hd under three conditions are shown in fig 7 b the percentage changes during the natural period showed a significantly high value in april and november one month before and after the flood season may to october under the reservoir impacts the percentage change turned negative in april and november and became non significant in other months it is noted that the significant low percentage change in april and november coincided with the transition time of reservoir operation rules from water storage to release see fig 1 the results indicated that the seasonal pattern of md hd propagation was highly influenced when the reservoir started releasing water particularly the negative value of standalone reservoir regulated change from october to november indicated that drought in late autumn was greatly aggravated due to the storage of coming water in summer and autumn compared with fig 7 a the seasonal characteristics of md hd propagation were weaker than that of up downstream propagation indicating that the reservoir mainly changed the up downstream drought propagation 3 3 3 influence on drought event characteristics to further investigate the reservoir influence on drought events the run theory was used to extract drought events and the associated characteristics duration and severity were estimated during the natural and disturbed periods the percentage changes in the three conditions were calculated to explore the impacts of baishi reservoir the results table 2 showed that the number of drought events duration and severity were all reduced from upstream to downstream during the disturbed period the percentage change of all indices turned positive which indicated a deteriorating trend of hd from upstream to downstream the most significant change was the maximum duration which changed from 50 0 to 81 0 the change from negative to positive from natural to disturbed period resulted in a high value of standalone reservoir regulated percentage change indicating the strong drought aggravating effect of the reservoir the percentage changes of the event characteristics of hd to md are listed in table 3 all the five indices related to the pre set characteristics showed a negative percentage change 77 2 to 36 4 under the natural condition it can be explained by the buffering effect of the land surface which reduced the drought events by merging several md events into one hd event 58 6 change of the no of events per decade during the disturbed period except for the no of events per decade 42 3 the percentage changes saw a positive value 2 2 to 442 9 comparing droughts between the disturbed and natural periods the standalone reservoir regulated percentage changes saw significant high values of almost all indices this indicated that baishi reservoir reduced the buffering effect of land surface through reducing the supply of precipitation to runoff among all characteristics the most variable one was drought duration 636 8 for average and 897 1 for maximum and the reservoir operations lead to prolonged drought durations considering the seasonal change analysis above the possible reason was that the reservoir stored water in summer but released water in autumn and may thus advance the original autumn drought to summer 4 discussion the reservoirs decrease river connectivity and destroy the natural hydrological process which thereby influences drought propagation different operation modes of reservoirs during the drought period may have different influences on the propagation of hd to the downstream the existing reservoirs in the study area were built to increase the resiliency against the spatiotemporal variation of local water resources our assessment results confirmed that the reservoirs in the drb are able to reduce the variability of water resources throughout a year by displacing the excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season the main purpose of baishi reservoir is flood control and drought resistance and it stores water in the flood season and supplies water in the dry season hence the seasonal variation of hd downstream changed accordingly on the other hand baishi reservoir is a multi year regulation reservoir which stores upstream water during the rainy years to ensure industrial and domestic water safety during the dry years resulting in the exacerbation of hd downstream in a word if the reservoirs tend to increase the water reserves of drought season via decreasing the release during flood season the duration and severity of the hd downstream could be increased a similar pattern of management has been reported by lópez moreno et al 2009 and wu et al 2016 however different reservoir operating rules may lead to different alterations of drought characteristics for example wu et al 2018 found that the reservoir in the dongjiang river south of china reduced the duration and alleviated the severity of drought which is inconsistent with our results ma et al 2018 also found that the reservoir alleviated hd in the heihe river basin the possible reason for the inconsistent results is that the reservoir operation rules under drought conditions are different the management plans of the reservoir in the dongjiang river designed for drought regulation aim to ensure the industrial domestic and agricultural water use downstream during dry periods wu et al 2018 in contrast baishi reservoir increases the water reserves during the drought season to ensure the water supply of the chaoyang city which is located upstream of the reservoir in addition baishi reservoir intercepts a large number of water resources in wet years and this may be another reason for the increased drought duration and severity downstream therefore it is essential to take the different kinds of reservoir operation rules into consideration for drought analysis 5 conclusions this study presented a useful framework to examine the impacts of reservoir operation on multi scale drought propagation based on two standardized drought indices spi and ssi the drb located in the northwestern liaoning areas was used to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the methodology the conclusions can be summarized as follows the streamflow of the drb decreased significantly and obvious change points were detected between 2003 and 2007 hence the natural and disturbed periods were divided based on the change point the cumulative distribution frequency of ssi revealed an obvious intensification of hd under the impacts of intensive human activity the stable frequency distribution of spi indicated that human activities play a dominant role in the occurrence of hd the effects of reservoir operations on the correlation between the multi timescale md and hd decreased from the natural period to the disturbed period especially during the wet season the operation of a large reservoir had a significant influence on both up downstream and md hd propagation which increased the average percentage change of duration by 636 8 md hd and that of severity by 522 5 from upstream to downstream of the reservoir the average percentage change of duration and severity also increased by 174 3 and 164 0 respectively the reservoir disturbed the drought seasonality of the natural period which was indicated by the advance of drought events from autumn to summer and the aggravation of autumn drought the percentage change analysis of drought characteristics suggested a strong aggravating effect of reservoirs on drought which was highly related to the reservoir operation patterns under drought conditions overall the proposed framework enables us to gain a better understanding of the evolution of drought propagation under the influence of high intensity human activities especially reservoir operation however some limitations still need to pay attention to firstly this study focused on the impact of a single reservoir on drought propagation the effects of joint operation of cascade reservoirs on drought will be further investigated secondly this study excluded the influence of climate change on drought propagation in the drb through quantitative comparison while quantitative analysis for climate change impacts was not performed however climatic factors also play a role in drought propagation especially for areas that are significantly affected by the monsoon lin et al 2017 the assessment framework proposed in this paper is only applicable to areas where the impacts of climate change are weak for other areas the impacts of climate change on drought need to be separated in advance credit authorship contribution statement zikang xing data curation methodology software writing original

3923,human interventions hi are significantly affecting the land surface hydrological cycle and thus altering the occurrence of hydrological drought so far however how hi affect the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is still unclear in this study we proposed a quantitative diagnosis framework and assessed the impacts of hi on drought propagation across varying scales over the typical reservoir dominant daling river basin drb in china in which the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi were utilized to identify the meteorological drought md and hydrological drought hd respectively our results show that the in situ streamflow records were found with an evident turning point around 2003 coincident with the operation of the largest reservoir in drb under the influence of reservoir operation the hd frequency saw an obvious intensification and the correlations between md and hd exhibited a decreasing tendency especially during the wet season the seasonality of drought propagation changed significantly for both up downstream and md hd as indicated by the advance of drought events from autumn to summer and the aggravation of autumn drought the reservoir operation changed the hd events characteristics by increasing the drought duration and severity our results highlight the strong aggravating effect of reservoirs on drought propagation keywords drought propagation meteorological drought hydrological drought reservoir impacts standardized drought index 1 introduction drought is usually classified into three categories depending on the affected components meteorological drought referred to as md hereafter precipitation deficiency agricultural drought soil moisture deficiency and hydrological drought referred to as hd negative anomalies in surface and subsurface water mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 md is the starting of a drought event and develops quickly while hd is commonly caused by the continuation of md the transition of md to hd is called drought propagation due to the physical relationship between the atmosphere and the terrestrial hydrological cycle a close correlation is expected between the md and hd guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 understanding the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is of critical significance to timely capture drought evolutions and assess its associated impacts which will largely benefit accurate drought early warning and risk mitigation so far considerable efforts have been devoted to characterizing drought propagation and exploring its potential influence factors e g climatic conditions and catchment characteristics at regional scale apurv et al 2017 barker et al 2016 han et al 2019 huang et al 2016 van loon and laaha 2015 for instance van loon and laaha 2015 investigated the controls on drought propagation in australia and the results suggested the streamflow drought deficit is governed by a combination of meteorological forcing and physiographic catchment characteristics in which the storage in soils aquifers lakes etc is important han et al 2019 found the increased soil moisture is the main driving force to accelerate drought propagation from md to groundwater drought in the pearl river basin china consequently the terrestrial hydrological processes are highly influential on drought propagation however drought propagation in these previous studies was usually viewed as a natural phenomenon without consideration of human related water shortage in the past few decades human interventions hi have taken place at local or regional scales including land use and land cover change lucc water withdraws from surface water or groundwater for irrigation dams and reservoirs to control the timing of streamflow dong et al 2019 leng et al 2015 wada et al 2013 these hi are known to significantly impact water cycle and thus exacerbate or alleviate drought conditions leng et al 2015 veldkamp et al 2017 wada et al 2013 through altering key water cycle fields primarily streamflow across varying spatial and temporal scales such as between upstream and downstream areas to date the impacts of reservoir or reservoir system regulation on hd have attracted increasing attention because it can directly alter the natural flow regime and provide additional resilience to the variability of water availability yu et al 2019 investigated the impacts of three gorges reservoirs tgr on the downstream hydrological extremes and found that tgr s operation can lead to more severe downstream drought during the period from middle summer to middle winter rangecroft et al 2016 showed a positive effect of reservoirs in alleviating hd by reducing drought frequency duration and intensity though it was not evident for major multi year drought zhang et al 2014 highlighted that the reservoir functions have reduced the drought frequency but extended the duration however these previous efforts were mainly dedicated to quantifying the effects of reservoir regulation on hd characteristics with a focus on the difference between the river downstream and upstream hd how drought propagation from md to hd and the seasonality and event characteristics have been altered by the operation of reservoirs is still unclear this study aims to analyze the changing features of drought under the influence of intensifying reservoir operation and explore how the reservoir system alters drought propagation process from two aspects seasonality and event characteristics a novel framework is developed to examine the impacts of reservoir operation on drought propagation from upstream to downstream and from md to hd the results of this study can advance our understanding of the role of reservoirs in regulating drought propagation and thus greatly benefit drought diagnosis assessment and early warning 2 approaches 2 1 study area the daling river basin drb located in the drought prone region in northeast china is a typical high managed basin with a high intensity reservoir network it covers a drainage area of 23048 km2 40 42 n 118 121 e fig 1 it belongs to the arid area in north temperate with an obvious continental climate the annual average temperature is 7 8 8 9 and the annual average precipitation is 430 630 mm the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is extremely uneven the rainy season lasts from june to september accounting for 77 9 of annual precipitation the spatial distribution of precipitation shows a decreasing tendency from south to north due to the long sunshine duration the evaporation in drb is high the annual mean evaporation in chaoyang station is 1958 9 mm which is about 4 times of annual mean precipitation 474 14 mm according to the database of the hydrological bureau of liaoning province there are 44 reservoirs with a combined storage capacity of 6 6 billion m3 in the drb among them four are characterized as large reservoirs with a capacity large than 100 million m3 which are marked in fig 1 the characteristics of the four large reservoirs are summarized in table 1 these reservoirs play an important role in water management for flood control drought resistance irrigation water supply and hydropower generation it is worth noting that baishi reservoir which is the largest reservoir in the drb with a total storage capacity of 1645 106m3 25 of the combined storage capacity in the drb was built in 1995 but started operation in 2000 baishi reservoir is the main water regulating structure in the basin controlling a draining area of 17649 km2 77 of the drb the main purpose of baishi reservoir is to control flood and supply water for chaoyang city the inter annual variation of inflow outflow and storage percentage during its operational period is also presented in fig 1 the seasonal pattern of outflow was significantly altered by reservoir operation compared with inflow with a high flow season in july ahead of time for about 2 months the variation of storage followed the change of inflow and outflow which decreased during the dry periods and increased during the wet season 2 2 data and methods 2 2 1 data the monthly streamflow records from 1980 to 2017 of the 12 hydrological stations in the drb see fig 1 were obtained from the hydrological bureau of liaoning province the four main stations habaqi chaoyang yixian and linghai located in the mainstream were selected as representative stations the monthly inflow outflow and storage data of the four large reservoirs were also obtained besides monthly precipitation data from 1980 to 2017 at the 40 rain stations were collected from the meteorological bureau of liaoning province the average precipitation of the sub basins was calculated using the arithmetic mean of the rain stations located in the sub basins controlled by the four representative stations all the original data of the hydrological and meteorological stations passed the homogenization test 2 2 2 methods this study presented a simple framework to evaluate the impacts of reservoir operation on drought propagation based on the observed hydrometeorological variables which comprised four main steps fig 2 2 2 2 1 division of the natural and influence periods the monthly streamflow series were divided into two sub series based on change point detection and the corresponding study period was divided into a natural and disturbed period the streamflow series of the natural period is considered as a relatively stationary series that is only affected by climate change while the streamflow series of the disturbed period are influenced by both climate change and anthropogenic activities the change point was compared with the historical process of reservoir construction in the drb and the key reservoirs which altered the hd characteristics were determined the mann kendall noted as m k test was used to detect the change point of the hydrological variables the calculation details can refer to fathian et al 2014 and gerstengarbe and werner 1999 the intersection of uf and ub within the confidence interval indicates the beginning of a significant step change point 2 2 2 2 calculation of drought indices in this study the monthly precipitation and streamflow data were used to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi at different timescales 1 3 6 9 12 24 months the spi and ssi series were separated into natural and disturbed series according to the results of change point detection based on the m k test the spi thomas b mckee 1993 was used to characterize the md at different time scales using long term 30 years precipitation data different time scales of spi represent dry or wet conditions for different periods the short time scale of spi e g the one and three month scales of the spi were called spi1 and spi3 respectively better reflects the short term dry wet conditions while the long term time scale of spi e g spi12 spi24 describes the cumulative precipitation anomalies of a consecutive long period the ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 was employed to measure hd in this research because its calculation procedures are similar to those of spi a comparison was made between spi and ssi to investigate the propagation from md to hd the detailed calculation steps of spi and ssi were reported in thomas b mckee 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2011 a previous study reported that the pearson type iii distribution fitted the long term precipitation and streamflow data well at different time scales in northeastern china li et al 2014 hence the multiple timescales of spi and ssi i e 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month were calculated using the pearson type iii distribution based on the monthly precipitation and streamflow records from 1980 to 2017 2 2 2 3 comparison of drought characteristics between the natural and disturbed periods the comparison was conducted based on the spi ssi series during the natural and disturbed periods through correlation analysis and frequency analysis to reveal the seasonal and multi time scale propagation characteristics the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was employed to determine the correlation between spi and ssi at different timescales li et al 2020 the pcc value ranges from 1 to 1 positive pcc indicates a positive correlation and vice versa the greater the absolute value of pcc the stronger the correlation is da silva et al 2016 2 2 2 4 determination of reservoir impacts on drought propagation the impacts of the key reservoirs on drought propagation from upstream to downstream and from md to hd were evaluated by calculating the percentage change between the natural disturbed and standalone reservoir regulated scenarios the impacts analysis was conducted from two perspectives drought events characteristics extracted by run theory and seasonal characteristics represented by average monthly spi3 ssi3 the reservoir operation affects the drought propagation from upstream to downstream and from md to hd to quantify the impacts from these two perspectives the percentage changes from downstream to upstream and from hd to md were calculated we designed a simple algorithm to separate the impacts of reservoir operation as follows the natural difference between the md and hd relative to the key reservoir was quantified during the natural period identified by the change point detection and the corresponding results represent the natural propagation from md to hd this percentage change is expected as a natural value without reservoir operation for the disturbed period the percentage change of hd relative to md was calculated as follows md h d ssi s p i s p i 100 the disturbed difference during the disturbed period was quantified using the same formula and the result represents the actual change of the disturbed period this change consists of the natural part and the reservoir regulated part from md to hd the natural difference natural and the disturbed difference disturbed were compared to generate the standalone reservoir regulated percentage change from md to hd during the disturbed period reservoir r e g u l a t e d disturbed natural natural 100 the above is the calculation steps of the impacts on propagation from md to hd the reservoir impacts on propagation from upstream to downstream can be obtained similarly based on the comparison of upstream and downstream ssi series considering that there is no obvious change in meteorological variables i g precipitation and temperature the algorithm above does not take the impacts of climate change into consideration meteorological variables analysis can be found in supplementary materials in other words the differences between the natural and disturbed periods are recognized as the effects of reservoir operation to quantify reservoir impacts on drought characteristics the frequency of drought events the mean and maximum value of drought duration and severity during the natural and disturbed period were calculated based on the run theory yevjevich 1969 and a fixed drought threshold 0 5 run theory is an approach used for the extraction of drought events and their characteristics the negative run in which the drought index remains below a truncation level is considered as a drought event the duration of a drought event was defined as the period during which the drought index remains below the pre set drought threshold the severity is the accumulated magnitude of the drought index during the duration the characteristics of md and hd events were extracted based on the spi and ssi series respectively besides the monthly mean spi and ssi were calculated to reflect the seasonal characteristics of drought 3 results 3 1 to separate the natural and disturbed periods fig 3 shows the trend and change point in the monthly streamflow of the four main hydrological stations located in the mainstream of drb the streamflow into the outlet of the drb linghai station has decreased significantly at a speed of 0 57 m3 s yr 1 from 1980 to 2017 the m k test showed that the intersection of uf and ub curves occurred in 2006 at 0 05 significance level similar results were obtained from the other three main stations with an obvious change point detected between 2003 and 2007 among the four stations the sudden changes of streamflow in chaoyang and linghai were more pronounced the intersection of uf and ub within the confidence lines the variations in monthly streamflow of the upstream habaqi midstream chaoyang and yixian and downstream linghai indicated that a remarkable and dramatic change has occurred in the drb which greatly increased the decay rate of streamflow since the change points of different stations varied from 2003 and 2007 a relatively natural period from 1980 to 2003 before reservoir regulation period and the disturbed period from 2007 to 2017 after reservoir regulation period over the drb were defined in this case besides the change point analysis for streamflow the abrupt analysis of precipitation and temperature was also conducted no significant abrupt was detected from the precipitation and temperature series the trend of meteorological variables showed almost no change before and after the reservoir regulation period indicating that the climate drivers maybe not the main reason for abrupt of streamflow see detailed results in the supplementary materials the streamflow turned to attenuation and the change point occurred several years after the start operation of baishi reservoir 2000 the occurrence of streamflow record abrupt change is well consistent with the emergence of baishi reservoir which is the largest human activity project in the drb moreover the streamflow of the upstream station chaoyang station was consistent with the inflow of baishi reservoir while the streamflow of the downstream station yixian station was consistent with the release flow of the reservoir see supplementary materials which indicated the spatial mutation of the hydrological process these analyses suggest that the regulation of baishi reservoir is the dominant factor that significantly altering the streamflow characteristics in comparison with other anthropogenic factors e g urbanization water supply etc therefore baishi reservoir was selected as the representative reservoir for the following reservoir impacts analysis 3 2 comparison analysis between md and hd characteristics during the natural and disturbed periods the cumulative distribution frequency of spi3 and ssi3 at the four main stations during the natural and disturbed periods are plotted in fig 4 overall the frequency distributions of spi stayed stable from the natural to the disturbed period in the four stations for the upstream habaqi and chaoyang stations the spi frequency curve during the natural period showed low values 4 3 while the spi during the disturbed period was higher without the low values that implied the remission of md after 2007 at the upstream of the drb for the downstream yixian and linghai stations the spi frequency basically stayed the same during the natural and disturbed periods compared with spi the ssi frequency differed significantly before and after the change point during the natural period the ssi frequency was lower than the spi frequency at all stations especially for the value range of 1 1 during the disturbed period however the ssi frequency increased significantly compared with the spi frequency ranging from 2 to 0 indicating the obvious intensification of hd under the impacts of human activity different from the upstream station a low ssi value of 4 3 i e extreme hd was detected at the downstream stations yixian and linghai suggesting more severe hd than upstream which indicated the reservoir increased the extreme hd frequency in the downstream the comparison of spi and ssi during the two periods suggested that human activities aggravated hd the frequency variation of spi depended on the evolution of precipitation from the natural to the disturbed period which represented the impacts of climate change on drought jenkins and warren 2015 consistent with precipitation abrupt analysis see supplementary materials the frequency curve of ssi was influenced by both climate change and human activity the different changing patterns between md and hd frequency during the two periods implied that the impacts of climate change on drought were weak while the influence of human activity on drought was substantial the results of the intra annual pcc between the spi and ssi time series at different timescales 1 3 6 9 12 24 month during the two periods are given in fig 5 the x axis represents the different intra annual months january february december while the y axis represents the multiple timescales of spi ssi the colored bar represents the pcc between the spi and ssi where red indicates a higher pcc and green indicates a lower pcc the up down arrows represent an increase decrease in the pcc values during the disturbed period compared to the natural period the pcc between the spi and ssi during the natural period showed a pronounced seasonal pattern higher pcc 0 7 was observed at short timescales 1 and 3 month from june to september while at long timescales 12 and 24 month higher pcc occurred almost all year round comparing the disturbed period with the natural period showed a decrease of the short timescale pcc 1 3 6 month timescale during the wet season may to september and an increase during the dry season october to april especially at the linghai station outlet of the drb that was reasonable since the reservoir usually reduced or stopped releasing water to protect downstream areas from flooding during the flood season may to september which can significantly affect the short time correlation between atmosphere and surface wu et al 2018 as for the long timescale pcc 12 24 month timescale a decrease was observed all year round at the four stations in general the correlations between the spi and ssi in the drb have decreased significantly especially at the 1 and 3 month scale during the wet season therefore only the spi3 ssi3 results were presented in the following sections comparing the correlation coefficients between chaoyang station and yixian station the influence of baishi reservoir on the correlation between md and hd can be inferred during the natural period the correlation patterns of the two stations are similar for the disturbed period the correlation pattern in the yixian station saw a significant decrease at 9 12 and 24 month timescale during january to june compared with that of chaoyang station that reveals baishi reservoir decreased the correlation of downstream between md and hd at a long timescale and in the dry season 3 3 quantifying reservoir operation influence on drought propagation 3 3 1 drought propagation process under the impacts of reservoir based on previous analysis baishi reservoir was selected for further investigations of the reservoir impacts on drought propagation the spi and ssi series at yixian station downstream of baishi reservoir representing md and hd are illustrated in fig 6 a baishi reservoir started operation in 2000 which was marked on the x axis the drought events identified by the fixed threshold were also shown consistent with the results in fig 4 the variations of spi3 before and after 2000 were steady and the number of md events almost remained the same however the ssi3 showed a decreasing trend after 2000 the number of hd events significantly increased baishi reservoir reduced the ssi values aggravated hd and altered the relationship between md and hd on the other hand the hd based on ssi3 propagation from upstream chaoyang station to downstream yixian station of baishi reservoir is also shown in fig 6 b before 2000 the upstream and downstream ssi matched well with several drought events occurring at the same time after 2000 drought became worse at both the upstream and downstream stations however the drought events which occurred at the same time showed inconsistent patterns in terms of duration and severity three drought events during 2011 2015 occurred only downstream due to the impacts of reservoir impoundment 3 3 2 influence on seasonal characteristics reservoir impacts on drought were quantified based on the percentage change under different conditions the percentage changes of multi year monthly average ssi3 from upstream chaoyang to downstream yixian under the pre defined three conditions are shown in fig 7 a the changes based on the natural data showed a relatively balanced distribution which was relatively lower in the wet season march to august but higher in the dry season september to february in contrast the monthly percentage changes under the disturbed condition saw an increase in the wet season may to july and a decrease in the dry season november april the reservoir effects lead to a seasonal change direction from the natural to the disturbed condition by aggravating summer and autumn hd and extenuating winter and spring hd downstream the maximum percentage change 229 occurred in december while the minimum 455 occurred in june since the major purpose of baishi reservoir is flood control baishi reservoir generally diminished the natural seasonal variability of the flow regime by reducing the high flow during the flooding season in summer and increasing the low flow during the dry season in winter thereby the downstream drought intensity has amplified in summer and autumn but decreased in winter and spring the percentage changes of multi year monthly average spi3 ssi3 representing drought propagation from md to hd under three conditions are shown in fig 7 b the percentage changes during the natural period showed a significantly high value in april and november one month before and after the flood season may to october under the reservoir impacts the percentage change turned negative in april and november and became non significant in other months it is noted that the significant low percentage change in april and november coincided with the transition time of reservoir operation rules from water storage to release see fig 1 the results indicated that the seasonal pattern of md hd propagation was highly influenced when the reservoir started releasing water particularly the negative value of standalone reservoir regulated change from october to november indicated that drought in late autumn was greatly aggravated due to the storage of coming water in summer and autumn compared with fig 7 a the seasonal characteristics of md hd propagation were weaker than that of up downstream propagation indicating that the reservoir mainly changed the up downstream drought propagation 3 3 3 influence on drought event characteristics to further investigate the reservoir influence on drought events the run theory was used to extract drought events and the associated characteristics duration and severity were estimated during the natural and disturbed periods the percentage changes in the three conditions were calculated to explore the impacts of baishi reservoir the results table 2 showed that the number of drought events duration and severity were all reduced from upstream to downstream during the disturbed period the percentage change of all indices turned positive which indicated a deteriorating trend of hd from upstream to downstream the most significant change was the maximum duration which changed from 50 0 to 81 0 the change from negative to positive from natural to disturbed period resulted in a high value of standalone reservoir regulated percentage change indicating the strong drought aggravating effect of the reservoir the percentage changes of the event characteristics of hd to md are listed in table 3 all the five indices related to the pre set characteristics showed a negative percentage change 77 2 to 36 4 under the natural condition it can be explained by the buffering effect of the land surface which reduced the drought events by merging several md events into one hd event 58 6 change of the no of events per decade during the disturbed period except for the no of events per decade 42 3 the percentage changes saw a positive value 2 2 to 442 9 comparing droughts between the disturbed and natural periods the standalone reservoir regulated percentage changes saw significant high values of almost all indices this indicated that baishi reservoir reduced the buffering effect of land surface through reducing the supply of precipitation to runoff among all characteristics the most variable one was drought duration 636 8 for average and 897 1 for maximum and the reservoir operations lead to prolonged drought durations considering the seasonal change analysis above the possible reason was that the reservoir stored water in summer but released water in autumn and may thus advance the original autumn drought to summer 4 discussion the reservoirs decrease river connectivity and destroy the natural hydrological process which thereby influences drought propagation different operation modes of reservoirs during the drought period may have different influences on the propagation of hd to the downstream the existing reservoirs in the study area were built to increase the resiliency against the spatiotemporal variation of local water resources our assessment results confirmed that the reservoirs in the drb are able to reduce the variability of water resources throughout a year by displacing the excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season the main purpose of baishi reservoir is flood control and drought resistance and it stores water in the flood season and supplies water in the dry season hence the seasonal variation of hd downstream changed accordingly on the other hand baishi reservoir is a multi year regulation reservoir which stores upstream water during the rainy years to ensure industrial and domestic water safety during the dry years resulting in the exacerbation of hd downstream in a word if the reservoirs tend to increase the water reserves of drought season via decreasing the release during flood season the duration and severity of the hd downstream could be increased a similar pattern of management has been reported by lópez moreno et al 2009 and wu et al 2016 however different reservoir operating rules may lead to different alterations of drought characteristics for example wu et al 2018 found that the reservoir in the dongjiang river south of china reduced the duration and alleviated the severity of drought which is inconsistent with our results ma et al 2018 also found that the reservoir alleviated hd in the heihe river basin the possible reason for the inconsistent results is that the reservoir operation rules under drought conditions are different the management plans of the reservoir in the dongjiang river designed for drought regulation aim to ensure the industrial domestic and agricultural water use downstream during dry periods wu et al 2018 in contrast baishi reservoir increases the water reserves during the drought season to ensure the water supply of the chaoyang city which is located upstream of the reservoir in addition baishi reservoir intercepts a large number of water resources in wet years and this may be another reason for the increased drought duration and severity downstream therefore it is essential to take the different kinds of reservoir operation rules into consideration for drought analysis 5 conclusions this study presented a useful framework to examine the impacts of reservoir operation on multi scale drought propagation based on two standardized drought indices spi and ssi the drb located in the northwestern liaoning areas was used to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the methodology the conclusions can be summarized as follows the streamflow of the drb decreased significantly and obvious change points were detected between 2003 and 2007 hence the natural and disturbed periods were divided based on the change point the cumulative distribution frequency of ssi revealed an obvious intensification of hd under the impacts of intensive human activity the stable frequency distribution of spi indicated that human activities play a dominant role in the occurrence of hd the effects of reservoir operations on the correlation between the multi timescale md and hd decreased from the natural period to the disturbed period especially during the wet season the operation of a large reservoir had a significant influence on both up downstream and md hd propagation which increased the average percentage change of duration by 636 8 md hd and that of severity by 522 5 from upstream to downstream of the reservoir the average percentage change of duration and severity also increased by 174 3 and 164 0 respectively the reservoir disturbed the drought seasonality of the natural period which was indicated by the advance of drought events from autumn to summer and the aggravation of autumn drought the percentage change analysis of drought characteristics suggested a strong aggravating effect of reservoirs on drought which was highly related to the reservoir operation patterns under drought conditions overall the proposed framework enables us to gain a better understanding of the evolution of drought propagation under the influence of high intensity human activities especially reservoir operation however some limitations still need to pay attention to firstly this study focused on the impact of a single reservoir on drought propagation the effects of joint operation of cascade reservoirs on drought will be further investigated secondly this study excluded the influence of climate change on drought propagation in the drb through quantitative comparison while quantitative analysis for climate change impacts was not performed however climatic factors also play a role in drought propagation especially for areas that are significantly affected by the monsoon lin et al 2017 the assessment framework proposed in this paper is only applicable to areas where the impacts of climate change are weak for other areas the impacts of climate change on drought need to be separated in advance credit authorship contribution statement zikang xing data curation methodology software writing original

3924,this study explores the prevalence of fracture clustering in natural networks and its influence on fluid flow and advective transport fracture networks from a compilation of previously published maps that encompass igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rock types various geological and tectonic settings and a broad distribution of length scales are analyzed using a two point correlation technique to characterize the spatial scaling between fracture barycenters the correlation dimension dc ranges from 1 47 to 1 89 with a median of 1 8 these results suggest that fracture networks often exhibit spatial clustering and are rarely poissonian as commonly assumed synthetic discrete fracture networks dfns with constant and variable transmissivity applied to all fractures are generated for three clustering dc 1 6 dc 1 8 and poissonian and power law length exponent α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 scenarios median particle breakthrough times are shown to increase by 10 70 as spatial clustering transitions from poissonian to highly clustered dc 1 6 median particle breakthrough times also increase by a factor of 1 2 3 4 20 240 when the power law length exponent increases from α 1 4 to α 2 2 as clustering increases i e dc reduces breakthrough curves become highly variable and exhibit features indicative of enhanced solute retention the increase in median breakthrough times with clustering persists with different network size and transmissivity distribution these results indicate that spatial clustering and length exponent both significantly influence transport the use of power law length distributions in generating fracture networks is relatively common whereas the spatial organization of fractures is rarely included in transport studies of fractured rock structural heterogeneity introduced by spatially clustered organization of fractures leads to substantial complexity in flow paths which is not captured by poissonian dfns keywords fracture clustering multiplicative cascade process correlation dimension fractured rock network analysis 1 introduction accurate representation of the spatial distribution of fractures is essential for characterizing fractured media and proper generation of synthetic discrete fracture networks dfns perhaps the most common assumption used in the analysis and generation of fracture networks is that fracture spacing follows a negative exponential distribution also known as the poisson distribution baecher et al 1977 dershowitz and einstein 1988 ross 1985 the poisson distribution implies that a uniform distribution of inherent flaws or microcracks is present within a rock mass and the propagation of new fractures from these initial flaws initiates independently of preexisting fractures olson 2004 olson et al 2007 pollard and aydin 1988 segall and pollard 1983 numerical and analogue experiments suggest that conditions for a poissonian distribution of spacing are met in early stages of fracture development due to the low fracture density belfield 1998 gross et al 1995 rives et al 1992 the poisson spacing assumption originated from several studies concerned with measuring spacing between adjacent fractures along one dimensional 1d scanlines and fitting the spacing data to a probability distribution call et al 1976 einstein et al 1980 la pointe and hudson 1985 priest and hudson 1976 in all these studies it was found that a negative exponential distribution best described the spacing data consequently fracture spacing was assumed to follow a poisson distribution in 1d and this assumption was extrapolated to higher spatial dimensions i e two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d however some authors observed that a fit of 1d fracture spacing data to an exponential distribution is not a sufficient condition to conclude that facture locations are based on a poisson process einstein et al 1980 miller 1979 for instance a network consisting of evenly spaced clustered and randomly positioned fractures may also give rise to a negative exponential distribution hudson and priest 1979 furthermore a poisson process implies a homogeneous and isotropic medium which is less likely to be the case in natural rock masses fracture spacing can also be characterized by other distributions such as lognormal becker and gross 1996 bouroz 1990 pascal et al 1997 rouleau and gale 1985 sen and kazi 1984 steffen et al 1975 gamma castaing et al 1996 gross 1993 huang and angelier 1989 wong et al 2018 near constant gross 1993 ladeira and price 1981 narr and suppe 1991 power law belfield and sovich 1995 bour et al 2002 bour and davy 1999 reeves et al 2014 and normal huang and angelier 1989 ji and saruwatari 1998 the above mentioned distributions suggest that fracture locations may not commonly follow a poisson process rives et al 1992 found that lognormal and normal distributions are reproduced in numerical settings when mechanical interactions between fractures are considered fractures interact primarily through stress shadow zones gudmundsson 1987a 1987b hobbs 1967 olson 1993 pollard and segall 1987 renshaw and pollard 1994 wu and pollard 1995 the size and influence of the stress shadows are controlled by young s modulus and fracture height gross et al 1995 in the mechanical fracture interaction model of rives et al 1992 fracture spacing is poissonian in the early stages of fracture propagation as the fracture density increases the influence of stress shadows becomes more pronounced and yields a lognormal distribution likely due to asymmetric skewness in the distribution of spacing and ultimately a normal distribution at relatively high fracture density when the system is mature and fracture saturated the natural progression from poisson spacing in the early stages of fracture propagation to normal or gaussian spacing at higher fracture densities is consistent with levy s central limit theorem which states that an appropriately shifted and scaled sum of independent and identically distributed finite variance random deviates will converge in the limit to a standard normal distribution ross 1985 fracture saturation however is an extreme end member and very rarely observed in natural fractured rock masses formed by tectonic stress which are commonly found to be above the percolation threshold but at densities far from saturation barton 1995 renshaw 1997 this may be attributed to fluid pressure which is known to play a major role during fracture propagation fossen 2010 jaeger et al 2007 schultz 2019 renshaw 1997 suggested that once the percolation threshold is exceeded fluid flow can occur across the rock mass which limits the buildup of fluid pressure and subsequent fracture propagation numerical simulations have suggested that heterogeneous strain distributions give rise to power law spacing belfield 1998 cowie et al 1995 1993 such heterogeneous distributions of spacing can be derived from multiplicative cascade processes that were originally developed to describe the partitioning of energy loss in turbulent systems gaume et al 2007 pathirana and herath 2002 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 waymire and ossiander 2000 power law gamma and lognormal distributions all describe networks with predominantly close fracture spacing that contain subregions with relatively sparse fracturing these distributions therefore can be considered to represent various degrees of non poissonian fracture clustering it is noteworthy that a gamma probability distribution function is a convolution of exponential and power law functions and has properties of both the truncation of the largest values in a power law distribution which often occurs from censoring bias when measuring fracture attributes on the visible portion of an outcrop will result in a lognormal distribution thus fracture spacing described by gamma and lognormal distributions may also be indicative of power law scaling near constant spacing sometimes referred to as uniform spacing is an end member scenario that arises in stratified sedimentary rocks where lithology controlled layers act as separate mechanical units bai and pollard 2000 gross 1993 contrasts in mechanical properties of the different layers serve as barriers to fracture propagation and as a result fractures are often confined to the layer in which they originated soliva and benedicto 2005 when fractures are confined to a mechanical layer spacing becomes proportional to the layer thickness and can lead to fracture spacings in each layer that converge to a single value fractures are inherently 2d features embedded within a 3d rock volume and inferring fracture spatial correlation based on 1d analyses is an oversimplification the over reliance on 1d transects for characterization of fracture spacing and other fracture attributes can be attributed to the lack of well exposed rock outcrops of sufficient scale where fractures of all sizes can be mapped this combined with lack of vertical exposure for most rock outcrops and the ease of stochastically generating poissonian fracture networks has led to the wide adoption of the poisson point process to assign fracture locations in dfn studies andersson and dverstorp 1987 baghbanan and jing 2007 bour and davy 1997 cacas et al 1990 de dreuzy et al 2001 dershowitz et al 1991 klimczak et al 2010 lang et al 2014 long et al 1982 min et al 2004a reeves et al 2008a renshaw 1999 several studies that analyze fracture patterns based on 2d data however indicate that the spatial distribution of natural fractures is rarely poissonian ackermann and schlische 1997 belayneh et al 2009 gillespie et al 2001 1993 odling et al 1999 reeves et al 2014 sanderson and peacock 2019 yamaji and sato 2011 rather fracture patterns exhibit complex spatial organization that needs to be sufficiently replicated in site specific synthetic dfns the spatial organization of fracture networks is best analyzed using aerial photography of surface exposures e g barton 1995 odling 1997 odling et al 1999 ouillon et al 1996 and recent developments and application of unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology have made it possible to generate high resolution fracture maps that allow for more in depth study of fracture spatial organization akara et al 2020 hardebol and bertotti 2013 healy et al 2017 sanderson and nixon 2015 watkins et al 2015 several studies have investigated the influence of fracture attributes on flow and solute transport most notably the influence of the power law distribution of fracture length bour and davy 1997 de dreuzy et al 2001 klimczak et al 2010 reeves et al 2013 2008a 2008c renshaw 1999 these studies however all assumed a poisson distribution of fracture spacing bour and davy 1997 de dreuzy et al 2001 and renshaw 1999 suggest that network connectivity and permeability improve when the power law length exponent α is less than 2 this is attributed to the presence of longer fractures that increase the likelihood of forming well connected networks conversely higher power law exponent values α 2 reduce long range connectivity and network scale permeability due to the prevalence of shorter fractures that require a high number of intersections with other fractures to reach the percolation threshold reeves et al 2008b 2008c determined that power law length exponent values less than 2 lead to highly asymmetrical plumes with super fickian growth rates when the power law length exponent exceeds 2 solute plumes were found to exhibit near gaussian shape and concentration profiles with growth rates that are approximately fickian the effect of fracture spatial clustering on network connectivity and permeability has also been investigated darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 odling 1992 these studies indicate that network connectivity decreases as fractures become highly clustered particularly when shorter fractures are predominant highly clustered networks naturally contain regions of sparse fracturing and exhibit stronger degrees of flow channeling that are limited to areas where fractures are concentrated as opposed to poissonian networks with more evenly distributed spacing which in turn reduces network scale permeability although the effect of spatial clustering on network permeability has been investigated the effect of spatial clustering on solute transport remains unknown given that fractured rock masses are increasingly targeted for conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction hyman et al 2015 karra et al 2015 middleton et al 2015 co2 sequestration geothermal energy hofmann et al 2014 shi et al 2019 and radioactive waste disposal dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 krall et al 2020 martin and christiansson 2009 national research council 1996 reeves et al 2010 tsang et al 2005 it is critical to understand the effect of clustering on solute transport this study investigates the prevalence of spatial clustering in natural fracture networks and determines how spatial clustering and power law fracture length distributions influence network structure and solute transport in the first part of the paper a two point correlation technique is presented and applied to 18 previously published fracture maps results from these 18 maps are compiled with the results from 9 other maps to better support the case for spatial clustering in natural fracture networks and to define a reliable range of correlation dimension in the second part of the paper synthetic dfns are generated over a defined range of spatial clustering and length exponents to examine the combined influences of these parameters on ensemble transport of a conservative solute concluding remarks at the end provide a synthesis of the study findings 2 spatial organization of fractures 2 1 methods of measuring spatial organization and application to previous maps in this study the term spatial clustering refers to networks where fracture spacing is not an exponentially distributed variable as opposed to a poissonian network the spatial clustering of fractures indicates heterogeneous distributions of strain within a rock mass where distances between fracture barycenters are best described by a power law the presence and degree of spatial clustering of fractures can be both confirmed and quantified using a variant of the box counting agterberg et al 1996 giaquinta et al 1999 ouillon et al 1996 vignes adler et al 1991 method or a two point correlation approach akara et al 2020 bour 2002 bour and davy 1999 these two methods are theoretically equivalent however previous studies have shown that the two point correlation method is more efficient and performs better in discriminating between poissonian and spatially clustered networks bonnet et al 2001 bour 1997 for these reasons the two point correlation method is preferred in this study the two point correlation function describes the likelihood that two points belong to the same structure and is expressed as hentschel and procaccia 1983 1 c 2 r 2 n p r n n 1 where c2 r is the correlation function n p r is the number of pairs of fracture barycenters separated by a straight line distance less than r and n is the total number of points barycenters in practice fracture barycenters midpoints and the distance between pairs of barycenters are first computed then the correlation function c2 r is computed for different values of r the correlation dimension dc is determined by plotting c2 r as a function of r on dual logarithmic scale if the plot exhibits a linear trend fracture spacing is power law and the network is clustered darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 the slope of the power law trend represents the correlation dimension bonnet et al 2001 to our knowledge only 9 fracture maps in the literature have been analyzed using the two point correlation method akara et al 2020 bour et al 2002 bour and davy 1999 to better constrain the range of correlation dimension in natural networks 18 previously published fracture maps are analyzed in this study agterberg et al 1996 barton 1995 barton and hsieh 1989 bisdom et al 2016 giaquinta et al 1999 la pointe and hudson 1985 munier 2004 ouillon et al 1996 scott and bonk 1984 vignes adler et al 1991 watkins et al 2015 using the two point correlation method these maps are presented in the supplementary material although numerous fracture maps have been published these 18 maps are selected because the fractures could be readily digitized the number of fractures is sufficient for the two point correlation analysis and map dimensions are large enough to sample the fracture network across multiple spatial scales these networks all represent fractures observed on horizontal outcrops and bedding plane fractures are excluded from the analysis results from the 18 maps analyzed in this study are combined with the 9 previously analyzed fracture maps to form a compilation of 27 fracture maps table 1 2 2 spatial clustering analyses the 27 fracture maps encompass all rock types igneous metamorphic and sedimentary with length scales ranging from 9 m to 690 km the compilation includes sparse intermediate and relatively dense networks with 2d fracture density values defined as the sum of all fracture lengths normalized by total area ranging from less than 0 1 to 5 4 m m2 values of correlation dimension computed using the two point correlation method for the 27 maps compilation vary between 1 47 and 1 89 fig 1 with a median value of 1 80 correlation dimensions obtained from the largest scale networks some of which are mixed geology in the case of bour and davy 1999 and giaquinta et al 1999 are reliably consistent with the smaller scale networks the median value and the histogram shown in fig 2 suggest that correlation dimensions in natural networks are skewed towards the upper end of the range the range of 1 47 to 1 89 is remarkably consistent with the range of 1 45 to 2 0 based on a total of 11 maps also analyzed in this study reported by bonnet et al 2001 while the lower end members are consistent the main difference between the two ranges concerns the maximum value 1 89 vs 2 0 it is worth noting that the 2 0 value reported by bonnet et al 2001 is based on a box counting variant to better understand this we computed the correlation dimensions of the same maps from ouillon et al 1996 and obtained values of 1 80 and 1 82 table 1 thus the difference between the two ranges reflects the ability of the two point correlation method to more precisely discriminate between approximately poisson dc 2 0 and spatially clustered networks 1 47 dc 2 0 bour and davy 1999 davy et al 1990 the two point correlation method used in this study was tested using synthetic networks with fracture spacing generated by a poisson point process to verify that the algorithm indeed produces correlation dimensions of 2 0 a correlation dimension dc of 2 0 in theory implies a poissonian network formed within a homogeneous and isotropic medium when fracture propagation is uninfluenced by mechanical fracture interaction homogeneous and isotropic conditions are most closely approximated in igneous rock and correlation dimension values for those systems in our analysis agterberg et al 1996 akara et al 2020 barton 1995 giaquinta et al 1999 munier 2004 scott and bonk 1984 range between 1 47 and 1 88 thus the influence of mechanical fracture interaction which is likely ubiquitous during the propagation of natural rock fracture networks olson and pollard 1989 thomas and pollard 1993 likely plays a large role in the spatial organization of fractures this assertion is supported by odling 1992 where connectivity patterns between a natural network in sandstone and 10 site specific synthetic networks were compared the synthetic networks that assigned fracture location using a poisson process were found to be significantly less connected than the natural network even though the other fracture attributes such as distributions of orientation and length and values of spatial density were derived from the natural network furthermore the presence of heterogeneous distributions of mechanical properties found in many natural geologic systems introduces additional complexity in the propagation of rock fractures that decreases the likelihood for poissonian fracture spacing given this logic and results from the 27 detailed fracture network maps none of which exhibit poissonian spacing over a broad range of outcrop scale rock type and geologic setting we suggest that poissonian networks are likely the exception not the rule 3 influence of spatial clustering on solute transport numerical simulations are used to study the effect of spatial clustering on solute transport by comparing results between non clustered poissonian networks and clustered networks where dc is less than 2 discerning these differences would not be possible in the laboratory or field laboratory experiments would need to include at least three orders of magnitude to honor the power law distributions of fracture length and incorporate the necessary realism and network complexity very few field studies on solute transport have been conducted in fractured rock at large scales e g meigs and beauheim 2001 which makes it challenging to conduct in depth study of solute transport properties for this network type 3 1 discrete fracture network generation synthetic fracture networks are generated for three spatial clustering scenarios high clustering dc 1 6 the median of the 27 fracture maps dc 1 8 which describes moderate clustering and poissonian no clustering dc 2 0 that honor the range of correlation dimension observed for natural networks as presented in section 2 a multiplicative cascade process is used to generate moderately dc 1 8 and highly dc 1 6 clustered networks whereas a poisson point process ross 1985 is used to generate poissonian networks which are functionally equivalent to dc 2 0 in addition to the spatial clustering scenarios three power law length exponent α scenarios that encompass both finite variance and infinite variance length distributions are simulated α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 bonnet et al 2001 renshaw 1999 all other fracture network parameters controlling orientation density and aperture are held constant to facilitate direct comparisons of the effect of spatial clustering on resultant network scale solute transport given realistic distributions of fracture length a 2d dfn approach is intentionally selected due to the lack of vertical exposures for the analyzed fracture outcrops in the absence of vertical outcrop exposures the vertical spatial organization of the fracture networks remains unknown and remains a topic for further study borehole data unavailable at the mapped sites is often used to gain insight into the vertical distribution of fractures however most common stress field conditions lead to vertical or sub vertical fracture orientations heidbach et al 2016 zoback 1992 zoback et al 1989 that are not conducive for accurate characterization of spatial fracture organization in the vertical direction due to sampling bias terzaghi 1965 previous dfn investigations on spatial clustering and the influence of length distribution were also conducted in 2d akara et al 2020 baghbanan and jing 2007 bour and davy 1997 darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 2001 klimczak et al 2010 min et al 2004b reeves et al 2008a 2008c trullenque et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 except for reeves et al 2014 where spatial clustering in the horizontal plane was honored using a multiplicative cascade process and a poisson process was arbitrarily used to assign the vertical component of fracture location the 2d approach allows us to study the influence of spatial fracture clustering on solute transport without inferring fracture organization in the vertical direction previous studies have shown that 2d simulations underestimate network scale permeability due to the inherent difference between 3d and 2d network connectivity huang et al 2017 lang et al 2014 min et al 2004b this study is concerned with identifying relative differences in solute transport behavior given realistic ranges of correlation dimension obtained from horizontal outcrops and power law length exponent values thus the difference in transport behavior for 2d simulations will be applicable to 3d simulations comprised of vertical fractures for each scenario 100 networks are stochastically generated on a 50 m 50 m domain the network generation starts with assigning fracture locations the multiplicative cascade process mcp is used to assign fracture location darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 the mcp is an iterative process that fragments a given shape into smaller pieces according to some geometrical rules at the first iteration the initial domain 50 m 50 m is subdivided into four equal boxes probabilities pi are randomly assigned to these four boxes such that 2 i 1 n p i 2 1 l dc 1 where n is the number of boxes pi is the probability of each box l is the ratio of sub domain side length to domain side length and dc is the two point correlation dimension the correlation dimension is used in eq 2 to reproduce different spatial clustering scenarios these initial boxes are further subdivided into four boxes at each subsequent iteration and the final probability of each box is the product of the parent probability and daughter probability the process is repeated 7 times and the resultant probability map is used to derive a cumulative sum probability vector c although the multiplicative cascade process can be iterated at infinity darcel et al 2003 found that less than 9 iterations is needed for spatial clustering to emerge in our experience the singularities in the probability map become apparent at the end of the 7th iteration fracture locations are then assigned by first generating random uniform numbers ui corresponding to the numbers of fractures needed each random number ui is then matched to the corresponding value cj of the cumulative sum probability vector based on the following condition 3 c j 1 u i c j for each ui the coordinates of the corresponding cj is taken as the fracture location fracture length is modeled following a power law distribution 4 f l 1 l m i n α l α where f l is the cumulative distribution function l min is the lower power law cutoff and α is the power law exponent three different power law exponents are considered α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 as α increases the probability of generating large fractures decreases length variates according to eq 4 are randomly assigned to each fracture fracture orientation is simulated using the von mises distribution which is the equivalent of a normal distribution for spherical data fisher 1993 the von mises probability density function is given by 5 f θ μ κ e κ c o s θ μ 2 π i 0 κ where θ is the deviation of the fracture pole orientation from the mean orienation i 0 κ is the modified bessel function of order zero μ is the mean direction and κ is an inverse measure of the dispersion around the mean two orthogonal fracture set orientations are used to promote fracture connectivity once geometrical properties location length and orientation are assigned fractures are added to the 50 m 50 m domain until a fractal dimesion d of 1 6 is achieved akara 2020 the value of d 1 6 is used because it is within the range of 1 32 1 7 found by barton 1995 and to ensure percolating networks the fractal dimension is preferrred as a measure of density because it is scale invariant the fractal dimension of 1 6 is maintained constant for the three power law exponent scenarios thus the number of fractures per network is adjusted for the three power law exponent scenarios the number of fractures for α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 is 1400 1700 and 2100 respectively a fracture transmissivity of 1 10 4 m2 s is assigned to each fracture by holding transmissivity fractal dimension d and orientation constant any change in transport behavior can be directly attributed to clustering and or power law length exponents table 2 provides details about the fracture network characteristics and examples of synthetic networks are illustrated in fig 3 solute transport in fractured rocks can be influenced by numerous geometrical factors hence additional scenarios are generated to investigate if the effect of spatial clustering on transport persists with different network sizes and transmissivity distribution networks with transmissivity values derived from a lognormal distribution mean 1 10 4 m2 s variance 0 5 are generated for a power law length of α 1 4 and three clustering scenarios dc 1 6 dc 1 8 and dc 2 0 the effect of network size is investigated using three domain sizes 40 m 40 m 50 m 50 m and 60 m 60 m a power law length exponent of α 1 8 corresponding to 1400 fractures is maintained for the three domain sizes network densities of the three domain sizes 40 m 40 m 50 m 50 m and 60 m 60 m are 1 52 m m2 2 2 m m2 and 3 43 m m2 respectively 3 2 simulation of flow and transport prior to simulating transport the velocity distribution through the network is needed this is accomplished by computing the head distribution at all interior nodes within the network first the hydraulic backbone for each network is derived by filtering out fracture segments that have at least one endpoint not connected to any other internal node nodes are located at the intersection points between fractures and a segment represents the portion of a fracture between two nodes hydraulic head distribution at internal nodes within the fracture network is solved by combining darcy s law 6 q t b h with the conservation of mass principle at all internal nodes where q is the fluid flux in m s t is the transmissivity of the fracture in m2 s h is the hydraulic gradient and b is the hydraulic aperture in m combining eq 7 with the conservation of mass principle at all internal nodes leads to a set of linear algebraic equations where the hydraulic head is the only unknown the minimal residual method minres a variant of the conjugate gradient method is used to solve these equations parashar and reeves 2012 the above formulations can also be adapted to include sources or sinks i e pumping of injection wells in 2d dfns by directly incorporating an additional flow input or output at the desired internal nodes parashar and reeves 2017 boundary conditions consist of constant hydraulic head values on two opposite sides of the square domain and linearly varying hydraulic head values on the other two sides such that δh δy 0 2 and δh δx 0 note that the boundary condition promotes and open flow condition where flow is allowed through all four sides of the domain i e the model does not contain any no flow boundaries for fractures that intersect the model domain only the portion of fracture within the model domain is considered it is also assumed that fractures are fully saturated with incompressible fluid fluid flow occurs primarily through fractures and flow is steady state only advective transport of nonreactive conservative solutes is considered as local within fracture dispersion is minimal compared to the macro dispersivity induced by fracture network patterns reeves et al 2008c smith and schwartz 1984 breakthrough curves for conservative and non diffusing particles are obtained by releasing particles from a source zone close to the top upgradient boundary and tracking them from one internal node to the next in a lagrangian framework until each particle exits one of the downgradient boundaries particles travel purely via advection and spread of the breakthrough curves is solely attributed to the geometrical structure of the fracture networks the trajectory of any given particle in the 2d fracture network is controlled by the velocity within fracture segments for each network realization 10 000 particles are instantaneously released in a 5 m 5 m square located in the upstream region of the network slightly below the top face fig 4 due to the spatially discontinuous nature of fracture networks not every network contained segments of the hydraulic backbone in the source release area in cases where segments of the backbone are not present a replacement fracture network realization is generated until this condition is satisfied at nodes where more than one possible direction is available particles are randomly assigned direction based on the complete mixing approach 7 p s i q i i 1 n q i where p s i is the probability of particle entering a segment si qi is the flux in the segment and n is the number of segments at the fracture intersection the trajectory of particle at fracture intersections can also be assigned using the streamline routing approach although the choice of mixing approach can affect transverse spreading of particles it has negligible effect on longitudinal spreading kang et al 2015 park et al 2001 3 3 effect of correlation dimension and length exponent non parametric methods are intentionally used to evaluate ensemble solute transport behavior based on particle breakthroughs along model boundaries rather than analyzing and parameterizing the data to fit specific transport models used for fractured media such as the continuous time random walk berkowitz et al 2006 berkowitz and scher 1997 meerschaert and scheffler 2004 fractional advection dispersion equations reeves et al 2008c zhang et al 2009 and convolution integral forms of the advection dispersion equation cushman and ginn 1993 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 breakthrough times of the 10 000 particles across any of the downgradient faces are first derived from the numerical simulations and normalized by the radial distance from the source area to the exit boundary to account for the open flow boundary condition fig 4 8 nt bt rd where nt is the normalized time l t bt is the particle breakthrough time t and rd is the radial distance from the release source to the exit boundary l the normalized times are then used to generate cumulative distribution functions of particle breakthrough for each clustering and length scenario 100 dfn flow and transport simulations are performed for a total of 1 106 particles in the ensemble the median and interquartile range of specific quantiles q 0 01 q 0 16 q 0 84 and q 0 99 are computed for each scenario from the 100 realizations fig 5 these values are compared with other scenarios to quantify differences in transport behavior the quantile pair q 0 16 q 0 84 is used to describe the bulk movement of the plume whereas quantiles q 0 01 and q 0 99 represent the early and late time transport behavior respectively advective motion of particles within fracture networks is influenced by the network structure which combines the influence of network scale fluid flow and channeling behavior as well as the geometrical attributes of the fractures which influence particle direction and jump length given segment velocity sund et al 2021 reeves et al 2008b suggested that transport behavior within fracture networks is inherently pre ergodic and capturing all possible variations in network structure is likely not possible results from this study indicate that the number of realizations used for each scenario is sufficient to define and distinguish between trends in fluid flow and solute transport within the explored parameter space influences of the correlation dimension and length exponent on network scale transport are analyzed qualitatively from the shape of breakthrough curves and quantitatively using network properties such as global network scale flow average number of intersections per fracture and the median and interquartile range iqr of q 0 01 q 0 84 q 0 16 and q 0 99 of particle breakthroughs the iqr is used as a measure of inter realization variability of the 100 simulations because it is less influenced by extreme values table 3 lists average network scale water flow through the outgoing face for each correlation dimension dc and length exponent α scenario networks with the same length exponent but different correlation dimensions have similar flow values as indicated by coefficients of variation in the range of 2 to 11 thus when comparing transport behavior relative to clustering variations in network scale flow do not play a significant role and the transport behavior can be directly attributed to the degree of clustering and its effect on network structure networks with the same correlation dimension but different length exponent however produce flow values that are significantly different with coefficients of variation ranging from 34 to 45 this indicates that unlike spatial clustering length exponent exerts a significant influence on network scale fluid flow and therefore both fluid flow and network structure play a role when comparing transport results from networks with differing length exponents the results presented in this section focus mainly on three parts of the breakthrough curves early time q 0 01 the bulk of the plume taken as the difference between q 0 84 and q 0 16 and the late time q 0 99 these quantiles are used in this study in a non parametric manner however to provide a context for these metrics in the case of strictly gaussian breakthroughs the quantile range q 0 84 q 0 16 represents 2σ or q 0 50 σ and q 0 01 and q 0 99 are slightly less than q 0 50 3σ q 0 50 3σ is equal to 0 997 where σ is the standard deviation of plume breakthrough times at the downgradient model boundaries the quantiles q 0 05 and q 0 95 correspond to q 0 50 2σ and show similar trends as q 0 01 and q 0 99 but ultimately q 0 01 and q 0 99 are selected to represent extreme tail behavior ensemble distributions of early times q 0 01 bulk of the plume q 0 84 q 0 16 and late times q 0 99 show a consistent pattern of increasing breakthrough times as clustering increases from poissonian to intermediate clustering to highly clustered networks figs 6 8 the median of early times for networks with dc 1 6 and dc 1 8 increases by a factor of 1 1 1 7 10 70 relative to networks with dc 2 0 table 4 interestingly factors of 1 1 1 7 are also observed for the bulk of the plume and late time breakthroughs the same trend in median breakthrough time is observed with different network size and for networks where transmissivity is drawn from a lognormal distribution figs 9 and 10 the distribution of the 100 early times q 0 01 bulk of the plume q 0 84 q 0 16 and late time q 0 99 becomes more dispersed and asymmetric as clustering increases fig 6 the interquartile range iqr allows us to evaluate inter realization variability and changes in iqr with clustering are mostly consistent across all portions of the breakthrough curve table 5 for q 0 01 early time the ratio of the interquartile range for networks with dc 1 6 and dc 1 8 relative to dc 2 0 ranges from 1 5 to 2 9 50 190 the same ratio varies from 1 6 to 2 8 60 180 for q 0 84 q 0 16 and from 1 0 to 3 3 0 230 for q 0 99 variations in dfn structure due to clustering explain the observed increase in breakthrough times and iqr given the same length exponent the number of fracture intersections for dc 1 6 high clustering is greater than that of dc 2 0 possonian no clustering table 6 as an example for a power law exponent of 2 2 the number of intersections per fracture increases three fold from dc 2 0 to dc 1 6 in contrast particle tortuosity decreases as clustering decreases for α 1 4 and α 1 8 table 7 as the number of fracture intersection increases particles are more likely to encounter high velocity pathways which explain the reduction in tortuosity sherman et al 2020 in terms of network connectivity the increase in number of intersections enhances the likelihood of achieving percolation threshold especially in less dense networks akara et al 2020 reeves et al 2014 furthermore as clustering increases the dfn structure becomes more irregular with locally high fracture densities in some portions of the domain which leads to highly channelized flow and transport whereas other portions of the domain are mostly unfractured and disconnected from flow and transport processes in a high clustering scenario particles are more likely to sample a wider range of individual fracture segments and their associated orientation length and velocity the enhanced sampling of individual fracture segments generally increases the variability in breakthrough times and yields slower breakthrough times conversely for unclustered networks dc 2 0 particle pathways are less complex resulting in less sampling of fracture segments during particle migration towards the boundaries faster breakthrough times and less variability in particle breakthrough the increase in number of intersections as correlation dimension decreases also explains the increasing asymmetry of quantile q 0 01 q 0 84 q 0 16 and q 0 99 distributions this suggests that spatial clustering may be another factor that contributes to late time tails associated with solute retention becker and shapiro 2000 cvetkovic et al 2004 kosakowski 2004 meigs and beauheim 2001 similar to the correlation dimension variations in length exponent affect breakthrough times and the interquartile range using the same three categories early time bulk of the plume and late time the median and iqr for networks with α 2 2 and α 1 8 are compared to networks with α 1 4 median breakthrough times increase as the length exponent increases from α 1 4 to α 2 2 fig 7 for early time breakthroughs q 0 01 the ratio of the median for α 2 2 and α 1 8 relative to α 1 4 ranges from 1 2 to 2 1 table 4 ratios of 1 5 to 2 7 and 1 5 to 3 4 are obtained for the bulk of the plume q 0 84 q 0 16 and the late time q 0 99 respectively the dispersion around the median and the asymmetry of the breakthrough time distribution becomes more pronounced with increases in the length exponent the ratio of the iqr for α 2 2 and α 1 8 relative to α 1 4 ranges from 1 7 to 4 7 for early time table 5 this ratio increases markedly for the bulk of the plume 2 0 to 6 1 and the late time 1 8 to 9 7 overall these ratios suggest that length exerts a greater influence on advective transport compared to spatial clustering and this influence is more pronounced for later time breakthroughs i e solute retention these trends are consistent with the results of reeves et al 2008b where dramatic increases in mean breakthrough times were observed with increases in power law exponent due to shorter mean pathway length and increased tortuosity as the length exponent increases from 1 4 to 2 2 the probability of generating larger fractures significantly decreases and shorter fractures are more common to achieve the same space filling fractal density the number of fractures in a network with α 1 4 will be significantly less than the number of fractures in a network with α 2 2 for example the number of fractures required on average to maintain d 1 6 is approximately 1400 for α 1 4 and 2100 for α 2 2 as a result networks with α 2 2 have appreciably more fracture intersections that engender longer particle breakthrough times in addition as the length exponent increases the amount of global flow through the network diminishes table 3 note that this is a direct comparison where the only differences are because of geometric fracture attributes and resultant network structure as a constant transmissivity value is assigned to all fractures this reduction in flow at the network scale reduces velocities within individual fracture segments and slows the overall movement of particles the observed trends in median breakthrough time and interquartile range suggest that the length exponent exerts a greater influence on transport than spatial clustering however both spatial clustering and length exponent significantly influence transport and the addition of clustering to a network with power law distributions of length is essential for capturing the complexity of fluid and solute pathways in natural fractured rock systems 4 study limitations this study focuses primarily on the effects of spatial clustering and power law exponent on solute transport stochastic fracture networks based on the probability distributions of fracture geometrical orientation length and hydraulic transmissivity properties are used in this study due to the challenge of generating deterministic fracture models from limited outcrop exposure although stochastic networks are effective at studying fluid flow and transport in fractured rocks they are based on assumptions that often oversimplify the complexity of natural networks for instance fracture geometrical properties are assumed independent random variables and fractures are idealized as lines or planar discs in addition to these general assumptions other specific assumptions have been made regarding the synthetic dfns used in this study although other distributions lognormal and gamma have been used to describe non poissonian fracture spacing our analysis of 27 fracture maps the largest compiled in the literature indicate that each of these networks is best described by a power law in some scenarios fracture aperture is assumed constant to ensure that changes in transport behavior can be attributed solely to spatial clustering in natural networks however fracture apertures are often heterogeneous several studies becker and shapiro 2000 frampton et al 2019 kang et al 2020 makedonska et al 2016 pham et al 2021 sund et al 2021 found that inter fracture aperture heterogeneity can influence overall flow and transport by inducing preferential flow channeling which in turn can lead to early time arrivals similarly hyman et al 2016 found that aperture length correlation can lead to earlier breakthrough time scaling while some of the assumptions could influence the magnitude of the observed differences the study findings indicate that spatial clustering has a noticeable effect on solute transport and thus spatial clustering needs to be considered in dfn studies 5 conclusion the spatial organization of fractures serves a critical role in the geometry and structure of fracture networks the spatial correlation analyses and dfn simulations performed in this study provides a range of spatial correlation dimensions that can be used in generating synthetic dfns and advances the current understanding of how fracture spatial clustering influences solute transport these are significant contributions that are applicable to nearly all dfn studies and addresses an important knowledge gap the primary findings of the study are two point correlation dimension analyses of 27 fracture maps the broadest compilation in the literature yields correlation dimensions ranging from 1 47 to 1 89 with a median of 1 8 this analysis suggests that natural networks commonly exhibit spatial clustering of fractures and are rarely poissonian contrary to what is commonly assumed numerical simulations of advective particle transport show that spatial clustering and length exponent both exert significant impacts on solute breakthrough times and retention ensemble median breakthrough times increase by 10 70 as the spatial organization of fractures transitions from poissonian to highly clustered networks due to increased particle pathway complexity fracture clustering does not affect the amount of global flow for networks with the same power law exponent value particle breakthrough curves become highly variable as networks become more clustered as shown by 50 230 increase in the iqr as the spatial organization of fractures transitions from poissonian to highly clustered increasing power law length exponents from α 1 4 to α 2 2 results in 20 240 increase in the median breakthrough time the effect of the length exponent on breakthrough times is more pronounced because the global flow through the network diminishes with increasing length exponent similar to spatial clustering the variability of inter realization particle breakthroughs increases when the length exponent increases from α 1 4 to α 2 2 as evidenced by iqr which increases from 70 to 870 the above mentioned effects of spatial clustering on solute transport persist with different network sizes and for networks where transmissivity is drawn from a lognormal distribution these findings qualitatively and quantitatively define the influence of both spatial clustering and length exponent on network structure and resultant fluid flow and solute transport while length exponent exerts an overall greater control on fluid flow and transport than spatial clustering results from this study demonstrate that dfn studies need to honor the degree of spatial clustering observed in natural networks to reproduce the complexity of interconnected fracture

3924,this study explores the prevalence of fracture clustering in natural networks and its influence on fluid flow and advective transport fracture networks from a compilation of previously published maps that encompass igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rock types various geological and tectonic settings and a broad distribution of length scales are analyzed using a two point correlation technique to characterize the spatial scaling between fracture barycenters the correlation dimension dc ranges from 1 47 to 1 89 with a median of 1 8 these results suggest that fracture networks often exhibit spatial clustering and are rarely poissonian as commonly assumed synthetic discrete fracture networks dfns with constant and variable transmissivity applied to all fractures are generated for three clustering dc 1 6 dc 1 8 and poissonian and power law length exponent α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 scenarios median particle breakthrough times are shown to increase by 10 70 as spatial clustering transitions from poissonian to highly clustered dc 1 6 median particle breakthrough times also increase by a factor of 1 2 3 4 20 240 when the power law length exponent increases from α 1 4 to α 2 2 as clustering increases i e dc reduces breakthrough curves become highly variable and exhibit features indicative of enhanced solute retention the increase in median breakthrough times with clustering persists with different network size and transmissivity distribution these results indicate that spatial clustering and length exponent both significantly influence transport the use of power law length distributions in generating fracture networks is relatively common whereas the spatial organization of fractures is rarely included in transport studies of fractured rock structural heterogeneity introduced by spatially clustered organization of fractures leads to substantial complexity in flow paths which is not captured by poissonian dfns keywords fracture clustering multiplicative cascade process correlation dimension fractured rock network analysis 1 introduction accurate representation of the spatial distribution of fractures is essential for characterizing fractured media and proper generation of synthetic discrete fracture networks dfns perhaps the most common assumption used in the analysis and generation of fracture networks is that fracture spacing follows a negative exponential distribution also known as the poisson distribution baecher et al 1977 dershowitz and einstein 1988 ross 1985 the poisson distribution implies that a uniform distribution of inherent flaws or microcracks is present within a rock mass and the propagation of new fractures from these initial flaws initiates independently of preexisting fractures olson 2004 olson et al 2007 pollard and aydin 1988 segall and pollard 1983 numerical and analogue experiments suggest that conditions for a poissonian distribution of spacing are met in early stages of fracture development due to the low fracture density belfield 1998 gross et al 1995 rives et al 1992 the poisson spacing assumption originated from several studies concerned with measuring spacing between adjacent fractures along one dimensional 1d scanlines and fitting the spacing data to a probability distribution call et al 1976 einstein et al 1980 la pointe and hudson 1985 priest and hudson 1976 in all these studies it was found that a negative exponential distribution best described the spacing data consequently fracture spacing was assumed to follow a poisson distribution in 1d and this assumption was extrapolated to higher spatial dimensions i e two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d however some authors observed that a fit of 1d fracture spacing data to an exponential distribution is not a sufficient condition to conclude that facture locations are based on a poisson process einstein et al 1980 miller 1979 for instance a network consisting of evenly spaced clustered and randomly positioned fractures may also give rise to a negative exponential distribution hudson and priest 1979 furthermore a poisson process implies a homogeneous and isotropic medium which is less likely to be the case in natural rock masses fracture spacing can also be characterized by other distributions such as lognormal becker and gross 1996 bouroz 1990 pascal et al 1997 rouleau and gale 1985 sen and kazi 1984 steffen et al 1975 gamma castaing et al 1996 gross 1993 huang and angelier 1989 wong et al 2018 near constant gross 1993 ladeira and price 1981 narr and suppe 1991 power law belfield and sovich 1995 bour et al 2002 bour and davy 1999 reeves et al 2014 and normal huang and angelier 1989 ji and saruwatari 1998 the above mentioned distributions suggest that fracture locations may not commonly follow a poisson process rives et al 1992 found that lognormal and normal distributions are reproduced in numerical settings when mechanical interactions between fractures are considered fractures interact primarily through stress shadow zones gudmundsson 1987a 1987b hobbs 1967 olson 1993 pollard and segall 1987 renshaw and pollard 1994 wu and pollard 1995 the size and influence of the stress shadows are controlled by young s modulus and fracture height gross et al 1995 in the mechanical fracture interaction model of rives et al 1992 fracture spacing is poissonian in the early stages of fracture propagation as the fracture density increases the influence of stress shadows becomes more pronounced and yields a lognormal distribution likely due to asymmetric skewness in the distribution of spacing and ultimately a normal distribution at relatively high fracture density when the system is mature and fracture saturated the natural progression from poisson spacing in the early stages of fracture propagation to normal or gaussian spacing at higher fracture densities is consistent with levy s central limit theorem which states that an appropriately shifted and scaled sum of independent and identically distributed finite variance random deviates will converge in the limit to a standard normal distribution ross 1985 fracture saturation however is an extreme end member and very rarely observed in natural fractured rock masses formed by tectonic stress which are commonly found to be above the percolation threshold but at densities far from saturation barton 1995 renshaw 1997 this may be attributed to fluid pressure which is known to play a major role during fracture propagation fossen 2010 jaeger et al 2007 schultz 2019 renshaw 1997 suggested that once the percolation threshold is exceeded fluid flow can occur across the rock mass which limits the buildup of fluid pressure and subsequent fracture propagation numerical simulations have suggested that heterogeneous strain distributions give rise to power law spacing belfield 1998 cowie et al 1995 1993 such heterogeneous distributions of spacing can be derived from multiplicative cascade processes that were originally developed to describe the partitioning of energy loss in turbulent systems gaume et al 2007 pathirana and herath 2002 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 waymire and ossiander 2000 power law gamma and lognormal distributions all describe networks with predominantly close fracture spacing that contain subregions with relatively sparse fracturing these distributions therefore can be considered to represent various degrees of non poissonian fracture clustering it is noteworthy that a gamma probability distribution function is a convolution of exponential and power law functions and has properties of both the truncation of the largest values in a power law distribution which often occurs from censoring bias when measuring fracture attributes on the visible portion of an outcrop will result in a lognormal distribution thus fracture spacing described by gamma and lognormal distributions may also be indicative of power law scaling near constant spacing sometimes referred to as uniform spacing is an end member scenario that arises in stratified sedimentary rocks where lithology controlled layers act as separate mechanical units bai and pollard 2000 gross 1993 contrasts in mechanical properties of the different layers serve as barriers to fracture propagation and as a result fractures are often confined to the layer in which they originated soliva and benedicto 2005 when fractures are confined to a mechanical layer spacing becomes proportional to the layer thickness and can lead to fracture spacings in each layer that converge to a single value fractures are inherently 2d features embedded within a 3d rock volume and inferring fracture spatial correlation based on 1d analyses is an oversimplification the over reliance on 1d transects for characterization of fracture spacing and other fracture attributes can be attributed to the lack of well exposed rock outcrops of sufficient scale where fractures of all sizes can be mapped this combined with lack of vertical exposure for most rock outcrops and the ease of stochastically generating poissonian fracture networks has led to the wide adoption of the poisson point process to assign fracture locations in dfn studies andersson and dverstorp 1987 baghbanan and jing 2007 bour and davy 1997 cacas et al 1990 de dreuzy et al 2001 dershowitz et al 1991 klimczak et al 2010 lang et al 2014 long et al 1982 min et al 2004a reeves et al 2008a renshaw 1999 several studies that analyze fracture patterns based on 2d data however indicate that the spatial distribution of natural fractures is rarely poissonian ackermann and schlische 1997 belayneh et al 2009 gillespie et al 2001 1993 odling et al 1999 reeves et al 2014 sanderson and peacock 2019 yamaji and sato 2011 rather fracture patterns exhibit complex spatial organization that needs to be sufficiently replicated in site specific synthetic dfns the spatial organization of fracture networks is best analyzed using aerial photography of surface exposures e g barton 1995 odling 1997 odling et al 1999 ouillon et al 1996 and recent developments and application of unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology have made it possible to generate high resolution fracture maps that allow for more in depth study of fracture spatial organization akara et al 2020 hardebol and bertotti 2013 healy et al 2017 sanderson and nixon 2015 watkins et al 2015 several studies have investigated the influence of fracture attributes on flow and solute transport most notably the influence of the power law distribution of fracture length bour and davy 1997 de dreuzy et al 2001 klimczak et al 2010 reeves et al 2013 2008a 2008c renshaw 1999 these studies however all assumed a poisson distribution of fracture spacing bour and davy 1997 de dreuzy et al 2001 and renshaw 1999 suggest that network connectivity and permeability improve when the power law length exponent α is less than 2 this is attributed to the presence of longer fractures that increase the likelihood of forming well connected networks conversely higher power law exponent values α 2 reduce long range connectivity and network scale permeability due to the prevalence of shorter fractures that require a high number of intersections with other fractures to reach the percolation threshold reeves et al 2008b 2008c determined that power law length exponent values less than 2 lead to highly asymmetrical plumes with super fickian growth rates when the power law length exponent exceeds 2 solute plumes were found to exhibit near gaussian shape and concentration profiles with growth rates that are approximately fickian the effect of fracture spatial clustering on network connectivity and permeability has also been investigated darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 odling 1992 these studies indicate that network connectivity decreases as fractures become highly clustered particularly when shorter fractures are predominant highly clustered networks naturally contain regions of sparse fracturing and exhibit stronger degrees of flow channeling that are limited to areas where fractures are concentrated as opposed to poissonian networks with more evenly distributed spacing which in turn reduces network scale permeability although the effect of spatial clustering on network permeability has been investigated the effect of spatial clustering on solute transport remains unknown given that fractured rock masses are increasingly targeted for conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction hyman et al 2015 karra et al 2015 middleton et al 2015 co2 sequestration geothermal energy hofmann et al 2014 shi et al 2019 and radioactive waste disposal dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 krall et al 2020 martin and christiansson 2009 national research council 1996 reeves et al 2010 tsang et al 2005 it is critical to understand the effect of clustering on solute transport this study investigates the prevalence of spatial clustering in natural fracture networks and determines how spatial clustering and power law fracture length distributions influence network structure and solute transport in the first part of the paper a two point correlation technique is presented and applied to 18 previously published fracture maps results from these 18 maps are compiled with the results from 9 other maps to better support the case for spatial clustering in natural fracture networks and to define a reliable range of correlation dimension in the second part of the paper synthetic dfns are generated over a defined range of spatial clustering and length exponents to examine the combined influences of these parameters on ensemble transport of a conservative solute concluding remarks at the end provide a synthesis of the study findings 2 spatial organization of fractures 2 1 methods of measuring spatial organization and application to previous maps in this study the term spatial clustering refers to networks where fracture spacing is not an exponentially distributed variable as opposed to a poissonian network the spatial clustering of fractures indicates heterogeneous distributions of strain within a rock mass where distances between fracture barycenters are best described by a power law the presence and degree of spatial clustering of fractures can be both confirmed and quantified using a variant of the box counting agterberg et al 1996 giaquinta et al 1999 ouillon et al 1996 vignes adler et al 1991 method or a two point correlation approach akara et al 2020 bour 2002 bour and davy 1999 these two methods are theoretically equivalent however previous studies have shown that the two point correlation method is more efficient and performs better in discriminating between poissonian and spatially clustered networks bonnet et al 2001 bour 1997 for these reasons the two point correlation method is preferred in this study the two point correlation function describes the likelihood that two points belong to the same structure and is expressed as hentschel and procaccia 1983 1 c 2 r 2 n p r n n 1 where c2 r is the correlation function n p r is the number of pairs of fracture barycenters separated by a straight line distance less than r and n is the total number of points barycenters in practice fracture barycenters midpoints and the distance between pairs of barycenters are first computed then the correlation function c2 r is computed for different values of r the correlation dimension dc is determined by plotting c2 r as a function of r on dual logarithmic scale if the plot exhibits a linear trend fracture spacing is power law and the network is clustered darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 the slope of the power law trend represents the correlation dimension bonnet et al 2001 to our knowledge only 9 fracture maps in the literature have been analyzed using the two point correlation method akara et al 2020 bour et al 2002 bour and davy 1999 to better constrain the range of correlation dimension in natural networks 18 previously published fracture maps are analyzed in this study agterberg et al 1996 barton 1995 barton and hsieh 1989 bisdom et al 2016 giaquinta et al 1999 la pointe and hudson 1985 munier 2004 ouillon et al 1996 scott and bonk 1984 vignes adler et al 1991 watkins et al 2015 using the two point correlation method these maps are presented in the supplementary material although numerous fracture maps have been published these 18 maps are selected because the fractures could be readily digitized the number of fractures is sufficient for the two point correlation analysis and map dimensions are large enough to sample the fracture network across multiple spatial scales these networks all represent fractures observed on horizontal outcrops and bedding plane fractures are excluded from the analysis results from the 18 maps analyzed in this study are combined with the 9 previously analyzed fracture maps to form a compilation of 27 fracture maps table 1 2 2 spatial clustering analyses the 27 fracture maps encompass all rock types igneous metamorphic and sedimentary with length scales ranging from 9 m to 690 km the compilation includes sparse intermediate and relatively dense networks with 2d fracture density values defined as the sum of all fracture lengths normalized by total area ranging from less than 0 1 to 5 4 m m2 values of correlation dimension computed using the two point correlation method for the 27 maps compilation vary between 1 47 and 1 89 fig 1 with a median value of 1 80 correlation dimensions obtained from the largest scale networks some of which are mixed geology in the case of bour and davy 1999 and giaquinta et al 1999 are reliably consistent with the smaller scale networks the median value and the histogram shown in fig 2 suggest that correlation dimensions in natural networks are skewed towards the upper end of the range the range of 1 47 to 1 89 is remarkably consistent with the range of 1 45 to 2 0 based on a total of 11 maps also analyzed in this study reported by bonnet et al 2001 while the lower end members are consistent the main difference between the two ranges concerns the maximum value 1 89 vs 2 0 it is worth noting that the 2 0 value reported by bonnet et al 2001 is based on a box counting variant to better understand this we computed the correlation dimensions of the same maps from ouillon et al 1996 and obtained values of 1 80 and 1 82 table 1 thus the difference between the two ranges reflects the ability of the two point correlation method to more precisely discriminate between approximately poisson dc 2 0 and spatially clustered networks 1 47 dc 2 0 bour and davy 1999 davy et al 1990 the two point correlation method used in this study was tested using synthetic networks with fracture spacing generated by a poisson point process to verify that the algorithm indeed produces correlation dimensions of 2 0 a correlation dimension dc of 2 0 in theory implies a poissonian network formed within a homogeneous and isotropic medium when fracture propagation is uninfluenced by mechanical fracture interaction homogeneous and isotropic conditions are most closely approximated in igneous rock and correlation dimension values for those systems in our analysis agterberg et al 1996 akara et al 2020 barton 1995 giaquinta et al 1999 munier 2004 scott and bonk 1984 range between 1 47 and 1 88 thus the influence of mechanical fracture interaction which is likely ubiquitous during the propagation of natural rock fracture networks olson and pollard 1989 thomas and pollard 1993 likely plays a large role in the spatial organization of fractures this assertion is supported by odling 1992 where connectivity patterns between a natural network in sandstone and 10 site specific synthetic networks were compared the synthetic networks that assigned fracture location using a poisson process were found to be significantly less connected than the natural network even though the other fracture attributes such as distributions of orientation and length and values of spatial density were derived from the natural network furthermore the presence of heterogeneous distributions of mechanical properties found in many natural geologic systems introduces additional complexity in the propagation of rock fractures that decreases the likelihood for poissonian fracture spacing given this logic and results from the 27 detailed fracture network maps none of which exhibit poissonian spacing over a broad range of outcrop scale rock type and geologic setting we suggest that poissonian networks are likely the exception not the rule 3 influence of spatial clustering on solute transport numerical simulations are used to study the effect of spatial clustering on solute transport by comparing results between non clustered poissonian networks and clustered networks where dc is less than 2 discerning these differences would not be possible in the laboratory or field laboratory experiments would need to include at least three orders of magnitude to honor the power law distributions of fracture length and incorporate the necessary realism and network complexity very few field studies on solute transport have been conducted in fractured rock at large scales e g meigs and beauheim 2001 which makes it challenging to conduct in depth study of solute transport properties for this network type 3 1 discrete fracture network generation synthetic fracture networks are generated for three spatial clustering scenarios high clustering dc 1 6 the median of the 27 fracture maps dc 1 8 which describes moderate clustering and poissonian no clustering dc 2 0 that honor the range of correlation dimension observed for natural networks as presented in section 2 a multiplicative cascade process is used to generate moderately dc 1 8 and highly dc 1 6 clustered networks whereas a poisson point process ross 1985 is used to generate poissonian networks which are functionally equivalent to dc 2 0 in addition to the spatial clustering scenarios three power law length exponent α scenarios that encompass both finite variance and infinite variance length distributions are simulated α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 bonnet et al 2001 renshaw 1999 all other fracture network parameters controlling orientation density and aperture are held constant to facilitate direct comparisons of the effect of spatial clustering on resultant network scale solute transport given realistic distributions of fracture length a 2d dfn approach is intentionally selected due to the lack of vertical exposures for the analyzed fracture outcrops in the absence of vertical outcrop exposures the vertical spatial organization of the fracture networks remains unknown and remains a topic for further study borehole data unavailable at the mapped sites is often used to gain insight into the vertical distribution of fractures however most common stress field conditions lead to vertical or sub vertical fracture orientations heidbach et al 2016 zoback 1992 zoback et al 1989 that are not conducive for accurate characterization of spatial fracture organization in the vertical direction due to sampling bias terzaghi 1965 previous dfn investigations on spatial clustering and the influence of length distribution were also conducted in 2d akara et al 2020 baghbanan and jing 2007 bour and davy 1997 darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 2001 klimczak et al 2010 min et al 2004b reeves et al 2008a 2008c trullenque et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 except for reeves et al 2014 where spatial clustering in the horizontal plane was honored using a multiplicative cascade process and a poisson process was arbitrarily used to assign the vertical component of fracture location the 2d approach allows us to study the influence of spatial fracture clustering on solute transport without inferring fracture organization in the vertical direction previous studies have shown that 2d simulations underestimate network scale permeability due to the inherent difference between 3d and 2d network connectivity huang et al 2017 lang et al 2014 min et al 2004b this study is concerned with identifying relative differences in solute transport behavior given realistic ranges of correlation dimension obtained from horizontal outcrops and power law length exponent values thus the difference in transport behavior for 2d simulations will be applicable to 3d simulations comprised of vertical fractures for each scenario 100 networks are stochastically generated on a 50 m 50 m domain the network generation starts with assigning fracture locations the multiplicative cascade process mcp is used to assign fracture location darcel et al 2003 de dreuzy et al 2004 the mcp is an iterative process that fragments a given shape into smaller pieces according to some geometrical rules at the first iteration the initial domain 50 m 50 m is subdivided into four equal boxes probabilities pi are randomly assigned to these four boxes such that 2 i 1 n p i 2 1 l dc 1 where n is the number of boxes pi is the probability of each box l is the ratio of sub domain side length to domain side length and dc is the two point correlation dimension the correlation dimension is used in eq 2 to reproduce different spatial clustering scenarios these initial boxes are further subdivided into four boxes at each subsequent iteration and the final probability of each box is the product of the parent probability and daughter probability the process is repeated 7 times and the resultant probability map is used to derive a cumulative sum probability vector c although the multiplicative cascade process can be iterated at infinity darcel et al 2003 found that less than 9 iterations is needed for spatial clustering to emerge in our experience the singularities in the probability map become apparent at the end of the 7th iteration fracture locations are then assigned by first generating random uniform numbers ui corresponding to the numbers of fractures needed each random number ui is then matched to the corresponding value cj of the cumulative sum probability vector based on the following condition 3 c j 1 u i c j for each ui the coordinates of the corresponding cj is taken as the fracture location fracture length is modeled following a power law distribution 4 f l 1 l m i n α l α where f l is the cumulative distribution function l min is the lower power law cutoff and α is the power law exponent three different power law exponents are considered α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 as α increases the probability of generating large fractures decreases length variates according to eq 4 are randomly assigned to each fracture fracture orientation is simulated using the von mises distribution which is the equivalent of a normal distribution for spherical data fisher 1993 the von mises probability density function is given by 5 f θ μ κ e κ c o s θ μ 2 π i 0 κ where θ is the deviation of the fracture pole orientation from the mean orienation i 0 κ is the modified bessel function of order zero μ is the mean direction and κ is an inverse measure of the dispersion around the mean two orthogonal fracture set orientations are used to promote fracture connectivity once geometrical properties location length and orientation are assigned fractures are added to the 50 m 50 m domain until a fractal dimesion d of 1 6 is achieved akara 2020 the value of d 1 6 is used because it is within the range of 1 32 1 7 found by barton 1995 and to ensure percolating networks the fractal dimension is preferrred as a measure of density because it is scale invariant the fractal dimension of 1 6 is maintained constant for the three power law exponent scenarios thus the number of fractures per network is adjusted for the three power law exponent scenarios the number of fractures for α 1 4 α 1 8 and α 2 2 is 1400 1700 and 2100 respectively a fracture transmissivity of 1 10 4 m2 s is assigned to each fracture by holding transmissivity fractal dimension d and orientation constant any change in transport behavior can be directly attributed to clustering and or power law length exponents table 2 provides details about the fracture network characteristics and examples of synthetic networks are illustrated in fig 3 solute transport in fractured rocks can be influenced by numerous geometrical factors hence additional scenarios are generated to investigate if the effect of spatial clustering on transport persists with different network sizes and transmissivity distribution networks with transmissivity values derived from a lognormal distribution mean 1 10 4 m2 s variance 0 5 are generated for a power law length of α 1 4 and three clustering scenarios dc 1 6 dc 1 8 and dc 2 0 the effect of network size is investigated using three domain sizes 40 m 40 m 50 m 50 m and 60 m 60 m a power law length exponent of α 1 8 corresponding to 1400 fractures is maintained for the three domain sizes network densities of the three domain sizes 40 m 40 m 50 m 50 m and 60 m 60 m are 1 52 m m2 2 2 m m2 and 3 43 m m2 respectively 3 2 simulation of flow and transport prior to simulating transport the velocity distribution through the network is needed this is accomplished by computing the head distribution at all interior nodes within the network first the hydraulic backbone for each network is derived by filtering out fracture segments that have at least one endpoint not connected to any other internal node nodes are located at the intersection points between fractures and a segment represents the portion of a fracture between two nodes hydraulic head distribution at internal nodes within the fracture network is solved by combining darcy s law 6 q t b h with the conservation of mass principle at all internal nodes where q is the fluid flux in m s t is the transmissivity of the fracture in m2 s h is the hydraulic gradient and b is the hydraulic aperture in m combining eq 7 with the conservation of mass principle at all internal nodes leads to a set of linear algebraic equations where the hydraulic head is the only unknown the minimal residual method minres a variant of the conjugate gradient method is used to solve these equations parashar and reeves 2012 the above formulations can also be adapted to include sources or sinks i e pumping of injection wells in 2d dfns by directly incorporating an additional flow input or output at the desired internal nodes parashar and reeves 2017 boundary conditions consist of constant hydraulic head values on two opposite sides of the square domain and linearly varying hydraulic head values on the other two sides such that δh δy 0 2 and δh δx 0 note that the boundary condition promotes and open flow condition where flow is allowed through all four sides of the domain i e the model does not contain any no flow boundaries for fractures that intersect the model domain only the portion of fracture within the model domain is considered it is also assumed that fractures are fully saturated with incompressible fluid fluid flow occurs primarily through fractures and flow is steady state only advective transport of nonreactive conservative solutes is considered as local within fracture dispersion is minimal compared to the macro dispersivity induced by fracture network patterns reeves et al 2008c smith and schwartz 1984 breakthrough curves for conservative and non diffusing particles are obtained by releasing particles from a source zone close to the top upgradient boundary and tracking them from one internal node to the next in a lagrangian framework until each particle exits one of the downgradient boundaries particles travel purely via advection and spread of the breakthrough curves is solely attributed to the geometrical structure of the fracture networks the trajectory of any given particle in the 2d fracture network is controlled by the velocity within fracture segments for each network realization 10 000 particles are instantaneously released in a 5 m 5 m square located in the upstream region of the network slightly below the top face fig 4 due to the spatially discontinuous nature of fracture networks not every network contained segments of the hydraulic backbone in the source release area in cases where segments of the backbone are not present a replacement fracture network realization is generated until this condition is satisfied at nodes where more than one possible direction is available particles are randomly assigned direction based on the complete mixing approach 7 p s i q i i 1 n q i where p s i is the probability of particle entering a segment si qi is the flux in the segment and n is the number of segments at the fracture intersection the trajectory of particle at fracture intersections can also be assigned using the streamline routing approach although the choice of mixing approach can affect transverse spreading of particles it has negligible effect on longitudinal spreading kang et al 2015 park et al 2001 3 3 effect of correlation dimension and length exponent non parametric methods are intentionally used to evaluate ensemble solute transport behavior based on particle breakthroughs along model boundaries rather than analyzing and parameterizing the data to fit specific transport models used for fractured media such as the continuous time random walk berkowitz et al 2006 berkowitz and scher 1997 meerschaert and scheffler 2004 fractional advection dispersion equations reeves et al 2008c zhang et al 2009 and convolution integral forms of the advection dispersion equation cushman and ginn 1993 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 breakthrough times of the 10 000 particles across any of the downgradient faces are first derived from the numerical simulations and normalized by the radial distance from the source area to the exit boundary to account for the open flow boundary condition fig 4 8 nt bt rd where nt is the normalized time l t bt is the particle breakthrough time t and rd is the radial distance from the release source to the exit boundary l the normalized times are then used to generate cumulative distribution functions of particle breakthrough for each clustering and length scenario 100 dfn flow and transport simulations are performed for a total of 1 106 particles in the ensemble the median and interquartile range of specific quantiles q 0 01 q 0 16 q 0 84 and q 0 99 are computed for each scenario from the 100 realizations fig 5 these values are compared with other scenarios to quantify differences in transport behavior the quantile pair q 0 16 q 0 84 is used to describe the bulk movement of the plume whereas quantiles q 0 01 and q 0 99 represent the early and late time transport behavior respectively advective motion of particles within fracture networks is influenced by the network structure which combines the influence of network scale fluid flow and channeling behavior as well as the geometrical attributes of the fractures which influence particle direction and jump length given segment velocity sund et al 2021 reeves et al 2008b suggested that transport behavior within fracture networks is inherently pre ergodic and capturing all possible variations in network structure is likely not possible results from this study indicate that the number of realizations used for each scenario is sufficient to define and distinguish between trends in fluid flow and solute transport within the explored parameter space influences of the correlation dimension and length exponent on network scale transport are analyzed qualitatively from the shape of breakthrough curves and quantitatively using network properties such as global network scale flow average number of intersections per fracture and the median and interquartile range iqr of q 0 01 q 0 84 q 0 16 and q 0 99 of particle breakthroughs the iqr is used as a measure of inter realization variability of the 100 simulations because it is less influenced by extreme values table 3 lists average network scale water flow through the outgoing face for each correlation dimension dc and length exponent α scenario networks with the same length exponent but different correlation dimensions have similar flow values as indicated by coefficients of variation in the range of 2 to 11 thus when comparing transport behavior relative to clustering variations in network scale flow do not play a significant role and the transport behavior can be directly attributed to the degree of clustering and its effect on network structure networks with the same correlation dimension but different length exponent however produce flow values that are significantly different with coefficients of variation ranging from 34 to 45 this indicates that unlike spatial clustering length exponent exerts a significant influence on network scale fluid flow and therefore both fluid flow and network structure play a role when comparing transport results from networks with differing length exponents the results presented in this section focus mainly on three parts of the breakthrough curves early time q 0 01 the bulk of the plume taken as the difference between q 0 84 and q 0 16 and the late time q 0 99 these quantiles are used in this study in a non parametric manner however to provide a context for these metrics in the case of strictly gaussian breakthroughs the quantile range q 0 84 q 0 16 represents 2σ or q 0 50 σ and q 0 01 and q 0 99 are slightly less than q 0 50 3σ q 0 50 3σ is equal to 0 997 where σ is the standard deviation of plume breakthrough times at the downgradient model boundaries the quantiles q 0 05 and q 0 95 correspond to q 0 50 2σ and show similar trends as q 0 01 and q 0 99 but ultimately q 0 01 and q 0 99 are selected to represent extreme tail behavior ensemble distributions of early times q 0 01 bulk of the plume q 0 84 q 0 16 and late times q 0 99 show a consistent pattern of increasing breakthrough times as clustering increases from poissonian to intermediate clustering to highly clustered networks figs 6 8 the median of early times for networks with dc 1 6 and dc 1 8 increases by a factor of 1 1 1 7 10 70 relative to networks with dc 2 0 table 4 interestingly factors of 1 1 1 7 are also observed for the bulk of the plume and late time breakthroughs the same trend in median breakthrough time is observed with different network size and for networks where transmissivity is drawn from a lognormal distribution figs 9 and 10 the distribution of the 100 early times q 0 01 bulk of the plume q 0 84 q 0 16 and late time q 0 99 becomes more dispersed and asymmetric as clustering increases fig 6 the interquartile range iqr allows us to evaluate inter realization variability and changes in iqr with clustering are mostly consistent across all portions of the breakthrough curve table 5 for q 0 01 early time the ratio of the interquartile range for networks with dc 1 6 and dc 1 8 relative to dc 2 0 ranges from 1 5 to 2 9 50 190 the same ratio varies from 1 6 to 2 8 60 180 for q 0 84 q 0 16 and from 1 0 to 3 3 0 230 for q 0 99 variations in dfn structure due to clustering explain the observed increase in breakthrough times and iqr given the same length exponent the number of fracture intersections for dc 1 6 high clustering is greater than that of dc 2 0 possonian no clustering table 6 as an example for a power law exponent of 2 2 the number of intersections per fracture increases three fold from dc 2 0 to dc 1 6 in contrast particle tortuosity decreases as clustering decreases for α 1 4 and α 1 8 table 7 as the number of fracture intersection increases particles are more likely to encounter high velocity pathways which explain the reduction in tortuosity sherman et al 2020 in terms of network connectivity the increase in number of intersections enhances the likelihood of achieving percolation threshold especially in less dense networks akara et al 2020 reeves et al 2014 furthermore as clustering increases the dfn structure becomes more irregular with locally high fracture densities in some portions of the domain which leads to highly channelized flow and transport whereas other portions of the domain are mostly unfractured and disconnected from flow and transport processes in a high clustering scenario particles are more likely to sample a wider range of individual fracture segments and their associated orientation length and velocity the enhanced sampling of individual fracture segments generally increases the variability in breakthrough times and yields slower breakthrough times conversely for unclustered networks dc 2 0 particle pathways are less complex resulting in less sampling of fracture segments during particle migration towards the boundaries faster breakthrough times and less variability in particle breakthrough the increase in number of intersections as correlation dimension decreases also explains the increasing asymmetry of quantile q 0 01 q 0 84 q 0 16 and q 0 99 distributions this suggests that spatial clustering may be another factor that contributes to late time tails associated with solute retention becker and shapiro 2000 cvetkovic et al 2004 kosakowski 2004 meigs and beauheim 2001 similar to the correlation dimension variations in length exponent affect breakthrough times and the interquartile range using the same three categories early time bulk of the plume and late time the median and iqr for networks with α 2 2 and α 1 8 are compared to networks with α 1 4 median breakthrough times increase as the length exponent increases from α 1 4 to α 2 2 fig 7 for early time breakthroughs q 0 01 the ratio of the median for α 2 2 and α 1 8 relative to α 1 4 ranges from 1 2 to 2 1 table 4 ratios of 1 5 to 2 7 and 1 5 to 3 4 are obtained for the bulk of the plume q 0 84 q 0 16 and the late time q 0 99 respectively the dispersion around the median and the asymmetry of the breakthrough time distribution becomes more pronounced with increases in the length exponent the ratio of the iqr for α 2 2 and α 1 8 relative to α 1 4 ranges from 1 7 to 4 7 for early time table 5 this ratio increases markedly for the bulk of the plume 2 0 to 6 1 and the late time 1 8 to 9 7 overall these ratios suggest that length exerts a greater influence on advective transport compared to spatial clustering and this influence is more pronounced for later time breakthroughs i e solute retention these trends are consistent with the results of reeves et al 2008b where dramatic increases in mean breakthrough times were observed with increases in power law exponent due to shorter mean pathway length and increased tortuosity as the length exponent increases from 1 4 to 2 2 the probability of generating larger fractures significantly decreases and shorter fractures are more common to achieve the same space filling fractal density the number of fractures in a network with α 1 4 will be significantly less than the number of fractures in a network with α 2 2 for example the number of fractures required on average to maintain d 1 6 is approximately 1400 for α 1 4 and 2100 for α 2 2 as a result networks with α 2 2 have appreciably more fracture intersections that engender longer particle breakthrough times in addition as the length exponent increases the amount of global flow through the network diminishes table 3 note that this is a direct comparison where the only differences are because of geometric fracture attributes and resultant network structure as a constant transmissivity value is assigned to all fractures this reduction in flow at the network scale reduces velocities within individual fracture segments and slows the overall movement of particles the observed trends in median breakthrough time and interquartile range suggest that the length exponent exerts a greater influence on transport than spatial clustering however both spatial clustering and length exponent significantly influence transport and the addition of clustering to a network with power law distributions of length is essential for capturing the complexity of fluid and solute pathways in natural fractured rock systems 4 study limitations this study focuses primarily on the effects of spatial clustering and power law exponent on solute transport stochastic fracture networks based on the probability distributions of fracture geometrical orientation length and hydraulic transmissivity properties are used in this study due to the challenge of generating deterministic fracture models from limited outcrop exposure although stochastic networks are effective at studying fluid flow and transport in fractured rocks they are based on assumptions that often oversimplify the complexity of natural networks for instance fracture geometrical properties are assumed independent random variables and fractures are idealized as lines or planar discs in addition to these general assumptions other specific assumptions have been made regarding the synthetic dfns used in this study although other distributions lognormal and gamma have been used to describe non poissonian fracture spacing our analysis of 27 fracture maps the largest compiled in the literature indicate that each of these networks is best described by a power law in some scenarios fracture aperture is assumed constant to ensure that changes in transport behavior can be attributed solely to spatial clustering in natural networks however fracture apertures are often heterogeneous several studies becker and shapiro 2000 frampton et al 2019 kang et al 2020 makedonska et al 2016 pham et al 2021 sund et al 2021 found that inter fracture aperture heterogeneity can influence overall flow and transport by inducing preferential flow channeling which in turn can lead to early time arrivals similarly hyman et al 2016 found that aperture length correlation can lead to earlier breakthrough time scaling while some of the assumptions could influence the magnitude of the observed differences the study findings indicate that spatial clustering has a noticeable effect on solute transport and thus spatial clustering needs to be considered in dfn studies 5 conclusion the spatial organization of fractures serves a critical role in the geometry and structure of fracture networks the spatial correlation analyses and dfn simulations performed in this study provides a range of spatial correlation dimensions that can be used in generating synthetic dfns and advances the current understanding of how fracture spatial clustering influences solute transport these are significant contributions that are applicable to nearly all dfn studies and addresses an important knowledge gap the primary findings of the study are two point correlation dimension analyses of 27 fracture maps the broadest compilation in the literature yields correlation dimensions ranging from 1 47 to 1 89 with a median of 1 8 this analysis suggests that natural networks commonly exhibit spatial clustering of fractures and are rarely poissonian contrary to what is commonly assumed numerical simulations of advective particle transport show that spatial clustering and length exponent both exert significant impacts on solute breakthrough times and retention ensemble median breakthrough times increase by 10 70 as the spatial organization of fractures transitions from poissonian to highly clustered networks due to increased particle pathway complexity fracture clustering does not affect the amount of global flow for networks with the same power law exponent value particle breakthrough curves become highly variable as networks become more clustered as shown by 50 230 increase in the iqr as the spatial organization of fractures transitions from poissonian to highly clustered increasing power law length exponents from α 1 4 to α 2 2 results in 20 240 increase in the median breakthrough time the effect of the length exponent on breakthrough times is more pronounced because the global flow through the network diminishes with increasing length exponent similar to spatial clustering the variability of inter realization particle breakthroughs increases when the length exponent increases from α 1 4 to α 2 2 as evidenced by iqr which increases from 70 to 870 the above mentioned effects of spatial clustering on solute transport persist with different network sizes and for networks where transmissivity is drawn from a lognormal distribution these findings qualitatively and quantitatively define the influence of both spatial clustering and length exponent on network structure and resultant fluid flow and solute transport while length exponent exerts an overall greater control on fluid flow and transport than spatial clustering results from this study demonstrate that dfn studies need to honor the degree of spatial clustering observed in natural networks to reproduce the complexity of interconnected fracture
