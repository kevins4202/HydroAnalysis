5385,shale weathering was characterized and quantified in a lysimeter and modelling study that jointly considered the flow transport gas diffusion and reactivity processes induced by exposure to the atmosphere of a recently excavated shale in this mechanically disaggregated shale presenting preferential pathways for water and a hydraulic conductivity at saturation of 100 cm day the water content and the seasonal saturation and desaturation cycles were identified as the main driving mechanisms of shale alteration the water content determined the diffusion of gaseous oxygen in the shale s unsaturated porosity which gave rise to a zonation of the oxidation of pyrite contained at 1 wt in the shale the acidification associated with this oxidation of pyrite was efficiently buffered by calcite but a release of sulphates cations iron and trace metals pb ni zn co cu and as mainly was observed besides pyrite and calcite dissolution iron oxy hydroxide formed and proved to be a good phase for sorbing trace metals whose content remained at low concentrations in the drainage water seasonal precipitation of gypsum was also identified in connection with the summer desaturation of the shale s shallow layers the hydraulic chemical and mineralogical observations made in the lysimeters were reproduced using hp1 a reactive transport code under unsaturated conditions it was possible to account for the gas diffusion where o2 availability controlled the reactivity with the shale depending on the meteorological conditions and the drainage at the base of the lysimeter keywords weathering critical zone vadose zone gas diffusion chemical reactivity shale 1 introduction the vadose zone have attracted more attention over the past decade as a privileged place for reactions between water atmosphere rock and soil this part of the earth system called the critical zone cz extends from the vegetation to the groundwater li et al 2017 and is a system that combines chemical biological physical and geological processes supporting life all together brantley et al 2007 the cz is subject to hydraulic geomorphological and climatic events wind rainfall flood drought that finally fracture grind and dissolve rocks anderson et al 2007 worthington et al 2016 the weathering of shales is of particular interest since clay minerals are ubiquitous on the earth s surface and play an important role in chemical element cycles co2 o2 nutrients in the atmosphere water and soils shales also serve as caprock for waste or subsurface gas storage and for which it is necessary to anticipate shale alteration the weathering of the rocks occurs over a variety of time and space scales from mineral grains to watersheds that makes it difficult to quantify the processes and their rates littke et al 1991 pacheco and van der weijden 2012 steefel et al 2005 to circumvent such scaling issues one approach consists of acquiring data in the laboratory and in the field and analysing the results with reactive transport models rtm in order to decipher the mechanisms occurring at the earth surface and subsurface goddéris et al 2019 hadermann and heer 1996 mayer et al 2015 steefel et al 2005 cz studies cover a large range of fields including regolith formation that contributes to important processes such as nutrient cycling carbon sequestration erosion and acid rain mitigation brantley et al 2007 jin et al 2010 reactions with atmospheric o2 and co2 induce nested alteration fronts in the subsurface from the atmosphere brantley et al 2013 lerouge et al 2020 in general the depths of these weathering reactions are unknown with a close link between the reactivity of the cz systems and the water table the water table can act as a buffer zone for contaminants molins and mayer 2007 as well as reducing the o2 migration rate and preventing mineral oxidization as observed in mining tailings ouangrawa et al 2009 acid rock drainage is a major concern when shales or mining waste deposits contain reactive sulphide minerals that are unstable in contact with atmospheric o2 blowes and jambor 1990 littke et al 1991 in addition to the acidification of the pore water the release of fe so4 and toxic metals cu pb zn and other trace metals has also been reported mayer et al 2015 besides water table fluctuations carbonate dissolution was one of the mechanisms reported to buffer the system and prevent pore water acidification brantley et al 2013 ouangrawa et al 2009 the prediction of the impact of sulphide rich tailings on the environment requires an understanding of the coupling between hydraulic flow transport and geochemical mineral dissolution precipitation oxido reduction reactions processes in the system reactive transport modelling is a powerful tool to investigate biogeochemical systems in the fields of hydrogeology geochemistry and biogeochemistry li et al 2017 macquarrie and mayer 2005 the simulation of metal elements release in the vadose zone taking into account water rock gas interactions flow and transport processes is the focus of an increasing number of studies acero et al 2009 mayer et al 2015 mayer et al 2002 molson et al 2005 however studies have focused on either laboratory experiments dm or the field scale 10 m without considering the intermediate scale that is reached through lysimeter monitoring the objective of this study is to provide insight into the chemical evolution of shale tailings containing small amounts of sulphide minerals by considering flow transport gas diffusion and water table variations rainfall evaporation at a lysimeter scale this study may help to reconcile the discrepancies that usually occur between laboratory data and field measurements guo et al 2020 maher et al 2006 pacheco and alencoão 2006 by more accurately controlling boundary conditions the quantification of the oxidation of the tailings material and its associated effects ph and redox state modifications in particular can be used to assess the possible release of sulphates and trace metals into the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 tailings of callovian oxfordian cox shale the studied site stems from the research conducted in the eastern part of france to build up a deep underground radioactive waste disposal facility in a deep geological formation the callovian oxfordian shale e g a clay rich sedimentary formation layer has been studied as a potential host rock for more than 20 years the thermo hydro mechanical and chemical behaviour of callovian oxfordian cox shale was notably investigated in an underground research laboratory located 500 m deep cox shale is an indurated shale that exhibits a fined grained texture characterised by a porosity between 15 and 20 de craen et al 2004 and pore diameters mainly ranging between 10 and 100 nm goddéris et al 2019 these nanometre sized pores induce low hydraulic conductivity 10 13 to 10 14 m s 1 and low diffusion coefficients descostes et al 2008 harrington et al 2012 with a biot coefficient of 0 6 and a young modulus of 4 gpa cox shale is a cohesive and stiff material charlier et al 2013 the mineralogy of cox is constituted by clay minerals mainly mixed layered illite smectite minerals and illite carbonates mainly calcite and quartz minor amounts of sulphur minerals 1 2 of pyrite galena and sulphate minerals celestite are also found as well as iron oxide and oxy hydroxides goethite pyrite is known to contain trace amounts of as pb co cu ni and zn lerouge et al 2011 in the conditions of the geological formation the pristine pore water is in equilibrium with the shale forming minerals gaucher et al 2009 and exhibits a ph of about 7 2 reductive conditions are found in the shale and pore water forced by an equilibrium with pyrite several million cubic meters of the callovo oxfordian rocks are expected to be excavated during the building operation of the facility this material will be stored as tailings at the surface where it will form a technosol scholtus et al 2015 therefore it is subject to meteorological variations that modify the cox chemical and mechanical properties due to decompaction disaggregation and leaching mineralogical alterations of various tailings samples were identified by erm etudes recherches matériaux poitiers france company using a jeol jsm 5600lv scanning electron microscope sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds examinations it enabled giving a chemical mapping together with the crystallographic information on these tailing samples the weathering of the rock stems from its mechanical deconstruction and from pyrite oxidation de windt et al 2014 vinsot et al 2014 that eventually increase the permeability of the rock from the surface to the depths and water infiltration will increase leaching of chemical elements due to dissolution precipitation of minerals a part of the tailings stored at the surface is also expected to be reused as backfill materials in the repository understanding and predicting the physico chemical evolution of the callovo oxfordian tailings is thus required to prevent any potential environmental impacts to design the tailing management scenarios geometry water cycle and to evaluate the physico chemical state of the tailings used as a backfill materials 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 lysimeter station the weathering of the callovian oxfordian shale was studied since 2013 using four stainless steel lysimeters fig 1 with a cross sectional area of 1 m2 and a height of 2 m andra lysimeter station osne le val france 48 30 33 n 5 12 43 e https www ugt online de en products lysimeter technology two lysimeters called l5 and l6 were filled with cox shale tailings already stored at the surface for 10 years the other two lysimeters called l7 and l8 were filled with recently excavated 6 months cox shale from loose tailings monoliths were directly cored from aged tailings to fill lysimeters l5 and l6 while the lysimeters l7 and l8 were hand filled and compacted layer by layer 30 cm to reach a density of 1700 kg m 3 close to the density measured in the aged tailings 1800 kg m 3 since july 2013 each lysimeter has been continuously weighed by precision scales and is equipped with soil hydrology devices such as tensiometers water content sensors temperature sensors and suction probes at depths of 20 50 100 and 150 cm lysimeters are also equipped with tipping counters for the measurement of basal water leakage the combined soil moisture and temperature sensors used ump 1 umwelt geräte technik gmbh are based on frequency domain reflectometry fdr method and measure local changes in dielectric permittivity around the probe that can be related to changes in water content the soil moisture sensors measure the local conductivity around the sensor hence the measured water content corresponds both to the water in the large space between the grains of argillaceous rock and in the porosity of the grains matrix potential was measured through suction in ceramic filters by tensiometers tensio 160 umwelt geräte technik gmbh at soil saturation matrix potential is zero and is positive with soil desaturation the pore size of the ceramic filters is higher than the argillaceous rock pore size and then the measured suction potential corresponds to the one of the intergrain spaces of the tailing material water sampling was also performed at different depths using ceramic suction probes umwelt geräte technik gmbh and an air pump operated by the matrix potential value the sampled water was stored in 500 ml glass bottles where water accumulated between two manual sampling times every two months tipping counters umwelt geräte technik gmbh were used for basal drainage monitoring and for leaking water sampling each lysimeter was placed on three high sensitivity weighting cells 10 g resolution a datalogger has recorded and transmitted the weight of the lysimeters the matrix potential the water content the drainage at the bottom and the temperature at an hourly frequency since january 2014 the lysimeter station has been equipped since july 2014 with a weather station measuring rainfall temperature relative humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure and incident solar radiation data 2 2 2 water sample analyses the water in the lysimeters was sampled every two months from january 2014 to january 2017 the water samples were then filtrated at 0 45 µm and analysed at the laboratoire interdisciplinaire des environnements continentaux liec nancy france for total carbon and inorganic carbon contents using a vcsh toc analyser shimadzu scientific instruments and for anions cl no2 no3 2 po4 2 so4 2 br by ionic chromatography dionex major and trace elements al as ba ca cd co cr cu fe k mg mn mo na ni p pb s sb se zn were measured at the laboratoire sols et environnement lse nancy france using icp oes icap duo thermo scientific additional water samples were also taken from l6 and l7 in march 2016 and november 2017 to determine the 34s 32s isotopic ratio immediately after sampling the water samples were filtrated at 0 45 µm and cadmium acetate at 50 g l 1 was added to trap sulphurs and prevent their oxidation in sulphates the samples were filtrated at 0 22 µm in the laboratory and sulphates were precipitated with bacl2 the baso4 precipitate was then mixed with vanadium pentoxide v2o5 and heated at 1000 c in tin capsules under o2 flux the gaseous so2 produced during combustion was purified by gas chromatography gc and analysed at the bureau de recherches géologiques et minières brgm orléans france with an elemental analyser coupled to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta plus cf irms thermo fisher scientific 2 3 water balance water balance calculations allows for estimating the flux of water between the atmosphere the cox shale in the lysimeters and the drainage at the base of the lysimeter at the lysimeter scale to reproduce flow in the lysimeter and to determine the hydraulic parameters it is necessary respecting the water balance to verify the coherence of the recorded data in a lysimeter the water balance can be calculated by considering the precipitation p evaporation ep drainage at the base of the lysimeter dr and the variation in water content δs according to equation 1 e g cui and zornberg 2009 tarantino et al 2009 1 δ s d r p e p compared to a water balance usually calculated in soil the surface run off is not considered in the lysimeter water balance because the top ledge of the lysimeter impedes such run off rain interception and water uptake by vegetation can also be disregarded because of the absence of vegetation in our lysimeter study furthermore only drainage is considered at the base of the lysimeter since water can only flow out of the lysimeter at its basis the lysimeter and local meteorological data were used to calculate the water balance in each lysimeter on a daily basis from the 01 01 2014 to 09 04 2017 these data include the lysimeter weights i e the water content variation δs and the volume of drained water measured directly at the lysimeter base dr precipitation p and evaporation ep are also involved in the water balance the local meteorological data measured onsite were completed with data from the météo france weather stations of chevillon station 52123003 located 7 km from the lysimeters for precipitation and temperature records and houdelaincourt station 55248001 located about 20 km away for evaporation evolution determined using the monteith method besides some minor differences during rain events between the osne le val and chevillon weather stations the cumulated amount of precipitation was similar between the two stations data from chevillon weather station can therefore reasonably be used to cover the 6 month period before the installation of the weather station at the lysimeter site by combining the different available data various water balances were calculated to assess the coherence of the data the first one aimed at calculating the evaporation by water balance on the lysimeters using the direct measurement of drainage and the variations in lysimeter weight as the variation in water content at the lysimeter scale another water balance in the lysimeters was made to calculate the basal drainage by considering the water content variation obtained from the lysimeter mass evolution the precipitation series météo france station for the beginning of 2014 and then from osne le val weather station and the evaporation calculated with the penman monteith formula using osne le val weather station data a correction factor of 0 2 was applied to the penman monteith evaporation to account for the difference between the potential evaporation and the actual evaporation 2 3 1 reactive transport model in unsaturated conditions a reactive transport model that aims reproducing the data collected in the lysimeters has been set up to evaluate the weathering phenomena occurring in the cox tailings the approach undertaken here aimed at numerically simulating the water content and the evolution of solute concentrations in the lysimeters during the 2014 to 2017 period using the meteorological data and the basal drainage in the lysimeters during the same period as boundary conditions the calculation code hp1 v2 4 jacques and šimůnek 2005 jacques et al 2018 jacques et al 2008a šimůnek et al 2006 which results from the coupling of hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 and phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 calculation codes was used hp1 can be used to simulate water flow gas diffusion and solute transport in an unsaturated medium and can consider the set of chemical reactions expected in shale tailings by a thermo kinetic approach while the geometry of the lysimeter was represented using a 1d model advection and diffusion transport mechanisms occurring in the lysimeter were accounted for by a dual porosity model because of the mechanical deconstruction of the cox shale during its excavation the hydraulic properties of the tailings are greatly changed compared to the initial shale and a preferential flow develops between the shale aggregates with little transfers with the water in the porosity of the aggregates the preferential flow between the soil aggregates was modelled as the mobile porosity zone while the immobile zone corresponded to the porosity inside the cox shale aggregates the mobile zone corresponded to 10 of the volume of the lysimeter with a porosity of 1 while the immobile zone was considered for the remaining 90 of the volume of the lysimeter with a porosity of 0 15 the 2 m high lysimeter was represented as 101 nodes each 2 cm long and both a mobile and immobile domain was associated with each of these 101 nodes a schematic representation of the modelled lysimeter is shown in fig 2 where the main flow transport and reactive processes are indicated simulation aim to reproduce the data that have been gathered between january 2014 and april 2017 2 3 2 hydraulic and transport model to simulate water flow and solute transport in the lysimeters a dual porosity model was used šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 this model considered vertical preferential water and gas flow in the zone between the rock aggregates mobile zone and a water and solute transfer between the aggregates immobile zone and the mobile zone water flow in the mobile zone and water transfer between the mobile and immobile zones in a dual porosity model are described in hydrus according to the following equations based on the richards equation gerke and van genuchten 1993a gerke and van genuchten 1993b šimůnek et al 2003 2 θ m t z k h z h z 1 γ w 3 θ i m t γ w 4 θ θ i m θ m where the indices m and im refer to the mobile and immobile zones respectively h is the hydraulic head l t and z are the time t and vertical space l coordinates respectively k h z is the relative hydraulic conductivity l t 1 θ is the volumetric water content and γw is the water transfer between mobile and immobile domains t 1 the water transfer depends on the head difference between the mobile and the immobile domains and is written as γ w α w h m h i m where αw is the water mass coefficient transfer between the mobile and the immobile zones t 1 the transfer of chemical components between the two zones of the porous medium is described by the two following mass balance equations gerke and van genuchten 1993a šimůnek et al 2003 5 θ m c m t s g θ s m c g t f m ρ s m t

relative volumetric proportion of the immobile zone in the considered medium in eq 5 solute transport through the gas phase is considered by an additional term on the right hand side where sg is the saturation of the gas phase in the mobile domain θs m is the water content at saturation of the mobile domain dg is the pore gas diffusion coefficient l2 t 1 and cg is the solute concentration in the gas phase the pore gas diffusion coefficient is calculated from the local saturation and porosity according to the formula proposed by millington 1959 7 d g n m 1 3 s g 7 3 d g 0 where dg 0 is the gas diffusion coefficient in a free medium the coupling of chemical species transport as solute in the soil water and as gas species in the soil atmosphere allows the reactivity of the gases with minerals and the feeding of the gas species from the atmosphere to be considered depending on the soil saturation this coupling is of particular interest when considering the oxidation of pyrite by atmospheric o2 since the transport of o2 in water is slow and the dissolved o2 is rapidly consumed by pyrite without o2 gas transport the pyrite oxidation is restricted to the first cm of the soil column water retention in the mobile and immobile domains was defined by the van genuchten mualem relationships van genuchten 1980 linking water content and hydraulic head in a porous medium and calculating the effective hydraulic conductivity they are written as follows 8a s e θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m h 0 8b s e 1 h 0 8c m 1 1 n n 1 8d k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where se is the effective saturation θs is the water content at saturation θr is the residual water content α n and l are empirical parameters of the retention functions and ks is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation 2 3 3 reactive model the reactivity considered in the model is based on the alteration mechanisms identified in the cox tailings section 3 2 major ca na mg k fe al s c si cl and trace elements pb co ni zn measured in the lysimeter solutions and involved in the reactive processes were considered as solute in the model o2 and co2 were considered as gas species that can be dissolved in water a selection of primary phases pyrite calcite and goethite such as iron oxy hydroxide can dissolve or precipitate through a kinetic control according to the kinetic parameters selected by marty et al 2015 thermochimie v 9b0 giffaut et al 2014 was used as the thermodynamic database for these calculations the composition of the considered pyrite phase includes pb ni co and zn trace metals at proportions given by lerouge et al 2011 gypsum completes the selected mineralogical assemblage as secondary phases whose occurrence is controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium for the sake of simplicity clay minerals were not introduced because of their slow dissolution rate compared to the simulation duration cation exchange involving na ca2 mg2 k and fe2 which occurs at the surface of clay minerals was nevertheless considered given its influence on the solution composition during transient chemical and hydraulic conditions de craen et al 2004 jacques et al 2008b the cation exchange capacity varying between 13 3 and 18 3 meq kgrock 1 was measured by cobaltihexammine extraction on tailings sampled at different depths at the installation of lysimeters l5 and l6 the cation exchange selectivity coefficients determined for the pristine cox claystone gaucher et al 2009 were used sorption of trace metals can take place at the surface of goethite minerals that locally precipitate in the vicinity of altered pyrite crystals and at the surface of clay minerals retention coefficients were fitted on the results for each trace element co log k 10 ni log k 9 7 pb log k 11 7 and zn log k 9 9 considering a site density of 0 28 mol of sites per mol of goethite dixit and hering 2003 k is the half reaction selectivity constant of the mass action equation describing the distribution of species between the exchange sites and the solution as defined in phreeqc code 2 3 4 hydraulic and chemical initial and boundary conditions the hydraulic boundary conditions used in the reactive transport model corresponded to the precipitation evaporation and drainage presented or recalculated in section 3 1 precipitation and evaporation series were then applied as upper boundary conditions on the tailing column while lysimeter basal drainage was used as lower boundary condition hydraulic boundary conditions were defined at a daily frequency the initial water content profile in the model was set to that measured in january 2014 on the lysimeters the rainwater composition was the chemical boundary condition at the lysimeter surface and was based on so4 0 017 mmol l 1 and cl 0 021 mmol l 1 concentrations measured on site and on rainwater compositions reported in appelo and postma 2005 for the remaining composition since the tailings were already oxidized at the beginning of the simulation the initial chemical system assumed for the model showed the effects of oxidation initial solutions in the lysimeter column corresponded to the composition of solutions at 20 cm 50 cm 100 cm 150 cm 200 cm in lysimeter l6 since the fe concentration was generally below the quantification limit 5 10 8 mol l 1 it was determined by equilibrating with goethite the ph of the solutions was altered until the saturation index of calcite was close to zero these six solutions were discretized further by linear interpolation into 26 solutions in order to reduce the difference in concentration of the solution between two nodes the cation distribution on the exchanger was calculated to be at equilibrium with the initial solutions the initial solutions contained trace metal concentrations based on data wherever data for the trace metal were not available at that particular depth at the jan 14 l6 sampling campaign the trace metal concentration for that depth was chosen based on the range of concentrations in solutions measured at a different sampling time regarding the gas phase the co2 and o2 atmospheric composition was set as the initial gas composition in the unsaturated porosity of the modelled lysimeters the initial model parameters are summarised in supplementary file a 3 results and discussion 3 1 water fluxes calculated from lysimeter data due to the release of the mechanical stress the flow properties in the tailings of callovian oxfordian cox shale are higher compared to the properties of the sound rock for in situ conditions indeed the rock has been milled and uncompacted during the excavation operations and has been partially recompacted when stored at the ground surface as tailings as a result the porosity and the pore size have increased compared to its initial state with an apparent density of 1700 kg m 3 after recompaction of the tailings the porosity can be estimated at 55 60 while it was of about 10 20 initially the tailings constitute an assemblage of µm to cm blocks or aggregates of rock hence the pore space of the tailings becomes highly heterogeneous with the occurrence of large spaces macropores fissures between the rock blocks and the porosity of these blocks is made of pores of very little size consequently zones of preferential flow are expected in such a porous medium as shown by the range of hydraulic conductivity from 10 3 to 10 8 m s 1 measured on tailings samples andra internal report in addition depending on the meteorological conditions the cox shale tailings are subject to variations in water saturation 3 2 water balance in the lysimeters water content and drainage in the lysimeters showed a seasonal evolution with a dry period during summer the measured daily weight variations could be irregular where a sharp weight variation was often followed by an opposite weight variation the lysimeters weight seemed to increase during rain events and to decrease shortly after on the other hand the drainage at the base of the lysimeters seemed to be less dependent on precipitation since heavy rains were not followed by a drainage outflow while heavy drainage could be observed without direct links to rain events this observation suggests a noticeable delay in the water flow within the lysimeters the evaporation calculated from the water balance in the lysimeters was not coherent because the expected seasonal variation with higher evaporation in summer than in winter was not found fig 3 a and b in addition negative evaporation was sometimes calculated following days with high positive evaporation and this inconsistency could not be solved by averaging the data over several days the drainage recalculated using the evaporation obtained from meteorological data with the daily values averaged over three days stayed in the range of the drainage measured from the lysimeters fig 3c but the instantaneous volume of water drained from the lysimeters base was lower and more spread over time the precipitation data the evaporation calculated using the penman monteith formula and the recalculated drainage that will be used as boundary conditions for the lysimeter flow simulations are summarized in fig 4 3 3 insights on water flow in the lysimeters water content showed a seasonal evolution with for the sensor at 20 cm a strong link with the rain events a delay was observed at depth in the seasonal water content evolution where the wet period at 150 cm was delayed by several months compared to the wet period close to the surface rock tailings at depth remained close to saturation with a water content of 60 the water content measurements showed a non negligible difference between the different lysimeters for a given depth however even if the water content value was different between the lysimeters a temporal similarity was observed between the water content increases and decreases the suction potential is null in a saturated porous medium and increases with the desaturation of this medium in agreement the highest recorded suction potentials corresponded to the more pronounced desaturation events close to the surface and during the summer period at depth suction potentials remained close to 0 indicating that the medium remained saturated or close to saturation suction potential gradients gave insights on the water flow in the lysimeters these suction potential gradients indicated a water flow from the top to the bottom of the lysimeters during the wet season and a reverse gradient during the summer period suggesting an upward capillary flow the potential gradients were generally higher between the tensiometers close to the surface than between the deep tensiometers at the lysimeter scale the mean gradient was about 0 05 cm cm 1 but much higher and reversed gradients of some cm cm 1 were occasionally recorded during dry periods 3 4 weathering mechanisms 3 4 1 elemental chemistry in solution the concentrations measured in solution were similar in the four lysimeters we chose to present only the results for l6 fig 5 the ph varied between 7 and 8 throughout the depth of the lysimeters the ph decrease observed with depth in january 2017 compared to the other measurements is not characteristic of an acidification from this date as such a ph decrease was also observed in november 2015 the ph values in the lysimeters were higher than the ph in the pristine cox shale pore water before oxidation in agreement with the carbonate ions that were lower the data were consistent with each other as the higher the carbonate ions the lower the ph millero 2007 nonetheless carbonate ions concentration might be expected to have been higher because of the calcite dissolution and biological activity however the degassing during sampling due to the exposure of the lysimeter water to the atmosphere lowers the carbonate content in solution the dissolved carbonate concentration was lower close to the surface increased until 50 cm depth and then remained stable cl in solution is two orders of magnitude below the values reported in the pristine cox pore water vinsot et al 2008 the value was slightly higher than the rainwater concentration measured on site 2 1 10 5 mol l 1 this concentration supported the assumption of percolating rainwater in the lysimeter with interaction with pore water note that the concentration decreased from january 2014 to january 2015 and then remained stable highlighting a possible leaching of cl that decreased with time the sulphate concentration increased with depth and remained in the same range throughout the study period sulphate levels in the lysimeter were two to three times higher than in pristine cox pore water for which redox reduced condition prevails and two orders of magnitude higher than in rainwater 1 75 10 5 mol l 1 this observation is consistent with a dissolution of pyrite oxidized by the oxygen from the atmosphere this observation is also consistent with the gypsum saturation indices that were at equilibrium from 50 to 200 cm deep and the observation of gypsum precipitates in the tailings na k and mg concentrations increased with depth in all lysimeters during the monitored period k and mg concentrations remained similar over time while na concentration clearly decreased between january 2014 and january 2017 at the surface of the lysimeters na reached in 2017 the concentrations observed in natural soils forest and meadow formed on callovian oxfordian shale scholtus et al 2015 in addition k and mg concentrations were higher in the lysimeter solutions than in cox pore water while the opposite was observed for na due to its leaching ca increased from the surface to 50 cm deep and then decreased until the bottom of the lysimeter this element was not only buffered by the ion exchanger but mainly by highly reactive minerals such as calcite that controlled its concentration in the callovian oxfordian gaucher et al 2009 such a concentration higher than the cox pore water could display dissolution of this phase however the saturation indices calculated on the basis of the solution analyses showed that calcite like dolomite was oversaturated and apparently ruled out this hypothesis fig 5 nonetheless the solutions were collected in the lysimeters every 2 months and were not preserved from the atmosphere during that period the pco2 measured in the cox is close to 10 2 atm gailhanou et al 2017 vinsot et al 2008 in agreement with the pco2 calculated from the solution analyses fig 5 co2 degassing no doubt occurred and modified the carbonate concentration measured by the toc analyser lerouge et al 2020 this may explain the calcite and dolomite oversaturation 3 4 2 isotopic ratio of sulphates δ34s all the results were reported in δ units relative to international standards defined by δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the measured isotopic ratio in the sample δ34s δ32s and in the standard which was cdt canyon diablo troilite for sulphur the isotopic signature of the so4 from the lysimeter samples ranged from 41 to 18 cdt table 1 and supplementary file b these values correspond to the pyrite domain in the pristine cox formation that ranges between 40 and 20 cdt lerouge et al 2011 isotopic analysis of well preserved cox pore water in anaerobic conditions shows high δ34s values between 18 7 and 22 3 cdt vinsot et al 2015 which was in line with the δ34s values of celestite lerouge et al 2011 after introducing oxygen into the preserved cox pore water samples the so4 concentration in the oxidized pore water increased two fold and the δ34s value dropped down to 16 4 cdt this decrease was interpreted to be due to release of so4 depleted in δ34s i e diagenetic pyrite present at the deeper parts of cox tremosa et al 2015 vinsot et al 2015 based on these results the isotopic analysis of the sampled solutions from the lysimeter indicated that the so4 concentration of the solutions contained a substantial amount of so4 released directly from diagenetic pyrite these results confirm the oxidation of pyrite in the tailings although they are not sufficient to quantify the extent of pyrite dissolution or the amount of so4 released by the pyrite 3 4 3 mineralogical changes mineralogical characterizations of cox tailings evidenced the presence of pyrite calcite and the precipitation of secondary phases gypsum and iron oxy hydroxides fig 6 the iron oxy hydroxides formation was linked to pyrite alteration and was described as a three step process involving the oxidation of disulphide s2 2 and fe2 that led to the formation of fe3 appelo and postma 2005 finally iron oxy hydroxides precipitated unless the ph remained below 3 debure et al 2017 the overall reaction is described by eq 9 9 4 f e s 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4 f e o h 3 8 s o 4 2 16 h the pyrite dissolution released protons in solution and thus led to an acidification of the system which was buffered by the dissolution of calcite towards the equilibrium ph of calcite 8 indeed the proton production caused calcite dissolution in agreement with equation 10 10 cac o 3 2 h ca 2 h 2 o c o 2 this calcite dissolution released co2 and ca that may precipitate with the sulphates coming from the pyrite dissolution to form gypsum according to equation 11 11 ca 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o c a s o 4 2 h 2 o note that gypsum precipitation is highly dependent on the water saturation indeed lysimeters faced weather changes rain snow wind over the years and seasons with water saturation and desaturation periods water loss led to an increase in the concentration evaporation of half the pristine cox pore water gaucher et al 2009 led to gypsum precipitation such water loss induced an increase in the sulphate concentration by a factor of 1 7 compared to the pristine pore water this factor reached 3 5 for an evaporation of 70 of the cox pore water this mechanism highlights the possible formation of gypsum at the top of the lysimeter that was more subject to saturation desaturation cycles nonetheless leaching and infiltration caused an increase in the sulphate and calcium concentrations from the surface towards the bottom of the lysimeters fig 5 therefore gypsum precipitated at the bottom of the lysimeter as shown by the saturation indices calculation fig 5 even if there was no water loss 3 4 4 trace element release in the lysimeters in the cox shale pyrite contains several trace elements as co cu ni pb and zn grangeon et al 2015 lerouge et al 2011 most of these elements were found at low concentrations in the solutions collected in the lysimeters fig 7 among them as was below the quantification limit 3 2 10 8 mol l 1 most of the time as was one of the main traces incorporated in pyrite with co ni and pb so this behaviour could be explained by the high affinity of as for iron oxy hydroxides that precipitate as a result of the pyrite dissolution daus et al 1998 debure et al 2018 giménez et al 2007 cu and zn are infra traces in pyrite lerouge et al 2011 explaining the low cu concentration while zn was provided by sphalerite zns dissolution furthermore zn and ni were present in feldspar and detrital minerals thus accounting for their higher quantity than co and cu the values detected for pb were explained by the presence of galena pbs in the pristine cox too lerouge et al 2011 with the exception of cu concentrations that remained in the range of the cox pore water the concentrations of co ni pb and zn were two orders of magnitude higher in the tailings water than in the cox pore water ba was detected as well mica quartz and feldspar were the ba carrier and their dissolution is the most relevant explanation for its presence in the solution ba released at the bottom of the lysimeters reached a concentration of 2 10 7 mol l 1 in march 2014 but stabilized and did not exceed 7 3 10 8 mol l 1 after march 2015 at the bottom of the lysimeters regarding se pyrite and fossil organic matter were the se bearing phases in the initial cox in sampled solutions se was under the quantification limit 5 3 10 8 mol l 1 in the older tailings 10 years in 2014 while it was still detected in the new tailings 3 years in 2014 but decreased from 3 9 10 7 mol l 1 in 2014 to 1 3 10 7 mol l 1 in 2017 at the bottom of the lysimeters this disappearance could be due to the leaching of this element or to its sorption on the iron oxy hydroxides jordan et al 2009 mn was detected as well at the bottom of the lysimeters and varied from 5 8 10 6 mol l 1 in the aged tailings to 1 8 10 8 mol l 1 in the new tailings mn was detected especially in the solutions of the aged tailings mn was carried by kaolinite micas and carbonates and mno represented initially 0 04 wt of clayrock such a mn concentration seemed to show a stage of dissolution that had not yet occurred in the new tailings other elements like cd mo and sb were always below the quantification limit during the three years of monitoring 3 6 10 9 mol l 1 2 1 10 7 mol l 1 and 8 10 8 mol l 1 respectively as well as cr most of the time ql 2 3 10 8 mol l 1 which was detected only occasionally but did not exceed 1 6 10 7 mol l 1 finally al and fe reached their highest concentrations 2 2 10 6 mol l 1 and 1 8 10 7 mol l 1 at the bottom of the lysimeters in the first samples they were not detected anymore after 5 months and remained below their limit of quantification qlal 1 3 10 7 mol l 1 and qlfe 1 8 10 8 mol l 1 3 4 5 gases o2 and co2 the most important mechanism driving the cox tailing alteration was pyrite oxidation which is highly dependent on o2 available in the lysimeters and on the exposed surface of pyrite to o2 the lysimeters were in contact with the atmosphere thus initially o2 was at the air value and decreased with depth due to its consumption by pyrite and because of the lower accessibility of the deeper facies permeability saturation however oxidation of the water samples collected every two months was not prevented between sampling times and during sampling and then no redox state differences with the depth were revealed by measurements on the water the redox conditions of the system can neither be assessed by the nitrite nitrate couple nor the sulphide sulphate couple the co2 amount was assessed by the measurement of inorganic carbon in solution that was compared occasionally with the alkalinity measurements both parameters were in agreement each time however as mentioned earlier the interaction with the atmosphere during water sampling led to co2 outgassing that lowered the analysed co2 compared to its quantity in the lysimeters 3 4 6 synthesis on the mechanisms involved in the cox alteration and release of elements microscope observations on tailing samples showed pyrite alteration in the tailings that finally led to the formation of iron oxy hydroxides as oxidizing conditions prevailed in the lysimeters pyrite dissolution led to an increase in sulphates in solution which was confirmed by δ34s isotopic analyses in the meantime calcite dissolved and buffered the system close to ph 8 and drove the increase in ca in solution the increasing amount of ca and sulphates may lead to gypsum precipitation as already seen for outcropping or shallow clay rich rock formations debure et al 2018 lerouge et al 2018 in addition desaturation phenomena due to warm and dry weather conditions could enhance this secondary phase s precipitation by drying the tailings in addition to its influence on saturation indices water content will affect the gas diffusion with a higher gas mobility under unsaturated conditions co2 migration influences the ph and the carbonate phases while o2 diffusion will be the driver of the pyrite oxidation which releases trace elements such as as co cu ni pb and zn in solution such metal elements have an affinity for clays and iron oxy hydroxides and their behaviour is expected to be controlled by sorption on these phases 3 5 modelling of lysimeter evolution and discussion 3 5 1 water content and transport 3 5 1 1 water content water content coupled with pressure head were used to determine hydraulic parameters through an inversion a single set of parameters were determined for the four lysimeters considering their similar evolution with time the inversion criteria by visual assessment were based on the ability of the model to describe the water content variations and delay at depth depending on rainfall and evaporation at the top of the lysimeters and drainage at the bottom the lower measuring depth 200 cm was usually saturated and so the reproduction of the data focused on the shallower depths fig 8 overall the modelled water content reproduced the most significant measurements especially the water content increase in july and august 2014 as well as the decrease in october 2016 finally the higher water contents were consistent with the rainfall at the shallower depth while at depth a retardation was observed given the scattering of the water contents measured between the different lysimeters the absolute water content value seemed less important to simulate than the water content variations over time at the different depths the water content evolution was modelled for a hydraulic conductivity at saturation of 100 cm day 1 within the mobile domain which is in the range of the hydraulic conductivities measured in tailings and in the lysimeters andra pers comm 3 5 1 2 chlorine transport water and solute transfer coefficients between the mobile and immobile zone as well as dispersivity are the parameters describing flow and transport in the double porosity model these parameters were determined by fitting the cl concentration over time in the lysimeters cl is usually used as an inert tracer no sorption exchange or precipitation as a mineral the initial concentration profile in the mobile zone implemented in the model was the profile measured in january 2014 i e equal to or lower than 4 10 4 mol l 1 the concentrations in the immobile zone were set to the pristine cox pore water concentration 4 1 10 2 mol l 1 vinsot et al 2008 the cl in rainwater measured on site was 2 1 10 5 mol l 1 cl concentrations increased during dry seasons while they decreased during wet seasons when chlorine was diluted by the rainwater resulting in concentrations 20 times lower than the initial chlorine concentration in the system fig 9 despite the two orders of magnitude of difference between the concentration in the immobile and in the mobile zone the cl in the immobile zone remained unchanged throughout the simulation indeed the higher cl loss was observed at 20 cm and represented only 2 6 of the initial cl concentration highlighting the small transfer coefficient between the mobile and immobile zone sensitivity tests made on the solute mass transfer coefficient revealed that only a small range of solute mass transfer coefficient values could reproduce cl variations in addition the contribution of the excess cl content from the porosity of claystone aggregates immobile zone to the cl content in the inter aggregate porosity of the tailings mobile zone 3 5 1 3 gas transport seasonal desaturation of the lysimeters enables gas infiltration throughout the whole lysimeter in this study gas diffusion focused on o2 and co2 that were identified as the main sources of reactivity according to the solution and solid analyses section 3 2 according to the results of the model fig 10 the higher o2 temporal variations were reported near the surface 20 and 50 cm deep while co2 was not present at a depth of 20 cm and displayed similar values between 50 and 150 cm deep to finally disappear at the bottom of the modelled lysimeter with the water saturation o2 was consumed by pyrite oxidation that limits its diffusion to larger depths together with the fact that gas diffusion is lower when water saturation increases co2 was released by calcite in response to pyrite oxidation maximal co2 release in the soil atmosphere occurred at 20 cm and was lower at depth because of the lower pyrite oxidation and the water saturation of the lysimeter 3 5 2 weathering of the tailings 3 5 2 1 water chemistry ph varied between 7 5 and 8 during the three years of monitoring fig 11 and supplementary file c for the other depths despite the pyrite oxidation ph do not reach acidic conditions such as those encountered in acid mine drainage in the cox tailing acidity due to the pyrite oxidation is buffered by the dissolution of carbonates involving a modification of the pore water chemistry modelling the evolution of the pore water chemistry in the lysimeter involves taking into account the reactivity of minerals coupled to gas solute and water transport the range of ph was well reproduced by the rtm model at the different depths of the lysimeter profile nonetheless the modelled ph was slightly lower than the measured ph at 50 cm deep and increased at the surface 20 cm deep because of co2 outgassing at larger depth the modelled ph was higher because of the lower reactivity of the rock at 150 cm deep the variations of ph over time were related to the presence or not of a gas phase and when o2 can enter at this depth pyrite was oxidized and ph was lower than under saturated conditions under conditions closed to the atmosphere the oxidation of the tailings and the dissolution of calcite led to in situ ph in the cox shale tailings of about 9 marty et al 2018 lower ph of 7 5 was obtained by equilibration with the atmosphere when air entered in the tailing porosity or during sampling k and na concentrations in solution were only controlled by the cation exchange at clay surfaces since we considered no minerals other than pyrite calcite and secondary gypsum and goethite in the model both elements increased at depth because of leaching from the surface of the lysimeter where weathering is more pronounced and an accumulation of solute elements in the deeper part of the lysimeter it is clear for na at 150 cm depth that the displayed concentration decreased over the time fig 12 such leaching was not observed for ca and so4 which displayed seasonal variations at 50 cm well reproduced by the model the measurements as well as the model reported fewer fluctuations at 150 cm deep fig 13 the variations depended on the water content that influences element solubility and thus mineral dissolution and precipitation 3 5 2 2 mineralogical evolution pyrite in the model decreased by 0 10 wt at 50 cm deep and by 0 02 wt at 150 cm deep this dissolution was congruent with calcite dissolution that was greater at 50 cm than at 150 cm fig 14 the dissolutions were consistent with the o2 availability in the lysimeter that enabled greater pyrite oxidation close to the surface than at depth fig 10 in addition pyrite oxidation released so4 in solution while calcite released ca the two elements were seasonally able to form gypsum when the water desaturation was enough to allow for gypsum oversaturation this phenomenon occurred at shallow depths down to 100 cm deep while the water content was too high below to permit gypsum precipitation ferrous iron released by pyrite dissolution was oxidized and continuously precipitated as goethite 3 5 2 3 release of trace metal elements the release of trace metals co ni pb and zn which occurred concurrently with pyrite dissolution was simulated together with their sorption on clays and iron oxy hydroxide phases the behaviour of trace metals was well described by the model at 50 cm deep while pb was overestimated at 150 cm deep figs 15 and 16 this overestimation is due to the saturation of the sorption site at this depth it is worth noting that the model satisfactorily described the trace metals behaviour despite their low amount compared to major elements suggesting an appropriate description of the different reactive processes within the tailings from these modelled results it was possible to determine a solid liquid distribution coefficient rd that varies with time and depth and is corrected from water content variations according to eq 12 12 r d c solid c solution where csolution and csolid are respectively the element concentrations at a given time in the solution mol l 1 and on the solid mol kg 1 because of the water content and concentration variations with time the distribution coefficients also varied with time in a large range table 2 nonetheless the distribution coefficients of each element were within the range of the values determined from laboratory experiments andra pers comm for co 225 l kg 1 ni 160 l kg 1 and zn 2000 l kg 1 but exceeded the value given for pb 1000 l kg 1 however these values were determined for saturated conditions desaturation as observed in the lysimeter had a high impact on the distribution coefficients that were lower at the bottom of the lysimeter under saturated conditions this can be related to the solute concentration in water which increases after evaporation increasing consequently the sorption jacques et al 2008a b 3 5 2 4 processes driving the system the water content and its variation are finally the key parameters controlling the whole reactivity of the system indeed saturation state rules o2 transport through the lysimeters and therefore pyrite oxidation this study confirms the importance of considering variable unsaturated water flow and the transport of reactive gas to simulate the weathering of rock piles mayer et al 2015 molins and mayer 2007 consequently fe so4 and protons were released in solution protons acidified the lysimeter but the carbonates mostly calcite buffered the system by dissolving debure et al 2017 mayer et al 2015 ouangrawa et al 2009 and released ca in the solution this chemical evolution recorded in the lysimeters was corresponding to the one identified during shale weathering littke et al 1991 and in laboratory oxidation experiments on cox shale tailings marty et al 2018 a decrease of the water content increases the element concentration in solution and enables the precipitation of secondary phases such as gypsum and goethite the modelled pyrite dissolution was higher near the surface 10 wt of dissolution than at the bottom 1 wt of dissolution of the lysimeter because of the higher o2 availability therefore goethite precipitation was higher near the surface than at the bottom which highlighted the spatial difference in the lysimeter a weathering decreasing with depth was expected in link with the availability in o2 its consumption and its re supply brantley et al 2013 littke et al 1991 vriens et al 2019 besides influencing the reactivity water content also induces water composition changes by dilution as previously observed by jacques et al 2008b transport of trace metals release from the cox tailings minerals mainly sulphurs is limited thanks to their sorption on clay minerals and on secondary minerals iron oxy hydroxide phases and particularly goethite are well known to complex heavy metal on their surface debure et al 2018 dzombak and morel 1990 lynch et al 2014 schultz et al 1987 the prediction of the trace metals behaviour in the tailings could be improved by dedicated sorption data the geometry and the thickness of the tailings could also have an influence on the sulphate content in the leakage water since pyrite oxidation is lower at depth and then a thick tailing could dilute the shallow release of so4 it is worth noting that the model was able to reproduce so4 evolution during the investigated period might thus be used to predict its behaviour over a longer period of time 3 5 2 5 uncertainties of the model and variability between lysimeters the model was adjusted to describe the measured water content fluxes and transport well but no fitting was done for the geochemical part however from one lysimeter to another the concentrations of elements varied by a factor of 2 this difference was partly due to the hydraulic conductivity that is different between the lysimeters nevertheless this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain the variations in concentration since a change in hydraulic conductivity by several orders of magnitude would be necessary to overcome this difference the presence of cracks and preferential pathways cannot be discarded particularly because of the size heterogeneity of the lysimeter filling material another source of variability may be the kinetic parameters chosen for pyrite and especially the reactive surface area the same surface area was considered for the entire profile while the alteration was greater near the surface than at depth the pyrite nanoparticles are major contributors to reactivity and dissolved first lowering the reactive specific surface marty et al 2018 this reactivity may partly explain why the modelling curves were in the upper part of the data thus the older lysimeters should be less reactive however the lysimeter with aged cox l5 and l6 did not release less so4 than the lysimeter filled with more recent tailings l7 and l8 in addition to the sorption model with a global surface site that was used here the dzombak and morel 1990 surface complexation model was tested to describe the retention of trace elements although the modelling results were consistent for co ni and zn the complexation constants of pb were too high and led overestimations of the sorbed pb on the shale by a factor of 1000 complexation constants were usually determined in the laboratory under well controlled and short term experimental conditions that can explain why they can be different from complexation constants determined from field data 4 conclusion flow transport gas diffusion and reactivity in the critical zone were investigated through a lysimeter and modelling study of the callovian oxfordian shale deposited as tailings the pyrite reactivity inside the shale tailing was highly dependent on the water saturation and the distribution of water over the lysimeter height the water saturation slowed down the downward migration of o2 gas inside the lysimeter and therefore pyrite oxidation as the lysimeters were desaturated from the surface preferential weathering was observed in the upper layers compared to the deeper parts calcite dissolution stemmed from pyrite oxidation and buffered the system preventing acid drainage at the outlet the co2 produced from this reaction then released to the atmosphere pyrite and calcite dissolution led to gypsum and iron oxy hydroxide precipitation as the main secondary phases the two phases were an indicator of the alteration and of the water desaturation gypsum during its alteration pyrite released sulphates and heavy metals that finally sorbed onto goethite and clay minerals such sorption is efficient for maintaining low concentrations of trace metals in drainage water and then to strongly limit their release in the environment however high sulphate concentrations up to 5 10 2 mol l 1 remained in the drainage water the difference of scale between lysimeters and tailings is not likely to affect the hydrodynamic and geochemical parameters determined for the lysimeters to the same extent as the discrepancies observed between laboratory and field measurements the lysimeter parameters are immediately applicable to tailings in order to predict metal and sulphate releases in the surface and groundwater however the geometry and the landscape design of the tailings may highly affect the elemental releases especially due to runoff and water travel time in the lysimeter a low runoff will limit the transport of suspended matter and promote infiltration inside the tailings by considering a more representative geometry of tailings in the predictive calculations it would be possible to accurately quantify the oxidation front in the tailings in addition it could be used to predict the migration and dilution in the deeper non altered part of the tailings of elements such as sulphates released by pyrite oxidation the sulphate and metal concentrations in the effluent water at the base of the tailings could then be estimated for environmental evaluation this study resulted in the quantification of the mineralogical evolution of cox shale and the drainage of major and trace elements in water in atmospheric conditions accounting for saturation and desaturation that can also be extrapolated using reactive transport modelling to quantify the weathering and evolution of clay rich

5385,shale weathering was characterized and quantified in a lysimeter and modelling study that jointly considered the flow transport gas diffusion and reactivity processes induced by exposure to the atmosphere of a recently excavated shale in this mechanically disaggregated shale presenting preferential pathways for water and a hydraulic conductivity at saturation of 100 cm day the water content and the seasonal saturation and desaturation cycles were identified as the main driving mechanisms of shale alteration the water content determined the diffusion of gaseous oxygen in the shale s unsaturated porosity which gave rise to a zonation of the oxidation of pyrite contained at 1 wt in the shale the acidification associated with this oxidation of pyrite was efficiently buffered by calcite but a release of sulphates cations iron and trace metals pb ni zn co cu and as mainly was observed besides pyrite and calcite dissolution iron oxy hydroxide formed and proved to be a good phase for sorbing trace metals whose content remained at low concentrations in the drainage water seasonal precipitation of gypsum was also identified in connection with the summer desaturation of the shale s shallow layers the hydraulic chemical and mineralogical observations made in the lysimeters were reproduced using hp1 a reactive transport code under unsaturated conditions it was possible to account for the gas diffusion where o2 availability controlled the reactivity with the shale depending on the meteorological conditions and the drainage at the base of the lysimeter keywords weathering critical zone vadose zone gas diffusion chemical reactivity shale 1 introduction the vadose zone have attracted more attention over the past decade as a privileged place for reactions between water atmosphere rock and soil this part of the earth system called the critical zone cz extends from the vegetation to the groundwater li et al 2017 and is a system that combines chemical biological physical and geological processes supporting life all together brantley et al 2007 the cz is subject to hydraulic geomorphological and climatic events wind rainfall flood drought that finally fracture grind and dissolve rocks anderson et al 2007 worthington et al 2016 the weathering of shales is of particular interest since clay minerals are ubiquitous on the earth s surface and play an important role in chemical element cycles co2 o2 nutrients in the atmosphere water and soils shales also serve as caprock for waste or subsurface gas storage and for which it is necessary to anticipate shale alteration the weathering of the rocks occurs over a variety of time and space scales from mineral grains to watersheds that makes it difficult to quantify the processes and their rates littke et al 1991 pacheco and van der weijden 2012 steefel et al 2005 to circumvent such scaling issues one approach consists of acquiring data in the laboratory and in the field and analysing the results with reactive transport models rtm in order to decipher the mechanisms occurring at the earth surface and subsurface goddéris et al 2019 hadermann and heer 1996 mayer et al 2015 steefel et

brantley et al 2007 jin et al 2010 reactions with atmospheric o2 and co2 induce nested alteration fronts in the subsurface from the atmosphere brantley et al 2013 lerouge et al 2020 in general the depths of these weathering reactions are unknown with a close link between the reactivity of the cz systems and the water table the water table can act as a buffer zone for contaminants molins and mayer 2007 as well as reducing the o2 migration rate and preventing mineral oxidization as observed in mining tailings ouangrawa et al 2009 acid rock drainage is a major concern when shales or mining waste deposits contain reactive sulphide minerals that are unstable in contact with atmospheric o2 blowes and jambor 1990 littke et al 1991 in addition to the acidification of the pore water the release of fe so4 and toxic metals cu pb zn and other trace metals has also been reported mayer et al 2015 besides water table fluctuations carbonate dissolution was one of the mechanisms reported to buffer the system and prevent pore water acidification brantley et al 2013 ouangrawa et al 2009 the prediction of the impact of sulphide rich tailings on the environment requires an understanding of the coupling between hydraulic flow transport and geochemical mineral dissolution precipitation oxido reduction reactions processes in the system reactive transport modelling is a powerful tool to investigate biogeochemical systems in the fields of hydrogeology geochemistry and biogeochemistry li et al 2017 macquarrie and mayer 2005 the simulation of metal elements release in the vadose zone taking into account water rock gas interactions flow and transport processes is the focus of an increasing number of studies acero et al 2009 mayer et al 2015 mayer et al 2002 molson et al 2005 however studies have focused on either laboratory experiments dm or the field scale 10 m without considering the intermediate scale that is reached through lysimeter monitoring the objective of this study is to provide insight into the chemical evolution of shale tailings containing small amounts of sulphide minerals by considering flow transport gas diffusion and water table variations rainfall evaporation at a lysimeter scale this study may help to reconcile the discrepancies that usually occur between laboratory data and field measurements guo et al 2020 maher et al 2006 pacheco and alencoão 2006 by more accurately controlling boundary conditions the quantification of the oxidation of the tailings material and its associated effects ph and redox state modifications in particular can be used to assess the possible release of sulphates and trace metals into the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 tailings of callovian oxfordian cox shale the studied site stems from the research conducted in the eastern part of france to build up a deep underground radioactive waste disposal facility in a deep geological formation the callovian oxfordian shale e g a clay rich sedimentary formation layer has been studied as a potential host rock for more than 20 years the thermo hydro mechanical and chemical behaviour of callovian oxfordian cox shale was notably investigated in an underground research laboratory located 500 m deep cox shale is an indurated shale that exhibits a fined grained texture characterised by a porosity between 15 and 20 de craen et al 2004 and pore diameters mainly ranging between 10 and 100 nm goddéris et al 2019 these nanometre sized pores induce low hydraulic conductivity 10 13 to 10 14 m s 1 and low diffusion coefficients descostes et al 2008 harrington et al 2012 with a biot coefficient of 0 6 and a young modulus of 4 gpa cox shale is a cohesive and stiff material charlier et al 2013 the mineralogy of cox is constituted by clay minerals mainly mixed layered illite smectite minerals and illite carbonates mainly calcite and quartz minor amounts of sulphur minerals 1 2 of pyrite galena and sulphate minerals celestite are also found as well as iron oxide and oxy hydroxides goethite pyrite is known to contain trace amounts of as pb co cu ni and zn lerouge et al 2011 in the conditions of the geological formation the pristine pore water is in equilibrium with the shale forming minerals gaucher et al 2009 and exhibits a ph of about 7 2 reductive conditions are found in the shale and pore water forced by an equilibrium with pyrite several million cubic meters of the callovo oxfordian rocks are expected to be excavated during the building operation of the facility this material will be stored as tailings at the surface where it will form a technosol scholtus et al 2015 therefore it is subject to meteorological variations that modify the cox chemical and mechanical properties due to decompaction disaggregation and leaching mineralogical alterations of various tailings samples were identified by erm etudes recherches matériaux poitiers france company using a jeol jsm 5600lv scanning electron microscope sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds examinations it enabled giving a chemical mapping together with the crystallographic information on these tailing samples the weathering of the rock stems from its mechanical deconstruction and from pyrite oxidation de windt et al 2014 vinsot et al 2014 that eventually increase the permeability of the rock from the surface to the depths and water infiltration will increase leaching of chemical elements due to dissolution precipitation of minerals a part of the tailings stored at the surface is also expected to be reused as backfill materials in the repository understanding and predicting the physico chemical evolution of the callovo oxfordian tailings is thus required to prevent any potential environmental impacts to design the tailing management scenarios geometry water cycle and to evaluate the physico chemical state of the tailings used as a backfill materials 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 lysimeter station the weathering of the callovian oxfordian shale was studied since 2013 using four stainless steel lysimeters fig 1 with a cross sectional area of 1 m2 and a height of 2 m andra

the surface for 10 years the other two lysimeters called l7 and l8 were filled with recently excavated 6 months cox shale from loose tailings monoliths were directly cored from aged tailings to fill lysimeters l5 and l6 while the lysimeters l7 and l8 were hand filled and compacted layer by layer 30 cm to reach a density of 1700 kg m 3 close to the density measured in the aged tailings 1800 kg m 3 since july 2013 each lysimeter has been continuously weighed by precision scales and is equipped with soil hydrology devices such as tensiometers water content sensors temperature sensors and suction probes at depths of 20 50 100 and 150 cm lysimeters are also equipped with tipping counters for the measurement of basal water leakage the combined soil moisture and temperature sensors used ump 1 umwelt geräte technik gmbh are based on frequency domain reflectometry fdr method and measure local changes in dielectric permittivity around the probe that can be related to changes in water content the soil moisture sensors measure the local conductivity around the sensor hence the measured water content corresponds both to the water in the large space between the grains of argillaceous rock and in the porosity of the grains matrix potential was measured through suction in ceramic filters by tensiometers tensio 160 umwelt geräte technik gmbh at soil saturation matrix potential is zero and is positive with soil desaturation the pore size of the ceramic filters is higher than the argillaceous rock pore size and then the measured suction potential corresponds to the one of the intergrain spaces of the tailing material water sampling was also performed at different depths using ceramic suction probes umwelt geräte technik gmbh and an air pump operated by the matrix potential value the sampled water was stored in 500 ml glass bottles where water accumulated between two manual sampling times every two months tipping counters umwelt geräte technik gmbh were used for basal drainage monitoring and for leaking water sampling each lysimeter was placed on three high sensitivity weighting cells 10 g resolution a datalogger has recorded and transmitted the weight of the lysimeters the matrix potential the water content the drainage at the bottom and the temperature at an hourly frequency since january 2014 the lysimeter station has been equipped since july 2014 with a weather station measuring rainfall temperature relative humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure and incident solar radiation data 2 2 2 water sample analyses the water in the lysimeters was sampled every two months from january 2014 to january 2017 the water samples were then filtrated at 0 45 µm and analysed at the laboratoire interdisciplinaire des environnements continentaux liec nancy france for total carbon and inorganic carbon contents using a vcsh toc analyser shimadzu scientific instruments and for anions cl no2 no3 2 po4 2 so4 2 br by ionic chromatography dionex major and trace elements al as ba ca cd co cr cu fe k mg mn mo na ni p pb s sb se zn were measured at the laboratoire sols et environnement lse nancy france using icp oes icap duo thermo scientific additional water samples were also taken from l6 and l7 in march 2016 and november 2017 to determine the 34s 32s isotopic ratio immediately after sampling the water samples were filtrated at 0 45 µm and cadmium acetate at 50 g l 1 was added to trap sulphurs and prevent their oxidation in sulphates the samples were filtrated at 0 22 µm in the laboratory and sulphates were precipitated with bacl2 the baso4 precipitate was then mixed with vanadium pentoxide v2o5 and heated at 1000 c in tin capsules under o2 flux the gaseous so2 produced during combustion was purified by gas chromatography gc and analysed at the bureau de recherches géologiques et minières brgm orléans france with an elemental analyser coupled to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta plus cf irms thermo fisher scientific 2 3 water balance water balance calculations allows for estimating the flux of water between the atmosphere the cox shale in the lysimeters and the drainage at the base of the lysimeter at the lysimeter scale to reproduce flow in the lysimeter and to determine the hydraulic parameters it is necessary respecting the water balance to verify the coherence of the recorded data in a lysimeter the water balance can be calculated by considering the precipitation p evaporation ep drainage at the base of the lysimeter dr and the variation in water content δs according to equation 1 e g cui and zornberg 2009 tarantino et al 2009 1 δ s d r p e p compared to a water balance usually calculated in soil the surface run off is not considered in the lysimeter water balance because the top ledge of the lysimeter impedes such run off rain interception and water uptake by vegetation can also be disregarded because of the absence of vegetation in our lysimeter study furthermore only drainage is considered at the base of the lysimeter since water can only flow out of the lysimeter at its basis the lysimeter and local meteorological data were used to calculate the water balance in each lysimeter on a daily basis from the 01 01 2014 to 09 04 2017 these data include the lysimeter weights i e the water content variation δs and the volume of drained water measured directly at the lysimeter base dr precipitation p and evaporation ep are also involved in the water balance the local meteorological data measured onsite were completed with data from the météo france weather stations of chevillon station 52123003 located 7 km from the lysimeters for precipitation and temperature records and houdelaincourt station 55248001 located about 20 km away for evaporation evolution determined using the monteith method besides some minor differences during rain events between the osne le val and chevillon weather stations the cumulated amount of precipitation was similar between the two stations data from chevillon weather station can therefore reasonably be used to cover the 6 month period before the installation of the weather station at the lysimeter site by combining the different available data various water balances were calculated to assess the coherence of the data the first one aimed at calculating the evaporation by water balance on the lysimeters using the direct measurement of drainage and the variations in lysimeter weight as the variation in water content at the lysimeter scale another water balance in the lysimeters was made to calculate the basal drainage by considering the water content variation obtained from the lysimeter mass evolution the precipitation series météo france station for the beginning of 2014 and then from osne le val weather station and the evaporation calculated with the penman monteith formula using osne le val weather station data a correction factor of 0 2 was applied to the penman monteith evaporation to account for the difference between the potential evaporation and the actual evaporation 2 3 1 reactive transport model in unsaturated conditions a reactive transport model that aims reproducing the data collected in the lysimeters has been set up to evaluate the weathering phenomena occurring in the cox tailings the approach undertaken here aimed at numerically simulating the water content and the evolution of solute concentrations in the lysimeters during the 2014 to 2017 period using the meteorological data and the basal drainage in the lysimeters during the same period as boundary conditions the calculation code hp1 v2 4 jacques and šimůnek 2005 jacques et al 2018 jacques et al 2008a šimůnek et al 2006 which results from the coupling of hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 and phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 calculation codes was used hp1 can be used to simulate water flow gas diffusion and solute transport in an unsaturated medium and can consider the set of chemical reactions expected in shale tailings by a thermo kinetic approach while the geometry of the lysimeter was represented using a 1d model advection and diffusion transport mechanisms occurring in the lysimeter were accounted for by a dual porosity model because of the mechanical deconstruction of the cox shale during its excavation the hydraulic properties of the tailings are greatly changed compared to the initial shale and a preferential flow develops between the shale aggregates with little transfers with the water in the porosity of the aggregates the preferential flow between the soil aggregates was modelled as the mobile porosity zone while the immobile zone corresponded to the porosity inside the cox shale aggregates the mobile zone corresponded to 10 of the volume of the lysimeter with a porosity of 1 while the immobile zone was considered for the remaining 90 of the volume of the lysimeter with a porosity of 0 15 the 2 m high lysimeter was represented as 101 nodes each 2 cm long and both a mobile and immobile domain was associated with each of these 101 nodes a schematic representation of the modelled lysimeter is shown in fig 2 where the main flow transport and reactive processes are indicated simulation aim to reproduce the data that have been gathered between january 2014 and april 2017 2 3 2 hydraulic and transport model to simulate water flow and solute transport in the lysimeters a dual porosity model was used šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 this model considered vertical preferential water and gas flow in the zone between the rock aggregates mobile zone and a water and solute transfer between the aggregates immobile zone and the mobile zone water flow in the mobile zone and water transfer between the mobile and immobile zones in a dual porosity model are described in hydrus according to the following equations based on the richards equation gerke and van genuchten 1993a gerke and van genuchten 1993b šimůnek et al 2003 2 θ m t z k h z h z 1 γ w 3 θ i m

is the relative hydraulic conductivity l t 1 θ is the volumetric water content and γw is the water transfer between mobile and immobile domains t 1 the water transfer depends on the head difference between the mobile and the immobile domains and is written as γ w α w h m h i m where αw is the water mass coefficient transfer between the mobile and the immobile zones t 1 the transfer of chemical components between the two zones of the porous medium is described by the two following mass balance equations gerke and van genuchten 1993a šimůnek et al 2003 5 θ m c m t s g θ s m c g t f m ρ s m t

saturation of the gas phase in the mobile domain θs m is the water content at saturation of the mobile domain dg is the pore gas diffusion coefficient l2 t 1 and cg is the solute concentration in the gas phase the pore gas diffusion coefficient is calculated from the local saturation and porosity according to the formula proposed by millington 1959 7 d g n m 1 3 s g 7 3 d g 0 where dg 0 is the gas diffusion coefficient in a free medium the coupling of chemical species transport as solute in the soil water and as gas species in the soil atmosphere allows the reactivity of the gases with minerals and the feeding of the gas species from the atmosphere to be considered depending on the soil saturation this coupling is of particular interest when considering the oxidation of pyrite by atmospheric o2 since the transport of o2 in water is slow and the dissolved o2 is rapidly consumed by pyrite without o2 gas transport the pyrite oxidation is restricted to the first cm of the soil column water retention in the mobile and immobile domains was defined by the van genuchten mualem relationships van genuchten 1980 linking water content and hydraulic head in a porous medium and calculating the

θs is the water content at saturation θr is the residual water content α n and l are empirical parameters of the retention functions and ks is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation 2 3 3 reactive model the reactivity considered in the model is based on the alteration mechanisms identified in the cox tailings section 3 2 major ca na mg k fe al s c si cl and trace elements pb co ni zn measured in the lysimeter solutions and involved in the reactive processes were considered as solute in the model o2 and co2 were considered as gas species that can be dissolved in water a selection of primary phases pyrite calcite and goethite such as iron oxy hydroxide can dissolve or precipitate through a kinetic control according to the kinetic parameters selected by marty et al 2015 thermochimie v 9b0 giffaut et al 2014 was used as the thermodynamic database for these calculations the composition of the considered pyrite phase includes pb ni co and zn trace metals at proportions given by lerouge et al 2011 gypsum completes the selected mineralogical assemblage as secondary phases whose occurrence is controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium for the sake of simplicity clay minerals were not introduced because of their slow dissolution rate compared to the simulation duration cation exchange involving na ca2 mg2 k and fe2 which occurs at the surface of clay minerals was nevertheless considered given its influence on the solution composition during transient chemical and hydraulic conditions de craen et al 2004 jacques et al 2008b the cation exchange capacity varying between 13 3 and 18 3 meq kgrock 1 was measured by cobaltihexammine extraction on tailings sampled at different depths at the installation of lysimeters l5 and l6 the cation exchange selectivity coefficients determined for the pristine cox claystone gaucher et al 2009 were used sorption of trace metals can take place at the surface of goethite minerals that locally precipitate in the vicinity of altered pyrite crystals and at the surface of clay minerals retention coefficients were fitted on the results for each trace element co log k 10 ni log k 9 7 pb log k 11 7 and zn log k 9 9 considering a site density of 0 28 mol of sites per mol of goethite dixit and hering 2003 k is the half reaction selectivity constant of the mass action equation describing the distribution of species between the exchange sites and the solution as defined in phreeqc code 2 3 4 hydraulic and chemical initial and boundary conditions the hydraulic boundary conditions used in the reactive transport model corresponded to the precipitation evaporation and drainage presented or recalculated in section 3 1 precipitation and evaporation series were then applied as upper boundary conditions on the tailing column while lysimeter basal drainage was used as lower boundary condition hydraulic boundary conditions were defined at a daily frequency the initial water content profile in the model was set to that measured in january 2014 on the lysimeters the rainwater composition was the chemical boundary condition at the lysimeter surface and was based on so4 0 017 mmol l 1 and cl 0 021 mmol l 1 concentrations measured on site and on rainwater compositions reported in appelo and postma 2005 for the remaining composition since the tailings were already oxidized at the beginning of the simulation the initial chemical system assumed for the model showed the effects of oxidation initial solutions in the lysimeter column corresponded to the composition of solutions at 20 cm 50 cm 100 cm 150 cm 200 cm in lysimeter l6 since the fe concentration was generally below the quantification limit 5 10 8 mol l 1 it was determined by equilibrating with goethite the ph of the solutions was altered until the saturation index of calcite was close to zero these six solutions were discretized further by linear interpolation into 26 solutions in order to reduce the difference in concentration of the solution between two nodes the cation distribution on the exchanger was calculated to be at equilibrium with the initial solutions the initial solutions contained trace metal concentrations based on data wherever data for the trace metal were not available at that particular depth at the jan 14 l6 sampling campaign the trace metal concentration for that depth was chosen based on the range of concentrations in solutions measured at a different sampling time regarding the gas phase the co2 and o2 atmospheric composition was set as the initial gas composition in the unsaturated porosity of the modelled lysimeters the initial model parameters are summarised in supplementary file a 3 results and discussion 3 1 water fluxes calculated from lysimeter data due to the release of the mechanical stress the flow properties in the tailings of callovian oxfordian cox shale are higher compared to the properties of the sound rock for in situ conditions indeed the rock has been milled and uncompacted during the excavation operations and has been partially recompacted when stored at the ground surface as tailings as a result the porosity and the pore size have increased compared to its initial state with an apparent density of 1700 kg m 3 after recompaction of the tailings the porosity can be estimated at 55 60 while it was of about 10 20 initially the tailings constitute an assemblage of µm to cm blocks or aggregates of rock hence the pore space of the tailings becomes highly heterogeneous with the occurrence of large spaces macropores fissures between the rock blocks and the porosity of these blocks is made of pores of very little size consequently zones of preferential flow are expected in such a porous medium as shown by the range of hydraulic conductivity from 10 3 to 10 8 m s 1 measured on tailings samples andra internal report in addition depending on the meteorological conditions the cox shale tailings are subject to variations in water saturation 3 2 water balance in the lysimeters water content and drainage in the lysimeters showed a seasonal evolution with a dry period during summer the measured daily weight variations could be irregular where a sharp weight variation was often followed by an opposite weight variation the lysimeters weight seemed to increase during rain events and to decrease shortly after on the other hand the drainage at the base of the lysimeters seemed to be less dependent on precipitation since heavy rains were not followed by a drainage outflow while heavy drainage could be observed without direct links to rain events this observation suggests a noticeable delay in the water flow within the lysimeters the evaporation calculated from the water balance in the lysimeters was not coherent because the expected seasonal variation with higher evaporation in summer than in winter was not found fig 3 a and b in addition negative evaporation was sometimes calculated following days with high positive evaporation and this inconsistency could not be solved by averaging the data over several days the drainage recalculated using the evaporation obtained from meteorological data with the daily values averaged over three days stayed in the range of the drainage measured from the lysimeters fig 3c but the instantaneous volume of water drained from the lysimeters base was lower and more spread over time the precipitation data the evaporation calculated using the penman monteith formula and the recalculated drainage that will be used as boundary conditions for the lysimeter flow simulations are summarized in fig 4 3 3 insights on water flow in the lysimeters water content showed a seasonal evolution with for the sensor at 20 cm a strong link with the rain events a delay was observed at depth in the seasonal water content evolution where the wet period at 150 cm was delayed by several months compared to the wet period close to the surface rock tailings at depth remained close to saturation with a water content of 60 the water content measurements showed a non negligible difference between the different lysimeters for a given depth however even if the water content value was different between the lysimeters a temporal similarity was observed between the water content increases and decreases the suction potential is null in a saturated porous medium and increases with the desaturation of this medium in agreement the highest recorded suction potentials corresponded to the more pronounced desaturation events close to the surface and during the summer period at depth suction potentials remained close to 0 indicating that the medium remained saturated or close to saturation suction potential gradients gave insights on the water flow in the lysimeters these suction potential gradients indicated a water flow from the top to the bottom of the lysimeters during the wet season and a reverse gradient during the summer period suggesting an upward capillary flow the potential gradients were generally higher between the tensiometers close to the surface than between the deep tensiometers at the lysimeter scale the mean gradient was about 0 05 cm cm 1 but much higher and reversed gradients of some cm cm 1 were occasionally recorded during dry periods 3 4 weathering mechanisms 3 4 1 elemental chemistry in solution the concentrations measured in solution were similar in the four lysimeters we chose to present only the results for l6 fig 5 the ph varied between 7 and 8 throughout the depth of the lysimeters the ph decrease observed with depth in january 2017 compared to the other measurements is not characteristic of an acidification from this date as such a ph decrease was also observed in november 2015 the ph values in the lysimeters were higher than the ph in the pristine cox shale pore water before oxidation in agreement with the carbonate ions that were lower the data were consistent with each other as the higher the carbonate ions the lower the ph millero 2007 nonetheless carbonate ions concentration might be expected to have been higher because of the calcite dissolution and biological activity however the degassing during sampling due to the exposure of the lysimeter water to the atmosphere lowers the carbonate content in solution the dissolved carbonate concentration was lower close to the surface increased until 50 cm depth and then remained stable cl in solution is two orders of magnitude below the values reported in the pristine cox pore water vinsot et al 2008 the value was slightly higher than the rainwater concentration measured on site 2 1 10 5 mol l 1 this concentration supported the assumption of percolating rainwater in the lysimeter with interaction with pore water note that the concentration decreased from january 2014 to january 2015 and then remained stable highlighting a possible leaching of cl that decreased with time the sulphate concentration increased with depth and remained in the same range throughout the study period sulphate levels in the lysimeter were two to three times higher than in pristine cox pore water for which redox reduced condition prevails and two orders of magnitude higher than in rainwater 1 75 10 5 mol l 1 this observation is consistent with a dissolution of pyrite oxidized by the oxygen from the atmosphere this observation is also consistent with the gypsum saturation indices that were at equilibrium from 50 to 200 cm deep and the observation of gypsum precipitates in the tailings na k and mg concentrations increased with depth in all lysimeters during the monitored period k and mg concentrations remained similar over time while na concentration clearly decreased between january 2014 and january 2017 at the surface of the lysimeters na reached in 2017 the concentrations observed in natural soils forest and meadow formed on callovian oxfordian shale scholtus et al 2015 in addition k and mg concentrations were higher in the lysimeter solutions than in cox pore water while the opposite was observed for na due to its leaching ca increased from the surface to 50 cm deep and then decreased until the bottom of the lysimeter this element was not only buffered by the ion exchanger but mainly by highly reactive minerals such as calcite that controlled its concentration in the callovian oxfordian gaucher et al 2009 such a concentration higher than the cox pore water could display dissolution of this phase however the saturation indices calculated on the basis of the solution analyses showed that calcite like dolomite was oversaturated and apparently ruled out this hypothesis fig 5 nonetheless the solutions were collected in the lysimeters every 2 months and were not preserved from the atmosphere during that period the pco2 measured in the cox is close to 10 2 atm gailhanou et al 2017 vinsot et al 2008 in agreement with the pco2 calculated from the solution analyses fig 5 co2 degassing no doubt occurred and modified the carbonate concentration measured by the toc analyser lerouge et al 2020 this may explain the calcite and dolomite oversaturation 3 4 2 isotopic ratio of sulphates δ34s all the results were reported in δ units relative to international standards defined by δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the measured isotopic ratio in the sample δ34s δ32s and in the standard which was cdt canyon diablo troilite for sulphur the isotopic signature of the so4 from the lysimeter samples ranged from 41 to 18 cdt table 1 and supplementary file b these values correspond to the pyrite domain in the pristine cox formation that ranges between 40 and 20 cdt lerouge et al 2011 isotopic analysis of well preserved cox pore water in anaerobic conditions shows high δ34s values between 18 7 and 22 3 cdt vinsot et al 2015 which was in line with the δ34s values of celestite lerouge et al 2011 after introducing oxygen into the preserved cox pore water samples the so4 concentration in the oxidized pore water increased two fold and the δ34s value dropped down to 16 4 cdt this decrease was interpreted to be due to release of so4 depleted in δ34s i e diagenetic pyrite present at the deeper parts of cox tremosa et al 2015 vinsot et al 2015 based on these results the isotopic analysis of the sampled solutions from the lysimeter indicated that the so4 concentration of the solutions contained a substantial amount of so4 released directly from diagenetic pyrite these results confirm the oxidation of pyrite in the tailings although they are not sufficient to quantify the extent of pyrite dissolution or the amount of so4 released by the pyrite 3 4 3 mineralogical changes mineralogical characterizations of cox tailings evidenced the presence of pyrite calcite and the precipitation of secondary phases gypsum and iron oxy hydroxides fig 6 the iron oxy hydroxides formation was linked to pyrite alteration and was described as a three step process involving the oxidation of disulphide s2 2 and fe2 that led to the formation of fe3 appelo and postma 2005 finally iron oxy hydroxides precipitated unless the ph remained below 3 debure et al 2017 the overall reaction is described by eq 9 9 4 f e s 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4 f e o h 3 8 s o 4 2 16 h the pyrite dissolution released protons in solution and thus led to an acidification of the system which was buffered by the dissolution of calcite towards the equilibrium ph of calcite 8 indeed the proton production caused calcite dissolution in agreement with equation 10 10 cac o 3 2 h ca 2 h 2 o c o 2 this calcite dissolution released co2 and ca that may precipitate with the sulphates coming from the pyrite dissolution to form gypsum according to equation 11 11 ca 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o c a s o 4 2 h 2 o note that gypsum precipitation is highly dependent on the water saturation indeed lysimeters faced weather changes rain snow wind over the years and seasons with water saturation and desaturation periods water loss led to an increase in the concentration evaporation of half the pristine cox pore water gaucher et al 2009 led to gypsum precipitation such water loss induced an increase in the sulphate concentration by a factor of 1 7 compared to the pristine pore water this factor reached 3 5 for an evaporation of 70 of the cox pore water this mechanism highlights the possible formation of gypsum at the top of the lysimeter that was more subject to saturation desaturation cycles nonetheless leaching and infiltration caused an increase in the sulphate and calcium concentrations from the surface towards the bottom of the lysimeters fig 5 therefore gypsum precipitated at the bottom of the lysimeter as shown by the saturation indices calculation fig 5 even if there was no water loss 3 4 4 trace element release in the lysimeters in the cox shale pyrite contains several trace elements as co cu ni pb and zn grangeon et al 2015 lerouge et al 2011 most of these elements were found at low concentrations in the solutions collected in the lysimeters fig 7 among them as was below the quantification limit 3 2 10 8 mol l 1 most of the time as was one of the main traces incorporated in pyrite with co ni and pb so this behaviour could be explained by the high affinity of as for iron oxy hydroxides that precipitate as a result of the pyrite dissolution daus et al 1998 debure et al 2018 giménez et al 2007 cu and zn are infra traces in pyrite lerouge et al 2011 explaining the low cu concentration while zn was provided by sphalerite zns dissolution furthermore zn and ni were present in feldspar and detrital minerals thus accounting for their higher quantity than co and cu the values detected for pb were explained by the presence of galena pbs in the pristine cox too lerouge et al 2011 with the exception of cu concentrations that remained in the range of the cox pore water the concentrations of co ni pb and zn were two orders of magnitude higher in the tailings water than in the cox pore water ba was detected as well mica quartz and feldspar were the ba carrier and their dissolution is the most relevant explanation for its presence in the solution ba released at the bottom of the lysimeters reached a concentration of 2 10 7 mol l 1 in march 2014 but stabilized and did not exceed 7 3 10 8 mol l 1 after march 2015 at the bottom of the lysimeters regarding se pyrite and fossil organic matter were the se bearing phases in the initial cox in sampled solutions se was under the quantification limit 5 3 10 8 mol l 1 in the older tailings 10 years in 2014 while it was still detected in the new tailings 3 years in 2014 but decreased from 3 9 10 7 mol l 1 in 2014 to 1 3 10 7 mol l 1 in 2017 at the bottom of the lysimeters this disappearance could be due to the leaching of this element or to its sorption on the iron oxy hydroxides jordan et al 2009 mn was detected as well at the bottom of the lysimeters and varied from 5 8 10 6 mol l 1 in the aged tailings to 1 8 10 8 mol l 1 in the new tailings mn was detected especially in the solutions of the aged tailings mn was carried by kaolinite micas and carbonates and mno represented initially 0 04 wt of clayrock such a mn concentration seemed to show a stage of dissolution that had not yet occurred in the new tailings other elements like cd mo and sb were always below the quantification limit during the three years of monitoring 3 6 10 9 mol l 1 2 1 10 7 mol l 1 and 8 10 8 mol l 1 respectively as well as cr most of the time ql 2 3 10 8 mol l 1 which was detected only occasionally but did not exceed 1 6 10 7 mol l 1 finally al and fe reached their highest concentrations 2 2 10 6 mol l 1 and 1 8 10 7 mol l 1 at the bottom of the lysimeters in the first samples they were not detected anymore after 5 months and remained below their limit of quantification qlal 1 3 10 7 mol l 1 and qlfe 1 8 10 8 mol l 1 3 4 5 gases o2 and co2 the most important mechanism driving the cox tailing alteration was pyrite oxidation which is highly dependent on o2 available in the lysimeters and on the exposed surface of pyrite to o2 the lysimeters were in contact with the atmosphere thus initially o2 was at the air value and decreased with depth due to its consumption by pyrite and because of the lower accessibility of the deeper facies permeability saturation however oxidation of the water samples collected every two months was not prevented between sampling times and during sampling and then no redox state differences with the depth were revealed by measurements on the water the redox conditions of the system can neither be assessed by the nitrite nitrate couple nor the sulphide sulphate couple the co2 amount was assessed by the measurement of inorganic carbon in solution that was compared occasionally with the alkalinity measurements both parameters were in agreement each time however as mentioned earlier the interaction with the atmosphere during water sampling led to co2 outgassing that lowered the analysed co2 compared to its quantity in the lysimeters 3 4 6 synthesis on the mechanisms involved in the cox alteration and release of elements microscope observations on tailing samples showed pyrite alteration in the tailings that finally led to the formation of iron oxy hydroxides as oxidizing conditions prevailed in the lysimeters pyrite dissolution led to an increase in sulphates in solution which was confirmed by δ34s isotopic analyses in the meantime calcite dissolved and buffered the system close to ph 8 and drove the increase in ca in solution the increasing amount of ca and sulphates may lead to gypsum precipitation as already seen for outcropping or shallow clay rich rock formations debure et al 2018 lerouge et al 2018 in addition desaturation phenomena due to warm and dry weather conditions could enhance this secondary phase s precipitation by drying the tailings in addition to its influence on saturation indices water content will affect the gas diffusion with a higher gas mobility under unsaturated conditions co2 migration influences the ph and the carbonate phases while o2 diffusion will be the driver of the pyrite oxidation which releases trace elements such as as co cu ni pb and zn in solution such metal elements have an affinity for clays and iron oxy hydroxides and their behaviour is expected to be controlled by sorption on these phases 3 5 modelling of lysimeter evolution and discussion 3 5 1 water content and transport 3 5 1 1 water content water content coupled with pressure head were used to determine hydraulic parameters through an inversion a single set of parameters were determined for the four lysimeters considering their similar evolution with time the inversion criteria by visual assessment were based on the ability of the model to describe the water content variations and delay at depth depending on rainfall and evaporation at the top of the lysimeters and drainage at the bottom the lower measuring depth 200 cm was usually saturated and so the reproduction of the data focused on the shallower depths fig 8 overall the modelled water content reproduced the most significant measurements especially the water content increase in july and august 2014 as well as the decrease in october 2016 finally the higher water contents were consistent with the rainfall at the shallower depth while at depth a retardation was observed given the scattering of the water contents measured between the different lysimeters the absolute water content value seemed less important to simulate than the water content variations over time at the different depths the water content evolution was modelled for a hydraulic conductivity at saturation of 100 cm day 1 within the mobile domain which is in the range of the hydraulic conductivities measured in tailings and in the lysimeters andra pers comm 3 5 1 2 chlorine transport water and solute transfer coefficients between the mobile and immobile zone as well as dispersivity are the parameters describing flow and transport in the double porosity model these parameters were determined by fitting the cl concentration over time in the lysimeters cl is usually used as an inert tracer no sorption exchange or precipitation as a mineral the initial concentration profile in the mobile zone implemented in the model was the profile measured in january 2014 i e equal to or lower than 4 10 4 mol l 1 the concentrations in the immobile zone were set to the pristine cox pore water concentration 4 1 10 2 mol l 1 vinsot et al 2008 the cl in rainwater measured on site was 2 1 10 5 mol l 1 cl concentrations increased during dry seasons while they decreased during wet seasons when chlorine was diluted by the rainwater resulting in concentrations 20 times lower than the initial chlorine concentration in the system fig 9 despite the two orders of magnitude of difference between the concentration in the immobile and in the mobile zone the cl in the immobile zone remained unchanged throughout the simulation indeed the higher cl loss was observed at 20 cm and represented only 2 6 of the initial cl concentration highlighting the small transfer coefficient between the mobile and immobile zone sensitivity tests made on the solute mass transfer coefficient revealed that only a small range of solute mass transfer coefficient values could reproduce cl variations in addition the contribution of the excess cl content from the porosity of claystone aggregates immobile zone to the cl content in the inter aggregate porosity of the tailings mobile zone 3 5 1 3 gas transport seasonal desaturation of the lysimeters enables gas infiltration throughout the whole lysimeter in this study gas diffusion focused on o2 and co2 that were identified as the main sources of reactivity according to the solution and solid analyses section 3 2 according to the results of the model fig 10 the higher o2 temporal variations were reported near the surface 20 and 50 cm deep while co2 was not present at a depth of 20 cm and displayed similar values between 50 and 150 cm deep to finally disappear at the bottom of the modelled lysimeter with the water saturation o2 was consumed by pyrite oxidation that limits its diffusion to larger depths together with the fact that gas diffusion is lower when water saturation increases co2 was released by calcite in response to pyrite oxidation maximal co2 release in the soil atmosphere occurred at 20 cm and was lower at depth because of the lower pyrite oxidation and the water saturation of the lysimeter 3 5 2 weathering of the tailings 3 5 2 1 water chemistry ph varied between 7 5 and 8 during the three years of monitoring fig 11 and supplementary file c for the other depths despite the pyrite oxidation ph do not reach acidic conditions such as those encountered in acid mine drainage in the cox tailing acidity due to the pyrite oxidation is buffered by the dissolution of carbonates involving a modification of the pore water chemistry modelling the evolution of the pore water chemistry in the lysimeter involves taking into account the reactivity of minerals coupled to gas solute and water transport the range of ph was well reproduced by the rtm model at the different depths of the lysimeter profile nonetheless the modelled ph was slightly lower than the measured ph at 50 cm deep and increased at the surface 20 cm deep because of co2 outgassing at larger depth the modelled ph was higher because of the lower reactivity of the rock at 150 cm deep the variations of ph over time were related to the presence or not of a gas phase and when o2 can enter at this depth pyrite was oxidized and ph was lower than under saturated conditions under conditions closed to the atmosphere the oxidation of the tailings and the dissolution of calcite led to in situ ph in the cox shale tailings of about 9 marty et al 2018 lower ph of 7 5 was obtained by equilibration with the atmosphere when air entered in the tailing porosity or during sampling k and na concentrations in solution were only controlled by the cation exchange at clay surfaces since we considered no minerals other than pyrite calcite and secondary gypsum and goethite in the model both elements increased at depth because of leaching from the surface of the lysimeter where weathering is more pronounced and an accumulation of solute elements in the deeper part of the lysimeter it is clear for na at 150 cm depth that the displayed concentration decreased over the time fig 12 such leaching was not observed for ca and so4 which displayed seasonal variations at 50 cm well reproduced by the model the measurements as well as the model reported fewer fluctuations at 150 cm deep fig 13 the variations depended on the water content that influences element solubility and thus mineral dissolution and precipitation 3 5 2 2 mineralogical evolution pyrite in the model decreased by 0 10 wt at 50 cm deep and by 0 02 wt at 150 cm deep this dissolution was congruent with calcite dissolution that was greater at 50 cm than at 150 cm fig 14 the dissolutions were consistent with the o2 availability in the lysimeter that enabled greater pyrite oxidation close to the surface than at depth fig 10 in addition pyrite oxidation released so4 in solution while calcite released ca the two elements were seasonally able to form gypsum when the water desaturation was enough to allow for gypsum oversaturation this phenomenon occurred at shallow depths down to 100 cm deep while the water content was too high below to permit gypsum precipitation ferrous iron released by pyrite dissolution was oxidized and continuously precipitated as goethite 3 5 2 3 release of trace metal elements the release of trace metals co ni pb and zn which occurred concurrently with pyrite dissolution was simulated together with their sorption on clays and iron oxy hydroxide phases the behaviour of trace metals was well described by the model at 50 cm deep while pb was overestimated at 150 cm deep figs 15 and 16 this overestimation is due to the saturation of the sorption site at this depth it is worth noting that the model satisfactorily described the trace metals behaviour despite their low amount compared to major elements suggesting an appropriate description of the different reactive processes within the tailings from these modelled results it was possible to determine a solid liquid distribution coefficient rd that varies with time and depth and is corrected from water content variations according to eq 12 12 r d c solid c solution where csolution and csolid are respectively the element concentrations at a given time in the solution mol l 1 and on the solid mol kg 1 because of the water content and concentration variations with time the distribution coefficients also varied with time in a large range table 2 nonetheless the distribution coefficients of each element were within the range of the values determined from laboratory experiments andra pers comm for co 225 l kg 1 ni 160 l kg 1 and zn 2000 l kg 1 but exceeded the value given for pb 1000 l kg 1 however these values were determined for saturated conditions desaturation as observed in the lysimeter had a high impact on the distribution coefficients that were lower at the bottom of the lysimeter under saturated conditions this can be related to the solute concentration in water which increases after evaporation increasing consequently the sorption jacques et al 2008a b 3 5 2 4 processes driving the system the water content and its variation are finally the key parameters controlling the whole reactivity of the system indeed saturation state rules o2 transport through the lysimeters and therefore pyrite oxidation this study confirms the importance of considering variable unsaturated water flow and the transport of reactive gas to simulate the weathering of rock piles mayer et al 2015 molins and mayer 2007 consequently fe so4 and protons were released in solution protons acidified the lysimeter but the carbonates mostly calcite buffered the system by dissolving debure et al 2017 mayer et al 2015 ouangrawa et al 2009 and released ca in the solution this chemical evolution recorded in the lysimeters was corresponding to the one identified during shale weathering littke et al 1991 and in laboratory oxidation experiments on cox shale tailings marty et al 2018 a decrease of the water content increases the element concentration in solution and enables the precipitation of secondary phases such as gypsum and goethite the modelled pyrite dissolution was higher near the surface 10 wt of dissolution than at the bottom 1 wt of dissolution of the lysimeter because of the higher o2 availability therefore goethite precipitation was higher near the surface than at the bottom which highlighted the spatial difference in the lysimeter a weathering decreasing with depth was expected in link with the availability in o2 its consumption and its re supply brantley et al 2013 littke et al 1991 vriens et al 2019 besides influencing the reactivity water content also induces water composition changes by dilution as previously observed by jacques et al 2008b transport of trace metals release from the cox tailings minerals mainly sulphurs is limited thanks to their sorption on clay minerals and on secondary minerals iron oxy hydroxide phases and particularly goethite are well known to complex heavy metal on their surface debure et al 2018 dzombak and morel 1990 lynch et al 2014 schultz et al 1987 the prediction of the trace metals behaviour in the tailings could be improved by dedicated sorption data the geometry and the thickness of the tailings could also have an influence on the sulphate content in the leakage water since pyrite oxidation is lower at depth and then a thick tailing could dilute the shallow release of so4 it is worth noting that the model was able to reproduce so4 evolution during the investigated period might thus be used to predict its behaviour over a longer period of time 3 5 2 5 uncertainties of the model and variability between lysimeters the model was adjusted to describe the measured water content fluxes and transport well but no fitting was done for the geochemical part however from one lysimeter to another the concentrations of elements varied by a factor of 2 this difference was partly due to the hydraulic conductivity that is different between the lysimeters nevertheless this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain the variations in concentration since a change in hydraulic conductivity by several orders of magnitude would be necessary to overcome this difference the presence of cracks and preferential pathways cannot be discarded particularly because of the size heterogeneity of the lysimeter filling material another source of variability may be the kinetic parameters chosen for pyrite and especially the reactive surface area the same surface area was considered for the entire profile while the alteration was greater near the surface than at depth the pyrite nanoparticles are major contributors to reactivity and dissolved first lowering the reactive specific surface marty et al 2018 this reactivity may partly explain why the modelling curves were in the upper part of the data thus the older lysimeters should be less reactive however the lysimeter with aged cox l5 and l6 did not release less so4 than the lysimeter filled with more recent tailings l7 and l8 in addition to the sorption model with a global surface site that was used here the dzombak and morel 1990 surface complexation model was tested to describe the retention of trace elements although the modelling results were consistent for co ni and zn the complexation constants of pb were too high and led overestimations of the sorbed pb on the shale by a factor of 1000 complexation constants were usually determined in the laboratory under well controlled and short term experimental conditions that can explain why they can be different from complexation constants determined from field data 4 conclusion flow transport gas diffusion and reactivity in the critical zone were investigated through a lysimeter and modelling study of the callovian oxfordian shale deposited as tailings the pyrite reactivity inside the shale tailing was highly dependent on the water saturation and the distribution of water over the lysimeter height the water saturation slowed down the downward migration of o2 gas inside the lysimeter and therefore pyrite oxidation as the lysimeters were desaturated from the surface preferential weathering was observed in the upper layers compared to the deeper parts calcite dissolution stemmed from pyrite oxidation and buffered the system preventing acid drainage at the outlet the co2 produced from this reaction then released to the atmosphere pyrite and calcite dissolution led to gypsum and iron oxy hydroxide precipitation as the main secondary phases the two phases were an indicator of the alteration and of the water desaturation gypsum during its alteration pyrite released sulphates and heavy metals that finally sorbed onto goethite and clay minerals such sorption is efficient for maintaining low concentrations of trace metals in drainage water and then to strongly limit their release in the environment however high sulphate concentrations up to 5 10 2 mol l 1 remained in the drainage water the difference of scale between lysimeters and tailings is not likely to affect the hydrodynamic and geochemical parameters determined for the lysimeters to the same extent as the discrepancies observed between laboratory and field measurements the lysimeter parameters are immediately applicable to tailings in order to predict metal and sulphate releases in the surface and groundwater however the geometry and the landscape design of the tailings may highly affect the elemental releases especially due to runoff and water travel time in the lysimeter a low runoff will limit the transport of suspended matter and promote infiltration inside the tailings by considering a more representative geometry of tailings in the predictive calculations it would be possible to accurately quantify the oxidation front in the tailings in addition it could be used to predict the migration and dilution in the deeper non altered part of the tailings of elements such as sulphates released by pyrite oxidation the sulphate and metal concentrations in the effluent water at the base of the tailings could then be estimated for environmental evaluation this study resulted in the quantification of the mineralogical evolution of cox shale and the drainage of major and trace elements in water in atmospheric conditions accounting for saturation and desaturation that can also be extrapolated using reactive transport modelling to quantify the weathering and evolution of clay rich

5386,understanding the temporal and spatial variability of river discharge of alpine hydrological systems is of particular interest due to their relevance for water uses including water provisioning hydropower production and touristic activities streamflow variability is highly heterogeneous both in time and space due to several reasons such as a differentiated response to climate change differences in catchment morphology and geographic location therefore catchment classification for these systems is challenging a suitable tool to determine the crucial scales of variability of a non stationary time series is wavelet transform in this work we compute the wavelet coherence between fifty selected gauging stations located within the inn river catchment to classify them by runoff behavior focusing only on long term variability between one and eight years scales this choice allows us to filter out the effect of local meteorological patterns and the effects of hydropower production in addition we decompose the streamflow signals in three levels 256 days three years six years using discrete wavelet transform to further understand the detected alterations in the streamflow signal three main runoff behaviors referred as three classes are found at the yearly scale focusing on two four years scales a loss of coherence between time series located at different elevations becomes significant in the 1980s prior to 1980 we detect four different behaviors while after 1980 we detect eleven different classes at larger scales the stations are clustered in four classes our analysis highlights that catchment classification may depend on the scale of the analyzed signal and it may vary both in time and space this research contributes to the development of new methods for catchment classification which is highly relevant for many hydrological applications such as prediction in ungauged basins model parameterization understanding the potential impact of environmental and climatic changes and transferring information from gauged catchments to the ungauged ones keywords wavelet transform catchment classification inn river basin 1 introduction in many disciplines a strong need for a widely accepted systematic classification scheme has been expressed baruck et al 2016 peel et al 2007 a robust classification system is crucial also in understanding hydrological complex systems mcdonnell and woods 2004 defining similarity between catchments to classify them into homogeneous clusters is relevant for several reasons including prediction in ungauged basins model parameterization understanding the potential impact of environmental and climatic changes and transferring information from gauged catchments to the ungauged ones toth 2013 however a generally agreed system upon catchment classification is still missing since it usually depends on the specific objectives of a study knoben et al 2018 mcdonnell and woods 2004 wagener et al 2007 several approaches with different underlying principles have attempted to categorize catchments some classification schemes consider the hydro climatic characteristics of a catchment brown et al 2013 buttle 2006 winter 2001 since streamflow is an integrator of meteorological climatic and morphologic processes such as surface connectivity leibowitz et al 2016 however a flow regime might occur in many climate zones andrés doménech et al 2015 and a single climate zone might contain many flow regimes haines et al 1988 other studies have classified catchments based on catchment structure functional catchment response wagener et al 2007 the use of hydrologic signature indices ley et al 2011 olden et al 2012 sawicz et al 2014 sawicz et al 2011 singh et al 2016 or its combination with physiography kuentz et al 2017 other authors have used partitioning and hierarchical cluster analysis such as self organizing maps som k means and ward methods ley et al 2011 lin and chen 2006 sharghi et al 2018 however the sensitivity of the classification to the initial partitioning and number of clusters which must be specified prior to the performance of the cluster analysis represents a drawback of the method ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 as a result catchment classifications are not unique castellarin et al 2001 samaniego et al 2010 in our work we apply a catchment classification framework based on the analysis of daily streamflow time series at multiple temporal scales for this purpose we apply wavelet transform wt since it is an appropriate tool to determine the crucial scales of variability of a signal and localize variations in the modes of variability within non stationary hydro climatic time series guan et al 2011 marcolini et al 2017b rathinasamy et al 2014 zolezzi et al 2009 in the past decades a wide range of hydro climatological studies carey et al 2013 fu et al 2012 have applied wt and wavelet transform coherence wtc and have shown that they are especially suitable to analyze the linkages between hydro climatic variables labat 2008 2010 labat et al 2004 nalley et al 2012 nalley et al 2016 the approach proposed in this work does not only rely on the classification of the time series considering different temporal scales but it also acknowledges that catchment classification can be non stationary this feature marks a difference between our work and other wavelet based catchment classification methods other studies in fact used wavelet based classifications such as wavelet entropy agarwal et al 2016b or coupled wavelet analysis with a self organizing map som approach agarwal et al 2016a where the non stationarity is investigated by dividing the data set into arbitrary segments in our approach non stationary behaviors in the classification procedure emerge naturally from the dataset and we avoid arbitrary assumptions therefore despite the ability of other applications of wavelet for catchment classification to provide a reasonable regionalization they fail to detect at which temporal scale and when in time different classifications can emerge this provides to our suggested approach an important advantage in comparison to others since the detection of non stationary behaviors without previous assumptions is relevant for finding the hydrological drivers leading to separate clusters moreover our work differs from previous ones for two additional technical reasons first we couple wtc analysis and discrete wavelet transform dwt analysis the first method leads to a rough classification of the behavior of several scales of a time series at a glance while the second one provides a more accurate and detailed quantitative analysis of the difference between the scale dependent signals of the analyzed time series second we classify the time series considering only large temporal scales of variability i e yearly 2 4 years 6 8 years in contrast to other studies paes and costa 2019 we want to exclude short scales disturbance due to river damming and hydropower plants operation which have been rigorously investigated in the alps alonso et al 2017 pérez ciria et al 2019 tuhtan et al 2012 zolezzi et al 2009 and affect scales up to one year moreover our analysis does not explicitly consider the heterogeneity in the hydrological response of a catchment caused by short term and local meteorological drivers flood events are therefore excluded from our analysis since they affect mainly short temporal scales ranging between one day and a month in the alps schaefli et al 2007 as a case study the present work focuses on the analysis of the streamflow variability of 50 different gauging stations located within the inn river basin and its tributaries with a time length of at least 40 years and catchment size of at least 102 km2 the long temporal scale of variability that we intend to investigate and the use of catchments where local characteristics should not dominate streamflow variability motivate the choice of these two selection criteria our analysis reveals a complex spatial and temporal dynamic in the catchment behavior at large temporal scales the proposed methodology allows us to test the hypothesis that catchment classification may change over time and may depend on the considered temporal scale we provide in section 2 and section 3 information about the study area and the proposed clustering method based on wt respectively section 4 contains the results of our analysis and in section 5 we discuss them considering advantages and limitations of the suggested classification method and the specific implications for our case study section 6 entails the conclusions that we can draw from our study and scope for further research 2 study area and data

gauging station id represented in fig 1 station name river name country geographic coordinates drainage area elevation of the gauging station mean elevation of the catchment minimum maximum and mean discharge and observation period to complement the information of table 1 table 2 provides a list of metadata concerning the gauging stations that present recorded modifications of the gauging reference point or its geographical coordinates the gauging stations we selected are between 40 and 114 years long for long term analyses more than 40 years of complete consecutive records is considered as a valid length for meaningful statistical results kahya and kalaycı 2004 partal 2010 moreover the gauging stations are representative of a wide catchment size range covering two orders of magnitude and catchment mean elevation from 503 m a s l to 2615 m a s l the study site has a typically hydrological alpine regime which implies humid and warm summer and fall snow and glacier melt in spring and summer and relatively dry winter korck et al 2012 the study area focuses on the middle and upper part of the inn river until the gauging station of wasserburg 420 m a s l at which the inn drains a catchment area of 11960 40 km2 the mean annual air temperature in this area ranges from 2 8 c in upper inn catchment above 1800 m a s l to 7 9 c in wasserburg period 1961 to 1990 auer et al 2001 the mean annual precipitation in the inn river basin is 1200 mm period 1990 to 2011 malagó et al 2017 ntegeka et al 2013 3 methods to show that catchment classification may change at different temporal scales and it is non stationary we apply wavelet coherence analysis and dwt grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 of the streamflow time series in the following we provide only a brief introduction to these tools as they are now quite common tools in hydrology sang 2013 3 1 continuous wavelet transform cwt to understand and apply the cross wavelet transform xwt and consequently the wavelet coherence analysis wtc first we need to introduce the continuous wavelet transform cwt the cwt allows us to determine signal periodicities and to detect the dominant scales and the associated time periods if xn is a discrete sequence with constant time spacing δ t its cwt is defined as the convolution of xn with a scaled and translated version of the mother wavelet ψ 0 η 1 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where designates the complex conjugate n the localized time index n the time variable s the wavelet scale and n is the number of data points in the time series hydrological studies typically apply the morlet function as mother wavelet because it provides a good compromise between the time and frequency resolution grinsted et al 2004 schaefli et al 2007 3 2 cross wavelet transform xwt and wavelet transform coherence wtc cross correlation analysis is a standard method useful to determine the time lag between two time series xi yi with i 0 1 2 n where n is the length of the time series the xwt of two time series xi and yi is defined as jury et al 2002 torrence and compo 1998 2 w xy w x w y where denotes complex conjugation the cross correlation is computed by keeping one of the two time series fixed and shifting the other by a given time lag several time lags are applied and then the one providing the maximum correlation is identified the aim is finding the maximum correlation and its associated time lag between two time series on each time step the correlation coefficient is defined as follows 3 r x y k 1 n 1 i 1 n x i μ x y i k μ y σ x σ y k 0 1 2 where k indicates the time lag between the two time series μ x and μ y are the sample means and σ x and σ y the sample standard deviations of the time series box and decker 2011 an additional helpful measure is how coherent the xwt is in time frequency space wtc between two time series represents the local correlation between two cwts and can be interpreted as the squared correlation coefficient of the time series components torrence and webster 1999 similarly to the correlation coefficient coherence varies between 0 uncorrelated to 1 fully correlated the study focuses on the coherence analysis which evidences the modes of variation periods that are correlated in the two signals wtc is defined as follows torrence and webster 1999 4 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator given by s w s scale s time w n s while s scale denotes smoothing with respect to scales s and s time smoothing in time for the morlet wavelet suitable smoothing operators are given by torrence and webster 1999 both xwt and wtc analyses compute the so called cone of influence coi which indicates where edge effects can occur and the results could have been disturbed due to the length of the available time series and the coi we limit our analysis to 6 8 year scales the xwt exposes regions with high common power and reveals information about the phase relationship however significant regions observed in a xwt spectrum likely overrepresented the variability in one variable and thus may not reflect an actual relevant cause effect relationship wtc is known as preferable to find locally phase locked behavior grinsted et al 2004 thus when comparing both techniques wtc has shown a better performance than xwt fu et al 2012 labat 2010 maraun and kurths 2004 the present study applied the wtc to evaluate the relationship between the selected gauging stations and for the catchment classification by runoff behavior wavelet coherence 5 statistical significance level is determined using monte carlo methods grinsted et al 2004 3 3 discrete wavelet transform dwt the dwt analyzes signals into progressively finer octave bands i e it uses algorithms that operate on scales with discrete numbers normally based on integer powers of two nalley et al 2012 tiwari and adamowski 2013 considering its properties the dwt analysis supports the detection of patterns and behavior changes at different temporal scales which are not easily perceptible in the raw data the discrete wavelet function can be computed as follows 5 ψ j k t 2 j 2 ψ 2 j t k where ψ t is the mother wavelet function j is the translation index and k is the dilation index the chosen mother wavelet was daubechies wavelet db20 mother wavelets with wider support as db20 have been found to be more efficient for time series with long term components maheswaran and khosa 2012 in particular smoother alterations gradual trends and slowly changing processes are easily detected with db20 pérez ciria et al 2019 3 4 streamflow classification in the following we provide a step wise description of the methodology and fig 2 contains a graphical description of the five steps used for the intra catchment comparison step 1 we select the gauging stations within the study area considering a length of at least 40 years and medium to large catchment areas of at least 102 km2 covering two orders of magnitude then we evaluate the quality of the available data determining gaps missing data errors and metadata information gathered in table 2 prior to further analysis we correct the detected errors e g the occurrence of a single negative value or of a single missing value of the streamflow datasets substituting them with the mean value between the previous and subsequent daily streamflow measurement we also tested the influence of the temporal resolution of the data on the results of the wtc similar results are obtained with daily and monthly resolution data when we focus on the yearly or larger temporal scales see figure a1 in the supplementary material therefore a coarser time resolution does not compromise the proposed classification method however daily data provides a more accurate localization of the scale and time occurrence of the changes in the signal than a monthly time series additionally it gives us the possibility to have a global understanding of the streamflow behavior at different temporal scales e g river damming hydropower plants operation as shown in pérez ciria et al 2019 prior to focus on large scales associated with climatic features step 2 we compute the wtc between all possible pairs of streamflow time series 1225 combinations to determine similarities and differences in the variability of the time series at multiple temporal scales fig 3 shows an illustrative example of the wtc outcome considering different gauging stations and the corresponding decomposed signal the ordered axis of the wtc plots represents the time in years the abscissa axis of the wtc presents the analyzed period from 6 months to over 16 years the color of the plot ranges from blue which means no coherence between the variables value equal to 0 to red which means total coherence value equal to 1 values of coherence lower that 0 25 are considered low coherence values we consider medium coherence values values ranging between 0 25 and 0 75 coherence values over 0 75 show high coherence areas circled with a black contour represent statistically significant results 95 confidence level determined using monte carlo methods only results falling inside the shaded area are not necessarily statistically significant since they belong to the cone of influence coi a region of the wavelet spectrum where edge effects can occur thus results inside the coi are not considered in our study the arrows indicate the relative phase relationship with those pointing right representing in phase pointing left representing antiphase and pointing straight down indicating the lead by 90 of the first introduced signal in our analysis the first streamflow time series introduced as input data step 3 visual analysis and classification step 3 1 first we perform a visual analysis of the results to investigate the value of the coherence i e the presence of low medium or high coherence values between pairs of time series focusing on i yearly scale for which we use y followed by the class number to specify that we refer to the yearly classification ii a medium scale focusing on 2 4 years designated as m iii a large scale of 6 8 years we present as l larger scales were not considered since they generally fall within the coi for the typical lengths of the time series available step 3 2 we conduct the time series classification those time series showing complete coherence coherence larger than 0 75 over the entire period for a specific interval of temporal scales i e yearly 2 4 years or 6 8 years are assigned to the same class of stations detected losses of coherence for a specific scale imply that two time series belong to the same class prior to the year in which the loss of coherence occurs and to different classes after this specific year or vice versa in our work due to an alteration detected in 1980 at 2 4 years scale for a large number of time series we conducted the classification of different streamflow responses prior and after 1980 no coherence coherence smaller than 0 25 or sporadic coherence areas of coherence with values larger than 0 75 are present for time intervals smaller than 5 years between a pair of gauging stations indicate that they belong to different classes for all the considered scales for the complete analyzed time span if the coherence values fall below 0 75 for time intervals shorter than 2 years or only for a specific scale within the 2 4 years and 6 8 years intervals then they are still considered members of the same class step 3 3 we develop tables with an initial classification taking into account the wtc results as main advantages the suggested methodology allows us first to detect streamflow similarities and differences among the gauging stations at different temporal scales and secondly we are able to accurately detect if the coherence is stationary or not step 4 we compute the dwt for each streamflow time series for the three considered intervals of scales i e 256 days representing the yearly scale 3 years for the 2 4 years scale and 6 years for the large scale 6 8 years the dwt analysis helps us to validate the previously conducted classification using wtc to better evaluate differences in phase and amplitude which are characteristic for the different classes and to clarify to which class belong certain gauging stations that present high coherence values with gauging stations of two different clusters after step 3 we computed the dwt of every selected gauging station for the yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales see fig 3 in the dwt plot of prutz and innsbruck at 2 4 years scale shown in fig 3 we can observe how the decomposed signals cease to be in phase at the same time as the loss of coherence of the wtc is detected shadowed yellow area for the dwt analysis in the results section we show the time span of the longest available time series in addition we compute the mean of the dwt spectra of stations belonging to the same class and we compare them with the mean of the dwt spectra of different classes to highlight differences and similarities between classes of stations this step is particularly relevant to obtain a final classification for which we set a minimum correlation coefficient of 0 85 as a threshold for stations belonging to the same class step 5 we summarize the results in maps and tables we assign to the stations belonging to the same class a specific symbol and color and we report them on the map in total four maps are produced reporting the classes identified for the yearly scale analysis for the 2 4 years scale for the 6 8 years scale and the final classification which includes all scales the aim of the maps is to illustrate spatial patterns within the previously identified classes 4 results following the steps of the suggested methodology once we had selected the 50 gauging stations for our analysis we computed the wtc between all possible pairs of streamflow time series 1225 combinations and we performed a visual analysis to determine similarities and differences in the variability of the time series at multiple temporal scales then we investigated the value of the coherence between pairs of time series focusing on yearly scale 2 4 years scale and 6 8 years scale subsequently we classified the time series according to the coherence and the specific scale then we elaborated the final classifications supported by the dwt analysis and we developed the maps representing these scale dependent classifications finally those stations belonging to the same class in all scales are grouped together 4 1 wtc visual analysis and classification 4 1 1 wtc and classification focusing on yearly scale at yearly scale the wtc results show three different behaviors in fig 4 a b c d and e we can observe almost complete coherence along the whole analyzed time span for pairs of stations belonging to the same class fig 4 a 4b and 4 e show the wtc of the stations kajetansbrücke prutz and innsbruck a clear very high coherence values larger than 0 9 at yearly scale was detected for the entire period thus these gauging stations belong to the same class called class y1 fig 4 c shows the wtc of feldolling and erb that belong to class y2 similarly fig 4 d shows the wtc of anger and bad aibling which belong to class y3 fig 4 f 4 g and 4 h represent the wtc of additional combinations of the gauging stations kajetansbrücke erb feldolling and bad aibling in this case fig 4 f shows the wtc between kajetansbrücke class y1 and erb class y2 fig 4 g displays the wtc between feldolling class y2 and bad aibling class y3 finally the comparison between kajetansbrücke class y1 and bad aibling class y3 is represented in fig 4 h these last three cases present a lack of persistent high coherence at yearly scale with values lower than 0 25 thus we categorize the gauging stations presenting this lack of constant high coherence into different classes class y1 is the most populated class 43 gauging stations followed by class y2 4 gauging stations and class y3 3 gauging stations as shown in table 3 the classification for classes y1 and y2 was straightforward since the wtc at yearly scale showed a constant high coherence during the complete analyzed time period on the contrary for class y3 the wtc does not display a complete coherence along the entire time series fig 4 d coherence values between 0 4 and 0 6 appear in class y3 but only for short time intervals not longer than 2 years 4 1 2 wtc and classification focusing on 2 4 years scale when we focus on 2 4 years scale m of the streamflow wtc we observe a higher degree of complexity in comparison to the analysis at the yearly scale as shown in fig 4 b and 4 d we observe a loss of coherence between different pairs of gauging stations from the 1980s which implies an alteration of the streamflow behavior therefore we conducted a classification prior to 1980 and after 1980 to assess the differences observed in the wtc four different classes are detected prior to 1980 and eleven classes after 1980 which we refer to as subclasses see table 3 we will refer to the four classes as class mn prior to 1980 with n from 1 to 4 number of detected classes the eleven subclasses in the most recent period from 1980 till 2016 are named as class mn i with n from 1 to 4 referring to the class to which they belong prior to 1980 and i a b c referring to the subclass to which they belong after 1980 in fig 4 a the wtc of kajetansbrücke and prutz shows a complete coherence along the whole analyzed time span and it is the representative case of the combinations of gauging stations that belong to the same class before and after the detected alteration in 1980 the wtc combinations that behave similar to fig 4 b and 4 e belong to the same class during the period prior to 1980 but to different subclasses for the time interval after 1980 in fig 4 c the signal of feldolling and erb shows a single loss of coherence limited in time and period it lasts not longer than 5 years and only appears linked to the 2 years scale this disturbance can be attributed to an alteration that does not appear to be significant for a long time and which is restricted to a specific scale 2 years of the entire analyzed range 2 4 years thus for these specific cases we consider that both gauging stations belong to the same class fig 4 d presents a particular case in which medium coherence is present from the 1980s but high coherence returns from the late 1990s this specific situation is documented in table 4 fig 4 f 4 g and 4 h present only sporadic coherence at 2 4 years scale therefore they belong to different classes differently from the analysis at the yearly scale at the 2 4 years scale we have 10 cases in which the wtc does not display any significant coherence with other stations such stations are designated as not classified see table 3 there is a remarkable increase in the number of different streamflow behaviors from four to eleven starting from 1980 the distribution of the gauging stations at 2 4 years scale is as follows 20 gauging stations compose class m1 prior to 1980 which is divided in five different subclasses from class m1 a to class m1 e class m2 prior to 1980 remains with the same 4 gauging stations after 1980 the 6 gauging stations that belong to class m3 prior to 1980 are distributed across class m3 a and class m3 b similarly the 10 gauging stations that belong to class m4 prior to 1980 correspond to class m4 a class m4 b and class m4 c after 1980 the not classified gauging stations remain the same during the complete analyzed time span to complete and complement the information shown in fig 4 and table 3 table 4 provides an inter comparison among the eleven groups of gauging stations indicating periods during which observed significant losses of coherence occurred and giving information about the coherence intensity low values between 0 and 0 25 medium values between 0 25 and 0 75 and for high coherence values larger than 0 75 among gauging stations that belong to the same class we use the letter c that represents complete coherence 4 1 3 wtc and classification focusing on 6 8 years scale at 6 8 years scale the wtc results allow us to categorize the gauging stations into four different classes the wtc analysis at 6 8 years scale is analogous to the ones presented in the previous sections as a distinctive feature while analyzing the wtc of the different combinations at these scales we detected 7 gauging stations that presented high coherence values with two differentiated classes class l1 and l2 in the preliminary classification these gauging stations belong to both classes and according to this both columns l1 and l2 are marked in table 3 in the next section with the aid of the dwt analysis we will reclassify them in table 3 we distinguish for these seven gauging stations the class l1 marked with o considered in the preliminary classification but discarded after the dwt analysis from the final class l2 marked with x in fig 4 a we can observe the complete coherence present also for the 6 8 years scale between gauging stations kajetansbrücke and prutz which are classified as class l1 high coherence at 6 8 years scale of the wtc between innsbruck and the abovementioned gauging stations that belong to l1 can be seen in fig 4 b and fig 4 e nonetheless similar results were detected while analyzing the wtc of innsbruck and gauging stations that belong to l2 table 3 using the wtc analysis alone we are not able to uniquely classify innsbruck and six other stations since they would belong to both l1 and l2 classes fig 4 c shows gauging stations of class l2 while fig 4 d of class l4 in the 6 8 years scale analysis we have eight stations which cannot be classified table 3 six of them already identified during the 2 4 years scale analysis 4 2 discrete wavelet transform to analyze in more details the behavior of the different classes we computed the dwt of each gauging station the dwt analysis also serves as validation for the preliminary classification in which we focused on three different scales i the dwt of 256 days will be considered representative of the yearly scale y ii the dwt of the 3 years scale is linked to the 2 4 years scale m previously analyzed and iii the 6 years dwt will support the 6 8 years l wtc analysis henceforward we will refer to the specific dwt scale as the scale or interval of scales of the wtc analysis that aims to validate or clarify this step is particularly relevant for the analysis of the large scales 6 8 years in which seven stations cannot be easily classified and display a behavior similar to two classes l1 and l2 using wtc thus the dwt results enable us to reclassify them in fig 5 a b and c we show the dwt at yearly scale grey lines of the stations that belong to class y1 class y2 and class y3 respectively in the same figures we also show the mean dwt computed for each class in fig 5 a the mean of the dwt of the stations categorized in class y1 dwt mean class y1 red line has similar signal frequency and amplitude over the analyzed time span in fig 5 b the dwt mean of the stations categorized in class y2 dwt mean class y2 in blue displays a higher irregularity than the y1 signal although a narrower amplitude than dwt mean class y1 fig 5 c shows the dwt mean of the stations categorized in class y3 dwt mean class y3 black line with even narrower amplitude than dwt mean class y2 in fig 5 a the dwt of the 43 gauging stations that belong to class y1 are included among them only four gauging stations 9 of class y1 have available data prior to 1950 see table 1 and therefore we can observe a larger difference between the calculated mean red line and the grey area in the following period where data availability increases the available number of stations explains the difference between the variability observed for class y1 and classes y2 four stations and y3 three stations fig 5 d shows the inter comparison among the dwt mean of the three classes to analyze in detail the behavior of the different classes at a medium scale 2 4 years we compute the dwt of each gauging station as shown in fig 6 a k the dwt of the classified gauging stations grey lines are subdivided in the eleven subclasses according to the wtc classification for 2 4 years scale after 1980 in addition the shadowed areas represent to which class the gauging stations belong prior to the alterations found in the 1980s yellow represents class m1 green m2 orange m3 and red m4 fig 6 a displays the gauging stations that belong to class m1 a and their dwt mean represented in red similarly fig 6 b to fig 6 k show the gauging stations that belong to class m1 b to class m4 b each plot includes the dwt mean red lines of the gauging stations that belong to the same class fig 6 l shows the dwt at 2 4 years scale of the gauging station klaushof brücke categorized as not classified the classification in four classes before 1980 is mainly caused by remarkable differences in amplitude and frequency among the four classes as observed in the 2 4 years scale classification also stations belonging to different subclasses starting from 1980 show differences both in amplitude and in frequency that cause a loss in the coherence but such differences are not immediately evident by the dwt analysis and hence the relevance of coupling both wtc and dwt just to give an example we compare class m1 a and m1 b between 1985 and 1990 some large fluctuations present in class m1 a are not visible in class m1 b also the behavior around the year 2000 is different since m1 b time series display a quicker dampening of the fluctuations occurred before the year 2000 than m1 a time series on the contrary around 2010 m1 b time series display a change in the amplitude of the fluctuations which is not present in m1 a time series fig 7 shows the dwt analysis for the large scale 6 8 years this step is relevant to determine to which class belong the seven stations that showed high coherence with both gauging stations classified as l1 and classified as l2 in the preliminary classification based on wtc results although advances in data sciences schwämmle and jensen 2010 have led to more refined classification schemes in hydrology where catchments can belong to different classes simultaneously we use the dwt results to further investigate the gauging stations runoff behavior and to reclassify them if significant similarities are observed with only one specific class fig 7 a and b show the dwt of the classified gauging stations grey lines representing the classes l1 and l2 their dwt mean is represented in red fig 7 c displays the seven gauging stations that were coherent with gauging stations belonging to l1 and with gauging stations classified as l2 in addition fig 7 d represents the inter comparison of the mean dwt of the gauging stations classified into class l1 fig 7 a class l2 fig 7 b and the mean dwt of gauging stations coherent both with class l1 and l2 gauging stations fig 7 c the inter comparison allows us to determine to which class belong the gauging stations under investigation in this case the black line representing their mean dwt is highly similar to the mean dwt of l2 gauging stations represented in orange with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 period 1960 2010 in contrast the correlation coefficient of this group of stations with the mean dwt of l1 is 0 8 period 1960 2010 therefore we consider reasonable to imply that for the final classification they will belong to class l2 and not to class l1 similarly to fig 7 a and b fig 7 e and f show the dwt of the classified gauging stations grey lines in l3 and l4 respectively including the mean red line of the signals 4 3 comparison with classical k means classification to compare the power of detection of our suggested method we conducted also the classification of the decomposed dwt time series using the classical k means classification burn and boorman 1993 razavi and coulibaly 2013 sharghi et al 2018 ssegane et al 2012 however k means is not a deterministic algorithm it starts with a randomized initialization procedure leading in some cases to different results zagouras et al 2013 thus the overall result is influenced by the initial cluster centers directly affecting its reliability javadi et al 2017 if the results vary highly from run to run this indicates that the data do not cluster well with k means this was the case for the 2 4 years scales and we hypothesize that the detected non stationarity might lead to a more uncertain clustering of the time series therefore we limited the comparison exercise to the yearly scale where all stations are classified by both methods and it showed the most stable results the results are given in table a1 of the supplementary material 84 of the clustering results using the dwt k means technique are in agreement with our wavelet approach in particular for cluster 3 we obtain the same classification using both techniques the dwt k means method and our suggested wavelet approach also display some differences in the clustering that are further discussed in the next section 4 4 maps development to illustrate the classification of table 3 based on the wtc and include the new insights provided by the dwt analysis of the mean daily streamflow we develop three different maps fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 show three maps representing the study area with the spatial distribution of the fifty analyzed gauging stations categorized according to yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales respectively in fig 8 the three classes detected while analyzing the yearly scale are represented class y1 red triangle class y2 orange triangle and class y3 blue triangle in fig 9 the four different classes detected prior to 1980 are differentiated by color class m1 in yellow class m2 in green class m3 in orange and class m4 in red in addition to represent the subclasses detected after 1980 different symbols are used fig 10 represents the final distribution of the four classes detected for the large scale 6 8 years class l1 in yellow class l2 in red class l3 in green and class l4 in blue in addition gauging stations categorized as not classified are represented with a grey cross finally we can summarize the classification based on the three scales and we can obtain the abovementioned total class revealing which stations belong to the same class at the yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales fig 11 the names of these classes are simply defined by merging the names of the scale dependent classes and are reported as total class in table 3 the geographical location of the final classification fig 11 shows that nested basins are generally characterized by large coherence and belong to the same class we observe not nested clusters only for the classes with mean catchment elevation lower than 1400 m a s l for a more detailed analysis and to account for the topological structure of the river system we have included table a2 and table a3 in the supplementary material as a qualitative indicator of the performance of the applied classification we have also included in the supplementary material figure a2 a14 the flow duration curves computed for the normalized streamflow data subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation the flow duration curves results are grouped in classes obtained in the final classification the normalized flow duration curves for time series belonging to the same class overlap in most cases however the comparison between the proposed wavelet based methodology and such classic hydrological signatures should be carefully interpreted since i the flow duration curves are constructed using the entire information contained in the discharge time series and ii they do not consider the occurrence of non stationarities 5 discussion 5 1 clustering physical explanation in this section we describe the possible physical mechanism underlying the observed pattern of different scales variability for each of the clusters geographical proximity of catchments could explain similarity between typical flows as well as climatic similarity knoben et al 2018 geographically close catchments are likely to have high membership degrees to the same representative climate s and consequently gradual spatial changes in climatic conditions are accompanied by gradual changes in flow regimes the suggested methodology allows us to focus on specific scales which are influenced by different hydrological processes or teleconnection effects beniston and jungo 2001 labat 2008 based on the wtc results we detected three different behaviors at the yearly scale a clear coherence at yearly scale was detected between most of the pairs of selected gauging stations that belong therefore to class y1 we observed that 43 of the 50 analyzed gauging stations are in class y1 including all swiss and austrian gauging stations and german gauging stations with mean catchment elevation above 1000 m a s l the gauging stations categorized in class y2 are tributaries of the inn which present mean catchment elevations between 800 and 1000 m a s l while the gauging stations in class y3 have mean catchment elevations below 550 m a s l to support the abovementioned information fig 12 a shows the mean maximum and minimum values of mean catchment elevation of the gauging stations that belong to the same class in addition the characteristics of the gauging stations categorized as not classified are also included fig 8 shows that y1 stations belong to the southern and most alpine part of the catchment characterized by relevant snow and glacier melt contribution auer et al 2001 schöber et al 2010 y2 and y3 stations belong to small subcatchments located in germany low inn river basin where no glacier melt is present and snow melt contribution is less relevant than in class y1 catchments due to the lower elevation ács et al 2018 this analysis highlights that characteristics of the river basins and particularly the mean elevation of a catchment play an important role in catchment classification and is readily identified by the methodology especially in alpine areas elevation has been proved to feature a relevant effect on snow related variables jonas et al 2009 marty et al 2002 that might directly affect runoff behavior additionally from the comparison of the dwt k means approach and our suggested wavelet approach we can observe that the members of cluster 1 using our approach present less variability in terms of catchment area mean q and mean catchment elevation than using the k means approach the variability in cluster 2 is lower using the k means method than our wavelet based method in case of catchment area and mean q but not for mean catchment elevation the second cluster using the k means method displays considerably higher spreading in terms of geographic location than our classification see table a1 in the supplementary material for cluster 3 we obtain the same clustering therefore both approaches are able to capture the different seasonality from the stations with the lowest mean elevation catchment i e anger bad aibling and weichselbaum we believe that less variability among the members of the same class in the physical characteristics of the catchment and especially in mean catchment elevation and geographical location of the stations is an indicator of a better performance of the method the geographic location of the stations is more relevant than elevation for larger scales clustering although elevation still remains an important factor fig 12 before 1980 the analysis of the 2 4 years scales fig 9 shows that the upper inn river basin and the inn itself up to wasserburg have the same variability class m1 this means that the contribution of the tributaries belonging to different classes does not influence this part of the signal low elevation catchments class m4 below 1300 m a s l behave similarly the sill river has its own behavior class m2 and the ziller river as well class m3 curiously the brixentaler ache shares the same behavior of the ziller after 1980 each main tributary has its own behavior and the inn river displays three different behaviors in the signal up to the station prutz after the confluence with the sanna river until kirchbichl and then from oberaudorf until wasserburg fig 9 considering the 6 8 years variability the inn river up to the station prutz the ötztaler ache the attel at anger and the glonn at bad aibling have different behaviors than all other stations the upper inn and the ötztaler ache may differ to the other stations due to the large glaciers present in the catchments and the high elevation fig 12 interestingly those stations that required the classification using dwt since only using wtc they were assigned to both l1 and l2 all belong to the m1c and the m2 subclasses the m1c stations belong to the inn after the confluence with the sanna river and this can explain the difficulty in distinguishing the behavior of those stations as they entail the contribution of both l1 and l2 rivers the m2 subclass corresponds to the sill river which also receives a contribution from glacier melt and hence share some similarity with the l1 class regarding the monitoring points that belong to the not classified category we should notice that the one denominated ekw valtorta is highly affected by water management activities hydropower production which disturb the natural streamflow and does not match with the remaining analyzed gauging stations at 2 4 years scale the remaining stations that were not classified are characterized by catchment areas smaller than 300 km2 fig 12b therefore we hypothesize that either local geographical features might have a large impact on these relatively small alpine basins or that those time series may have inaccurate measurements in both cases our analysis is helpful to call for further hydrological studies in these catchments to test these hypotheses on the contrary in larger catchments averaging effects might reduce the importance of specific site characteristics meißl et al 2017 merz and blöschl 2009 and we observe that the classification procedure gives more consistent results in fact 95 of the gauging stations that were classified at yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales have catchment area larger than 300 km2 fig 12c shows the mean maximum and minimum values of mean streamflow for each group of gauging stations that belong to the same class at yearly 2 4 years 6 8 years scales as expected the figure shows a high resemblance with fig 12b which represents the catchment area we can observe that in general catchment area and mean streamflow are more variable within a class than mean catchment elevation for the class y1m3bl1 however we can observe a higher variability in mean catchment elevation but very similar mean streamflow values for the not classified stations we observe that they belong to a wide range of mean catchment elevation values but share similar catchment area from 97 km2 to 295 km2 and mean streamflow from 1 m3 s to 5 37 m3 s overall although no morphological information is given as input to the clustering procedure the outcomes show that classes contain generally nested catchments and a predominant consistency in terms of elevation and location catchment area and mean streamflow 5 2 change point in the 1980s the observed loss of coherence for the 2 4 years scale in 1980 between different pairs of gauging stations implies local alterations of the streamflow behavior an exhaustive review of the available metadata and literature is necessary to corroborate the detected alteration and to investigate the possible drivers that impact the streamflow of the inn river basin it is noteworthy to mention that although 23 stations show changes of the gauging reference point between 1977 and 1983 table 2 no direct correlation with our results is found in fact there are gauging stations that belong to the same class after 1980 even if some of them present a change of the gauging reference point in 1980 this is the case for example of class m1a which includes swiss gauging stations with no modifications and the gauging stations located in kajetansbrücke and prutz which have both a modification of the gauging reference point in 1981 and 1979 respectively moreover there are additional modifications included in the table which occur at different times but no additional alterations were found in the wtc or the dwt at the 2 4 years scale pérez ciria et al 2019 focused on reservoirs and hydropower plants impacts on the streamflow regime of the inn and adige river basins the detected change points occur at shorter temporal scales weekly to yearly and are associated in the past to dams and hydropower plants construction or more recently to changes in the hydropower plants management however the temporal occurrence of these streamflow alterations does not match the loss of coherence identified in the present study therefore to interpret the results we reviewed several works that focused on detecting alterations of different geophysical variables in the alpine region auer et al 2001 beniston et al 2018 bocchiola 2014 böhm et al 2001 mallucci et al 2019 marcolini et al 2017a marcolini et al 2017b reid et al 2016 rottler et al 2019 schöner et al 2019 shift detection analysis of snow days revealed that swiss winters are strongly characterized by a significant step like change in snow days at the end of the 1980s marty 2008 a significant intensification of the melting rate from the 1980s was reported in 9 alpine glaciers haeberli et al 2017 including silvretta glacier switzerland located close to the gauging stations at tarasp and martina both class y1m1al1 and hintereis kesselwand and vernagt within the catchment area of huben and tumpen both class y1m1el3 in addition focusing on the net surface mass balance steady state conditions were found during the 1962 1982 period a negative mass balance have been observed since about 1982 with a faster mass loss for the period 2003 2013 which indicates a clear and regionally consistent acceleration of mass loss over recent decades over the entire european alps schöner et al 2017 vincent et al 2017 focusing on the swiss alps reid et al 2016 detected changes in swiss stratospheric and tropospheric temperature an increase of river groundwater and lake temperatures and a decrease of snow days in the 1980s additionally two short periods of mass gain 1910s and late 1970s and two periods of rapid mass loss 1940s and late1980s to present were detected huss et al 2010 a reduction in the total amount of snow and also snow cover duration since the mid 1980s was detected and mainly attributed to warmer temperatures in the european alps hantel and hirtl wielke 2007 scherrer et al 2004 serquet et al 2011 impacts were particularly evident at elevations below 1200 m beniston 2006 in contrast other sites above 2000 m experienced an increase in the amount of snow these insights are consistent with the increased heterogeneity detected from the 1980s in our study site in which 82 of the analyzed subcatchments contain regions with elevation between 1200 m and 2000 m studies focusing on the alpine region have observed similar heterogeneity patterns from the 1980s while describing climatic areas ács et al 2018 and catchment features such as soil conservation service curve number scs cn merz and blöschl 2009 therefore the increase in classes i e in spatial streamflow variability detected in this study may be related to changes in snow and glacier dynamics or land use yet further research should be performed to assess a causal effect similarly causes of alterations in the flow behavior associated to changes in climate conditions including the impact of large scale climate oscillations vegetation or evapotranspiration require a more in depth analysis and therefore need to be further investigated 5 3 advantages and limitations of the method to successfully apply the suggested methodology some requirements must be satisfied a minimum time series length is required to obtain statistical significant results out of the coi additionally although the clustering methodology is straightforward as it happens with several classical clustering techniques the causal effects that lead to the detected heterogeneous responses need to be further investigated with tailored studies the suggested methodology presents also several advantages in comparison to other available methods one of its main strengths is that we do not need to specify in advance the number of clusters we couple wtc analysis and dwt analysis thus the first method allows us to obtain a rough classification of the behavior of several scales of a time series at a glance while the second one is helpful to have a more accurate and detailed quantitative analysis of the difference between the scale dependent signals of the analyzed time series our analysis allows us to quickly identify the temporal non stationarity of catchment classification while focusing on different temporal scales this allows us to assess changes in the catchment behavior affecting only specific scales of the streamflow signal therefore in contrast to previous studies based on catchment classification using wavelet analysis we do not consider only different behaviors in the temporal scales of the signals as it is done by using the wavelet entropy agarwal et al 2016b but we identify periods of time in which the coherence differs moreover we filter out local meteorological effects and the effects of hydropower production considering only the long term behavior of the streamflow the proposed approach is able to detect the heterogeneous behavior of streamflow within a catchment and it reveals its complex spatial and temporal dynamics 6 conclusion the implications of our study can be summarized as follows i the classification at the yearly scale is directly linked to seasonality and divides snow and glacier dominated catchments from more rain dominated catchments with lower mean catchment elevation an alteration of the coherence in a cluster of this specific temporal scale can be easily detected with the proposed methodology and hence it can support climate change studies e g identification of catchment areas that display a hydrological shift from snowfall dominated to rainfall dominated regimes ii this work shows two main interesting characteristics of the inn catchment first the catchment can be classified differently according to the temporal scale secondly the similarity between catchments can change over time this has important implications for the validation of hydrological models as it could be non trivial to reproduce such heterogeneous non stationary behavior in particular if the meteorological drivers are not accurate enough or do not reflect this non stationary behavior it will be probably needed to define time dependent and heterogeneous model parameters iii climate change impacts caused by teleconnection effects are linked to large temporal scales labat 2006 2010 labat et al 2005 focusing on these specific scales allows us to assess the likely heterogeneous response of alpine catchments to teleconnection effects and to identify the most sensitive regions within a catchment this research contributes to the development of a robust method for catchment classification which is highly relevant for many hydrological applications such as prediction in ungauged basins model parameterization understanding the potential impact of environmental and climatic changes and transferring information from gauged catchments to the ungauged ones our analysis highlights that catchment classification may depend on the scale of the analyzed signal and it may vary both in time and space moreover the proposed method could help to identify catchments where further hydrological studies are required such as catchments that do not display any similarity with the surrounding ones it might also help to test hypotheses about the impact of climate change and teleconnection effects on hydrological processes in complex systems like the alps in our case study we identified a significant change in streamflow variability starting from the 1980s at the temporal scale of 2 4 years despite this result is consistent with changes in the alpine cryosphere further studies should investigate why these scales of streamflow are more affected than others in addition the suggested methodology can be easily applied to classify other geophysical and hydrological variables and become an alternative for the most classical clustering

5386,understanding the temporal and spatial variability of river discharge of alpine hydrological systems is of particular interest due to their relevance for water uses including water provisioning hydropower production and touristic activities streamflow variability is highly heterogeneous both in time and space due to several reasons such as a differentiated response to climate change differences in catchment morphology and geographic location therefore catchment classification for these systems is challenging a suitable tool to determine the crucial scales of variability of a non stationary time series is wavelet transform in this work we compute the wavelet coherence between fifty selected gauging stations located within the inn river catchment to classify them by runoff behavior focusing only on long term variability between one and eight years scales this choice allows us to filter out the effect of local meteorological patterns and the effects of hydropower production in addition we decompose the streamflow signals in three levels 256 days three years six years using discrete wavelet transform to further understand the detected alterations in the streamflow signal three main runoff behaviors referred as three classes are found at the yearly scale focusing on two four years scales a loss of coherence between time series located at different elevations becomes significant in the 1980s prior to 1980 we detect four different behaviors while after 1980 we detect eleven different classes at larger scales the stations are clustered in four classes our analysis highlights that catchment classification may depend on the scale of the analyzed signal and it may vary both in time and space this research contributes to the development of new methods for catchment classification which is highly relevant for many hydrological applications such as prediction in ungauged basins model parameterization understanding the potential impact of environmental and climatic changes and transferring information from gauged catchments to the ungauged ones keywords wavelet transform catchment classification inn river basin 1 introduction in many disciplines a strong need for a widely accepted systematic classification scheme has been expressed baruck et al 2016 peel et al 2007 a robust classification system is crucial also in understanding hydrological complex systems mcdonnell and woods 2004 defining similarity between catchments to classify them into homogeneous clusters is relevant for several reasons including prediction in ungauged basins model parameterization understanding the potential impact of environmental and climatic changes and transferring information from gauged catchments to the ungauged ones toth 2013 however a generally agreed system upon catchment classification is still missing since it usually depends on the specific objectives of a study knoben et al 2018 mcdonnell and woods 2004 wagener et al 2007 several approaches with different underlying principles have attempted to categorize catchments some classification schemes consider the hydro climatic characteristics of a catchment brown et al 2013 buttle 2006 winter 2001 since streamflow is an integrator of meteorological climatic and morphologic processes such as surface connectivity leibowitz et al 2016 however a flow regime might occur in many climate zones andrés doménech et al 2015 and a single climate zone might contain many flow regimes haines et al 1988 other studies have classified catchments based on catchment structure functional catchment response wagener et al 2007 the use of hydrologic signature indices ley et al 2011 olden et al 2012 sawicz et al 2014 sawicz et al 2011 singh et al 2016 or its combination with physiography kuentz et al 2017 other authors have used partitioning and hierarchical cluster analysis such as self organizing maps som k means and ward methods ley et al 2011 lin and chen 2006 sharghi et al 2018 however the sensitivity of the classification to the initial partitioning and number of clusters which must be specified prior to the performance of the cluster analysis represents a drawback of the method ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 as a result catchment classifications are not unique castellarin et al 2001 samaniego et al 2010 in our work we apply a catchment classification framework based on the analysis of daily streamflow time series at multiple temporal scales for this purpose we apply wavelet transform wt since it is an appropriate tool to determine the crucial scales of variability of a signal and localize variations in the modes of variability within non stationary hydro climatic time series guan et al 2011 marcolini et al 2017b rathinasamy et al 2014 zolezzi et al 2009 in the past decades a wide range of hydro climatological studies carey et al 2013 fu et al 2012 have applied wt and wavelet transform coherence wtc and have shown that they are especially suitable to analyze the linkages between hydro climatic variables labat 2008 2010 labat et al 2004 nalley et al 2012 nalley et al 2016 the approach proposed in this work does not only rely on the classification of the time series considering different temporal scales but it also acknowledges that catchment classification can be non stationary this feature marks a difference between our work and other wavelet based catchment classification methods other studies in fact used wavelet based classifications such as wavelet entropy agarwal et al 2016b or coupled wavelet analysis with a self organizing map som approach agarwal et al 2016a where the non stationarity is investigated by dividing the data set into arbitrary segments in our approach non stationary behaviors in the classification procedure emerge naturally from the dataset and we avoid arbitrary assumptions therefore despite the ability of other applications of wavelet for catchment classification to provide a reasonable regionalization they fail to detect at which temporal scale and when in time different classifications can emerge this provides to our suggested approach an important advantage in comparison to others since the detection of non stationary behaviors without previous assumptions is relevant for finding the hydrological drivers leading to separate clusters moreover our work differs from previous ones for two additional technical reasons first we couple wtc analysis and discrete wavelet transform dwt analysis the first method leads to a rough classification of the behavior of several scales of a time series at a glance while the second one provides a more accurate and detailed quantitative analysis of the difference between the scale dependent signals of the analyzed time series second we classify the time series considering only large temporal scales of variability i e yearly 2 4 years 6 8 years in contrast to other studies paes and costa 2019 we want to exclude short scales disturbance due to river damming and hydropower plants operation which have been rigorously investigated in the alps alonso et al 2017 pérez ciria et al 2019 tuhtan et al 2012 zolezzi et al 2009 and affect scales up to one year moreover our analysis does not explicitly consider the heterogeneity in the hydrological response of a catchment caused by short term and local meteorological drivers flood events are therefore excluded from our analysis since they affect mainly short temporal scales ranging between one day and a month in the alps schaefli et al 2007 as a case study the present work focuses on the analysis of the streamflow variability of 50 different gauging stations located within the inn river basin and its tributaries with a time length of at least 40 years and catchment size of at least 102 km2 the long temporal scale of variability that we intend to investigate and the use of catchments where local characteristics should not dominate streamflow variability motivate the choice of these two selection criteria our analysis reveals a complex spatial and temporal dynamic in the catchment behavior at large temporal scales the proposed methodology allows us to test the hypothesis that catchment classification may change over time and may depend on the considered temporal scale we provide in section 2 and section 3 information about the study area and the proposed clustering method based on wt respectively section 4 contains the results of our analysis and in section 5 we discuss them considering advantages and limitations of the suggested classification method and the specific implications for our case study section 6 entails the conclusions that we can draw from our study and scope for further research 2 study area and data in our work we consider mean daily streamflow time series q from 50 gauging stations located along the inn river basin and its tributaries table 1 the swiss bundesamt für umwelt abteilung hydrologie

provided the data and metadata for this study in fig 1 we present the study area and the spatial location of the 50 gauging stations table 1 contains the key features of the analyzed monitoring points gauging station id represented in fig 1 station name river name country geographic coordinates drainage area elevation of the gauging station mean elevation of the catchment minimum maximum and mean discharge and observation period to complement the information of table 1 table 2 provides a list of metadata concerning the gauging stations that present recorded modifications of the gauging reference point or its geographical coordinates the gauging stations we selected are between 40 and 114 years long for long term analyses more than 40 years of complete consecutive records is considered as a valid length for meaningful statistical results kahya and kalaycı 2004 partal 2010 moreover the gauging stations are representative of a wide catchment size range covering two orders of magnitude and catchment mean elevation from 503 m a s l to 2615 m a s l the study site has a typically hydrological alpine regime which implies humid and warm summer and fall snow and glacier melt in spring and summer and relatively dry winter korck et al 2012 the study area focuses on the middle and upper part of the inn river until the gauging station of wasserburg 420 m a s l at which the inn drains a catchment area of 11960 40 km2 the mean annual air temperature in this area ranges from 2 8 c in upper inn catchment above 1800 m a s l to 7 9 c in wasserburg period 1961 to 1990 auer et al 2001 the mean annual precipitation in the inn river basin is 1200 mm period 1990 to 2011 malagó et al 2017 ntegeka et al 2013 3 methods to show that catchment classification may change at different temporal scales and it is non stationary we apply wavelet coherence analysis and dwt grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 of the streamflow time series in the following we provide only a brief introduction to these tools as they are now quite common tools in hydrology sang 2013 3 1 continuous wavelet transform cwt to understand and apply the cross wavelet transform xwt and consequently the wavelet coherence analysis wtc first we need to introduce the continuous wavelet transform cwt the cwt allows us to determine signal periodicities and to detect the dominant scales and the associated time periods if xn is a discrete sequence with constant time spacing δ t its cwt is defined as the convolution of xn with a scaled and translated version of the mother wavelet ψ 0 η 1 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where designates the complex conjugate n the localized time index n the time variable s the wavelet scale and n is the number of data points in the time series hydrological studies typically apply the morlet function as mother wavelet because it provides a good compromise between the time and frequency resolution grinsted et al 2004 schaefli et al 2007 3 2 cross wavelet transform xwt and wavelet transform coherence wtc cross correlation analysis is a standard method useful to determine the time lag between two time series xi yi with i 0 1 2 n where n is the length of the time series the xwt of two time series xi and yi is defined as jury et al 2002 torrence and compo 1998 2 w xy w x w y where denotes complex conjugation the cross correlation is computed by keeping one of the two time series fixed and shifting the other by a given time lag several time lags are applied and then the one providing the maximum correlation is identified the aim is finding the maximum correlation and its associated time lag between two time series on each time step the correlation coefficient is defined as follows 3 r x y k 1 n 1 i 1 n x i μ x y i k μ y σ x σ y k 0 1 2 where k indicates the time lag between the two time series μ x and μ y are the sample means and σ x and σ y the sample standard deviations of the time series box and decker 2011 an additional helpful measure is how coherent the xwt is in time frequency space wtc between two time series represents the local correlation between two cwts and can be interpreted as the squared correlation coefficient of the time series components torrence and webster 1999 similarly to the correlation coefficient coherence varies between 0 uncorrelated to 1 fully correlated the study focuses on the coherence analysis which evidences the modes of variation periods that are correlated in the two signals wtc is defined as follows torrence and webster 1999 4 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator given by s w s scale s time w n s while s scale denotes smoothing with respect to scales s and s time smoothing in time for the morlet wavelet suitable smoothing operators are given by torrence and webster 1999 both xwt and wtc analyses compute the so called cone of influence coi which indicates where edge effects can occur and the results could have been disturbed due to the length of the available time series and the coi we limit our analysis to 6 8 year scales the xwt exposes regions with high common power and reveals information about the phase relationship however significant regions observed in a xwt spectrum likely overrepresented the variability in one variable and thus may not reflect an actual relevant cause effect relationship wtc is known as preferable to find locally phase locked behavior grinsted et al 2004 thus when comparing both techniques wtc has shown a better performance than xwt fu et al 2012 labat 2010 maraun and kurths 2004 the present study applied the wtc to evaluate the relationship between the selected gauging stations and for the catchment classification by runoff behavior wavelet coherence 5 statistical significance level is determined using monte carlo methods grinsted et al 2004 3 3 discrete wavelet transform dwt the dwt analyzes signals into progressively finer octave bands i e it uses algorithms that operate on scales with discrete numbers normally based on integer powers of two nalley et al 2012 tiwari and adamowski 2013 considering its properties the dwt analysis supports the detection of patterns and behavior changes at different temporal scales which are not easily perceptible in the raw data the discrete wavelet function can be computed as follows 5 ψ j k t 2 j 2 ψ 2 j t k where ψ t is the mother wavelet function j is the translation index and k is the dilation index the chosen mother wavelet was daubechies wavelet db20 mother wavelets with wider support as db20 have been found to be more efficient for time series with long term components maheswaran and khosa 2012 in particular smoother alterations gradual trends and slowly changing processes are easily detected with db20 pérez ciria et al 2019 3 4 streamflow classification in the following we provide a step wise description of the methodology and fig 2 contains a graphical description of the five steps used for the intra catchment comparison step 1 we select the gauging stations within the study area considering a length of at least 40 years and medium to large catchment areas of at least 102 km2 covering two orders of magnitude then we evaluate the quality of the available data determining gaps missing data errors and metadata information gathered in table 2 prior to further analysis we correct the detected errors e g the occurrence of a single negative value or of a single missing value of the streamflow datasets substituting them with the mean value between the previous and subsequent daily streamflow measurement we also tested the influence of the temporal resolution of the data on the results of the wtc similar results are obtained with daily and monthly resolution data when we focus on the yearly or larger temporal scales see figure a1 in the supplementary material therefore a coarser time resolution does not compromise the proposed classification method however daily data provides a more accurate localization of the scale and time occurrence of the changes in the signal than a monthly time series additionally it gives us the possibility to have a global understanding of the streamflow behavior at different temporal scales e g river damming hydropower plants operation as shown in pérez ciria et al 2019 prior to focus on large scales associated with climatic features step 2 we compute the wtc between all possible pairs of streamflow time series 1225 combinations to determine similarities and differences in the variability of the time series at multiple temporal scales fig 3 shows an illustrative example of the wtc outcome considering different gauging stations and the corresponding decomposed signal the ordered axis of the wtc plots represents the time in years the abscissa axis of the wtc presents the analyzed period from 6 months to over 16 years the color of the plot ranges from blue which means no coherence between the variables value equal to 0 to red which means total coherence value equal to 1 values of coherence lower that 0 25 are considered low coherence values we consider medium coherence values values ranging between 0 25 and 0 75 coherence values over 0 75 show high coherence areas circled with a black contour represent statistically significant results 95 confidence level determined using monte carlo methods only results falling inside the shaded area are not necessarily statistically significant since they belong to the cone of influence coi a region of the wavelet spectrum where edge effects can occur thus results inside the coi are not considered in our study the arrows indicate the relative phase relationship with those pointing right representing in phase pointing left representing antiphase and pointing straight down indicating the lead by 90 of the first introduced signal in our analysis the first streamflow time series introduced as input data step 3 visual analysis and classification step 3 1 first we perform a visual analysis of the results to investigate the value of the coherence i e the presence of low medium or high coherence values between pairs of time series focusing on i yearly scale for which we use y followed by the class number to specify that we refer to the yearly classification ii a medium scale focusing on 2 4 years designated as m iii a large scale of 6 8 years we present as l larger scales were not considered since they generally fall within the coi for the typical lengths of the time series available step 3 2 we conduct the time series classification those time series showing complete coherence coherence larger than 0 75 over the entire period for a specific interval of temporal scales i e yearly 2 4 years or 6 8 years are assigned to the same class of stations detected losses of coherence for a specific scale imply that two time series belong to the same class prior to the year in which the loss of coherence occurs and to different classes after this specific year or vice versa in our work due to an alteration detected in 1980 at 2 4 years scale for a large number of time series we conducted the classification of different streamflow responses prior and after 1980 no coherence coherence smaller than 0 25 or sporadic coherence areas of coherence with values larger than 0 75 are present for time intervals smaller than 5 years between a pair of gauging stations indicate that they belong to different classes for all the considered scales for the complete analyzed time span if the coherence values fall below 0 75 for time intervals shorter than 2 years or only for a specific scale within the 2 4 years and 6 8 years intervals then they are still considered members of the same class step 3 3 we develop tables with an initial classification taking into account the wtc results as main advantages the suggested methodology allows us first to detect streamflow similarities and differences among the gauging stations at different temporal scales and secondly we are able to accurately detect if the coherence is stationary or not step 4 we compute the dwt for each streamflow time series for the three considered intervals of scales i e 256 days representing the yearly scale 3 years for the 2 4 years scale and 6 years for the large scale 6 8 years the dwt analysis helps us to validate the previously conducted classification using wtc to better evaluate differences in phase and amplitude which are characteristic for the different classes and to clarify to which class belong certain gauging stations that present high coherence values with gauging stations of two different clusters after step 3 we computed the dwt of every selected gauging station for the yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales see fig 3 in the dwt plot of prutz and innsbruck at 2 4 years scale shown in fig 3 we can observe how the decomposed signals cease to be in phase at the same time as the loss of coherence of the wtc is detected shadowed yellow area for the dwt analysis in the results section we show the time span of the longest available time series in addition we compute the mean of the dwt spectra of stations belonging to the same class and we compare them with the mean of the dwt spectra of different classes to highlight differences and similarities between classes of stations this step is particularly relevant to obtain a final classification for which we set a minimum correlation coefficient of 0 85 as a threshold for stations belonging to the same class step 5 we summarize the results in maps and tables we assign to the stations belonging to the same class a specific symbol and color and we report them on the map in total four maps are produced reporting the classes identified for the yearly scale analysis for the 2 4 years scale for the 6 8 years scale and the final classification which includes all scales the aim of the maps is to illustrate spatial patterns within the previously identified classes 4 results following the steps of the suggested methodology once we had selected the 50 gauging stations for our analysis we computed the wtc between all possible pairs of streamflow time series 1225 combinations and we performed a visual analysis to determine similarities and differences in the variability of the time series at multiple temporal scales then we investigated the value of the coherence between pairs of time series focusing on yearly scale 2 4 years scale and 6 8 years scale subsequently we classified the time series according to the coherence and the specific scale then we elaborated the final classifications supported by the dwt analysis and we developed the maps representing these scale dependent classifications finally those stations belonging to the same class in all scales are grouped together 4 1 wtc visual analysis and classification 4 1 1 wtc and classification focusing on yearly scale at yearly scale the wtc results show three different behaviors in fig 4 a b c d and e we can observe almost complete coherence along the whole analyzed time span for pairs of stations belonging to the same class fig 4 a 4b and 4 e show the wtc of the stations kajetansbrücke prutz and innsbruck a clear very high coherence values larger than 0 9 at yearly scale was detected for the entire period thus these gauging stations belong to the same class called class y1 fig 4 c shows the wtc of feldolling and erb that belong to class y2 similarly fig 4 d shows the wtc of anger and bad aibling which belong to class y3 fig 4 f 4 g and 4 h represent the wtc of additional combinations of the gauging stations kajetansbrücke erb feldolling and bad aibling in this case fig 4 f shows the wtc between kajetansbrücke class y1 and erb class y2 fig 4 g displays the wtc between feldolling class y2 and bad aibling class y3 finally the comparison between kajetansbrücke class y1 and bad aibling class y3 is represented in fig 4 h these last three cases present a lack of persistent high coherence at yearly scale with values lower than 0 25 thus we categorize the gauging stations presenting this lack of constant high coherence into different classes class y1 is the most populated class 43 gauging stations followed by class y2 4 gauging stations and class y3 3 gauging stations as shown in table 3 the classification for classes y1 and y2 was straightforward since the wtc at yearly scale showed a constant high coherence during the complete analyzed time period on the contrary for class y3 the wtc does not display a complete coherence along the entire time series fig 4 d coherence values between 0 4 and 0 6 appear in class y3 but only for short time intervals not longer than 2 years 4 1 2 wtc and classification focusing on 2 4 years scale when we focus on 2 4 years scale m of the streamflow wtc we observe a higher degree of complexity in comparison to the analysis at the yearly scale as shown in fig 4 b and 4 d we observe a loss of coherence between different pairs of gauging stations from the 1980s which implies an alteration of the streamflow behavior therefore we conducted a classification prior to 1980 and after 1980 to assess the differences observed in the wtc four different classes are detected prior to 1980 and eleven classes after 1980 which we refer to as subclasses see table 3 we will refer to the four classes as class mn prior to 1980 with n from 1 to 4 number of detected classes the eleven subclasses in the most recent period from 1980 till 2016 are named as class mn i with n from 1 to 4 referring to the class to which they belong prior to 1980 and i a b c referring to the subclass to which they belong after 1980 in fig 4 a the wtc of kajetansbrücke and prutz shows a complete coherence along the whole analyzed time span and it is the representative case of the combinations of gauging stations that belong to the same class before and after the detected alteration in 1980 the wtc combinations that behave similar to fig 4 b and 4 e belong to the same class during the period prior to 1980 but to different subclasses for the time interval after 1980 in fig 4 c the signal of feldolling and erb shows a single loss of coherence limited in time and period it lasts not longer than 5 years and only appears linked to the 2 years scale this disturbance can be attributed to an alteration that does not appear to be significant for a long time and which is restricted to a specific scale 2 years of the entire analyzed range 2 4 years thus for these specific cases we consider that both gauging stations belong to the same class fig 4 d presents a particular case in which medium coherence is present from the 1980s but high coherence returns from the late 1990s this specific situation is documented in table 4 fig 4 f 4 g and 4 h present only sporadic coherence at 2 4 years scale therefore they belong to different classes differently from the analysis at the yearly scale at the 2 4 years scale we have 10 cases in which the wtc does not display any significant coherence with other stations such stations are designated as not classified see table 3 there is a remarkable increase in the number of different streamflow behaviors from four to eleven starting from 1980 the distribution of the gauging stations at 2 4 years scale is as follows 20 gauging stations compose class m1 prior to 1980 which is divided in five different subclasses from class m1 a to class m1 e class m2 prior to 1980 remains with the same 4 gauging stations after 1980 the 6 gauging stations that belong to class m3 prior to 1980 are distributed across class m3 a and class m3 b similarly the 10 gauging stations that belong to class m4 prior to 1980 correspond to class m4 a class m4 b and class m4 c after 1980 the not classified gauging stations remain the same during the complete analyzed time span to complete and complement the information shown in fig 4 and table 3 table 4 provides an inter comparison among the eleven groups of gauging stations indicating periods during which observed significant losses of coherence occurred and giving information about the coherence intensity low values between 0 and 0 25 medium values between 0 25 and 0 75 and for high coherence values larger than 0 75 among gauging stations that belong to the same class we use the letter c that represents complete coherence 4 1 3 wtc and classification focusing on 6 8 years scale at 6 8 years scale the wtc results allow us to categorize the gauging stations into four different classes the wtc analysis at 6 8 years scale is analogous to the ones presented in the previous sections as a distinctive feature while analyzing the wtc of the different combinations at these scales we detected 7 gauging stations that presented high coherence values with two differentiated classes class l1 and l2 in the preliminary classification these gauging stations belong to both classes and according to this both columns l1 and l2 are marked in table 3 in the next section with the aid of the dwt analysis we will reclassify them in table 3 we distinguish for these seven gauging stations the class l1 marked with o considered in the preliminary classification but discarded after the dwt analysis from the final class l2 marked with x in fig 4 a we can observe the complete coherence present also for the 6 8 years scale between gauging stations kajetansbrücke and prutz which are classified as class l1 high coherence at 6 8 years scale of the wtc between innsbruck and the abovementioned gauging stations that belong to l1 can be seen in fig 4 b and fig 4 e nonetheless similar results were detected while analyzing the wtc of innsbruck and gauging stations that belong to l2 table 3 using the wtc analysis alone we are not able to uniquely classify innsbruck and six other stations since they would belong to both l1 and l2 classes fig 4 c shows gauging stations of class l2 while fig 4 d of class l4 in the 6 8 years scale analysis we have eight stations which cannot be classified table 3 six of them already identified during the 2 4 years scale analysis 4 2 discrete wavelet transform to analyze in more details the behavior of the different classes we computed the dwt of each gauging station the dwt analysis also serves as validation for the preliminary classification in which we focused on three different scales i the dwt of 256 days will be considered representative of the yearly scale y ii the dwt of the 3 years scale is linked to the 2 4 years scale m previously analyzed and iii the 6 years dwt will support the 6 8 years l wtc analysis henceforward we will refer to the specific dwt scale as the scale or interval of scales of the wtc analysis that aims to validate or clarify this step is particularly relevant for the analysis of the large scales 6 8 years in which seven stations cannot be easily classified and display a behavior similar to two classes l1 and l2 using wtc thus the dwt results enable us to reclassify them in fig 5 a b and c we show the dwt at yearly scale grey lines of the stations that belong to class y1 class y2 and class y3 respectively in the same figures we also show the mean dwt computed for each class in fig 5 a the mean of the dwt of the stations categorized in class y1 dwt mean class y1 red line has similar signal frequency and amplitude over the analyzed time span in fig 5 b the dwt mean of the stations categorized in class y2 dwt mean class y2 in blue displays a higher irregularity than the y1 signal although a narrower amplitude than dwt mean class y1 fig 5 c shows the dwt mean of the stations categorized in class y3 dwt mean class y3 black line with even narrower amplitude than dwt mean class y2 in fig 5 a the dwt of the 43 gauging stations that belong to class y1 are included among them only four gauging stations 9 of class y1 have available data prior to 1950 see table 1 and therefore we can observe a larger difference between the calculated mean red line and the grey area in the following period where data availability increases the available number of stations explains the difference between the variability observed for class y1 and classes y2 four stations and y3 three stations fig 5 d shows the inter comparison among the dwt mean of the three classes to analyze in detail the behavior of the different classes at a medium scale 2 4 years we compute the dwt of each gauging station as shown in fig 6 a k the dwt of the classified gauging stations grey lines are subdivided in the eleven subclasses according to the wtc classification for 2 4 years scale after 1980 in addition the shadowed areas represent to which class the gauging stations belong prior to the alterations found in the 1980s yellow represents class m1 green m2 orange m3 and red m4 fig 6 a displays the gauging stations that belong to class m1 a and their dwt mean represented in red similarly fig 6 b to fig 6 k show the gauging stations that belong to class m1 b to class m4 b each plot includes the dwt mean red lines of the gauging stations that belong to the same class fig 6 l shows the dwt at 2 4 years scale of the gauging station klaushof brücke categorized as not classified the classification in four classes before 1980 is mainly caused by remarkable differences in amplitude and frequency among the four classes as observed in the 2 4 years scale classification also stations belonging to different subclasses starting from 1980 show differences both in amplitude and in frequency that cause a loss in the coherence but such differences are not immediately evident by the dwt analysis and hence the relevance of coupling both wtc and dwt just to give an example we compare class m1 a and m1 b between 1985 and 1990 some large fluctuations present in class m1 a are not visible in class m1 b also the behavior around the year 2000 is different since m1 b time series display a quicker dampening of the fluctuations occurred before the year 2000 than m1 a time series on the contrary around 2010 m1 b time series display a change in the amplitude of the fluctuations which is not present in m1 a time series fig 7 shows the dwt analysis for the large scale 6 8 years this step is relevant to determine to which class belong the seven stations that showed high coherence with both gauging stations classified as l1 and classified as l2 in the preliminary classification based on wtc results although advances in data sciences schwämmle and jensen 2010 have led to more refined classification schemes in hydrology where catchments can belong to different classes simultaneously we use the dwt results to further investigate the gauging stations runoff behavior and to reclassify them if significant similarities are observed with only one specific class fig 7 a and b show the dwt of the classified gauging stations grey lines representing the classes l1 and l2 their dwt mean is represented in red fig 7 c displays the seven gauging stations that were coherent with gauging stations belonging to l1 and with gauging stations classified as l2 in addition fig 7 d represents the inter comparison of the mean dwt of the gauging stations classified into class l1 fig 7 a class l2 fig 7 b and the mean dwt of gauging stations coherent both with class l1 and l2 gauging stations fig 7 c the inter comparison allows us to determine to which class belong the gauging stations under investigation in this case the black line representing their mean dwt is highly similar to the mean dwt of l2 gauging stations represented in orange with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 period 1960 2010 in contrast the correlation coefficient of this group of stations with the mean dwt of l1 is 0 8 period 1960 2010 therefore we consider reasonable to imply that for the final classification they will belong to class l2 and not to class l1 similarly to fig 7 a and b fig 7 e and f show the dwt of the classified gauging stations grey lines in l3 and l4 respectively including the mean red line of the signals 4 3 comparison with classical k means classification to compare the power of detection of our suggested method we conducted also the classification of the decomposed dwt time series using the classical k means classification burn and boorman 1993 razavi and coulibaly 2013 sharghi et al 2018 ssegane et al 2012 however k means is not a deterministic algorithm it starts with a randomized initialization procedure leading in some cases to different results zagouras et al 2013 thus the overall result is influenced by the initial cluster centers directly affecting its reliability javadi et al 2017 if the results vary highly from run to run this indicates that the data do not cluster well with k means this was the case for the 2 4 years scales and we hypothesize that the detected non stationarity might lead to a more uncertain clustering of the time series therefore we limited the comparison exercise to the yearly scale where all stations are classified by both methods and it showed the most stable results the results are given in table a1 of the supplementary material 84 of the clustering results using the dwt k means technique are in agreement with our wavelet approach in particular for cluster 3 we obtain the same classification using both techniques the dwt k means method and our suggested wavelet approach also display some differences in the clustering that are further discussed in the next section 4 4 maps development to illustrate the classification of table 3 based on the wtc and include the new insights provided by the dwt analysis of the mean daily streamflow we develop three different maps fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 show three maps representing the study area with the spatial distribution of the fifty analyzed gauging stations categorized according to yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales respectively in fig 8 the three classes detected while analyzing the yearly scale are represented class y1 red triangle class y2 orange triangle and class y3 blue triangle in fig 9 the four different classes detected prior to 1980 are differentiated by color class m1 in yellow class m2 in green class m3 in orange and class m4 in red in addition to represent the subclasses detected after 1980 different symbols are used fig 10 represents the final distribution of the four classes detected for the large scale 6 8 years class l1 in yellow class l2 in red class l3 in green and class l4 in blue in addition gauging stations categorized as not classified are represented with a grey cross finally we can summarize the classification based on the three scales and we can obtain the abovementioned total class revealing which stations belong to the same class at the yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales fig 11 the names of these classes are simply defined by merging the names of the scale dependent classes and are reported as total class in table 3 the geographical location of the final classification fig 11 shows that nested basins are generally characterized by large coherence and belong to the same class we observe not nested clusters only for the classes with mean catchment elevation lower than 1400 m a s l for a more detailed analysis and to account for the topological structure of the river system we have included table a2 and table a3 in the supplementary material as a qualitative indicator of the performance of the applied classification we have also included in the supplementary material figure a2 a14 the flow duration curves computed for the normalized streamflow data subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation the flow duration curves results are grouped in classes obtained in the final classification the normalized flow duration curves for time series belonging to the same class overlap in most cases however the comparison between the proposed wavelet based methodology and such classic hydrological signatures should be carefully interpreted since i the flow duration curves are constructed using the entire information contained in the discharge time series and ii they do not consider the occurrence of non stationarities 5 discussion 5 1 clustering physical explanation in this section we describe the possible physical mechanism underlying the observed pattern of different scales variability for each of the clusters geographical proximity of catchments could explain similarity between typical flows as well as climatic similarity knoben et al 2018 geographically close catchments are likely to have high membership degrees to the same representative climate s and consequently gradual spatial changes in climatic conditions are accompanied by gradual changes in flow regimes the suggested methodology allows us to focus on specific scales which are influenced by different hydrological processes or teleconnection effects beniston and jungo 2001 labat 2008 based on the wtc results we detected three different behaviors at the yearly scale a clear coherence at yearly scale was detected between most of the pairs of selected gauging stations that belong therefore to class y1 we observed that 43 of the 50 analyzed gauging stations are in class y1 including all swiss and austrian gauging stations and german gauging stations with mean catchment elevation above 1000 m a s l the gauging stations categorized in class y2 are tributaries of the inn which present mean catchment elevations between 800 and 1000 m a s l while the gauging stations in class y3 have mean catchment elevations below 550 m a s l to support the abovementioned information fig 12 a shows the mean maximum and minimum values of mean catchment elevation of the gauging stations that belong to the same class in addition the characteristics of the gauging stations categorized as not classified are also included fig 8 shows that y1 stations belong to the southern and most alpine part of the catchment characterized by relevant snow and glacier melt contribution auer et al 2001 schöber et al 2010 y2 and y3 stations belong to small subcatchments located in germany low inn river basin where no glacier melt is present and snow melt contribution is less relevant than in class y1 catchments due to the lower elevation ács et al 2018 this analysis highlights that characteristics of the river basins and particularly the mean elevation of a catchment play an important role in catchment classification and is readily identified by the methodology especially in alpine areas elevation has been proved to feature a relevant effect on snow related variables jonas et al 2009 marty et al 2002 that might directly affect runoff behavior additionally from the comparison of the dwt k means approach and our suggested wavelet approach we can observe that the members of cluster 1 using our approach present less variability in terms of catchment area mean q and mean catchment elevation than using the k means approach the variability in cluster 2 is lower using the k means method than our wavelet based method in case of catchment area and mean q but not for mean catchment elevation the second cluster using the k means method displays considerably higher spreading in terms of geographic location than our classification see table a1 in the supplementary material for cluster 3 we obtain the same clustering therefore both approaches are able to capture the different seasonality from the stations with the lowest mean elevation catchment i e anger bad aibling and weichselbaum we believe that less variability among the members of the same class in the physical characteristics of the catchment and especially in mean catchment elevation and geographical location of the stations is an indicator of a better performance of the method the geographic location of the stations is more relevant than elevation for larger scales clustering although elevation still remains an important factor fig 12 before 1980 the analysis of the 2 4 years scales fig 9 shows that the upper inn river basin and the inn itself up to wasserburg have the same variability class m1 this means that the contribution of the tributaries belonging to different classes does not influence this part of the signal low elevation catchments class m4 below 1300 m a s l behave similarly the sill river has its own behavior class m2 and the ziller river as well class m3 curiously the brixentaler ache shares the same behavior of the ziller after 1980 each main tributary has its own behavior and the inn river displays three different behaviors in the signal up to the station prutz after the confluence with the sanna river until kirchbichl and then from oberaudorf until wasserburg fig 9 considering the 6 8 years variability the inn river up to the station prutz the ötztaler ache the attel at anger and the glonn at bad aibling have different behaviors than all other stations the upper inn and the ötztaler ache may differ to the other stations due to the large glaciers present in the catchments and the high elevation fig 12 interestingly those stations that required the classification using dwt since only using wtc they were assigned to both l1 and l2 all belong to the m1c and the m2 subclasses the m1c stations belong to the inn after the confluence with the sanna river and this can explain the difficulty in distinguishing the behavior of those stations as they entail the contribution of both l1 and l2 rivers the m2 subclass corresponds to the sill river which also receives a contribution from glacier melt and hence share some similarity with the l1 class regarding the monitoring points that belong to the not classified category we should notice that the one denominated ekw valtorta is highly affected by water management activities hydropower production which disturb the natural streamflow and does not match with the remaining analyzed gauging stations at 2 4 years scale the remaining stations that were not classified are characterized by catchment areas smaller than 300 km2 fig 12b therefore we hypothesize that either local geographical features might have a large impact on these relatively small alpine basins or that those time series may have inaccurate measurements in both cases our analysis is helpful to call for further hydrological studies in these catchments to test these hypotheses on the contrary in larger catchments averaging effects might reduce the importance of specific site characteristics meißl et al 2017 merz and blöschl 2009 and we observe that the classification procedure gives more consistent results in fact 95 of the gauging stations that were classified at yearly 2 4 years and 6 8 years scales have catchment area larger than 300 km2 fig 12c shows the mean maximum and minimum values of mean streamflow for each group of gauging stations that belong to the same class at yearly 2 4 years 6 8 years scales as expected the figure shows a high resemblance with fig 12b which represents the catchment area we can observe that in general catchment area and mean streamflow are more variable within a class than mean catchment elevation for the class y1m3bl1 however we can observe a higher variability in mean catchment elevation but very similar mean streamflow values for the not classified stations we observe that they belong to a wide range of mean catchment elevation values but share similar catchment area from 97 km2 to 295 km2 and mean streamflow from 1 m3 s to 5 37 m3 s overall although no morphological information is given as input to the clustering procedure the outcomes show that classes contain generally nested catchments and a predominant consistency in terms of elevation and location catchment area and mean streamflow 5 2 change point in the 1980s the observed loss of coherence for the 2 4 years scale in 1980 between different pairs of gauging stations implies local alterations of the streamflow behavior an exhaustive review of the available metadata and literature is necessary to corroborate the detected alteration and to investigate the possible drivers that impact the streamflow of the inn river basin it is noteworthy to mention that although 23 stations show changes of the gauging reference point between 1977 and 1983 table 2 no direct correlation with our results is found in fact there are gauging stations that belong to the same class after 1980 even if some of them present a change of the gauging reference point in 1980 this is the case for example of class m1a which includes swiss gauging stations with no modifications and the gauging stations located in kajetansbrücke and prutz which have both a modification of the gauging reference point in 1981 and 1979 respectively moreover there are additional modifications included in the table which occur at different times but no additional alterations were found in the wtc or the dwt at the 2 4 years scale pérez ciria et al 2019 focused on reservoirs and hydropower plants impacts on the streamflow regime of the inn and adige river basins the detected change points occur at shorter temporal scales weekly to yearly and are associated in the past to dams and hydropower plants construction or more recently to changes in the hydropower plants management however the temporal occurrence of these streamflow alterations does not match the loss of coherence identified in the present study therefore to interpret the results we reviewed several works that focused on detecting alterations of different geophysical variables in the alpine region auer et al 2001 beniston et al 2018 bocchiola 2014 böhm et al 2001 mallucci et al 2019 marcolini et al 2017a marcolini et al 2017b reid et al 2016 rottler et al 2019 schöner et al 2019 shift detection analysis of snow days revealed that swiss winters are strongly characterized by a significant step like change in snow days at the end of the 1980s marty 2008 a significant intensification of the melting rate from the 1980s was reported in 9 alpine glaciers haeberli et al 2017 including silvretta glacier switzerland located close to the gauging stations at tarasp and martina both class y1m1al1 and hintereis kesselwand and vernagt within the catchment area of huben and tumpen both class y1m1el3 in addition focusing on the net surface mass balance steady state conditions were found during the 1962 1982 period a negative mass balance have been observed since about 1982 with a faster mass loss for the period 2003 2013 which indicates a clear and regionally consistent acceleration of mass loss over recent decades over the entire european alps schöner et al 2017 vincent et al 2017 focusing on the swiss alps reid et al 2016 detected changes in swiss stratospheric and tropospheric temperature an increase of river groundwater and lake temperatures and a decrease of snow days in the 1980s additionally two short periods of mass gain 1910s and late 1970s and two periods of rapid mass loss 1940s and late1980s to present were detected huss et al 2010 a reduction in the total amount of snow and also snow cover duration since the mid 1980s was detected and mainly attributed to warmer temperatures in the european alps hantel and hirtl wielke 2007 scherrer et al 2004 serquet et al 2011 impacts were particularly evident at elevations below 1200 m beniston 2006 in contrast other sites above 2000 m experienced an increase in the amount of snow these insights are consistent with the increased heterogeneity detected from the 1980s in our study site in which 82 of the analyzed subcatchments contain regions with elevation between 1200 m and 2000 m studies focusing on the alpine region have observed similar heterogeneity patterns from the 1980s while describing climatic areas ács et al 2018 and catchment features such as soil conservation service curve number scs cn merz and blöschl 2009 therefore the increase in classes i e in spatial streamflow variability detected in this study may be related to changes in snow and glacier dynamics or land use yet further research should be performed to assess a causal effect similarly causes of alterations in the flow behavior associated to changes in climate conditions including the impact of large scale climate oscillations vegetation or evapotranspiration require a more in depth analysis and therefore need to be further investigated 5 3 advantages and limitations of the method to successfully apply the suggested methodology some requirements must be satisfied a minimum time series length is required to obtain statistical significant results out of the coi additionally although the clustering methodology is straightforward as it happens with several classical clustering techniques the causal effects that lead to the detected heterogeneous responses need to be further investigated with tailored studies the suggested methodology presents also several advantages in comparison to other available methods one of its main strengths is that we do not need to specify in advance the number of clusters we couple wtc analysis and dwt analysis thus the first method allows us to obtain a rough classification of the behavior of several scales of a time series at a glance while the second one is helpful to have a more accurate and detailed quantitative analysis of the difference between the scale dependent signals of the analyzed time series our analysis allows us to quickly identify the temporal non stationarity of catchment classification while focusing on different temporal scales this allows us to assess changes in the catchment behavior affecting only specific scales of the streamflow signal therefore in contrast to previous studies based on catchment classification using wavelet analysis we do not consider only different behaviors in the temporal scales of the signals as it is done by using the wavelet entropy agarwal et al 2016b but we identify periods of time in which the coherence differs moreover we filter out local meteorological effects and the effects of hydropower production considering only the long term behavior of the streamflow the proposed approach is able to detect the heterogeneous behavior of streamflow within a catchment and it reveals its complex spatial and temporal dynamics 6 conclusion the implications of our study can be summarized as follows i the classification at the yearly scale is directly linked to seasonality and divides snow and glacier dominated catchments from more rain dominated catchments with lower mean catchment elevation an alteration of the coherence in a cluster of this specific temporal scale can be easily detected with the proposed methodology and hence it can support climate change studies e g identification of catchment areas that display a hydrological shift from snowfall dominated to rainfall dominated regimes ii this work shows two main interesting characteristics of the inn catchment first the catchment can be classified differently according to the temporal scale secondly the similarity between catchments can change over time this has important implications for the validation of hydrological models as it could be non trivial to reproduce such heterogeneous non stationary behavior in particular if the meteorological drivers are not accurate enough or do not reflect this non stationary behavior it will be probably needed to define time dependent and heterogeneous model parameters iii climate change impacts caused by teleconnection effects are linked to large temporal scales labat 2006 2010 labat et al 2005 focusing on these specific scales allows us to assess the likely heterogeneous response of alpine catchments to teleconnection effects and to identify the most sensitive regions within a catchment this research contributes to the development of a robust method for catchment classification which is highly relevant for many hydrological applications such as prediction in ungauged basins model parameterization understanding the potential impact of environmental and climatic changes and transferring information from gauged catchments to the ungauged ones our analysis highlights that catchment classification may depend on the scale of the analyzed signal and it may vary both in time and space moreover the proposed method could help to identify catchments where further hydrological studies are required such as catchments that do not display any similarity with the surrounding ones it might also help to test hypotheses about the impact of climate change and teleconnection effects on hydrological processes in complex systems like the alps in our case study we identified a significant change in streamflow variability starting from the 1980s at the temporal scale of 2 4 years despite this result is consistent with changes in the alpine cryosphere further studies should investigate why these scales of streamflow are more affected than others in addition the suggested methodology can be easily applied to classify other geophysical and hydrological variables and become an alternative for the most classical clustering

5387,sustainable water use and water scarcity are major concerns in developing countries such as india rapidly growing population along with increasing economic and technological development in india have resulted in increased water use leading to severe water scarcity the present study aims to quantify and assess sustainable water use and water scarcity in india a data intensive approach is employed at a state spatial resolution and monthly temporal scales during the period 1991 1999 the water stress index wsi which is defined as the ratio of total water use to available water is used as a measure of blue water scarcity the total available water includes surface water and groundwater while the total water uses include irrigation industrial domestic and environmental uses a community land model clm 4 0 developed by the national centre for atmospheric research ncar is used to quantify the total available water in india water uses in india are reconstructed using a census based statistical database while the environmental water demand is modelled following the hydrology based approach which allocates environmental flows as a proportion of the available water with seasonally defined environmental flow thresholds further the excess water component defined as the amount of water remaining after meeting the demands at each time step is incorporated into the modelling framework by adding it to the available water pool the study estimates that 60 of the population in india faces severe water stress during the analysis period and is more predominant in the states of rajasthan gujarat uttar pradesh and maharashtra moreover non renewable groundwater abstraction which is defined as the amount of groundwater abstraction more than the groundwater recharge is also quantified this study identifies severe groundwater depletion in the north western parts of india consistent with the current estimates from grace satellite observations abbreviations aic akaike

withdrawals along with changing climate pose severe threats to sustainable water use in india hoekstra and chapagain 2006 oki et al 2001 the total water withdrawals in the country account for about 650 bcm billion cubic meters predominantly used for irrigation kumar 2003 the increase in irrigation water demand is attributed to the green revolution which increased crop production from 50 b kg billion kilograms in 1950 1951 to 203 b kg in 1998 1999 chakravarti 1973 chand 2004 on the other hand industrial and domestic water use has exponentially increased owing to the population growth economic and technological development in india amarasinghe et al 2005 seckler et al 2000 a review of recent literature suggests that around one billion people in india face water scarcity at least one month a year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 further severe groundwater depletion is experienced in the semi arid regions of north western india owing to increased groundwater abstraction for meeting various water uses wada et al 2014a this highlights the significance of sustainable water resource management which as a first step requires the evaluation of how water is currently being used chini and stillwell 2016 marston et al 2018 against this background the present study aims to carry out a large scale assessment of sustainable water use in india by quantifying the components of available water surface water and groundwater and those of water demands irrigation industrial domestic and environmental demands 1 1 limitations of existing approaches several large scale assessments have quantified sustainable water use and water scarcity at a global scale e g hanasaki et al 2008 hoekstra et al 2012 wada et al 2016 liu et al 2017a however these studies need improvement in modelling the components of available water and water uses joseph et al 2018 for instance the majority of these assessments focus on quantifying irrigation water demand while other water demands such as domestic and industrial are estimated using surrogate indicators such as population gross domestic product and electricity consumption hanasaki et al 2008 hoekstra et al 2016 kummu et al 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 while the relative magnitude of industrial and domestic water use to irrigation water use is small this needs to be accounted accurately especially when the scales of analysis is monthly this includes major demand influencing factors such as industrial production and changing per capita water use with technological development in the modelling approach wada et al 2016 similarly in the past domestic water use is estimated by using the population as the major influencing factor and neglected the temporal changes in per capita domestic water use mitchell and jones 2005 wada et al 2011a however economic and technological development has enhanced the living standards in india leading to an increase in per capita water use over time alcamo et al 2003 srinivasan et al 2013 these limitations are addressed in this paper with a view to improving these estimates using a census based dataset specific to industries and domestic sectors environmental water demand is another important water use which is neglected in most of these assessments e g oki et al 2001 kummu et al 2010 although some of the large scale assessments make provisions for environmental flow by assuming 60 80 of natural runoff this assumption overstates the level of water scarcity and population experiencing water scarcity hoekstra et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 allocation of greater than 50 of the total available water may leave other demands such as irrigation industrial and domestic unmet or partially met moreover it is unrealistic to assume such a magnitude of environmental flow allocation in india owing to social and economic reasons another crucial component groundwater contribution to available water is not considered in many large scale assessments except for a few e g wada et al 2011a wada et al 2011b india tops the list of countries with the most excessive groundwater abstraction in the world mukherjee 2018 moreover large groundwater abstractions constituting 20 25 of the global groundwater abstractions are reported in india giordano 2009 pokhrel et al 2012 shah 2005 wada et al 2011a further groundwater abstractions in india exhibit a rapid increase from 87 km3 to 190 km3 over the period 1960 to 2000 driven mainly by the green revolution kumar 2003 wada et al 2011a recent studies have identified that the ganges brahmaputra basin in india is the most groundwater stressed region in the world bhanja et al 2018 richey et al 2015 groundwater contribution is significant in the north western parts of india where severe groundwater depletion is observed by recent studies using grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite data wada et al 2014b furthermore many of the previous assessments quantified water scarcity at an annual time scale alcamo et al 2007 hanasaki et al 2008 kummu et al 2010 oki et al 2001 however water shortage is highly seasonal due to the large sub annual variation of freshwater consumption and availability hoekstra et al 2012 for instance a major share of the total available water in india is concentrated in the monsoon season from june to september and other months have less available water to meet the demands hoekstra et al 2012 similarly the irrigation water use is highly seasonal in india with two different crop seasons kharif cropping season from june to october and rabi cropping season from october to march revadekar and preethi 2012 when water availability and water uses are quantified at an annual time scale the assessment fails to capture this intra annual variability liu et al 2017b veldkamp et al 2017 in summary the lack of proper quantification of components such as groundwater industrial domestic and environmental water use and selection of appropriate scales of analysis can be listed as the major drawbacks of the previous studies moreover these components need to be integrated into a single modelling framework to obtain a better representation of blue water scarcity the present study aims to overcome the limitations of previous studies by quantifying the components of available water and water uses via the combined use of a large scale earth system model and census based statistical data there are various terms used in this paper to describe water fluxes to ensure consistency of terminology throughout the paper we use the following definitions o bluewater availability is defined as the natural runoff available through groundwater and rivers after deducting the environmental flow requirements aldaya et al 2012 o net irrigated area is the area of land in which irrigation is adopted during the cropping once or more than once in a year if two or more crops are grown in different seasons india wris 2012 o india wris 2012 o gross domestic product gdp is the measure of the monetary value of final goods and services produced in a country in a given period callen 2008 o water demand is the total volume of water used by various users within the water system if sufficient water is available wada et al 2011a o water use is a general non specific term representing the use of water by agriculture industry domestic purposes and environmental needs in the present study we use water use interchangeably with water demand u n 1997 o sustainable water use is defined as water resources and water services that can satisfy the changing biophysical demand placed on them now and into the future without system degradation loucks 2000 1 2 objective and scope the primary objective of this study is to quantify blue water scarcity in india at state spatial scale and monthly temporal scale the sub objectives are listed as follows a to quantify the available water from both surface and groundwater sources b to reconstruct various water demands using census based statistical data c to quantify the amount of non renewable groundwater abstraction in india and d to estimate blue water scarcity by compiling the above datasets this paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the nature of the data collected and section 3 provides the methods adopted for the analysis the model validation of available water and water use are presented in section 4 followed by the results of each component in section 5 the estimation of blue water scarcity measures using the modelled components of available water and water uses is explained in section 5 3 followed by conclusions in section 6 an appendix is also provided in section 7 with the supplement figures to support each of these sections 2 datasets table 1 lists the census datasets collected from various national and state government organisations in india these datasets are compiled from multiple sources and are based both on surveys and observations for instance the survey based industrial water demand by nciwrd 1999 is used as a reference data in the present study while the modelled estimates from other sources e g fao 2002 bank 2012 are excluded among the datasets industrial production data is made up of 56 industrial products and by industrial consumables that include 29 survey components accessed from indiastat thukral 2011 similarly reservoir data consists of reservoir live storage and full reservoir capacity of 63 major reservoirs in the country all the other datasets are single variables at the spatial and temporal scales indicated in table 1 most of the continuous datasets are at national and annual time scale for instance population data is available from 1960 to 2015 at annual and whole of india scales but state wise population data is only available for five years table 1 hence the available state wise data is used to extrapolate over longer periods assuming that the proportion of each state to whole of india remains constant over the analysis period further there are differences in the length of the various datasets available corresponding to the length of the available data in table 1 the components such as surface runoff and groundwater recharge components are modelled for the period 1960 to 2005 irrigation water demand is modelled from 1950 to 1999 industrial water demand is modelled from 1981 to 2010 and domestic water demand from 1991 to 2015 as a result the overlapping period for all these datasets is from 1991 to 1999 hence blue water scarcity measures are estimated during this period also there are privacy concerns that limit many state governmental organisations from reporting some water uses which restrict the validation of the model nevertheless we compiled datasets at state scale wherever available and use it for validation section 3 discusses the methods by which these datasets are disaggregated to the analysis scale of the present study state and monthly and used for estimation of the available water and various water uses 3 methods the overall modelling framework listing the components is shown in fig 1 the green boxes in the modelling framework fig 1 represent the components of available water and water uses and the violet boxes represent the modelling approach for these components joseph et al 2020 the components of available water surface water and groundwater are modelled in this study using a community land model clm 4 0 on the other hand the components of water use irrigation industrial domestic and environmental water use are modelled using census datasets specific to each of these sectors since most of these components are highly seasonal they are quantified at monthly timescale furthermore the spatial scale of analysis selected is state as the analysis at whole of india may hide the spatial variability within the physical blue water scarcity indicators of water stress are estimated in this study following the un sdg 6 4 2 sustainable development goal and water shortage based on per capita available water the un sdg 6 4 2 indicator define the level of water stress as the ratio of freshwater withdrawal to available water resource minus the environmental flow requirements hák et al 2016 the per capita available water is defined as the average quantity of water available for an individual in one day to meet the various water requirements vanham et al 2018 sections 3 1 3 3 discuss the methods by which the available water water use and blue water scarcity indicators are estimated in this study 3 1 estimation of available water the community land model clm 4 0 which is the land surface representation of community earth system model cesm created and evolved by the national centre of atmospheric research ncar is used in this study oleson et al 2010 many previous large scale assessments used this model to quantify and assess the issues associated with climate change and human interventions lawrence et al 2011 lo and famiglietti 2013 sacks et al 2009 sakaguchi and zeng 2009 zeng and decker 2009 the model details including the water balance diagram and the mathematical representation of the runoff components are shown in appendix a1 the model was run at a spatial resolution of 0 47 0 63 and at a monthly time scale from 1950 to 2002 three simulation cases are run for this study a control run with no irrigation irrigation runs with b irrigation data from wisser et al 2010 and c irrigation data based on census datasets from thukral 2011 these simulation cases are designated as ctrl irr wisser and irr indiastat respectively the irrigation run is significant as irrigation changes the soil moisture which in turn alters the water and energy fluxes from the land surface to the planetary boundary layer lawston et al 2017 the water stores in the model include water in unconfined aquifer and water stored in the soil column the present study assumes that 50 of the irrigation is supplied by surface water and the remaining 50 from groundwater this assumption is based on the rationale that global irrigation consumptive use from groundwater constitutes 43 of the total in india india also has the largest extent of the groundwater irrigated area 39 million hectares in the world siebert et al 2010 wey et al 2015 previous studies which focused on whole of india identified that 50 of the total irrigation is groundwater fed while the remaining is met by surface water bhanja et al 2018 dhawan 2017 gandhi and bhamoriya 2011 jha and sinha 2009 on the other hand some studies reported that the groundwater contribution to irrigation increased from 45 to 55 during 1990 to 2000 which corresponds to the analysis period of the present study ministry of agriculture 2014 suhag 2016 nevertheless there are differences in irrigation contribution from groundwater within different regions of india however most of the reported values in the various states of india lie within the range of 45 60 as shown in table 2 below there was no further data available at the state scale to validate the assumption made in this study this is one of the limitations of large scale approaches where regional or catchment wise information is difficult to collect nevertheless we have validated all the components of the modelling framework used in this study which supports our assumption on irrigation distribution 3 1 1 surface water component to parameterise surface runoff a topmodel based runoff model is implemented in clm based on the concept that the fractional saturated and impermeable area are determined by topographic characteristics and soil moisture state of a grid cell niu et al 2005 surface runoff consists of both overland flow due to saturation excess and infiltration excess mechanisms the drainage or sub surface runoff is estimated as a function of water table depth oleson et al 2010 the modelled surface runoff is calibrated against the discharge observations from gauging locations at various river basins in india including vijayawada in the krishna river basin gurudeshwar in the narmada river basin polavaram in the godavari river basin khanpur in the mahi river basin and japla in the ganga river basin cwc 2005 the dataset for the ganga basin is not continuous but three discrete sets of data from the years 1971 to 1975 1980 to 1985 and 2000 to 2002 are available since the gauging locations are at the outlet of the basin and considering the travel time for runoff to reach the basin outlet model calibration is performed at the annual timescale further reservoirs in india operates on an annual basis and we did not consider the influence of reservoirs while calibrating the streamflow this is consistent with many of the previous global water resources assessments and there is a lack of data associated with it joseph et al 2020 3 1 2 groundwater component several past large scale assessments have neglected the groundwater contribution in determining sustainable water use mainly because of data constraints hanasaki et al 2008 kummu et al 2010 this study determines the groundwater component for total available water from the recharge flux calculated by the clm 4 0 model as shown in fig 1 the clm model computes the recharge as the vertical flux between the aquifer and bottom soil layer such that positive recharge flows downward as gravity drainage and negative recharge flows upward by capillary flux lo et al 2008 oleson et al 2008 richey et al 2015 the positive recharge is assumed to contribute to groundwater availability while the negative modelled recharge is assumed to lack renewable supplies to replenish the aquifers richey et al 2015 therefore only the gravity drainage component positive recharge of the clm 4 0 model is considered as groundwater available in this study this study uses the census data on sector wise state wise groundwater abstraction and the modelled estimate of renewable groundwater available to quantify the non renewable groundwater abstraction non renewable groundwater abstraction is defined as the groundwater abstraction minus renewable groundwater available doll 2009 the mean annual groundwater recharge from clm 4 0 corresponds to the renewable groundwater available wada et al 2010 while the groundwater withdrawal dataset is generated based on the census data collected from indiastat thukral 2011 since the groundwater abstraction data is state wise and annually the non renewable groundwater abstraction of state j and year i n r g w i j is estimated as shown in equation 3 1 3 1 n r g w i j g w r i j g w a i j where g w r i j is the groundwater recharge for state j and year i and g w a i j is the groundwater abstraction for state j and year i while groundwater withdrawals at whole of india are available during the period of analysis state wise groundwater withdrawals are only available for the year 2004 thukral 2011 the state wise data for the year 2004 is used to extrapolate the data for the analysis period 1991 1999 by assuming a uniform ratio of groundwater withdrawal to total water withdrawal in each state we assumed the groundwater withdrawal of each state to total groundwater withdrawal of india hasn t changed during the analysis period this implies that during the analysis period a sudden rise or fall in groundwater abstraction in one state compared to other states is neglected although there is an increasing trend of groundwater withdrawal from 1991 to 1999 we assume that this increase is uniform for all the states one of the primary reasons for this assumption is the lack of state wise groundwater withdrawal data for a longer period 3 2 estimation of water uses the water uses are estimated using census datasets collected from national and state government agencies commission 2006 commission 2008 nciwrd 1999 thukral 2011 the irrigation water use is estimated from census datasets on irrigated areas and irrigation water withdrawals while the industrial water use is modelled using datasets on industrial production industrial consumables and technological development indicators domestic water use is quantified using datasets on population and gross domestic product the environmental water use is modelled following hydrology based approach to overcome the lack of available data the modelled components of available water and water uses are calibrated using an independent census dataset at the basin state and whole of india scales 3 2 1 irrigation water use irrigation water use is reconstructed based on the data of irrigated areas and irrigation water volume from national and state governmental agencies anant 2012 bengal 2012 forests 2007 manna 2016 thukral 2011 table 1 presents the state wise source wise net irrigated area in india from 2000 to 2011 this data is used to calculate the average fraction of net irrigated area by surface water r s w i as shown in equation 3 2 if the net irrigated area by surface water in state i for a year is n i a s w i y e a r 1000 ha and net irrigated area by surface water for the whole of india for the year is n i a s w i n d i a y e a r then the average fraction of net irrigated area by surface water is estimated as 3 2 r s w i n i a s w i 2000 n i a s w i n d i a 2000 n i a s w i 2011 n i a s w i n d i a 2011 12 this average fraction of net irrigated area by surface water is combined with the irrigation water volume from surface water and the net irrigated area for the base year to estimate the irrigation water volumes in india the total irrigation water volume from surface water v t s w n i a b a s e y e a r is estimated as shown in equation 3 3 3 3 v t s w n i a b a s e y e a r v s w i b a s e y e a r n i a t i b a s e y e a r n i a s w i b a s e y e a r where n i a t i b a s e y e a r represents the total net irrigated area in state i in the base year thousand hectares n i a s w i b a s e y e a r is the total net irrigated area in state i by surface water in the base year thousand hectares and v s w i b a s e y e a r is the irrigation water volume from surface water in state i in the base year bcm similar steps are repeated for estimating the total irrigation water volume from groundwater for each state in india the reconstructed irrigation water volume is further validated using an independent census data on irrigation water volume at state scale section 4 the modelled results of irrigation water use are discussed in section 5 3 3 2 2 industrial water use this study uses a modelling framework combining the census datasets of industrial production industrial survey components and economic technological indicators to determine industrial water use joseph et al 2017 the input variables considered include the industrial production data of eight broad categories of industries five major industrial survey components and three economic technological indicators a multivariate regression model is used to estimate the industrial water demand with these variables in three categories as predictors however the predictor variables exhibit high cross correlation which may result in over parameterisation of the multivariate model to overcome this problem the model drivers were selected using principal component analysis pca to reduce a large number of input variables to a more compact set of orthogonal predictors jolliffe 2002 rencher 2002 these components are developed as a linear function of all the input variables for instance the coefficients of each variable in the linear function for pc1 and pc2 are illustrated in fig a2 of the appendix these components are structured in a way such that the first pc represents the maximum variance and second pc the second maximum variance in the direction orthogonal to the first pc the first two principal components explain 95 of the total variability of the input variables thus these predictors are used to estimate industrial water demand since these components are a linear association of the input variables we choose a linear model that best fits the industrial water use the linear model selected with the components pc1 and pc2 is shown in equation 3 4 3 4 i n d i j a p c 1 b p c 2 c where indi j is the industrial water demand at whole of india and annual scales the variables a b and c are coefficients of the best linear model selected for modelling the model results are validated using survey data of industrial water demand from nciwrd 1999 and bhushan 2004 these results are then disaggregated at state scale in proportion to the number of industrial units in each state the modelling results at state scale are further validated with an independent dataset from state governmental agencies bengal 2012 forests 2007 panandiker 2013 wilson 2014 the annual values are then disaggregated to monthly scale using the monthly industrial production dataset joseph et al 2019 3 2 3 domestic water use this study uses the census datasets of population and domestic water use to identify that per capita domestic water use has been increasing in india the increase in per capita domestic water use is consistent with the rise in per capita gdp of the country and show a high cross correlation correlation coefficient 0 8 supporting this various studies have highlighted the significance of including the change in the rate of per capita water use that occurs with economic development in the modelling processes guo et al 2013 oki and kanae 2006 therefore the present study models the per capita domestic water use by including a time dependent per capita gdp approach a power function model is selected using the levenberg marquardt algorithm to fit per capita domestic water use with per capita gdp gavin 2011 lourakis 2005 moré 1978 the per capita domestic water use p c u i j at state j and year i is estimated in equation 3 5 as 3 5 p c u i 1 j a 1 p c g i j b 1 c 1 where p c g i j is the per capita gross domestic product of state j and year i a1 b1 and c1 are coefficients of the power function model selected the total domestic water use d w u i j at year i and state j is estimated as a product of population and modelled per capita domestic water use in equation 3 6 3 6 d w u i j p c u i j p o p i j the model statistics r squared 0 91 adjusted r squared 0 71 and rmse 6 61 support the model selection the modelling results are validated using census datasets of domestic water use at whole of india scale the model results at state scale are further validated against independent census data from state governmental organisations thukral 2011 3 2 4 environmental water use the quantification of environmental water use in large scale assessments is difficult due to the lack of available data and proper prediction methods various approaches for quantifying environmental water demand include hydrology based hydraulic rating habitat simulation and holistic methods tharme 2003 among these methods the hydrology based approach allocates the environmental water demand by mimicking the natural flow regime the hydraulic rating approach focus on the river hydraulic parameters habitat simulation aims at sustaining the aquatic habitat and holistic approach follows a combination of these methods we use a hydrologic based approach due to the lack of national level eco hydrological data using this method environmental flows are allocated in this study as a proportion of the available water smakhtin 2006 a summary of the various hydrology based environmental flow estimation methods is shown in table 3 since environmental flows are seasonal the classification of months as low flow and high flow months is adopted in this study following pastor et al 2014 low flow months correspond to months when the mean monthly flow is less than mean annual flow while all other months are considered high flow months tennant 1976 the low flow months are allocated flow exceeded 90 of the time q90 and the high flow months are assigned flow exceeded 50 of the time q50 although environmental water demand is included in the current approach the implementation of environmental flows is still not practised in most states therefore the impact of the environmental flow component on blue water scarcity is evaluated in this study by comparing the water stress index estimate with and without the environmental flow component in section 5 7 1 3 3 estimation of blue water scarcity measures bluewater scarcity measures of water stress and water shortage are estimated based on available water and water demands water stored in reservoirs transfers water from high flow months to low flow months and to help reduce the severity of water stress in dry months in this study monthly excess water is defined as the amount of available water after meeting irrigation industrial and domestic water demands resulting monthly excess water is carried over to the next month however when the excess water reaches the reservoir storage capacity subsequent surplus flows are treated as river flows losses the proportion of surplus water routed to river discharge is estimated using a linear model that is calibrated against the monthly river discharge at the krishna basin outlet in vijayawada the linear calibration model selected is based on akaike and bayesian s information criteria edwards et al 1963 shibata 1976 fig a3 of the appendix shows the model selection process and the time series of modelled and observed monthly discharge in the krishna basin the model results show that 65 of excess water is stored in reservoirs and 35 become losses as river flows it is important to note that we have lumped the reservoir data at state scale for this calibration procedure as water demands are only estimated at state scale the estimated volume of reservoir storage is validated against reservoir live storage data source commission 2008 thukral 2011 this validation of the excess water during the months 1995 june to 1996 may is shown in fig 2 three cases are presented control case assumes no carry over of water carryover case assumes that 65 of excess carry over water while with reservoir case assumes no carryover and the reservoir live storage capacity is added to the total surface water the carryover case shows good agreement to with reservoir case supporting this model selection r squared 0 92 rmse 6 34 nse 0 79 moreover a recent study by gupta et al 2016 identified that runoff ratio of the 28 river basins in india for the period of 1971 to 2005 is approximately 33 8 which reinforces the current assumption of 35 the mathematical representation of the estimation of wsi is shown in equations 3 7 to 3 12 where s w i j and g w i j are the monthly surface runoff and groundwater runoff estimates respectively these are based on the land surface model clm 4 0 outputs for month i and location j respectively the total available water t a w i j is defined as 3 7 t a w i j s w i j g w i j e x w i 1 j where the excess water from the previous month e x w i 1 j is defined as 3 8 e x w i 1 j 0 65 s w i 1 j i r r i 1 j i n d i 1 j d o m i 1 j 3 9 m a x e x w i 1 j r c i 1 j where r c i 1 j is the full reservoir capacity of state j in month i i r r i j is the irrigation water demand i n d i j is the industrial water demand and d o m i j is the domestic water demand the total water demand of month i and location j is defined as 3 10 t w d i j i r r i j i n d i j d o m i j the water stress index of the month i and location j w s i i j is therefore defined as 3 11 w s i i j t w d i j t a w i j when the environmental flow component is included the updated water stress index for state i and month j w s i n e w i j is defined as 3 12 w s i n e w i j t w d i j t a w i j e n v i j where e n v i j is the environmental flow component for state j and month i the water stress index is estimated in the present study following equation 3 12 wada et al 2011a wada et al 2011b based on wsi water stress regions are classified as low water stress wsi 0 2 moderate water stress 0 2 wsi 0 4 and severe water stress wsi 0 4 the water shortage indicator is estimated using the measure of per capita available water the per capita available water indicator paw classifies blue water scarcity into four different zones a no stress region with paw 1700 m3 cap year b water scarce region with 1000 paw 1700 m3 cap year c water stressed region with 500 paw 1000 m3 cap year and d absolute water stress region with paw 500 m3 cap year the virtual water component which represents the amount of embedded water within a product transferred between india and other countries is neglected due to lack of available data hoekstra and hung 2002 similarly desalinated water use in the coastal regions is not included in the modelling framework because the major desalination plants in india namely minjur and nemmeli are in operation only since 2005 which is outside the analysis period abraham and luthra 2011 natarajan 2018 although the major reservoirs are included in the modelling framework the small storages in tanks and ponds are excluded as proper quantification of their water contribution is not available 4 model validation in this study validation of the available water and water uses at both national and state scales is performed by utilizing independent census data collected from state governmental organisations in india for instance streamflow data from five river basins in india is collected for calibrating the modelled runoff these river basins are in different climate zones with the river basin mahi is in an arid region krishna is in a semi arid region godavari is in a tropical area ganga in a tropical wet climate region and narmada is in a humid tropical region among these basins two of them are west flowing and others and east flowing rivers although we wish to compare the observed and modelled runoff from a greater number of river basins there is a lack of observed data in many of the river basins in india fig 3 shows the time series of observed discharge and modelled runoff from three simulation cases for five river basins in india the modelled vs observed discharge with a 1 1 line is also shown as a sub plot corresponding to each river basin the model performance statistics r squared root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are shown in table 4 the unit of rmse is the same as the unit of discharge bcm year while r squared and nse are dimensionless values these metrics indicate good model performance for all study basins except for krishna river basin however the model overestimates the discharge for the krishna basin during the period 1982 to 2000 the lower model performance in the krishna basin during this period can be attributed to the major droughts in the basin in the same period gaur et al 2007 similarly for the ganga basin the model results show good agreement with the observed discharge most of the time except for the period 2000 to 2002 these results gave us confidence in using the surface water component of the total available water obtained from the clm 4 0 model fig 4 a c shows the validation of estimated net irrigated area by surface water nia sw groundwater nia gw and all sources total nia against the observed data collected from the different states of india the model results show good agreement with the observed data and are supported by the corresponding performance measures nse 0 86 for nia sw 0 97 for nia gw and 0 92 for total nia the reconstructed irrigated area equation 3 1 is further used in equation 3 2 to estimate the irrigation water volume the census dataset on irrigation water volume is not available for most of these states which made necessary to validate it against the existing global assessments as reported in chou 2019 table 5 shows the validation of industrial water use against the census data collected from the state governmental organisations the model results show good agreement with industrial water use statistics for most of the states however for karnataka state the model underestimates industrial water use the methodology adopted in this study is to disaggregate the river basin level industrial water use statistic to state scale proportional to the drainage area of the basin in each state but for karnataka state industrial development is much higher in regions which are not overlapping with the krishna basin leading to a distortion in the estimation chandrakanth 2009 the deviations are however small which justifies this estimation of industrial water use model for further analysis fig 5 shows the validation of domestic water use against state governmental organisations overall the results show good agreement with the observed data average nse 0 49 for the state of west bengal the model underestimates domestic water use it is important however to note here that this study does not consider the influence of annual rainfall on domestic water use which may be one of the reasons for the underestimation west bengal receives high rainfall compared to other parts of india which increase the availability of water for domestic purposes 5 results and discussions figs 6 and a4 show the spatial distribution and time series of the modelled components of available water and water use the north western part of india and the south eastern parts have the lowest available water while the south western and north eastern parts have the highest available water most of the components exhibit seasonality with higher flows during the summer monsoon months june to september except for domestic water use which is higher in the summer months starting in march and lower in the winter months beginning november similarly industrial water use is higher in march compared to other months due to the increased industrial production by the end of the financial year in india section 5 4 the modelled results of each of these components are discussed in section 5 1 to 5 6 5 1 surface water component in india the major contributor of surface runoff is the summer monsoon rainfall from june to september while other months receive significantly less or no rainfall the spatial distribution of surface runoff and monthly time series of rainfall and surface runoff are shown in fig a1 of the appendix it should be noted here that the north eastern region and the south western state kerala receive the highest rainfall which results in higher runoff values for those states similarly the north western region and the south eastern state tamil nadu receive the lowest rainfall leading to lower runoff the inter annual variability of surface runoff shows that the flow is higher in the year 1994 while the year 1992 1997 and 1998 corresponds to low flow period across india fig 7 5 2 groundwater component the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge is shown in fig 6 and the time series is shown in fig 8 b it is important to note that the states of north western india and uttar pradesh are highly dependent on groundwater the available surface water in these states is not enough to meet their water demands which leads to extensive groundwater abstraction fig 8a shows the state wise groundwater withdrawal and estimated non renewable groundwater abstraction for the year 1999 the data show higher groundwater withdrawal in large food producing states such as uttar pradesh and punjab groundwater withdrawal accounts for between 10 and 25 bcm in most of the states except for the surface water abundant north eastern region and south western states this study uses the sector wise state wise groundwater abstraction data and the groundwater recharge component from clm 4 0 model to estimate the non renewable groundwater abstraction fig 8b shows the state wise estimated non renewable groundwater abstraction for the year 1999 this calculation identified that 34 bcm of groundwater abstraction is non renewable in the country in the year 1992 and increased to 42 bcm in the year 1999 the high groundwater abstraction is predominant in the states of gujarat 9 bcm in 1992 12 bcm in 1999 rajasthan 10 bcm in 1992 13 bcm in 1999 and tamil nadu 14 bcm in 1992 18 bcm in 1999 groundwater in these arid states meets a significant proportion of the water demands more specifically irrigation water demand the estimate is consistent with the severe depletion of groundwater observed in north western india using the change in water storage from grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite data wada et al 2014b 5 3 irrigation water use fig 9 shows the estimated irrigation water use at state at monthly scales the seasonality of irrigation water use corresponds with the kharif summer season cropping season in india from june to october where intensive irrigation is applied to meet crop water demand although summer monsoon rainfall from june to september contributes to crop water requirement irrigation is still applied to meet the high crop water demand predominantly in the arid regions spatially the states of andhra pradesh rajasthan and uttar pradesh have the highest irrigation water use in india fig a5 of the appendix shows the time series of irrigation water use for these states along with the whole of india irrigation water use is increasing over time in the whole of india and more predominantly in uttar pradesh and rajasthan fig a5 where excessive groundwater abstraction can be observed fig 8a it is also important to note that the central north eastern state of uttar pradesh is the largest food grain producing state 50 b kg in the country contributing to 19 of india s total food production and hence extensive irrigation 76 of the area is irrigated is applied throughout the year 5 4 industrial water use fig 10 shows the modelled spatial distribution of monthly averaged industrial water use for each month the states of maharashtra tamil nadu and andhra pradesh are the largest users of industrial water in india industrial water use exhibits a pronounced seasonality with the highest water use occurring in march this can be ascribed to the end of the financial year in india which runs from april to march and leads to increased industrial production to meet production targets chaturvedi 2012 the time series of modelled industrial water use for major industrialised states in the country is also shown in fig a6 of the appendix industrial water use shows an exponential increase in most of the states after the year 2000 consistent with economic and technological development except for madhya pradesh all other states exhibit an increasing water use trend which is at a faster rate than irrigation water use 5 5 domestic water use fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of domestic water use for each month in india the central north eastern state of uttar pradesh and the central western state of maharashtra lead domestic water use in india the rising population in uttar pradesh and increasing technological development in maharashtra have led to increasing domestic water use in these states domestic water use also exhibits strong seasonality with summer months april to september having greater domestic water use than in the winter months november to february in india 5 6 environmental water use fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of monthly environmental flow for the country it is important to note that the monthly environmental flow requirements are higher than the industrial and domestic water use in india this higher magnitude is owing to the model used in this study which allocates environmental flow as a proportion of available water nonetheless this estimate is lower than the previous studies who allocated 60 80 of available water as environmental flow based on the results central india and the north eastern parts have relatively higher environmental water requirement than other regions corresponding to the higher rainfall and surface runoff in those regions similarly the months of june to october corresponds to the summer monsoon season resulting in high environmental water use in those months there are no established rules for determination or implementation of environmental flow in india which results in inadequate management and allocation of these flows however it is increasingly important to sustain freshwater estuarine ecosystem and the human livelihoods and well being that depend on these ecosystems declaration 2007 consistent with this criterion the environmental flow component is included in the overall water demand for the estimation of blue water scarcity following un sdg 6 4 2 hák et al 2016 5 7 estimation of blue water scarcity measures the spatial distribution of severe water stress intensity is shown in fig 13 severe water stress intensity is defined as the percentage of time each state is affected by severe water stress during the analysis period from january to april most of the states except the north eastern parts face severe water stress for more than 80 of the time the central region of india shifts from more severe to less severe water stress following may and south india from june onwards by the end of september the summer monsoon retreats from northern and central regions of india resulting in more severe water stress in those regions however the south western part of india continues to receive summer monsoon rainfall south west monsoon season until the end of october further the south eastern and central north eastern parts of india receive the additional north east monsoon season from october to december resulting in less water stress in those regions fig 14 shows the monthly distribution of per capita water availability and water stress index the interquartile range of each box indicates the annual variation of these indices the seasonal distribution shows high values of paw and low values of wsi during the months from june to october the months from january to may show more severe water stress wsi 0 4 with march and april extremely stressed wsi 1 paw is low in most parts of india from october to december nevertheless for the south east and central north east regions the north east monsoon rainfall from october to december helps to increase paw and reduce wsi fig 13 fig 15 shows the exponential decay of the water stress index with the increase in per capita available water the various zones of water stress and water shortage are indicated with red dots which corresponds to monthly values during the period 1991 to 1999 the overlapping zone of extremely severe water stress wsi 1 and the absolute water stress paw 500 m3 cap year is the most critical zone where both the blue water scarcity indicators are at the extreme ends it is important to note that more than 40 of the data falls within this critical region revealing severe water scarcity in the country for higher per capita water use the wsi values fall in low or moderate water stress except for a very few months due to the seasonality of the water demands water stress regimes include lws corresponds to low water stress region when wsi 0 2 mws corresponds to moderate water stress region when 0 2 wsi 0 4 sws corresponds to severe water stress region when 0 4 wsi 1 esws corresponds to extremely severe water stress region when wsi 1 wada et al 2011a the water shortage regimes include aws corresponds to absolute water stress region when per capita available water 500 m3 person year ws corresponds to water stress region when 500 per capita available water 1000 m3 person year wsc corresponds to water scarce region when 1000 per capita available water 1700 m3 person year nws corresponds to no water stress region when per capita available water 1700 m3 person year damkjaer and taylor 2017 the number of states experiencing low moderate and severe water stress for each month is shown in fig 16 around eight north eastern states are consistently under low water stress fig 13 which results in a higher number of states affected by low water stress the number of states experiencing moderate water stress is smaller due to the high seasonality of monsoon rainfall which is concentrated in only four months of the year around five to seven states are consistently under severe water stress which includes gujarat rajasthan uttar pradesh and maharashtra by assuming the entire population in each spatial unit state experiences the same monthly water stress regime this study also estimated the amount of population experiencing low moderate and severe water stress fig 17 shows the inter annual variation in the amount of population experiencing water stress the annual rainfall hyetograph is also shown as the inset to represent the inter annual variability although there is an increasing trend of severely water stressed population inter annual variability of monsoon rainfall reduces the severe water stress in 1994 and 1998 further fig a7 presents the annual time series of the total population and the population experiencing severe water stress for at least one month of the year approximately 0 62 billion in india faces severe water stress for at least one month of the year from 1991 to 1999 which increases over time to 0 83 billion in 1999 in summary the overall trend of the amount of population experiencing severe water stress is increasing with increasing water demands over time both indicators show extreme water stress in the states of gujarat and rajasthan where water availability is low together with higher water demands groundwater contributes significantly to meet water demands in the arid regions of india section 5 2 the state of maharashtra falls under absolute water stress primarily due to its high population density maharashtra is one of the top industrialised states in the country where industrial water demand is high however compared to states such as uttar pradesh in northern india irrigation water demand is low which precludes maharashtra from falling into extremely severe wsi condition on the other hand uttar pradesh is the largest food producing state in india which drives the high water demand leading to extreme wsi despite the per capita water availability indicator showing only water stressed condition 5 7 1 influence of environmental flow and reservoirs environmental flow policy is not yet implemented in most indian states thus adopting an environmental flow threshold for the analysis period does not imply in practice that other demands are unmet fig 18 shows the impact of environmental flow and reservoir on the various water stress regimes the inclusion of environmental flows causes the percentage of low water stress to reduce from 40 to 33 moderate water stress slightly to increase from 18 to 19 and severe water stress to increase from 41 to 48 similarly the amount of population experiencing severe water stress for at least one month a year increases from 0 52 billion to 0 75 billion people with the inclusion of environmental flows conversely by incorporating the reservoir component equation 3 8 the severe water stress is reduced from 66 to 48 and low water stress zones increased from 18 to 33 fig 18 this analysis shows that the 63 major reservoirs in india contribute to the reduction of severe water stress for approximately 0 1 0 2 billion people this reduction of severe water stress is more pronounced from october to january the influence of environmental flow and reservoirs differ between the various states of india table 6 lists the population millions of several states experiencing severe water stress when environmental flows and reservoirs are included for instance when the environmental flow is added the population experiencing severe water stress in maharashtra increases from 5 1 to 15 million on the other hand the reservoir component helps to reduce the population experiencing severe water stress from 46 5 to 5 1 million among the states west bengal andhra pradesh and karnataka show high sensitivity to reservoir component while states such as bihar madhya pradesh and tamil nadu shows high sensitivity to environmental flow component except for the states in table 6 other states shows less sensitivity to environmental flow and reservoir component it is important to note that those less sensitive states include states which are heavily water stressed e g uttar pradesh and states which are experiencing low water stress e g mizoram assam the monthly variation of state by state population experiencing low water stress when environmental flow and reservoir component are shown in figs a8 a9 a8 and a9 compare the population experiencing low water stress with and without environmental flow respectively the difference is evident during the months of january to march during these months the states such as bihar and jharkhand shifts from low water stress category with the addition of environmental flow similarly figs a10 and a11 compare the population experiencing severe water stress with and without environmental flow respectively the difference is evident during the months of july and august in the states of rajasthan and tamil nadu fig 19 shows the monthly variation of blue water scarcity measures wsi and paw caused by the inclusion of environmental flow when environmental flows are included the per capita available water reduces by 10 30 m3 person month and the water stress index increase from 0 1 to 0 4 and this influence is predominant in november and december in summary not including the environmental flow component results in an underestimation of water stress however if higher environmental flow thresholds e g 80 of surface water were considered it would result in less available water for meeting the other water demands leading to a higher estimate of water scarcity 6 conclusions this study presents a modelling framework for quantifying water scarcity in india via the use of a large scale earth system model clm 4 0 combined with a census based statistical database at state and monthly scales to determine blue water scarcity the study reveals that 0 62 billion people in the country face severe water stress for at least one month a year also this study estimates non renewable groundwater abstraction and identifies critical groundwater depletion in the states of gujarat 12 bcm rajasthan 13 bcm and tamil nadu 18 bcm water scarcity is more severe in gujarat rajasthan maharashtra and uttar pradesh with rajasthan facing severe water stress for more than 90 of the study period conversely the north eastern part of india shows consistent low water stress as the region receives a large amount of rainfall throughout the year most of the states in india have water surplus during the summer monsoon season june september while more than 60 of india exhibit severe water stress during the months from january to april the primary drivers of blue water scarcity are different for various states in india high irrigation water use leads to severe water stress in uttar pradesh while high population density leads to severe water shortage in maharashtra this study also highlights the significant impact on water stress if environmental flows in the country were implemented when the environmental flow component is neglected it results in an underestimation of water stress of 10 15 the inclusion of the reservoir component reduces severe water stress for 0 1 0 2 billion people in the country this is achieved by storing an estimate of approximately 65 of the excess water reservoirs while the remaining 35 is lost as outflows credit authorship contribution

5387,sustainable water use and water scarcity are major concerns in developing countries such as india rapidly growing population along with increasing economic and technological development in india have resulted in increased water use leading to severe water scarcity the present study aims to quantify and assess sustainable water use and water scarcity in india a data intensive approach is employed at a state spatial resolution and monthly temporal scales during the period 1991 1999 the water stress index wsi which is defined as the ratio of total water use to available water is used as a measure of blue water scarcity the total available water includes surface water and groundwater while the total water uses include irrigation industrial domestic and environmental uses a community land model clm 4 0 developed by the national centre for atmospheric research ncar is used to quantify the total available water in india water uses in india are reconstructed using a census based statistical database while the environmental water demand is modelled following the hydrology based approach which allocates environmental flows as a proportion of the available water with seasonally defined environmental flow thresholds further the excess water component defined as the amount of water remaining after meeting the demands at each time step is incorporated into the modelling framework by adding it to the available water pool the study estimates that 60 of the population in india faces severe water stress during the analysis period and is more predominant in the states of rajasthan gujarat uttar pradesh and maharashtra moreover non renewable groundwater abstraction which is defined as the amount of groundwater abstraction more than the groundwater recharge is also quantified this study identifies severe groundwater depletion in the north western parts of india consistent with the current estimates from grace satellite observations abbreviations aic akaike

groundwater abstraction 1 introduction india is the second most populous country in the world with 17 of the global population but with only 4 of global water resources commission 2008 rising water withdrawals along with changing climate pose severe threats to sustainable water use in india hoekstra and chapagain 2006 oki et al 2001 the total water withdrawals in the country account for about 650 bcm billion cubic meters predominantly used for irrigation kumar 2003 the increase in irrigation water demand is attributed to the green revolution which increased crop production from 50 b kg billion kilograms in 1950 1951 to 203 b kg in 1998 1999 chakravarti 1973 chand 2004 on the other hand industrial and domestic water use has exponentially increased owing to the population growth economic and technological development in india amarasinghe et al 2005 seckler et al 2000 a review of recent literature suggests that around one billion people in india face water scarcity at least one month a year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 further severe groundwater depletion is experienced in the semi arid regions of north western india owing to increased groundwater abstraction for meeting various water uses wada et al 2014a this highlights the significance of sustainable water resource management which as a first step requires the evaluation of how water is currently being used chini and stillwell 2016 marston et al 2018 against this background the present study aims to carry out a large scale assessment of sustainable water use in india by quantifying the components of available water surface water and groundwater and those of water demands irrigation industrial domestic and environmental demands 1 1 limitations of existing approaches several large scale assessments have quantified sustainable water use and water scarcity at a global scale e g hanasaki et al 2008 hoekstra et al 2012 wada et al 2016 liu et al 2017a however these studies need improvement in modelling the components of available water and water uses joseph et al 2018 for instance the majority of these assessments focus on quantifying irrigation water demand while other water demands such as domestic and industrial are estimated using surrogate indicators such as population gross domestic product and electricity consumption hanasaki et al 2008 hoekstra et al 2016 kummu et al 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 while the relative magnitude of industrial and domestic water use to irrigation water use is small this needs to be accounted accurately especially when the scales of analysis is monthly this includes major demand influencing factors such as industrial production and changing per capita water use with technological development in the modelling approach wada et al 2016 similarly in the past domestic water use is estimated by using the population as the major influencing factor and neglected the temporal changes in per capita domestic water use mitchell and jones 2005 wada et al 2011a however economic and technological development has enhanced the living standards in india leading to an increase in per capita water use over time alcamo et al 2003 srinivasan et al 2013 these limitations are addressed in this paper with a view to improving these estimates using a census based dataset specific to industries and domestic sectors environmental water demand is another important water use which is neglected in most of these assessments e g oki et al 2001 kummu et al 2010 although some of the large scale assessments make provisions for environmental flow by assuming 60 80 of natural runoff this assumption overstates the level of water scarcity and population experiencing water scarcity hoekstra et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 allocation of greater than 50 of the total available water may leave other demands such as irrigation industrial and domestic unmet or partially met moreover it is unrealistic to assume such a magnitude of environmental flow allocation in india owing to social and economic reasons another crucial component groundwater contribution to available water is not considered in many large scale assessments except for a few e g wada et al 2011a wada et al 2011b india tops the list of countries with the most excessive groundwater abstraction in the world mukherjee 2018 moreover large groundwater abstractions constituting 20 25 of the global groundwater abstractions are reported in india giordano 2009 pokhrel et al 2012 shah 2005 wada et al 2011a further groundwater abstractions in india exhibit a rapid increase from 87 km3 to 190 km3 over the period 1960 to 2000 driven mainly by the green revolution kumar 2003 wada et al 2011a recent studies have identified that the ganges brahmaputra basin in india is the most groundwater stressed region in the world bhanja et al 2018 richey et al 2015 groundwater contribution is significant in the north western parts of india where severe groundwater depletion is observed by recent studies using grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite data wada et al 2014b furthermore many of the previous assessments quantified water scarcity at an annual time scale alcamo et al 2007 hanasaki et al 2008 kummu et al 2010 oki et al 2001 however water shortage is highly seasonal due to the large sub annual variation of freshwater consumption and availability hoekstra et al 2012 for instance a major share of the total available water in india is concentrated in the monsoon season from june to september and other months have less available water to meet the demands hoekstra et al 2012 similarly the irrigation water use is highly seasonal in india with two different crop seasons kharif cropping season from june to october and rabi cropping season from october to march revadekar and preethi 2012 when water availability and water uses are quantified at an annual time scale the assessment fails to capture this intra annual variability liu et al 2017b veldkamp et al 2017 in summary the lack of proper quantification of components such as groundwater industrial domestic and environmental water use and selection of appropriate scales of analysis can be listed as the major drawbacks of the previous studies moreover these components need to be integrated into a single modelling framework to obtain a better representation of blue water scarcity the present study aims to overcome the limitations of previous studies by quantifying the components of available water and water uses via the combined use of a large scale earth system model and census based statistical data there are various terms used in this paper to describe water fluxes to ensure consistency of terminology throughout the paper we use the following definitions o bluewater availability is defined as the natural runoff available through groundwater and rivers after deducting the environmental flow requirements aldaya et al 2012 o net irrigated area is the area of land in which irrigation is adopted during the cropping once or more than once in a year if two or more crops are grown in different seasons india wris 2012 o india wris 2012 o gross domestic product gdp is the measure of the monetary value of final goods and services produced in a country in a given period callen 2008 o water demand is the total volume of water used by various users within the water system if sufficient water is available wada et al 2011a o water use is a general non specific term representing the use of water by agriculture industry domestic purposes and environmental needs in the present study we use water use interchangeably with water demand u n 1997 o sustainable water use is defined as water resources and water services that can satisfy the changing biophysical demand placed on them now and into the future without system degradation loucks 2000 1 2 objective and scope the primary objective of this study is to quantify blue water scarcity in india at state spatial scale and monthly temporal scale the sub objectives are listed as follows a to quantify the available water from both surface and groundwater sources b to reconstruct various water demands using census based statistical data c to quantify the amount of non renewable groundwater abstraction in india and d to estimate blue water scarcity by compiling the above datasets this paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the nature of the data collected and section 3 provides the methods adopted for the analysis the model validation of available water and water use are presented in section 4 followed by the results of each component in section 5 the estimation of blue water scarcity measures using the modelled components of available water and water uses is explained in section 5 3 followed by conclusions in section 6 an appendix is also provided in section 7 with the supplement figures to support each of these sections 2 datasets table 1 lists the census datasets collected from various national and state government organisations in india these datasets are compiled from multiple sources and are based both on surveys and observations for instance the survey based industrial water demand by nciwrd 1999 is used as a reference data in the present study while the modelled estimates from other sources e g fao 2002 bank 2012 are excluded among the datasets industrial production data is made up of 56 industrial products and by industrial consumables that include 29 survey components accessed from indiastat thukral 2011 similarly reservoir data consists of reservoir live storage and full reservoir capacity of 63 major reservoirs in the country all the other datasets are single variables at the spatial and temporal scales indicated in table 1 most of the continuous datasets are at national and annual time scale for instance population data is available from 1960 to 2015 at annual and whole of india scales but state wise population data is only available for five years table 1 hence the available state wise data is used to extrapolate over longer periods assuming that the proportion of each state to whole of india remains constant over the analysis period further there are differences in the length of the various datasets available corresponding to the length of the available data in table 1 the components such as surface runoff and groundwater recharge components are modelled for the period 1960 to 2005 irrigation water demand is modelled from 1950 to 1999 industrial water demand is modelled from 1981 to 2010 and domestic water demand from 1991 to 2015 as a result the overlapping period for all these datasets is from 1991 to 1999 hence blue water scarcity measures are estimated during this period also there are privacy concerns that limit many state governmental organisations from reporting some water uses which restrict the validation of the model nevertheless we compiled datasets at state scale wherever available and use it for validation section 3 discusses the methods by which these datasets are disaggregated to the analysis scale of the present study state and monthly and used for estimation of the available water and various water uses 3 methods the overall modelling framework listing the components is shown in fig 1 the green boxes in the modelling framework fig 1 represent the components of available water and water uses and the violet boxes represent the modelling approach for these components joseph et al 2020 the components of available water surface water and groundwater are modelled in this study using a community land model clm 4 0 on the other hand the components of water use irrigation industrial domestic and environmental water use are modelled using census datasets specific to each of these sectors since most of these components are highly seasonal they are quantified at monthly timescale furthermore the spatial scale of analysis selected is state as the analysis at whole of india may hide the spatial variability within the physical blue water scarcity indicators of water stress are estimated in this study following the un sdg 6 4 2 sustainable development goal and water shortage based on per capita available water the un sdg 6 4 2 indicator define the level of water stress as the ratio of freshwater withdrawal to available water resource minus the environmental flow requirements hák et al 2016 the per capita available water is defined as the average quantity of water available for an individual in one day to meet the various water requirements vanham et al 2018 sections 3 1 3 3 discuss the methods by which the available water water use and blue water scarcity indicators are estimated in this study 3 1 estimation of available water the community land model clm 4 0 which is the land surface representation of community earth system model cesm created and evolved by the national centre of atmospheric research ncar is used in this study oleson et al 2010 many previous large scale assessments used this model to quantify and assess the issues associated with climate change and human interventions lawrence et al 2011 lo and famiglietti 2013 sacks et al 2009 sakaguchi and zeng 2009 zeng and decker 2009 the model details including the water balance diagram and the mathematical representation of the runoff components are shown in appendix a1 the model was run at a spatial resolution of 0 47 0 63 and at a monthly time scale from 1950 to 2002 three simulation cases are run for this study a control run with no irrigation irrigation runs with b irrigation data from wisser et al 2010 and c irrigation data based on census datasets from thukral 2011 these simulation cases are designated as ctrl irr wisser and irr indiastat respectively the irrigation run is significant as irrigation changes the soil moisture which in turn alters the water and energy fluxes from the land surface to the planetary boundary layer lawston et al 2017 the water stores in the model include water in unconfined aquifer and water stored in the soil column the present study assumes that 50 of the irrigation is supplied by surface water and the remaining 50 from groundwater this assumption is based on the rationale that global irrigation consumptive use from groundwater constitutes 43 of the total in india india also has the largest extent of the groundwater irrigated area 39 million hectares in the world siebert et al 2010 wey et al 2015 previous studies which focused on whole of india identified that 50 of the total irrigation is groundwater fed while the remaining is met by surface water bhanja et al 2018 dhawan 2017 gandhi and bhamoriya 2011 jha and sinha 2009 on the other hand some studies reported that the groundwater contribution to irrigation increased from 45 to 55 during 1990 to 2000 which corresponds to the analysis period of the present study ministry of agriculture 2014 suhag 2016 nevertheless there are differences in irrigation contribution from groundwater within different regions of india however most of the reported values in the various states of india lie within the range of 45 60 as shown in table 2 below there was no further data available at the state scale to validate the assumption made in this study this is one of the limitations of large scale approaches where regional or catchment wise information is difficult to collect nevertheless we have validated all the components of the modelling framework used in this study which supports our assumption on irrigation distribution 3 1 1 surface water component to parameterise surface runoff a topmodel based runoff model is implemented in clm based on the concept that the fractional saturated and impermeable area are determined by topographic characteristics and soil moisture state of a grid cell niu et al 2005 surface runoff consists of both overland flow due to saturation excess and infiltration excess mechanisms the drainage or sub surface runoff is estimated as a function of water table depth oleson et al 2010 the modelled surface runoff is calibrated against the discharge observations from gauging locations at various river basins in india including vijayawada in the krishna river basin gurudeshwar in the narmada river basin polavaram in the godavari river basin khanpur in the mahi river basin and japla in the ganga river basin cwc 2005 the dataset for the ganga basin is not continuous but three discrete sets of data from the years 1971 to 1975 1980 to 1985 and 2000 to 2002 are available since the gauging locations are at the outlet of the basin and considering the travel time for runoff to reach the basin outlet model calibration is performed at the annual timescale further reservoirs in india operates on an annual basis and we did not consider the influence of reservoirs while calibrating the streamflow this is consistent with many of the previous global water resources assessments and there is a lack of data associated with it joseph et al 2020 3 1 2 groundwater component several past large scale assessments have neglected the groundwater contribution in determining sustainable water use mainly because of data constraints hanasaki et al 2008 kummu et al 2010 this study determines the groundwater component for total available water from the recharge flux calculated by the clm 4 0 model as shown in fig 1 the clm model computes the recharge as the vertical flux between the aquifer and bottom soil layer such that positive recharge flows downward as gravity drainage and negative recharge flows upward by capillary flux lo et al 2008 oleson et al 2008 richey et al 2015 the positive recharge is assumed to contribute to groundwater availability while the negative modelled recharge is assumed to lack renewable supplies to replenish the aquifers richey et al 2015 therefore only the gravity drainage component positive recharge of the clm 4 0 model is considered as groundwater available in this study this study uses the census data on sector wise state wise groundwater abstraction and the modelled estimate of renewable groundwater available to quantify the non renewable groundwater abstraction non renewable groundwater abstraction is defined as the groundwater abstraction minus renewable groundwater available doll 2009 the mean annual groundwater recharge from clm 4 0 corresponds to the renewable groundwater available wada et al 2010 while the groundwater withdrawal dataset is generated based on the census data collected from indiastat thukral 2011 since the groundwater abstraction data is state wise and annually the non renewable groundwater abstraction of state j and year i n r g w i j is estimated as shown in equation 3 1 3 1 n r g w i j g w r i j g w a i j where g w r i j is the groundwater recharge for state j and year i and g w a i j is the groundwater abstraction for state j and year i while groundwater withdrawals at whole of india are available during the period of analysis state wise groundwater withdrawals are only available for the year 2004 thukral 2011 the state wise data for the year 2004 is used to extrapolate the data for the analysis period 1991 1999 by assuming a uniform ratio of groundwater withdrawal to total water withdrawal in each state we assumed the groundwater withdrawal of each state to total groundwater withdrawal of india hasn t changed during the analysis period this implies that during the analysis period a sudden rise or fall in groundwater abstraction in one state compared to other states is neglected although there is an increasing trend of groundwater withdrawal from 1991 to 1999 we assume that this increase is uniform for all the states one of the primary reasons for this assumption is the lack of state wise groundwater withdrawal data for a longer period 3 2 estimation of water uses the water uses are estimated using census datasets collected from national and state government agencies commission 2006 commission 2008 nciwrd 1999 thukral 2011 the irrigation water use is estimated from census datasets on irrigated areas and irrigation water withdrawals while the industrial water use is modelled using datasets on industrial production industrial consumables and technological development indicators domestic water use is quantified using datasets on population and gross domestic product the environmental water use is modelled following hydrology based approach to overcome the lack of available data the modelled components of available water and water uses are calibrated using an independent census dataset at the basin state and whole of india scales 3 2 1 irrigation water use irrigation water use is reconstructed based on the data of irrigated areas and irrigation water volume from national and state governmental agencies anant 2012 bengal 2012 forests 2007 manna 2016 thukral 2011 table 1 presents the state wise source wise net irrigated area in india from 2000 to 2011 this data is used to calculate the average fraction of net irrigated area by surface water r s w i as shown in equation 3 2 if the net irrigated area by surface water in state i for a year is n i a s w i y e a r 1000 ha and net irrigated area by surface water for the whole of india for the year is n i a s w i n d i a y e a r then the average fraction of net irrigated area by surface water is estimated as 3 2 r s w i n i a s w i 2000 n i a s w i n d i a 2000 n i a s w i 2011 n i a s w i n d i a 2011 12 this average fraction of net irrigated area by surface water is combined with the irrigation water volume from surface water and the net irrigated area for the base year to estimate the irrigation water volumes in india the total irrigation water volume from surface water v t s w n i a b a s e y e a r is estimated as shown in equation 3 3 3 3 v t s w n i a b a s e y e a r v s w i b a s e y e a r n i a t i b a s e y e a r n i a s w i b a s e y e a r where n i a t i b a s e y e a r represents the total net irrigated area in state i in the base year thousand hectares n i a s w i b a s e y e a r is the total net irrigated area in state i by surface water in the base year thousand hectares and v s w i b a s e y e a r is the irrigation water volume from surface water in state i in the base year bcm similar steps are repeated for estimating the total irrigation water volume from groundwater for each state in india the reconstructed irrigation water volume is further validated using an independent census data on irrigation water volume at state scale section 4 the modelled results of irrigation water use are discussed in section 5 3 3 2 2 industrial water use this study uses a modelling framework combining the census datasets of industrial production industrial survey components and economic technological indicators to determine industrial water use joseph et al 2017 the input variables considered include the industrial production data of eight broad categories of industries five major industrial survey components and three economic technological indicators a multivariate regression model is used to estimate the industrial water demand with these variables in three categories as predictors however the predictor variables exhibit high cross correlation which may result in over parameterisation of the multivariate model to overcome this problem the model drivers were selected using principal component analysis pca to reduce a large number of input variables to a more compact set of orthogonal predictors jolliffe 2002 rencher 2002 these components are developed as a linear function of all the input variables for instance the coefficients of each variable in the linear function for pc1 and pc2 are illustrated in fig a2 of the appendix these components are structured in a way such that the first pc represents the maximum variance and second pc the second maximum variance in the direction orthogonal to the first pc the first two principal components explain 95 of the total variability of the input variables thus these predictors are used to estimate industrial water demand since these components are a linear association of the input variables we choose a linear model that best fits the industrial water use the linear model selected with the components pc1 and pc2 is shown in equation 3 4 3 4 i n d i j a p c 1 b p c 2 c where indi j is the industrial water demand at whole of india and annual scales the variables a b and c are coefficients of the best linear model selected for modelling the model results are validated using survey data of industrial water demand from nciwrd 1999 and bhushan 2004 these results are then disaggregated at state scale in proportion to the number of industrial units in each state the modelling results at state scale are further validated with an independent dataset from state governmental agencies bengal 2012 forests 2007 panandiker 2013 wilson 2014 the annual values are then disaggregated to monthly scale using the monthly industrial production dataset joseph et al 2019 3 2 3 domestic water use this study uses the census datasets of population and domestic water use to identify that per capita domestic water use has been increasing in india the increase in per capita domestic water use is consistent with the rise in per capita gdp of the country and show a high cross correlation correlation coefficient 0 8 supporting this various studies have highlighted the significance of including the change in the rate of per capita water use that occurs with economic development in the modelling processes guo et al 2013 oki and kanae 2006 therefore the present study models the per capita domestic water use by including a time dependent per capita gdp approach a power function model is selected using the levenberg marquardt algorithm to fit per capita domestic water use with per capita gdp gavin 2011 lourakis 2005 moré 1978 the per capita domestic water use p c u i j at state j and year i is estimated in equation 3 5 as 3 5 p c u i 1 j a 1 p c g i j b 1 c 1 where p c g i j is the per capita gross domestic product of state j and year i a1 b1 and c1 are coefficients of the power function model selected the total domestic water use d w u i j at year i and state j is estimated as a product of population and modelled per capita domestic water use in equation 3 6 3 6 d w u i j p c u i j p o p i j the model statistics r squared 0 91 adjusted r squared 0 71 and rmse 6 61 support the model selection the modelling results are validated using census datasets of domestic water use at whole of india scale the model results at state scale are further validated against independent census data from state governmental organisations thukral 2011 3 2 4 environmental water use the quantification of environmental water use in large scale assessments is difficult due to the lack of available data and proper prediction methods various approaches for quantifying environmental water demand include hydrology based hydraulic rating habitat simulation and holistic methods tharme 2003 among these methods the hydrology based approach allocates the environmental water demand by mimicking the natural flow regime the hydraulic rating approach focus on the river hydraulic parameters habitat simulation aims at sustaining the aquatic habitat and holistic approach follows a combination of these methods we use a hydrologic based approach due to the lack of national level eco hydrological data using this method environmental flows are allocated in this study as a proportion of the available water smakhtin 2006 a summary of the various hydrology based environmental flow estimation methods is shown in table 3 since environmental flows are seasonal the classification of months as low flow and high flow months is adopted in this study following pastor et al 2014 low flow months correspond to months when the mean monthly flow is less than mean annual flow while all other months are considered high flow months tennant 1976 the low flow months are allocated flow exceeded 90 of the time q90 and the high flow months are assigned flow exceeded 50 of the time q50 although environmental water demand is included in the current approach the implementation of environmental flows is still not practised in most states therefore the impact of the environmental flow component on blue water scarcity is evaluated in this study by comparing the water stress index estimate with and without the environmental flow component in section 5 7 1 3 3 estimation of blue water scarcity measures bluewater scarcity measures of water stress and water shortage are estimated based on available water and water demands water stored in reservoirs transfers water from high flow months to low flow months and to help reduce the severity of water stress in dry months in this study monthly excess water is defined as the amount of available water after meeting irrigation industrial and domestic water demands resulting monthly excess water is carried over to the next month however when the excess water reaches the reservoir storage capacity subsequent surplus flows are treated as river flows losses the proportion of surplus water routed to river discharge is estimated using a linear model that is calibrated against the monthly river discharge at the krishna basin outlet in vijayawada the linear calibration model selected is based on akaike and bayesian s information criteria edwards et al 1963 shibata 1976 fig a3 of the appendix shows the model selection process and the time series of modelled and observed monthly discharge in the krishna basin the model results show that 65 of excess water is stored in reservoirs and 35 become losses as river flows it is important to note that we have lumped the reservoir data at state scale for this calibration procedure as water demands are only estimated at state scale the estimated volume of reservoir storage is validated against reservoir live storage data source commission 2008 thukral 2011 this validation of the excess water during the months 1995 june to 1996 may is shown in fig 2 three cases are presented control case assumes no carry over of water carryover case assumes that 65 of excess carry over water while with reservoir case assumes no carryover and the reservoir live storage capacity is added to the total surface water the carryover case shows good agreement to with reservoir case supporting this model selection r squared 0 92 rmse 6 34 nse 0 79 moreover a recent study by gupta et al 2016 identified that runoff ratio of the 28 river basins in india for the period of 1971 to 2005 is approximately 33 8 which reinforces the current assumption of 35 the mathematical representation of the estimation of wsi is shown in equations 3 7 to 3 12 where s w i j and g w i j are the monthly surface runoff and groundwater runoff estimates respectively these are based on the land surface model clm 4 0 outputs for month i and location j respectively the total available water t a w i j is defined as 3 7 t a w i j s w i j g w i j e x w i 1 j where the excess water from the previous month e x w i 1 j is defined as 3 8 e x w i 1 j 0 65 s w i 1 j i r r i 1 j i n d i 1 j d o m i 1 j 3 9 m a x e x w i 1 j r c i 1 j where r c i 1 j is the full reservoir capacity of state j in month i i r r i j is the irrigation water demand i n d i j is the industrial water demand and d o m i j is the domestic water demand the total water demand of month i and location j is defined as 3 10 t w d i j i r r i j i n d i j d o m i j the water stress index of the month i and location j w s i i j is therefore defined as 3 11 w s i i j t w d i j t a w i j when the environmental flow component is included the updated water stress index for state i and month j w s i n e w i j is defined as 3 12 w s i n e w i j t w d i j t a w i j e n v i j where e n v i j is the environmental flow component for state j and month i the water stress index is estimated in the present study following equation 3 12 wada et al 2011a wada et al 2011b based on wsi water stress regions are classified as low water stress wsi 0 2 moderate water stress 0 2 wsi 0 4 and severe water stress wsi 0 4 the water shortage indicator is estimated using the measure of per capita available water the per capita available water indicator paw classifies blue water scarcity into four different zones a no stress region with paw 1700 m3 cap year b water scarce region with 1000 paw 1700 m3 cap year c water stressed region with 500 paw 1000 m3 cap year and d absolute water stress region with paw 500 m3 cap year the virtual water component which represents the amount of embedded water within a product transferred between india and other countries is neglected due to lack of available data hoekstra and hung 2002 similarly desalinated water use in the coastal regions is not included in the modelling framework because the major desalination plants in india namely minjur and nemmeli are in operation only since 2005 which is outside the analysis period abraham and luthra 2011 natarajan 2018 although the major reservoirs are included in the modelling framework the small storages in tanks and ponds are excluded as proper quantification of their water contribution is not available 4 model validation in this study validation of the available water and water uses at both national and state scales is performed by utilizing independent census data collected from state governmental organisations in india for instance streamflow data from five river basins in india is collected for calibrating the modelled runoff these river basins are in different climate zones with the river basin mahi is in an arid region krishna is in a semi arid region godavari is in a tropical area ganga in a tropical wet climate region and narmada is in a humid tropical region among these basins two of them are west flowing and others and east flowing rivers although we wish to compare the observed and modelled runoff from a greater number of river basins there is a lack of observed data in many of the river basins in india fig 3 shows the time series of observed discharge and modelled runoff from three simulation cases for five river basins in india the modelled vs observed discharge with a 1 1 line is also shown as a sub plot corresponding to each river basin the model performance statistics r squared root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are shown in table 4 the unit of rmse is the same as the unit of discharge bcm year while r squared and nse are dimensionless values these metrics indicate good model performance for all study basins except for krishna river basin however the model overestimates the discharge for the krishna basin during the period 1982 to 2000 the lower model performance in the krishna basin during this period can be attributed to the major droughts in the basin in the same period gaur et al 2007 similarly for the ganga basin the model results show good agreement with the observed discharge most of the time except for the period 2000 to 2002 these results gave us confidence in using the surface water component of the total available water obtained from the clm 4 0 model fig 4 a c shows the validation of estimated net irrigated area by surface water nia sw groundwater nia gw and all sources total nia against the observed data collected from the different states of india the model results show good agreement with the observed data and are supported by the corresponding performance measures nse 0 86 for nia sw 0 97 for nia gw and 0 92 for total nia the reconstructed irrigated area equation 3 1 is further used in equation 3 2 to estimate the irrigation water volume the census dataset on irrigation water volume is not available for most of these states which made necessary to validate it against the existing global assessments as reported in chou 2019 table 5 shows the validation of industrial water use against the census data collected from the state governmental organisations the model results show good agreement with industrial water use statistics for most of the states however for karnataka state the model underestimates industrial water use the methodology adopted in this study is to disaggregate the river basin level industrial water use statistic to state scale proportional to the drainage area of the basin in each state but for karnataka state industrial development is much higher in regions which are not overlapping with the krishna basin leading to a distortion in the estimation chandrakanth 2009 the deviations are however small which justifies this estimation of industrial water use model for further analysis fig 5 shows the validation of domestic water use against state governmental organisations overall the results show good agreement with the observed data average nse 0 49 for the state of west bengal the model underestimates domestic water use it is important however to note here that this study does not consider the influence of annual rainfall on domestic water use which may be one of the reasons for the underestimation west bengal receives high rainfall compared to other parts of india which increase the availability of water for domestic purposes 5 results and discussions figs 6 and a4 show the spatial distribution and time series of the modelled components of available water and water use the north western part of india and the south eastern parts have the lowest available water while the south western and north eastern parts have the highest available water most of the components exhibit seasonality with higher flows during the summer monsoon months june to september except for domestic water use which is higher in the summer months starting in march and lower in the winter months beginning november similarly industrial water use is higher in march compared to other months due to the increased industrial production by the end of the financial year in india section 5 4 the modelled results of each of these components are discussed in section 5 1 to 5 6 5 1 surface water component in india the major contributor of surface runoff is the summer monsoon rainfall from june to september while other months receive significantly less or no rainfall the spatial distribution of surface runoff and monthly time series of rainfall and surface runoff are shown in fig a1 of the appendix it should be noted here that the north eastern region and the south western state kerala receive the highest rainfall which results in higher runoff values for those states similarly the north western region and the south eastern state tamil nadu receive the lowest rainfall leading to lower runoff the inter annual variability of surface runoff shows that the flow is higher in the year 1994 while the year 1992 1997 and 1998 corresponds to low flow period across india fig 7 5 2 groundwater component the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge is shown in fig 6 and the time series is shown in fig 8 b it is important to note that the states of north western india and uttar pradesh are highly dependent on groundwater the available surface water in these states is not enough to meet their water demands which leads to extensive groundwater abstraction fig 8a shows the state wise groundwater withdrawal and estimated non renewable groundwater abstraction for the year 1999 the data show higher groundwater withdrawal in large food producing states such as uttar pradesh and punjab groundwater withdrawal accounts for between 10 and 25 bcm in most of the states except for the surface water abundant north eastern region and south western states this study uses the sector wise state wise groundwater abstraction data and the groundwater recharge component from clm 4 0 model to estimate the non renewable groundwater abstraction fig 8b shows the state wise estimated non renewable groundwater abstraction for the year 1999 this calculation identified that 34 bcm of groundwater abstraction is non renewable in the country in the year 1992 and increased to 42 bcm in the year 1999 the high groundwater abstraction is predominant in the states of gujarat 9 bcm in 1992 12 bcm in 1999 rajasthan 10 bcm in 1992 13 bcm in 1999 and tamil nadu 14 bcm in 1992 18 bcm in 1999 groundwater in these arid states meets a significant proportion of the water demands more specifically irrigation water demand the estimate is consistent with the severe depletion of groundwater observed in north western india using the change in water storage from grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite data wada et al 2014b 5 3 irrigation water use fig 9 shows the estimated irrigation water use at state at monthly scales the seasonality of irrigation water use corresponds with the kharif summer season cropping season in india from june to october where intensive irrigation is applied to meet crop water demand although summer monsoon rainfall from june to september contributes to crop water requirement irrigation is still applied to meet the high crop water demand predominantly in the arid regions spatially the states of andhra pradesh rajasthan and uttar pradesh have the highest irrigation water use in india fig a5 of the appendix shows the time series of irrigation water use for these states along with the whole of india irrigation water use is increasing over time in the whole of india and more predominantly in uttar pradesh and rajasthan fig a5 where excessive groundwater abstraction can be observed fig 8a it is also important to note that the central north eastern state of uttar pradesh is the largest food grain producing state 50 b kg in the country contributing to 19 of india s total food production and hence extensive irrigation 76 of the area is irrigated is applied throughout the year 5 4 industrial water use fig 10 shows the modelled spatial distribution of monthly averaged industrial water use for each month the states of maharashtra tamil nadu and andhra pradesh are the largest users of industrial water in india industrial water use exhibits a pronounced seasonality with the highest water use occurring in march this can be ascribed to the end of the financial year in india which runs from april to march and leads to increased industrial production to meet production targets chaturvedi 2012 the time series of modelled industrial water use for major industrialised states in the country is also shown in fig a6 of the appendix industrial water use shows an exponential increase in most of the states after the year 2000 consistent with economic and technological development except for madhya pradesh all other states exhibit an increasing water use trend which is at a faster rate than irrigation water use 5 5 domestic water use fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of domestic water use for each month in india the central north eastern state of uttar pradesh and the central western state of maharashtra lead domestic water use in india the rising population in uttar pradesh and increasing technological development in maharashtra have led to increasing domestic water use in these states domestic water use also exhibits strong seasonality with summer months april to september having greater domestic water use than in the winter months november to february in india 5 6 environmental water use fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of monthly environmental flow for the country it is important to note that the monthly environmental flow requirements are higher than the industrial and domestic water use in india this higher magnitude is owing to the model used in this study which allocates environmental flow as a proportion of available water nonetheless this estimate is lower than the previous studies who allocated 60 80 of available water as environmental flow based on the results central india and the north eastern parts have relatively higher environmental water requirement than other regions corresponding to the higher rainfall and surface runoff in those regions similarly the months of june to october corresponds to the summer monsoon season resulting in high environmental water use in those months there are no established rules for determination or implementation of environmental flow in india which results in inadequate management and allocation of these flows however it is increasingly important to sustain freshwater estuarine ecosystem and the human livelihoods and well being that depend on these ecosystems declaration 2007 consistent with this criterion the environmental flow component is included in the overall water demand for the estimation of blue water scarcity following un sdg 6 4 2 hák et al 2016 5 7 estimation of blue water scarcity measures the spatial distribution of severe water stress intensity is shown in fig 13 severe water stress intensity is defined as the percentage of time each state is affected by severe water stress during the analysis period from january to april most of the states except the north eastern parts face severe water stress for more than 80 of the time the central region of india shifts from more severe to less severe water stress following may and south india from june onwards by the end of september the summer monsoon retreats from northern and central regions of india resulting in more severe water stress in those regions however the south western part of india continues to receive summer monsoon rainfall south west monsoon season until the end of october further the south eastern and central north eastern parts of india receive the additional north east monsoon season from october to december resulting in less water stress in those regions fig 14 shows the monthly distribution of per capita water availability and water stress index the interquartile range of each box indicates the annual variation of these indices the seasonal distribution shows high values of paw and low values of wsi during the months from june to october the months from january to may show more severe water stress wsi 0 4 with march and april extremely stressed wsi 1 paw is low in most parts of india from october to december nevertheless for the south east and central north east regions the north east monsoon rainfall from october to december helps to increase paw and reduce wsi fig 13 fig 15 shows the exponential decay of the water stress index with the increase in per capita available water the various zones of water stress and water shortage are indicated with red dots which corresponds to monthly values during the period 1991 to 1999 the overlapping zone of extremely severe water stress wsi 1 and the absolute water stress paw 500 m3 cap year is the most critical zone where both the blue water scarcity indicators are at the extreme ends it is important to note that more than 40 of the data falls within this critical region revealing severe water scarcity in the country for higher per capita water use the wsi values fall in low or moderate water stress except for a very few months due to the seasonality of the water demands water stress regimes include lws corresponds to low water stress region when wsi 0 2 mws corresponds to moderate water stress region when 0 2 wsi 0 4 sws corresponds to severe water stress region when 0 4 wsi 1 esws corresponds to extremely severe water stress region when wsi 1 wada et al 2011a the water shortage regimes include aws corresponds to absolute water stress region when per capita available water 500 m3 person year ws corresponds to water stress region when 500 per capita available water 1000 m3 person year wsc corresponds to water scarce region when 1000 per capita available water 1700 m3 person year nws corresponds to no water stress region when per capita available water 1700 m3 person year damkjaer and taylor 2017 the number of states experiencing low moderate and severe water stress for each month is shown in fig 16 around eight north eastern states are consistently under low water stress fig 13 which results in a higher number of states affected by low water stress the number of states experiencing moderate water stress is smaller due to the high seasonality of monsoon rainfall which is concentrated in only four months of the year around five to seven states are consistently under severe water stress which includes gujarat rajasthan uttar pradesh and maharashtra by assuming the entire population in each spatial unit state experiences the same monthly water stress regime this study also estimated the amount of population experiencing low moderate and severe water stress fig 17 shows the inter annual variation in the amount of population experiencing water stress the annual rainfall hyetograph is also shown as the inset to represent the inter annual variability although there is an increasing trend of severely water stressed population inter annual variability of monsoon rainfall reduces the severe water stress in 1994 and 1998 further fig a7 presents the annual time series of the total population and the population experiencing severe water stress for at least one month of the year approximately 0 62 billion in india faces severe water stress for at least one month of the year from 1991 to 1999 which increases over time to 0 83 billion in 1999 in summary the overall trend of the amount of population experiencing severe water stress is increasing with increasing water demands over time both indicators show extreme water stress in the states of gujarat and rajasthan where water availability is low together with higher water demands groundwater contributes significantly to meet water demands in the arid regions of india section 5 2 the state of maharashtra falls under absolute water stress primarily due to its high population density maharashtra is one of the top industrialised states in the country where industrial water demand is high however compared to states such as uttar pradesh in northern india irrigation water demand is low which precludes maharashtra from falling into extremely severe wsi condition on the other hand uttar pradesh is the largest food producing state in india which drives the high water demand leading to extreme wsi despite the per capita water availability indicator showing only water stressed condition 5 7 1 influence of environmental flow and reservoirs environmental flow policy is not yet implemented in most indian states thus adopting an environmental flow threshold for the analysis period does not imply in practice that other demands are unmet fig 18 shows the impact of environmental flow and reservoir on the various water stress regimes the inclusion of environmental flows causes the percentage of low water stress to reduce from 40 to 33 moderate water stress slightly to increase from 18 to 19 and severe water stress to increase from 41 to 48 similarly the amount of population experiencing severe water stress for at least one month a year increases from 0 52 billion to 0 75 billion people with the inclusion of environmental flows conversely by incorporating the reservoir component equation 3 8 the severe water stress is reduced from 66 to 48 and low water stress zones increased from 18 to 33 fig 18 this analysis shows that the 63 major reservoirs in india contribute to the reduction of severe water stress for approximately 0 1 0 2 billion people this reduction of severe water stress is more pronounced from october to january the influence of environmental flow and reservoirs differ between the various states of india table 6 lists the population millions of several states experiencing severe water stress when environmental flows and reservoirs are included for instance when the environmental flow is added the population experiencing severe water stress in maharashtra increases from 5 1 to 15 million on the other hand the reservoir component helps to reduce the population experiencing severe water stress from 46 5 to 5 1 million among the states west bengal andhra pradesh and karnataka show high sensitivity to reservoir component while states such as bihar madhya pradesh and tamil nadu shows high sensitivity to environmental flow component except for the states in table 6 other states shows less sensitivity to environmental flow and reservoir component it is important to note that those less sensitive states include states which are heavily water stressed e g uttar pradesh and states which are experiencing low water stress e g mizoram assam the monthly variation of state by state population experiencing low water stress when environmental flow and reservoir component are shown in figs a8 a9 a8 and a9 compare the population experiencing low water stress with and without environmental flow respectively the difference is evident during the months of january to march during these months the states such as bihar and jharkhand shifts from low water stress category with the addition of environmental flow similarly figs a10 and a11 compare the population experiencing severe water stress with and without environmental flow respectively the difference is evident during the months of july and august in the states of rajasthan and tamil nadu fig 19 shows the monthly variation of blue water scarcity measures wsi and paw caused by the inclusion of environmental flow when environmental flows are included the per capita available water reduces by 10 30 m3 person month and the water stress index increase from 0 1 to 0 4 and this influence is predominant in november and december in summary not including the environmental flow component results in an underestimation of water stress however if higher environmental flow thresholds e g 80 of surface water were considered it would result in less available water for meeting the other water demands leading to a higher estimate of water scarcity 6 conclusions this study presents a modelling framework for quantifying water scarcity in india via the use of a large scale earth system model clm 4 0 combined with a census based statistical database at state and monthly scales to determine blue water scarcity the study reveals that 0 62 billion people in the country face severe water stress for at least one month a year also this study estimates non renewable groundwater abstraction and identifies critical groundwater depletion in the states of gujarat 12 bcm rajasthan 13 bcm and tamil nadu 18 bcm water scarcity is more severe in gujarat rajasthan maharashtra and uttar pradesh with rajasthan facing severe water stress for more than 90 of the study period conversely the north eastern part of india shows consistent low water stress as the region receives a large amount of rainfall throughout the year most of the states in india have water surplus during the summer monsoon season june september while more than 60 of india exhibit severe water stress during the months from january to april the primary drivers of blue water scarcity are different for various states in india high irrigation water use leads to severe water stress in uttar pradesh while high population density leads to severe water shortage in maharashtra this study also highlights the significant impact on water stress if environmental flows in the country were implemented when the environmental flow component is neglected it results in an underestimation of water stress of 10 15 the inclusion of the reservoir component reduces severe water stress for 0 1 0 2 billion people in the country this is achieved by storing an estimate of approximately 65 of the excess water reservoirs while the remaining 35 is lost as outflows credit authorship contribution

5388,hydrological variations in many lake systems are connected with water supply or loss in response to climate changes in yunnan province of south eastern china major lakes and their catchments such as dian lake basin in the vicinity of the provincial capital kunming were also preferred for early settlements here we reconstructed hydrological conditions of the lake and parts of its catchment in combination with early human occupation during the last 6 cal ka bp and focused on the dian culture bronze age and succeeding han dynasty we mainly used sediment composition in the lake and on land to infer transportation processes related to climate controlled hydrological variations and combined them with past human occupation in response to groundwater fluctuations and resulting settlements and land use our results show that dian lake experienced several low lake level stages between 4 5 and 1 0 cal ka bp negative hydrological balance due to deteriorated monsoon climate impact but also indicate high frequency flood drought events lowered groundwater levels enabled human cultures to settle at low terrain sites during the late neolithic bronze age dian culture and early chinese

characterized by the influence of moving water at the coring site and its carrying capacity of grains in suspended load transport both depend on the distance between inflowing water and the site of deposition within a standing water body yan et al 2018 hence low proportions of the finest fractions em1 and increased silt and or sand em2 em3 likely indicate close proximity of site dc8 to inflowing water and vice versa thus reflecting the distance between the lake shore and the coring site in response to lake shrinkage or lake level rise variations in energy flow under a constant lake level would mainly affect the deposition of coarser components but not the finest fractions slack water deposits when taking the principles of physical settling processes into account hence frequent fluctuations between endmembers were interpreted in terms of variable river discharges the latter are associated with periodical extremes among a variety of geochemical elements in the core dc8 derived from an x ray fluorescence xrf line scan by a geotek xrf core scanner in 2 mm resolution at nanjing normal university we used calcium ca as the major proxy for aquatic gastropods growth as carbonate caco3 content correlated with xrf calcium values fig 5 and gastropods rely on the availability of dissolved calcium in the lake water for the production of their shell titanium ti served as a representative proxy for detrital sediment flux into the lake haug et al 2001 hence cyclic recurrences of sediment flux calculated based on frequency after redfit analysis by past 3 0 software hammer et al 2001 were based on titanium values as all xrf elements belong to compositional data aitchison 1986 we applied cumulative log ratio transformation clr to avoid spurious correlation loss on

site tg3 fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological conditions and climate impact during the last 6 cal ka bp grain size composition and geochemical data from core dc8 of dianchi lake characterized the hydrodynamic variations of the lake throughout the last 6 cal ka bp likely in response to variable river discharges and related effective moisture availability provided by the asm a general decrease of the slackwater deposits em1 in dc8 fig 4 indicates dian lake shrinkage after 4 9 cal ka bp and the increase of coarser fluvial sediment input a stronger decline after 3 5 cal ka bp until ca 1 1 cal ka bp was interrupted by short term fluctuations when the lake level increased between 2 2 and 1 9 cal ka bp despite the inferred reduction in the lake water volume detrital flux ti values fig 4 remained almost constant with a slight decreasing trend this indicated a permanent influx from the sub catchment related to the extended delta formation higher calcium values after ca 4 5 cal ka bp are likely associated with the increased calcium availability by relative enrichment of calcium ions in a reduced water volume also with carbonate precipitation and the significant enrichment of margarya gastropod shells the data correspond well with a general weakening trend of the asian summer monsoon related effective moisture supply as documented in the dongge cave records wang et al 2005 dykoski et al 2006 ca 500 km farther east despite the slight differences between them fig 8 g comparable monsoon signals and a decline in the mean annual precipitation especially during the entire bronze age were also inferred from neighbouring xingyun lake records fig 8 e f as documented by reconstructed mean annual precipitation chen et al 2014 with lowered values at around 4 2 cal ka bp and more severe during the late dian and han periods between 2 0 and 1 7 cal ka bp comparable results were recorded form the same lake by variations in isotopic signals from carbonates hillman et al 2014 with significantly heavier δ18o around 4 2 cal ka bp and during the dian period and at ca 1 7 cal ka bp both records from xingyun lake correspond with variations in em1 slackwater deposits in dian lake although the resolution of em1 between 6 and 4 cal ka bp is relatively low figs 5 and 9 b but support phases of lake shrinkage lower lake level and thus closer distance between the site and the inflowing river were likely related to reduction in effective moisture supply short term lake level increases of dian lake em1 fig 8 during the late dian and han periods between ca 2 2 1 8 cal ka bp at the boundary of the so called 2 kyr shift reversal of monsoon impact in asia cheng et al 2016 accord clearly with the dongge cave record dykoski et al 2006 and isotopic record of xingyun lake hillman et al 2014 this short term increase of dian lake level may have promoted the overflow of existing deep wells that led to the refilling of them while pottery pipes in well j8 perhaps were installed for water supply to the nearby farmlands fig s2 furthermore latest at that time dian settlements were abandoned and covered with margarya gastropod debris to lift the sites above the rising gwl low gully erosion during the late dian period and until 1 5 cal ka bp dearing et al 2008 points to the overall low grade linear surface processes in response to the reduced monsoon rainfall sea surface temperature variations in the arabian sea generally followed the declining trend gupta et al 2003 of summer monsoon impact that culminated during the late eastern han period and thereafter until about 1 3 cal ka bp thereby facilitating the lowest water availability in the dian lake basin due to drier climatic conditions fig 9 frequent alternations in sediment composition ems1 3 fig 4 between the slack water deposits em1 low energy transported silt em2 and high energy transported sand em3 however indicates periodical flood and drought events notably between ca 3 0 and 0 6 cal ka bp based on the continunous record of ti xrf in higher resolution the recurrence cycle of 20 years fig 10 for the last 5 cal ka bp indicate instable monsoon climatic conditions with repeated alternations of enhanced water discharge during extreme flood events and drought periods lack of monsoon rainfall they are possibly in line with sunspot cycles solanki et al 2004 and comparable with such events during the last decades in yunnan province xu et al 2015 notably high frequency variations of em2 and em3 between 3 and 1 cal ka bp can be supported by such periodical events highly variable river discharges in the erhai lake region during the last 5 ka bp fig 9 d dearing et al 2008 corresponded with the detected periodical droughts and floods at dian lake despite differences in resolution of the records and further indicated frequent events in both regions that have accelerated in the periods of high climatic instability with dominance of droughts a comparison with total solar irradiance tsi fig 9 a also implies that most of the grand solar minima steinhilber et al 2012 match or are close to lower em1 values and may explain a reduction in effective moisture supply in the wider region likely under a regional to global climatic setting 5 2 links between human occupation and hydro climate during the bronze age the presence of late neolithic and dian culture layers requires dry ground in the low terrain environments that are currently below the gwl the assumption of yao et al 2015 that the bronze age settlements concentrated on uplifted sites e g shell mounds known as on site locations in comparison to non occupied off site places that are related to wetland environments cannot be confirmed by our findings as the settlement structures occurred at lowland sites tg4 and tg5 too without artificial raising of the ground above the flood zone instead the existence of permanent settlements below the modern gwl requires dry ground and thus corresponds with the changes of the sediment composition em1 fig 4 as a sign of low lake stages and contemporary lowered gwl after 4 9 cal ka bp both in response to reduced effective moisture supply during spells of weak monsoon continuous decline of the lake level after ca 3 3 cal ka bp ca 1400 bce promoted the extension of near shore wetlands and likely desiccation of the former landward wetland regions that are now becoming accessible for various farming activities yao et al 2015 almost equal to the modern 1890 m contour line around dian lake fig 9 few archaeobotanical results at three sites across the delta yao et al 2015 indicated the presence of cultigen plants during the bronze age such as wheat rice barley and foxtail millet with preference to on site locations while rice in combination with wetland taxa was also present at off sites lowlands according to the ecological niche modelling related to the spread of agriculture and introduction of rice millet and eventually wheat into the mountainous regions of southwest asia such crops could have existed at around 1400 bce in the yunnan region d alpoim guedes and butler 2014 taking a lake shrinkage of nearly 4 m into account paddy rice cultivation may have been possible on the exposed lake deposits too however pollen analyses on the lake records were not done yet and may shed light on a possible correlation between land use extension into the wetlands and sedimentary deposits a comparison with the previous modelling results and the reported 2 m lake level variations at dian lake lustig et al 2011 may have promoted the increase of the arable land by about 6 9 yao et al 2015 and even larger in extend this supports our assumption and explains the ground water decline and likely a change from an hydrologically open lake system 4 8 cal ka bp and probably before the reported 12th century ce yao et al 2015 to a closed system lustig et al 2011 between ca 4 8 and 1 3 cal ka b bp fig 5 that favoured the occupation of dian settlements and agricultural practices at the low terrains house remains seen in the layers of dian culture figs s1 and s3 are clear indications of settlements at low terrains stilt houses similar to bronze art ware found in elite cemeteries fig s1 d indicated a permanent settlement close to wetland environments as early as 1400 bce early dian according to the dated gastropod layers at the top of the settlements consequently houses and perhaps bronze artefacts commonly assigned to the shizhaishan late dian culture may need to be reassigned to earlier periods similar to the dated wooden posts of such houses found in baiyangcun at haimenkou jianchuan county north western yunnan martello et al 2018 which dated to 2464 1974 cal bc independent of possible cultural changes hydro climatic conditions and low gwl were necessary to enable the settlements at low terrains additionally all discovered ring wells may also indicate such high instability in groundwater supply notably during the late dian and succeeding han periods thirteen wells below the modern lake level 1887 5 m a s l were found at tg4 site two of which were even dug down to 5 5 m depth to reach the gwl a noteworthy phenomenon is the massive accumulation of the endemic freshwater gastropod margarya nevill 1877 zhang et al 2015 contemporaneous with dian and han settlements according to the dated layers yao et al 2015 in tg4 section thick gastropod layers 1 5 2 m above the settlement floor dated back to between 1027 and 626 bce most of the gastropods were consumed as the apex of the shell was cut to enable release of the soft parts by suction or squeezing a rough calculation based on gastropod counts only at tg4 site indicates that 275 300 mill specimen were consumed during ca 1500 years that equals to 500 700 individuals every day aldridge et al 2009 calculated that a person could harvest about 20 kg gastropods per day transferring such calculation to the wider region around the lake basins with numerous sites of massive gastropod accumulations we suggest an increase in human population during the bronze age and subsequent han dynasty such huge amount of gastropods was more likely to be harvested from the nearby shallow lakes and possibly wetland ponds the increase of xrf calcium values in core dc8 between 4 5 and 1 8 cal ka bp 2 5 ka bc 0 2 ka ad and increased carbonate in the sediments mainly during low lake stays fig 5 correspond well with the period of harvested gastropods the increase of calcium and related carbonate are mainly due to relatively enriched ca ions in a reduced water volume that supported the productivity of carbonate and gastropod shells the gastropod layers at site tg4 however where likely filled at the top of dian settlements after the places were abandoned and now used by han people as indicated by all the wells and artefacts of the han period above dian layers complex relationships between the lake hydrology and nearshore regions are demonstrated in a geological profile from dian lake across the investigated archaeological sites fig 11 this profile not only shows the estimation of lake level variations and related ground water levels during the bronze age succeeding han dynasty and thereafter but also the use of settlements in low terrains outside the elevated regions deteriorating hydro climatic conditions in dian lake accidently provided more arable land for human occupation and development below modern gwl it also demonstrates that the so called on site shell mounds gastropod accumulations and naturally elevated regions in the delta were not the only places for past settlements of dian cultures around dian lake dryer climatic conditions and thus lowered lake and gwl instead prom oted the extension of settlements in lowland areas more frequently than previously assumed although it is widely believed that intervals of large scale climate deterioration and thus weakened asm and succeeding climate periods may have promoted the transformation or cultural fall of the regional civilisations in the mainland of china india e g staubwasser et al 2003 huang et al 2011 dutt et al 2018 for example the dian society was able to use increased dry land due to such climate shifts and fast environmental changes 6 conclusion our results showed that the sedimentary composition of sediments in dian lake and the fluvial delta formation are strongly linked to variations in the hydrological regime during the last 6 cal ka bp with lowest lake stages during the bronze age dian culture and early chinese dynasties han to tang the extend of late neolithic culture horizons and dian settlements to low terrain sites were only possible because of a declined ground water table and associated reduced lake water due to monsoon climate deterioration the increased availability of arable land at that periods and rich food from aquatic systems may have even promoted dian and han population we believe that the comparison of hydrological conditions in the lake basin and on land with human occupation is an appropriate concept for the understanding of past hydro environmental conditions and possible human

5388,hydrological variations in many lake systems are connected with water supply or loss in response to climate changes in yunnan province of south eastern china major lakes and their catchments such as dian lake basin in the vicinity of the provincial capital kunming were also preferred for early settlements here we reconstructed hydrological conditions of the lake and parts of its catchment in combination with early human occupation during the last 6 cal ka bp and focused on the dian culture bronze age and succeeding han dynasty we mainly used sediment composition in the lake and on land to infer transportation processes related to climate controlled hydrological variations and combined them with past human occupation in response to groundwater fluctuations and resulting settlements and land use our results show that dian lake experienced several low lake level stages between 4 5 and 1 0 cal ka bp negative hydrological balance due to deteriorated monsoon climate impact but also indicate high frequency flood drought events lowered groundwater levels enabled human cultures to settle at low terrain sites during the late neolithic bronze age dian culture and early chinese

fill this gap by investigating the hydrological variations of dian lake and its catchment by sedimentary processes as this culturally important region close to the lake depended of lake level height

mastersizer 2000 analyzerat nanjing university china after the removal of carbonate and organic matter were subjected to end member modelling analysis emma according to the modified em modelling algorithm for detrital components in lake deposits weltje and prins 2007 dietze et al 2012 three identified endmembers ems 1 3 explained 94 of the cumulative variance based on 176 samples they are characterized by the influence of moving water at the coring site and its carrying capacity of grains in suspended load transport both depend on the distance between inflowing water and the site of deposition within a standing water body yan et al 2018 hence low proportions of the finest fractions em1 and increased silt and or sand em2 em3 likely indicate close proximity of site dc8 to inflowing water and vice versa thus reflecting the distance between the lake shore and the coring site in response to lake shrinkage or lake level rise variations in energy flow under a constant lake level would mainly affect the deposition of coarser components but not the finest fractions slack water deposits when taking the principles of physical settling processes into account hence frequent fluctuations between endmembers were interpreted in terms of variable river discharges the latter are associated with periodical extremes among a variety of geochemical elements in the core dc8 derived from an x ray fluorescence xrf line scan by a geotek xrf core scanner in 2 mm resolution at nanjing normal university we used calcium ca as the major proxy for aquatic gastropods growth as carbonate caco3 content correlated with xrf calcium values fig 5 and gastropods rely on the availability of dissolved calcium in the lake water for the production of their shell titanium ti served as a representative proxy for detrital sediment flux into the lake haug et al 2001 hence cyclic recurrences of sediment flux calculated based on frequency after redfit analysis by past 3 0 software hammer et al 2001 were based on titanium values as all xrf elements belong to compositional data aitchison 1986 we applied cumulative log ratio transformation clr to avoid spurious correlation loss on ignition was applied to identify organic matter content derived from burning at 550 c of homogenized samples while for total carbonate content the burning temperature was increased to 880 900 c xrf ca data corresponded with total carbonate content 4 results 4 1 lake deposits at dc8 site dian lake the 2 33 m long sediment core dc8 covered the last 6000 years according to the applied age model for the upper 180 cm fig 2 the sediments were dominated by silt fractions of up to 85 with higher clay content up to 12 for the last 2 cal ka bp remarkable sand fractions of 15 20 were found in the lower part of the core 4 6 cal ka bp and there were strong fluctuations during the last 3 cal ka bp fig 3 a three extracted endmembers em 1 3 fig 3b and fig 4 were used to explain the energy for the transportation of sediments into the lake basin and their deposition through time em1 represents the finest fraction composition with the main modal values at 8 and a minor mode at 80 µm of which the finer component can be assigned to slack water deposits derived from suspended load transport and deposition under calm water the values generally declined from about 4 9 cal ka bp to 2 2 cal ka bp and it experienced the lowest values between 1 9 and 1 1 cal ka bp the highest values afterward are followed by a second decline between 0 6 and 0 15 cal ka bp the second minor mode in em1 however represents coarser components that were contemporarily deposited and thus assigned to the slack water facies em2 mainly represents the silt fraction mean modal value at 32 µm related to low energy

interest in the lake catchment all terrestrial sites revealed 1 5 3 m thick fine grained floodplain deposits below modern cultivation soil and above the modern local ground water level gwl they

content in wetland sediments between fine grained lake deposits at ca 6 7 m depth ca 3 4 m below the modern gwl at site tg2 in section tg3 higher organic matter content in wetland facies occurred at 5

the early holocene ca 12 9 8 cal ka bp they indicate a landward extend of the dian lake for all periods the total carbonate content remained low in both sediment cores at tg2 and tg3 sites 5 except in few samples with shell fragments indicating that old carbonate input hardwater effect into the lake may have been not the major reason for the estimated reservoir error in sediments of core dc8 from the lake site tg4 provided a full succession of cultural layers in all segments below the modern clayey silt sand related to cultivated floodplain deposits a 1 5 to 2 m thick layer of massive gastropods shells mainly composed of margarya nevill zhang et al 2015 and charcoal fragments were found below the top sequences fig 6 followed by silty sediments rich in charcoal and archaeological remains pottery fragments bone tools bronze ware down to the bottom of the section the upper shell layer and layer 8 in section t0402 fig 6 b were dated to 2576 145 and 2977 92 cal yr bp 626bc and

range for the gastropod layers and the underlying fine artefact rich sediments with mean ages between 546 and 775 bce below layer 6 and 1125 1262 bce in layer 13 yunnan provincial institute of cultural relics and archaeology and university of chicago 2019 according to these ages most of the gastropod layers here can be assigned to the dian period several dwelling sites partly accompanied by holes for wooden piles indicated living places fig 6 a and s1 suppl inf during the dian period before the gastropod layers were filled above them ground level houses were found in the lower part of

to the dated wood of a brandreth in well j8 fig s2 wood fragments and a peach kernel at the bottom of the well j7 fig 6 b c some of them were dug down across the shell layers to 5 5 m below the modern

site tg3 fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological conditions and climate impact during the last 6 cal ka bp grain size composition and geochemical data from core dc8 of dianchi lake characterized the hydrodynamic variations of the lake throughout the last 6 cal ka bp likely in response to variable river discharges and related effective moisture availability provided by the asm a general decrease of the slackwater deposits em1 in dc8 fig 4 indicates dian lake shrinkage after 4 9 cal ka bp and the increase of coarser fluvial sediment input a stronger decline after 3 5 cal ka bp until ca 1 1 cal ka bp was interrupted by short term fluctuations when the lake level increased between 2 2 and 1 9 cal ka bp despite the inferred reduction in the lake water volume detrital flux ti values fig 4 remained almost constant with a slight decreasing trend this indicated a permanent influx from the sub catchment related to the extended delta formation higher calcium values after ca 4 5 cal ka bp are likely associated with the increased calcium availability by relative enrichment of calcium ions in a reduced water volume also with carbonate precipitation and the significant enrichment of margarya gastropod shells the data correspond well with a general weakening trend of the asian summer monsoon related effective moisture supply as documented in the dongge cave records wang et al 2005 dykoski et al 2006 ca 500 km farther east despite the slight differences between them fig 8 g comparable monsoon signals and a decline in the mean annual precipitation especially during the entire bronze age were also inferred from neighbouring xingyun lake records fig 8 e f as documented by reconstructed mean annual precipitation chen et al 2014 with lowered values at around 4 2 cal ka bp and more severe during the late dian and han periods between 2 0 and 1 7 cal ka bp comparable results were recorded form the same lake by variations in isotopic signals from carbonates hillman et al 2014 with significantly heavier δ18o around 4 2 cal ka bp and during the dian period and at ca 1 7 cal ka bp both records from xingyun lake correspond with variations in em1 slackwater deposits in dian lake although the resolution of em1 between 6 and 4 cal ka bp is relatively low figs 5 and 9 b but support phases of lake shrinkage lower lake level and thus closer distance between the site and the inflowing river were likely related to reduction in effective moisture supply short term lake level increases of dian lake em1 fig 8 during the late dian and han periods between ca 2 2 1 8 cal ka bp at the boundary of the so called 2 kyr shift reversal of monsoon impact in asia cheng et al 2016 accord clearly with the dongge cave record dykoski et al 2006 and isotopic record of xingyun lake hillman et al 2014 this short term increase of dian lake level may have promoted the overflow of existing deep wells that led to the refilling of them while pottery pipes in well j8 perhaps were installed for water supply to the nearby farmlands fig s2 furthermore latest at that time dian settlements were abandoned and covered with margarya gastropod debris to lift the sites above the rising gwl low gully erosion during the late dian period and until 1 5 cal ka bp dearing et al 2008 points to the overall low grade linear surface processes in response to the reduced monsoon rainfall sea surface temperature variations in the arabian sea generally followed the declining trend gupta et al 2003 of summer monsoon impact that culminated during the late eastern han period and thereafter until about 1 3 cal ka bp thereby facilitating the lowest water availability in the dian lake basin due to drier climatic conditions fig 9 frequent alternations in sediment composition ems1 3 fig 4 between the slack water deposits em1 low energy transported silt em2 and high energy transported sand em3 however indicates periodical flood and drought events notably between ca 3 0 and 0 6 cal ka bp based on the continunous record of ti xrf in higher resolution the recurrence cycle of 20 years fig 10 for the last 5 cal ka bp indicate instable monsoon climatic conditions with repeated alternations of enhanced water discharge during extreme flood events and drought periods lack of monsoon rainfall they are possibly in line with sunspot cycles solanki et al 2004 and comparable with such events during the last decades in yunnan province xu et al 2015 notably high frequency variations of em2 and em3 between 3 and 1 cal ka bp can be supported by such periodical events highly variable river discharges in the erhai lake region during the last 5 ka bp fig 9 d dearing et al 2008 corresponded with the detected periodical droughts and floods at dian lake despite differences in resolution of the records and further indicated frequent events in both regions that have accelerated in the periods of high climatic instability with dominance of droughts a comparison with total solar irradiance tsi fig 9 a also implies that most of the grand solar minima steinhilber et al 2012 match or are close to lower em1 values and may explain a reduction in effective moisture supply in the wider region likely under a regional to global climatic setting 5 2 links between human occupation and hydro climate during the bronze age the presence of late neolithic and dian culture layers requires dry ground in the low terrain environments that are currently below the gwl the assumption of yao et al 2015 that the bronze age settlements concentrated on uplifted sites e g shell mounds known as on site locations in comparison to non occupied off site places that are related to wetland environments cannot be confirmed by our findings as the settlement structures occurred at lowland sites tg4 and tg5 too without artificial raising of the ground above the flood zone instead the existence of permanent settlements below the modern gwl requires dry ground and thus corresponds with the changes of the sediment composition em1 fig 4 as a sign of low lake stages and contemporary lowered gwl after 4 9 cal ka bp both in response to reduced effective moisture supply during spells of weak monsoon continuous decline of the lake level after ca 3 3 cal ka bp ca 1400 bce promoted the extension of near shore wetlands and likely desiccation of the former landward wetland regions that are now becoming accessible for various farming activities yao et al 2015 almost equal to the modern 1890 m contour line around dian lake fig 9 few archaeobotanical results at three sites across the delta yao et al 2015 indicated the presence of cultigen plants during the bronze age such as wheat rice barley and foxtail millet with preference to on site locations while rice in combination with wetland taxa was also present at off sites lowlands according to the ecological niche modelling related to the spread of agriculture and introduction of rice millet and eventually wheat into the mountainous regions of southwest asia such crops could have existed at around 1400 bce in the yunnan region d alpoim guedes and butler 2014 taking a lake shrinkage of nearly 4 m into account paddy rice cultivation may have been possible on the exposed lake deposits too however pollen analyses on the lake records were not done yet and may shed light on a possible correlation between land use extension into the wetlands and sedimentary deposits a comparison with the previous modelling results and the reported 2 m lake level variations at dian lake lustig et al 2011 may have promoted the increase of the arable land by about 6 9 yao et al 2015 and even larger in extend this supports our assumption and explains the ground water decline and likely a change from an hydrologically open lake system 4 8 cal ka bp and probably before the reported 12th century ce yao et al 2015 to a closed system lustig et al 2011 between ca 4 8 and 1 3 cal ka b bp fig 5 that favoured the occupation of dian settlements and agricultural practices at the low terrains house remains seen in the layers of dian culture figs s1 and s3 are clear indications of settlements at low terrains stilt houses similar to bronze art ware found in elite cemeteries fig s1 d indicated a permanent settlement close to wetland environments as early as 1400 bce early dian according to the dated gastropod layers at the top of the settlements consequently houses and perhaps bronze artefacts commonly assigned to the shizhaishan late dian culture may need to be reassigned to earlier periods similar to the dated wooden posts of such houses found in baiyangcun at haimenkou jianchuan county north western yunnan martello et al 2018 which dated to 2464 1974 cal bc independent of possible cultural changes hydro climatic conditions and low gwl were necessary to enable the settlements at low terrains additionally all discovered ring wells may also indicate such high instability in groundwater supply notably during the late dian and succeeding han periods thirteen wells below the modern lake level 1887 5 m a s l were found at tg4 site two of which were even dug down to 5 5 m depth to reach the gwl a noteworthy phenomenon is the massive accumulation of the endemic freshwater gastropod margarya nevill 1877 zhang et al 2015 contemporaneous with dian and han settlements according to the dated layers yao et al 2015 in tg4 section thick gastropod layers 1 5 2 m above the settlement floor dated back to between 1027 and 626 bce most of the gastropods were consumed as the apex of the shell was cut to enable release of the soft parts by suction or squeezing a rough calculation based on gastropod counts only at tg4 site indicates that 275 300 mill specimen were consumed during ca 1500 years that equals to 500 700 individuals every day aldridge et al 2009 calculated that a person could harvest about 20 kg gastropods per day transferring such calculation to the wider region around the lake basins with numerous sites of massive gastropod accumulations we suggest an increase in human population during the bronze age and subsequent han dynasty such huge amount of gastropods was more likely to be harvested from the nearby shallow lakes and possibly wetland ponds the increase of xrf calcium values in core dc8 between 4 5 and 1 8 cal ka bp 2 5 ka bc 0 2 ka ad and increased carbonate in the sediments mainly during low lake stays fig 5 correspond well with the period of harvested gastropods the increase of calcium and related carbonate are mainly due to relatively enriched ca ions in a reduced water volume that supported the productivity of carbonate and gastropod shells the gastropod layers at site tg4 however where likely filled at the top of dian settlements after the places were abandoned and now used by han people as indicated by all the wells and artefacts of the han period above dian layers complex relationships between the lake hydrology and nearshore regions are demonstrated in a geological profile from dian lake across the investigated archaeological sites fig 11 this profile not only shows the estimation of lake level variations and related ground water levels during the bronze age succeeding han dynasty and thereafter but also the use of settlements in low terrains outside the elevated regions deteriorating hydro climatic conditions in dian lake accidently provided more arable land for human occupation and development below modern gwl it also demonstrates that the so called on site shell mounds gastropod accumulations and naturally elevated regions in the delta were not the only places for past settlements of dian cultures around dian lake dryer climatic conditions and thus lowered lake and gwl instead prom oted the extension of settlements in lowland areas more frequently than previously assumed although it is widely believed that intervals of large scale climate deterioration and thus weakened asm and succeeding climate periods may have promoted the transformation or cultural fall of the regional civilisations in the mainland of china india e g staubwasser et al 2003 huang et al 2011 dutt et al 2018 for example the dian society was able to use increased dry land due to such climate shifts and fast environmental changes 6 conclusion our results showed that the sedimentary composition of sediments in dian lake and the fluvial delta formation are strongly linked to variations in the hydrological regime during the last 6 cal ka bp with lowest lake stages during the bronze age dian culture and early chinese dynasties han to tang the extend of late neolithic culture horizons and dian settlements to low terrain sites were only possible because of a declined ground water table and associated reduced lake water due to monsoon climate deterioration the increased availability of arable land at that periods and rich food from aquatic systems may have even promoted dian and han population we believe that the comparison of hydrological conditions in the lake basin and on land with human occupation is an appropriate concept for the understanding of past hydro environmental conditions and possible human

5389,a framework is formulated in this paper for data driven modelling practices to characterise inclusive multiple modelling imm practices with multiple goals of enhancing the extracted information from given datasets and learning from multiple models this can be a shift from traditional practices with the single goal of selecting a superior model from multiple models without a statistical

imm strategies are capable of enhancing the accuracy of predicted water levels ii the accuracy of predicting the sea state of the caspian sea serves confidence building on accuracy and iii the time length of the record of lake van is long enough for the confidence building on the study of possible trends imm serves a bottom up learning opportunity for lake urmia that its distressed state is due to being deprived of compensation flows without contributions from climate change arguably a good management policy is the key for its restoration imm is at its infancy but arguably its potential

ulrnc urmia lake restoration national committee wi willmott s index 1 introduction the research presented in this paper is focussed on modelling water levels of three waterbodies of the caspian sea and lakes urmia and van in the middle east using data driven techniques the internationally publicised shrinking of lake urmia is the driver for the paper published papers on predicting water levels of lake urmia use some of the state of the art artificial intelligence ai techniques and claim on finding superior models e g see kisi et al 2015 talebizadeh and moridnejad 2011 vaheddoost et al 2016 but without returning the benefits of improvements to the study areas the paper innovates on modelling practices by introducing inclusive multiple modelling imm practices in explicit terms as a framework for enhanced modelling accuracy and thereby creating a heuristic capability to learn trends within residuals of predicted results which may shed light to the shrinkage of lake urmia notably imm is implicit in some of the ongoing research activities see khatibi et al 2017 but its explicit usage paves the way for learning from the results to gain an insight into the nature of a study area the data driven models also known as local models are used by the paper and include artificial neural networks ann and support vector machine svm these typically give rise to predictor estimator problems where the latter is referred to in various ways including inverse problems with a diverse range of techniques for the identification of their inherent parameters building on critical reviews of various techniques given later the paper uses the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and firefly algorithm ffa for the ann models as well as the least squares ls method and ffa for the svm models further algorithms are employed such as multiple linear regression mlr with its inverse problem based on ls they collectively form a set of models each associated with a developmental history and diverse applications the choice of individual models and their variations are deemed classic in modelling and therefore their detailed reviews are outside the scope of the paper but for a review see asce 2000 khatibi et al 2017 2014 and ghorbani et al 2018 among others the paper uses the selected models through imm practices as specified in due course for a modelling study of the above three waterbodies the paper presents a critical view over a range of issues and introduces a number of terms and procedures it refers to existing modelling practices as exclusionary multiple models emm but presents imm practices as an alternative although exclusion and inclusion are normally used in social contexts their key features are depicted in fig 1 and summarised next but are detailed in sections 3 and 4 emm comprises a set of existing models which compete against an innovative model through a testing procedure involving one or a few testcases they invariably identify the innovative model as the best or superior to competing models arguably emm practices identify a superior model but this is at the expense of competing models without using exhaustive sets of cases in statistical sense they are the ends whereas imm treats models as the means to an end the paper is within the scope of data driven local models and innovates by introducing i imm through a framework and ii modelling practices through an architecture where a framework is a set of dimensions selected consensually and architecture is a high level specification of procedures and or the role of the individual dimensions as illustrated in fig 1 the imm framework is introduced through the four dimensions of model reuse mr hierarchy and or recursions hr a provision of elastic model learning environment ele and goal orientation go and hence the acronym of rheo this is complemented by formalising modelling practices through a common architecture involving multiple models mm is in terms of levels of models as follows i level 1 use a set of models as base models each subject to training and testing where their outputs are reused at the next level ii level 2 run base models by a combiner model which is constructed by reusing the outputs of the base models as its inputs for an improved accuracy the rheo dimensions capture scientific thinking and make it possible to integrate knowledge whereas its architecture creates the mindset of model learning in imm practices in contrast to competition in emm practices one way to differentiate these two mindsets is that the results in emm practices should be sought to be fit for purpose in terms of using a set of performance metrics but those of imm practices should be sought to be defensible in terms of ensuring that the extracted information from the models does not depend on modelling assumptions notably the paper refers to competing models in emm practices but in imm practices they are referred to as base models and the innovative model in emm would become the combiner model in imm past imm works are tacit in the works by khatibi et al 2018 2017 nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 2013 and tayfur et al 2014 as reviewed in section 3 the paper introduces the four dimensions of imm rheo and transforms tacit into explicit knowledge on the architecture for each rheo dimension towards a capability in which modelling tasks are implemented through formulating strategies models can be made defensible error residuals can be studied more systematically to identify possible inherent trends and model learning can be used to investigate impacts of past changes the paper applies imm rheo to investigate lake urmia which is currently distressed and shrinking fast it has received a considerable attention by researchers with a plethora of publications e g unep 2012 marden et al 2014 kisi et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 jalili et al 2016 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2017 and alborzi et al 2018 however a significant proportion of the published literature is preoccupied with the accuracy of predicting water levels whereas lake urmia serves no operational function and is not a direct component of any water supply system for what it was the second most saline lake in the world improving the accuracy of predictions of lake urmia water levels is only significant in academic terms but has little return to the management of lake urmia the paper does not offer any new algorithms but imm rethinks modelling practices as promoted by khatibi et al 2018 2017 nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 2013 and ghorbani et al 2018 2 critical review of research on caspian urmia van waterbodies the nearest distance between the furthest of the three waterbodies under study is approx 500 km see fig 2 for their location maps their similarities and differences are outlined below 2 1 the caspian sea the caspian sea lat 36 to 47 n long 47 to 54 e is the largest and deepest inland waterbody in the world its main features include i the sea level lies below the mean ocean level ii in the last 100 year of hydrographic records its level variation has been 25 m to 29 m below mean sea level msl where the range includes secular variations as its recent rise occurred some 100 times faster than the global sea level changes its volume is 78 200 km3 mean surface area 371 000 km2 without the garabogazköl lagoon its drainage basin area is 3 626 000 km2 bathymetric details of the caspian sea is shown in supplementary electronic material which would contribute to dynamic water levels along its coastlines its water level is a balance of inflows which comprise flows from watercourses estimated annual discharge 3000 km3 groundwater estimated annual discharge 4 km3 and direct rainfalls estimated annual discharge 75 km3 and outflows in the form of evaporation from the sea estimated annual discharge 349 km3 sea state of the caspian sea is a complex outcome of its different specific geographical hydrogeological and meteorological variables e g precipitation runoff temperature water salinity evaporation and its low lying aquifers interacting shorelines its variations are also associated with secular scale anomalies as discussed by ozyavas et al 2010 and kislov 2016 currently secular scale variations are not a problem and the data record used in this study are outside any such periods measuring water levels in the caspian sea was initiated in baku in 1830 and is now conducted at more than 20 locations https www britannica com place caspian sea these have been used by various researchers in mathematical models to predict future sea states e g see vaziri 1997 arpe et al 2014 and srivastava et al 2016 various ai techniques have been tested for more accurate predictions and identifying the superior technique e g imani et al 2014 who tested the performances of svm gep and ccnn cascade correlation neural network using satellite altimetry observations from june 1992 to december 2013 and concluded that performances of svm in predicting caspian sea level periods are superior over gep and ccnn and that of svm and gep over ccnn and also they showed that the residuals are normally distributed 2 2 lake urmia main features of lake urmia lat 37 42 n long 45 19 e include i with respect to its baseline in 2000 it was the second most saline lake in the world ii located within the west and east azerbaijan provinces in iran it is distressed due to being deprived of its natural compensation flows at least over the last 10 years due to impounding almost all of its rivers and watercourses iii it is registered under the ramsar convention in 1975 site no 38 and therefore is supposed to be protected from anthropogenic impacts but to no avail iv its water level fluctuated but this was an annual natural cycle its mean surface area prior to 2000 was 5 200 km2 whereas its drainage basin area is 52 000 km2 and as such most of the hinterland sides of the mountains in the east and west azerbaijan provinces are drained to lake urmia more than 20 watercourses and rivers flow into lake urmia and the main ones include the river jighati zarrine rud the river aji the river tatovu simineh rud shaharchay nazlichay zolachay sofichay prior to 2000 the lake was shallower to the south it was the narrowest approximately in its middle and to the north the lake was as deep as 16 m its average water volume prior to 2000 was approximately 33 km3 being a closed waterbody water level at lake urmia is solely a balance of inflows from watercourses groundwater and evaporations from the lake as its outflows as well as on hydrological and meteorological variables e g precipitation runoff temperature evaporation water salinity and its coastal aquifers the water budget for lake urmia is affected by annual cycle episodes of droughts and the recent catastrophe at the lake the account below is a simplified the average annual inflow to the lake prior to 2000 was approx 4 3 km3 and the runoffs in the watercourses approx 7 km3 lotfi 2012 the annual evaporation capacity at the lake is approx 1 5 m but this is a complex function due to the shallow depth of the lake however during its pristine time the value could have been roughly 5 km3 inflows to the lake are cut off to almost zero following extensive dam construction projects without allowing for compensation flows to maintain ecological functions at their downstream thus without inflows the lake will disappear the root of the catastrophe of lake urmia goes back to circa 1990 prior to which the catchment was nearly in its pristine condition but only received some effluents from residential industrial areas near cities such as tabriz and urmia the basin has undergone an extensive program of change since 1990 in two forms dam construction projects and expansion of pumpage programs at the 12 aquifers surrounding the lake superseding their ingenious set of qanat systems woven into the fabric of a rather affluent agricultural practices but these are not the subject of the paper overall the number of planned dams is 71 of which 35 are operational their reported total capacity in 2006 was 1 7 km3 see hassanzadeh et al 2012 according to which 9 further dams are under construction with a reported capacity of 1 5 km3 and 23 are under design with a reported capacity of 0 7 km3 a total of 3 9 km3 but these figures are likely not to include the capacity of the river jighati as discussed in section 6 which is approx equal to 1 1 km3 a reduction of 3 9 km3 alone is capable of severely damaging the lake and thereby of contravening the ramsar convention measuring water levels in lake urmia goes back to 1964 and research has recently been active on developing predictive water levels for the lake there are more than 100 papers in refereed journals published on various aspects of the subject two main reviews include garousi et al 2013 and aghakouchak et al 2015 and in between them they refer to some 80 papers a further review by the paper is unlikely to add value but there are problems on explaining the causes for the catastrophe of lake urmia instead of an exhaustive review the paper suffices to a critical overview to identify the missing issues in the literature as follows i being a hypersaline waterbody lake urmia has no significance for water resources though its basin has a vital role ii the lake never had an operational water management status to require accurately predicted water levels and therefore research to this end only fulfils scientific curiosity iii often euphemistic concepts diffused into the media justify a raft of reasons for the shrinkage of the lake e g climate change but in reality this is a closed hydrological system and its outflows by evaporation must be replenished else the lake will disappear and therefore other factors are significant but secondary iv lake urmia is not even like the aral sea where the sea was a pivotal link in its microclimatic hydrological cycle comprised the sea two major rivers groundwater northern sides of the himalayan mountains and evaporations from the lake destined to the himalayan mountains whereas lake urmia just conditions the local microclimate without having any pivotal role in its hydrological cycle hence the hydrological damage is not permanent v if compensation flows are maintained lake urmia ought to recover in hydrological terms but damage on its habitat e g urmina artemia is likely to remain evidently the distressed state of lake urmia is a direct outcome of dams which started impounding runoff circa 2000 2 3 lake van lake van lat 38 38 n long 42 57 e is the largest and deepest inland waterbody in turkey fig 2 the largest soda lake degens et al 1984 on the earth and one of the 10 largest endorheic closed basin salty lakes in the world the main features of lake van include i its depth varies mean 162 m and max 453 m ii its 75 years of recorded water levels indicate that water level has episodes of abrupt rises 3 98 m between 1940s to date iii low agricultural activity 3222 km2 which consist of irrigated area as 670 km2 fallow land as 1036 km2 and dry land farming as 1536 km2 tsi 2014 its drainage area is approx 15 500 km2 that includes the lake its surface area and volume changed in 1943 to 2016 between 3550 km2 and 3620 km2 avg 3580 km2 and between 560 km3 and 575 km3 avg 568 km3 at minimum and maximum water level respectively aydin and karakuş 2016 as a closed waterbody water level in lake van is a balance of inflows from precipitation watercourses and groundwater and losses as evaporations the water budget components of lake van for 1960 2009 data consist of precipitation mean 1 7 km3 year runoff mean 2 km3 year and submarine groundwater discharge 1 4 km3 year as inputs and evaporation loss 5 km3 year as an output duzen 2011 sorman 2002 notably water levels of lake van increased relatively between 1965 to date for its inputs exceeded its losses water levels in the lake are also outcomes of specific hydro meteorological effects e g precipitation runoff temperature water salinity evaporation but with a limited interactions with its shorelines or onshore processes some 8 watercourses and rivers flow into lake van fed by rain and meltwater it may be divided bathymetrically into two sub basins to define its hydrological regimes the main body of water to the west is deep and reaches a maximum depth of 452 9 m its maximum depth is 460 m litt et al 2009 and a narrow passage separates it from the much shallower eastern sub basin extending to northern and southern directions its northern shores are generally steep and lined with cliffs but its southern shore is sinuous and eroded degens and kurtman 1978 measuring water levels in lake van was initiated in the early 1940s and there are various research reports on developing a predictive model to predict its water levels water level fluctuations of the lake van have been studied by various researchers including şen et al 1999 used cluster regression model şen et al 2000 and aksoy et al 2013 used stochastic modelling altunkaynak and şen 2007 used fuzzy logic model altunkaynak 2007 and doğan et al 2016 used artificial neural network to predict daily and monthly water level of lake van and khatibi et al 2014 used low dimensional chaos to predict water levels the previous studies are in the tradition of emm practices the paper focuses on imm rheo for lake van to learn from them and return the benefits of the learning from its 73 years of data to the lakes in the region 3 scientific thinking in modelling practices a critical review is outlined on modelling practices using local models data driven as prediction tools by contrasting emm and imm practices as shown in fig 1 emm practices follow invariably a formal modelling procedure but imm capabilities need a formalised procedure 3 1 existing practices a critical review 3 1 1 categorising existing techniques existing modelling practices developed since 1960 use local models by selecting a set of modelling techniques from a very large array of possibilities these include transfer function regression techniques the paradigm of time series analysis dynamic time series analysis chaos theory and catastrophe theory ai models often emulating deeper natural processes machine learning models and deep learning emulating the working of higher species e g firefly algorithm ffa these capabilities normally within emm practices may be categorised into generations of modelling techniques all share one feature they select one from mms and dispose the rest without reusing or leaning from them 3 1 2 modelling procedure existing practices use a best practice procedure and khatibi et al 2017 argue that such practices for a particular problem area are an integration of i defining model structures ii developing a set of models referred to here as competing models of which one is a new application iii each model involves a set of model parameters to be identified through training and testing iv assessing performance measures while avoiding overfitting underfitting and selecting the best model often by using the superlative of a superior model 3 1 3 critical views over emm practices the mindset behind emm is a successful driver for innovation as literally model brands have diversified however emm practices on predictive local models with a single goal of selecting the superior model are evidently at the expense of rejecting the competing models the multiple models in a set often comprise as few as two but often no more than five one of which is an innovative technique and competes with the rest competing models in the exercise of benchmarking using a set of performance metrics any reported superior model in reality uses only a few testcases and is arguably biased towards the used testcases arguably experience shows that subsequent superior models i use anecdotal evidence without statistical justification ii different performance criteria may suggest different superior models and iii claims on superiority of emm models are not defensible arguably the discourse on emm can benefit from abandoning superlative terms of superiority but use the term of fit for purpose 3 2 existing aspirations for improvements the rejected models in emm practices are often fit for purpose for containing a level of information in terms of performance metrics and therefore their rejections are tantamount to rejecting information khatibi et al 2014 likens the situation to throwing the baby out with the bathwater critical views against emm practices are also reflected by khatibi et al 2017 2012 2011a b who promote pluralism in modelling in terms of considering it legitimate to test any relevant alternatives however existing practices are not seemingly aspired towards pluralism capabilities on combining models go back to 1960s with the following tendencies i coupling and connecting different components of the hydrological cycle using distributed models in one modelling platform e g meteorological models for global circulation models konvicka 1999 and james 1994 ii perturbing the parameters of the same distributed models and running ensemble models see for a general account in druyan 2012 robertson et al 2004 and iii the emergence of local models and combining their performances together imm is rooted on the latter two types of models and implemented in various ways clemen 1989 presents a review of model combination practices by using regression analysis and simple averaging which sets regression coefficients to a constant value other model combination strategies include step wise modelling promoted by haitjema 1995 using analytic element modelling originally introduced by strack 1999 groundwater multimodel analysis ye et al 2008 bayesian model averaging e g combining conceptual groundwater multiple models by tsai 2010 the above initiatives all may be considered as a way of implementing imm and further techniques are outlined in due course these may be categorised as i tacit or implicit imm in which there is no explicit reasoning or no bespoke platform capability e g past ensemble models and ii explicit imm in which there is a bespoke platform e g bayesian model averaging the term imm is introduced here as an umbrella term to essentially cover all the streams of model combination platforms when competing models in emm are also used in tacit imm they are combined by an algorithm the simplest algorithm is to average the models in which case a constant and equal weight is prescribed to each model notably based on the review by nadiri et al 2019 there is a mathematical basis that even simple averaging is an effective strategy capable of producing improvements in a more sophisticated tacit imm the weights may be set by regression analysis but kadkhodaie ilkhchi et al 2009 used ga to assign linearly varying weights for model combinations the linearity limitation imposed by ga was removed by nadiri et al 2013 using ann and this was followed by testing a range of strategies by nadiri et al 2017 2018a b tayfur et al 2014 khatibi et al 2018 and ghorbani et al 2018 3 3 explicit imm frameworks bayesian model averaging is arguably one example of an explicit model combination platform which uses bayesian statistics as a model combination algorithm more algorithms platforms are feasible to formalise imm both in terms of its rheo dimensions and their architectures as outlined below 3 3 1 dimension 1 model reuse mr reuse is a feature of the recent culture in social discourses since the 1980s and its features may be found in tacit imm practices arguably the reuse dimension is the pillar of the imm practices whilst models in emm are products of tendencies for diversification driven by the need for innovation next generation capabilities may be characterised by the reuse dimension the roots of which may go to the 1980s this dimension is a simple acknowledgement to make models more efficacious than emm practices and to promote the onset of imm practices with wide implications as outlined by khatibi 2009 but without referencing to imm the paper defines mr in terms of using the outputs of one model as inputs to another model mr suggests connectivity interconnectivity between models without specifying the mechanism for the connection implicit usage of mr may be found in nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 and khatibi et al 2018 2017 3 3 2 dimension 2 hierarchy and or recursion hr the introduction of two levels of models base models and a combiner model outlined above is in fact a mark of introducing hierarchy generally hierarchy is a pivotal concept of systems science which has emerged since the 1950s but recursion is a concept of mathematics where a model algorithm reuses another model algorithm hr is used tacitly in some of existing modelling practices by various research teams in tabriz university in relation to local models as discussed above the paper only makes hierarchy explicit by using a level 2 model as a combiner acting over the base models at level 1 where the connection is 1 way i e data is passed from level 1 to level 2 arguably problems associated with emm practices stem from not imposing a hierarchy an alternative to hierarchy is recursion or the creation of interacting models e g actor critic neural networks the architecture for which there is an ann model at level 1 actor and another ann model at level 2 critic to facilitate reinforced learning e g see grondman et al 2012 the bayesian model averaging bma by draper 1994 and hoeting et al 1999 is another systematic approach as discussed by moazamnia et al 2019 which applies bayesian statistics to combine ensemble of models and to quantify their uncertainty 3 3 3 dimension 3 model learning environment the connectivity among the models characterises the nature of the model learning environment in the emm and imm practices in emm practices model learning is side lined as individual modelling techniques in a set of competing models are discrete standalone and disposable after one time usage unless they are selected as a superior model as such convergences and divergences between the competing modelling results are overlooked and hence emm learning environments are arguably a plastic model learning environment ple the authors are not aware of any critical views raised by other researchers against practices giving rise to ple the subtlety in imm is that the competing models may or may not include any machine learning deep learning or statistical learning techniques but once they are organised in levels 1 and 2 base and combiner models a new kind of learning kicks in the paper calls this as elastic model learning environment eme and khatibi et al 2018 2017 and nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 express it as reaping benefits of synergy or learning from convergence and divergence among the models 3 3 4 dimension 4 goal orientation go the paper takes preliminary steps to lay out the requirements for goal orientation in imm practices through stating the goals and formulating strategies for their realisations goals are discussed further in the discussion section but for now the following two goals are identified i the default goal improving performances in terms of maximising correlation or minimising errors and this is the default position for both imm or emm as well as enhancing the quality of the fit by reducing error residuals and ii emergent goals model learning in imm rheo should bring to fashion the use of the results to define the baseline and subsequently to explain changes or impacts when an insight emerges these may be translated into new goals which were not evident in the first place and hence emergent or bottom up goals goal orientation is a concept that emerged in systems science in the 1950s singleton 1974 argues that the traditional directive to the design engineer is that he should do the best he can with a given sort of problem but argues that objectives should be specified in terms of inputs outputs times and costs to jenkins 1969 systems engineers synthesise the various sub systems components together so that they work together towards achieving an overall objective although the above concepts on go are five decades old they are still true to explain both emm and imm practices khatibi and cluckie 2012 discuss tacit presence of goal orientation in flood prediction and warning practices the characteristic of goal orientation is that once goals are stated explicitly it has to trigger measurements and monitoring facilities until their demonstrable realisations and their requirements are embedded in policies planning and strategies this transforms a system from one off initiative to living systems 3 4 review of roles of learning in imm the concept of model learning presented by the paper is a bottom up process and already implicit in computer sciences as opposed to top down learning theories outlined below to clear possible misunderstanding in the appropriate terminology the oxford dictionary definition of learning is the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study experience or being taught hobart mowrer 1907 87 remarks that the psychology of learning is confused fragmented and disordered mowrer 1970 he searches for roots of learning and states that learning has been formalised by the paradigm of learning in a range of disciplines including education computer sciences social sciences management science and philosophy of science each discipline is served with top down paradigms and theories with some 40 theories see https www learning theories org doku php id learning paradigms typically paradigms theories and models compete with one another with little attention to learning each focus on a certain aspect but overlook others bottom up learning theories have also been developed in computer science bousquet et al 2004 differentiate between machine learning and computational learning theory according to whom the goal of machine learning is to automate a process through a simple process for inductive inference or machine learning through observing a phenomenon constructing its model and making predictions using the model whereas the goal of learning theory is to formalise the process the provision of imm rheo provides an inclusive environment but at a heuristic basis which splits the discipline into plastic and elastic learning where the latter may be tacit or explicit 4 architecture for imm rheo the above scientific thinking on imm rheo is transformed into a methodology through the followings i outlining the architecture to make models defensible ii formalising modelling procedure through formulating modelling strategies iii and outlining performance metric 4 1 modelling techniques used by the paper the paper uses the following equation for the models 1 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 h t 4 h t 5 where h t is the unknown water level at time t and f is an unknown function to be determined from the input data and hence the term data driven of water levels lagging at time steps of t 1 t 5 notably eq 1 implicitly included an error term particularly when uncertainty estimation is explicit in the modelling capability the various models categorised in the paper in section 3 1 includes the following choices selected in this study artificial neural networks ann support vector machine svm and multiple linear regression mlr the application of these techniques is identical in both emm and imm practices and models are implemented in two modes the prediction mode and model fitting mode inverse problem but this generic term may change according to the technique in which case the inverse problem of ann backpropagation uses the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and firefly algorithm ffa svm uses least squares ls method and ffa and mlr uses the ls technique standard accounts of these models are now deemed unnecessary but each is specified as below with the intention of making these models reproducible by a third party anns are parallel information processing systems which consist of a set of neurons arranged in layers to transform input signals into output signals by using suitable functions called actuation functions with a system of weights each neuron in a layer is connected to all the neurons of the next layer but not among themselves the type of ann used in this study is a multi layer feed forward perceptron mlp network the ann topology comprises three layers i input layer ii hidden layer and iii output target layer the paper uses the following approaches to identify the values of the parameters between the input to hidden and hidden to output layers i the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and hence mlp lm and ii ffa and hence mlp ffa the topology of ann models is identified through a trial and error procedure implementations of mlp lm and mlp ffa are detailed by khatibi et al 2017 haykin 1999 and yang 2010 the paper uses matlab 2016 software to implement the mlp lm and mlp ffa models svm is based on statistical learning theory vapnik 1999 which is a kernel based learning approach and uses a linear high dimensional hypothesis space called feature space for implicit kernel functions to map the data onto the feature space it is now a widely applied tool where the implementation of both estimator predictor problems are similar to neural networks with similar weights and bias there are a number of techniques to identify the values of the weights and bias and the paper uses i the least squares ls technique to formulate an optimisation problem to minimise the euclidian norm in the training process and hence this model is referred to as svm ls and ii ffa is used and hence svm ffa for more details on the authors implementation see khatibi et al 2017 and ghorbani et al 2018 the paper uses matlab 2016 software to implement the svm ls and svm ffa models mlr is a predictive linear regression approach most commonly used to explain the data with the stated dependent variables and independent variable its simplicity is at the expense of the need for its compliance with its assumptions i residuals must be normally distributed ii a linear relationship is assumed between dependent and independent variables and iii the residuals are homoscedastic and approximately rectangular shaped the paper uses ls to identify the values of the parameters the paper uses spss17 0 0 spss software 2008 to implement the mlr models 4 2 architecture for each dimension in imm practices the options for investigation are far greater as there is no urge to select a superior model but to achieve a number of goals such as to improved enhanced accuracy through a selection of modelling strategies an account of the imm rheo framework with respect to the testcases is presented below during which the architecture for imm modelling practices is formalised as follows 4 2 1 model reuse r the base models can be from any suitable modelling technique brand and can include innovatory or traditional technique algorithm there is no architecture for mr as it is a statement of cultural tendency the paper selects a set of four models to serve as base models without interacting with each other and each is run by using a model structure as discussed later in terms of eq 1 and by deriving a full benefit from their individual best practice procedure once their outputs are available they are reused as input data for another model as discussed below 4 2 2 hierarchy and or recursion the architecture for hr is to organise the models and their associated activities in a study some of recursive strategies are outlined above but this paper uses hierarchical levels to organise models as follows at level 0 decide modelling structures select base models and combiner models form strategies and process the dataset level 1 train and test individual base models using the same input data and target data to identify the values of their training parameters and to produce their output results to be reused as inputs to level 2 models level 2 train and test the combiner model s using their input data derived from level 1 and the same target data to produce results as used in inter comparison studies modelling at two or more levels requires formulating modelling strategies as discussed later in this section 4 2 3 elastic learning environment connecting mr with hr creates a new context where i models are connected and their accuracy at level 1 can influence those at level 2 ii as detailed by nadiri et al 2019 there is a mathematical evidence that the variance of the error residuals between the modelled and observed values of the combined results at level 2 should be lower than that of the mean variance of the base models at level 1 iii the results of any data driven model is broken to model fits quantified in terms of performance metrics trends identifiable by the scatter diagram of error residuals and residual analysis through statistical distributions and iv referring to these three components as the information band imm at level 2 creates a closure which is absent at level 1 and not feasible naturally different closures are possible by different modelling strategies and different hierarchies and or recursions the above lays the foundation for an architecture to model learning through defensible modelling results in the following terms i formulate strategies at two or more levels as detailed in section 4 3 ii check visually the error residuals for trends through the scatter diagram of error residuals and iii explain the errors residuals by a statistical distribution the procedure is already tacit in existing practices but without a closure in their information bands the closure in the information band gives rise to defensible modelling results and provides a scientific basis for model learning from the results towards evidence based decision making the defensibility in this context is a statement that stems from the closure in the information band 4 2 4 goal orientation by connecting mr hr and ele it becomes necessary to state explicitly the goals to facilitate model learning e g to maximise the information extracted from site specific data but this is a minimum amount and more goals become feasible which are discussed later in the paper the architecture for go is to formalise the modelling procedure through formulating strategies and stating objective through producing defensible results 4 3 formulating imm strategies 4 3 1 level 0 modelling strategies this study uses ai models and formulates four strategies as depicted in fig 3 each strategy is formulated through the following levels level 0 comprises parsing out the results possible decisions on modelling structures using eq 1 for both levels 1 and 2 level 1 for each strategy select its base models from a set of the above four modelling techniques level 2 select the combiner model algorithm to combine base models imm strategies are currently implemented manually the four strategies depicted in fig 3 are specified as follows strategy 1 at level 1 the selected two base models are svm ls and svm ffa at level 2 the combiner model is ann model imm ann strategy 2 at level 1 the selected two base models are mlp lm and mlp ffa at level 2 the combiner model is ann model imm svm strategy 3 at level 1 the selected four base models are svm ls svm ffa mlp lm and mlp ffa at level 2 the combiner model is mlr model imm mlr strategy 4 at level 1 the selected 4 base models are svm ls svm ffa mlp lm and mlp ffa at level 2 the combiner algorithm is simple averaging sa imm sa 4 3 2 level 0 model structures level 0 includes decisions on selecting appropriate model structures for each of the waterbodies water level is modelled by each of the base model at level 1 through the following model structure the model structures studied in the paper through a trial and error procedure are 1 1 h t f h t 1 1 2 h t f h t 1 h t 2 1 3 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 1 4 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 h t 4 1 5 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 h t 4 h t 5 the paper uses mlp lm mlp ffa svm ls and svm ffa specified below to describe eq 1 but model combinations are expressed as 2 h t a t l e v e l 2 ϕ h t l e v e l 1 m 1 h t l e v e l 1 m 2 where m1 m2 refer to model 1 model 2 for a particular strategy where eq 2 may be expressed for each strategy at level 2 as follows 2 1 h t s t r a t e g y 1 ϕ h t s v m l s h t s v m f f a 2 2 h t s t r a t e g y 2 ϕ h t m l p l m h t m l p f f a 2 3 h t s t r a t e g y 3 ϕ h t s v m l s h t s v m f f a h t m l p l m h t m l p f f a 2 4 h t s t r a t e g y 4 h t s v m l s h t s v m f f a h t m l p l m h t m l p f f a 4 where ϕ is a function which fits an appropriate relationship to eq 2 and is determined by the training procedure the combiners model at level 2 are mlp lm svm ls mlr and the simple averaging algorithm i e using a constant and equal value of weights for each input data in general eq 2 is pivotal which expresses the learning for convergences and divergences between input data and target data as depicted in fig 3 models at both levels 1 and 2 use target observed values notably target data refer to observed values and in the case of local models constructed by the paper observed data are the basis for forming input data and observed data 4 3 3 level 0 examination of local data for model structure most of the inherent and salient characteristics of hydrologic systems are reviewed by sivakumar 2017 before embarking on a full scale modelling preliminary ideas should be developed at level 0 to understand possible structures in the data and anticipate appropriate model structures to guide the formulation of modelling strategies the usual procedure includes i plotting time series and ii deriving statistics other investigations e g cross correlation autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation matrices were investigated but not presented for simplicity 4 4 assessing each component of the information band 4 4 1 performance metrics the study uses the following performance measures coefficient of correlation cc or r values root means square errors rmse nash sutcliff efficiency nse coefficient and willmott s index wi of agreement cc is a scale independent fitness metric and its values vary between 1 and 1 in which a value near zero indicate poor but that approaching 1 indicates a near perfect performances rmse values range from 0 the perfect model to higher real numbers and is a global measure of fit costs between the observed and modelled values it is scale dependent and sensitive to outliers nse is a scale independent fitness metric with values ranging from 1 to the closer its value to 1 the more accurate is the prediction wi is a descriptive measure and applies for cross comparisons the value of which varies between 0 and 1 0 reflects poor agreements but 1 reflects the perfect agreement willmott 1981 points that the relatively high wi values may be obtained even for poor model fits susceptible to outliers 4 4 2 trend studies among a diverse range of statistical metrics to study model performances scatter diagrams provides a visual insight into model fitting additionally the paper uses scatter diagrams of residual errors to identify possible trends in the data similar to jha and sahoo 2015 and mohanty et al 2013 as stated by sivakumar 2017 there are no proven automatic methods to identify the trend component in a system the authors are not aware of any theoretical basis for studying trends by error residuals of scatter diagrams and assume this to be a heuristic approach although visual reviews of scatter diagrams of error residuals are widespread among practitioners trend analysis is well developed in statistics see anscombe and tukey 1963 and sneyers 1991 and on floods and precipitation models see madsen et al 2014 for a review 4 4 3 homoscedasticity of error residuals the error residual component of the information band is examined by the null hypothesis that they are homoscedastic at a given level of significance this means that the models have extracted all the information from the dataset without the introduction of any systematic error to the residuals and thereby the residuals have no more information for extraction if the null hypothesis does not pass the alternative hypothesis is significant and further investigations are needed to explain possible presence of trend or similar sources of significant information in this study the xlstat 2014 application is used for their analysis by i breusch pagan test and ii white test see koenker 1981 and white 1980 4 5 hydrometric record of the lakes under study as per review in section 4 1 it is expected that water level in the caspian sea depends partially on the location within it therefore the recorded values at one observation station are not necessarily the same as those for other stations as the underlying dynamics should prevail over its middle and southern caspian the variability for lake urmia is not expected to be particularly high and its dynamics to be low due to its shallow water depths the scope for dynamics at lake van is expected to be significant as it is a deep lake statistics of the recorded water levels and the location of the gauges are presented in table 1 5 results the modelling results are presented for the four imm strategies defined in fig 3 and their presentation for each strategy is structured as level 0 specify decisions for the model structures level 1 present results of the base models and level 2 present results of combiner models 5 1 level 0 model structure the data records for the three waterbodies are displayed in fig 4 and these are used to form datasets for the imm strategies using the model structures defined by eqs 1 and 2 the datasets were parsed out prior to modelling in a number of ways but are not presented for not making the results over complicated the presentation suffices to the statistics of the data in table 1 and their time plots in fig 4 in which the latter displays the dynamic character of the data notably there are two outliers in the recorded levels of lake urmia but were ignored and these may impact the results overall the results at level 0 provide some insight into the data structure as a result of which the sea state for the caspian sea is highly dynamics that for lake urmia reflects drastic changes since 2000 and lake van displays the dynamic state with four significant jumps over four periods the data were divided into two sets for the training phase and testing phase in the proportion of 80 and 20 the data used for the testing phase was not used in the training phase 5 2 performance of imm level 1 base models equivalent to emm the base models for strategy 1 svm ls and svm ffa require the identification of model structures defined by eqs 1 1 1 5 and table 2 gives the performance metrics for the selected model and its most representative the better performing model structures at level 1 overall the models at level 1 are considered as fit for purpose notably electronic supplementary material esm gives more detailed results including svm model parameters and the performance metrics for each of the five model structures the base models for strategy 2 mlp lm and mlp ffa tested the model structures defined by eqs 1 1 1 5 and detailed results are presented in esm but table 2 summarises them by giving the performance metrics for the selected model as most representative model structures at level 1 overall these models at level 1 are considered as fit for purpose the results are further presented in figs 5a 5b and 6 for both base models of strategies 1 and 2 by displaying predicted hydrographs and their scatter diagrams for a visual assessment these results together with those presented in table 2 are suggestive of the following salient conclusions i the quality of selected models in the testing phase drops slightly compared with that of the training phase and this is expected and ii better performing models are deemed fit for purpose and selected using performance metrics of the testing phase but not of the training phase also decisions may require other considerations when their behaviours are inconsistent if the investigations presented in the paper followed emm practices the total of four base models would be ranked as follows mlp ffa svm ffa for the first and second rank and there would be competition for the third and fourth rank between mlp lm and svm ls arguably ranking or expression of superiority is not helpful and to be avoided in imm practices 5 3 performances of imm level 2 combiner models strategies 1 4 the results presented below are driven by the default goal of the study by investigating ways of improving modelling accuracy through imm rheo strategy 1 uses imm ann as its combiner model at level 2 and is formulated as per fig 3 but its topology is yet unknown which is identified by the best practice procedure through varying the number of the neurons in the hidden layer from 1 to 20 the selected topologies are given in table 2 but more detailed results are given in esm the table presents the parameter values used for running the ann models fig 5a presents the predicted values and their scatter diagrams for each waterbody and the subsequent improvements are discussed further below strategy 2 uses imm svm as its combiner model at level 2 and is formulated as per fig 3 but its parameters are yet unknown which are identified by the best practice procedure its values are given in table 2 but more detailed results are in esm predicted values and their scatter diagrams are presented in figs 5a and 5b and improvements are discussed further below strategy 3 is formulated by using the base models svm ls svm ffa mlp lm and mlp ffa but the combiner model is based on the mlr technique likewise strategy 4 is formulated as in strategy 3 but the combiner algorithm comprises a simple averaging rule the results for strategies 1 4 are presented in table 3a and are discussed below a comparative study of the performance metrics of the four strategies is presented in tables 3a and 3b which provide evidence for the efficacy of the four imm strategies as follows i there are improvements in the accuracy of the models at level 2 compared with those at level 1 so much as to justify imm practices ii the defensible strategy for the three waterbodies is strategy 2 at training and testing phases and strategy 3 is nearly just as good performances of strategy 4 in terms of rmse is interesting and according to the discussion by nadiri et al 2019 the rmse of strategy 4 has to be less than the mean of the rmse of the base models consider this for lake urmia i the rmse of strategy 4 is 0 149 ii the mean rmse of the four base models is 0 173 0 196 0 157 0 188 0 150 4 0 and iii hence the conditions holds true as also discussed by nadiri et al 2019 owing to improvements by strategy 4 it serves here as a benchmark 5 4 visual trend through scatter diagram of error residuals levels 1 and 2 error residuals at levels 1 and 2 for the results of strategies 1 and 2 are displayed in fig 6 the figure provides evidence that there is some waviness in the residuals of the models for the caspian and urmia waterbodies at level 2 of strategy 1 where no such waviness is observed for the results at level 1 therefore even if strategy 1 produces enhanced accuracy they are not necessarily reliable and the strategy can be removed from further considerations this observation is a good evidence that alternative strategies at level 2 are required a clearer inter comparison of strategies 1 to 4 is shown in fig 7 in terms of their residual scatter diagrams the pattern in the residuals is clear the amplitudes of the scatters depend on the strategy for strategy 1 the performances are good for the caspian sea and lake van but fit for purpose for lake urmia for strategies 2 and 3 the amplitudes in each of the three waterbodies are remarkably narrow for strategy 4 significant scatters in the residuals for all three waterbodies are strikingly evident the scatter diagram of the error residuals of strategies 2 4 displayed in fig 7 for each waterbody clearly shows that there is little sign of any trend the waviness in the scatter diagram of the results the caspian and urmia waterbodies are explained above and attributed to modelling errors 5 5 residual analysis the results presented below are driven by model learning by investigating any hidden trend in the observed data owing to improved accuracy through imm rheo two tests are carried out for testing the homoscedasticity in the error residuals and they are i breusch pagan test and ii white test as discussed in section 4 4 the salient features of the results presented in table 4 are as follows i residuals for strategy 2 are generally homoscedastic with one minor exception for lake urmia testing phase the breusch pagan test did not render homoscedasticity ii residuals for strategies 2 and 3 of the training phases are order of rounding errors and no statistical tests are necessary iii residuals for the models of caspian sea at their training and testing phases are homoscedastic with the exception of the residuals by strategy 1 which are explained below iv residuals for the models of lake urmia at their training phases are homoscedastic but mostly heteroscedastic for the testing phase see the explanation below v residuals for the models of lake van at their training phases are heteroscedastic and largely homoscedastic for the testing phase for models with homoscedastic residuals information extraction is successful and therefore any further information is unlikely to be extracted from the particular model in cases where the residuals are not homoscedastic the inherent heteroscedasticity needs to be explained by possible existence of trends outliers and or ultimately by identifying other possible distributions in the residuals as the training and testing results for lake van show that the residuals are homoscedastic table 4 and their scatter diagrams fig 7c contain no trend this is taken as evidence for the regional behaviour including lake urmia similarly the training results for lake urmia show that the residuals are homoscedastic table 4 and there is no trend in terms of the scatter diagram of error residuals fig 7b and therefore homoscedasticity for their testing results is confirmed but only by the white test the heteroscedasticity by the breusch pagan test is attributed to a single outlier and when this is removed the residuals improve towards homoscedasticity the exceptions are extracted and explained in table 5 6 discussion the focus of imm on results are now discussed with respect to the goals set out for the study 6 1 the goal of improved accuracy there is no similar work to compare the results reported in the paper with those investigated by others the focus of imm on the information band performance metrics trends and homoscedasticity of error residuals are presented in section 5 according to the results there is no difference between emm practices and imm practices at level 1 except that the emm results would normally be processed by ranking the models and identifying a superior one whereas the paper regards them as fit for purpose and avoids such superlatives the introduction of imm rheo practices makes a difference in such a way that a closure to the information band becomes feasible and these can be investigated in a more meaningful way in summary the results indicate that strategies 1 4 in particular strategies 2 and 3 are significantly enhanced by the narrow down in the residuals the model learning from the results includes i the conclusion that the testcase of the caspian sea subject to more dynamic variations provides a stringent test for the accuracy capability of imm rheo ii the testcase of lake van with 73 years of data provides a more realistic data for investigating possible trends in the region such as climate changes and iii the caspian and lake van testcases are used for learning on the performances of the modelling strategies to serve as a mean for confidence building for the study of lake urmia owing to enhanced residuals strategies 1 4 are capable of narrowing down the residuals in particular strategies 2 and 3 extract successfully maximum information from the time series of the three waterbodies to the extent that there are no significant trends in the data as such there is no further information in the residuals to be extracted hence imm rheo is a procedure to identify a strategy which maximises the extracted information this makes the modelling results defensible by a cycle of activities from studying performance measure to error residuals 6 2 emergent goal by applying imm rheo the models investigated by the paper are fit to explore emergent goals for an insight through outlining the baseline and subsequent changes owing to the accuracy of modelling results the narrowing of the amplitude of the residuals and exploring any trend in the data the exploration is confined to lake urmia alone 6 2 1 the baseline the hydrological timeline for lake urmia is defined as follows the first ever dam built in its basin was completed in 1978 with a capacity of 1 1 km3 on the river jighati siminehrud as its major river prior to which the average discharge from the river to the lake was approximately 1 6 km3 per year this did not impact the lake as its water levels up to 2000 remained within the normal range of annual fluctuations major dams were constructed during 1988 2000 thus year 2000 may be taken as the baseline for water level 6 2 2 changes the dams impacted the lake as follows most of dams in the basin of lake urmia have become operational since 2000 in the form of reducing flows into lake urmia to trickles the average water level decline of 0 3 m year impacted the lake induced the catastrophic shrinkage in its surface area by 2018 as much as approx 90 of its surface area has left more than 1 m of salt deposits at the base level and now exposes the at risk population to health hazards in spite of international willingness to help a major element in the official explanation is the attribution of the catastrophe to climate change the study presented in the paper provides some data driven evidence that error residuals of water levels of two major lakes urmia and van in the region are explainable by probability distribution without suggesting any trend the results therefore provide clear signals for explaining the shrinkage of lake urmia that stems from the impacts of constructed dams without compensation flows but not from any trend such as climate change the absence of the signals is similar to the study by the authors investigating the recorded data at three gauging stations of the river jighati within its upper catchments in which no trend was identified see ghorbani et al 2018 though the data went back to 1989 the paper is not detracting from the importance of climate change or population rise but the role of planning on the catastrophe at lake urmia needs more attention the above results demonstrate the role of model learning which can be transformed into emergent goals for the service of the management of the system the alternative is improvements of accuracy for the sake of pure hydrology and this should not be justified for instance consider the study by kakahaji et al 2013 reporting improvements on predicting water level of lake urmia in their modelling studies arguably their study is in the tradition of emm practices they present their results in terms of a requirement for wise use of lake urmia the term wise use is promoted by the ramsar convention https www ramsar org which stipulates a range of conditions as embedded in their definition the wise use of all wetlands being achieved in all parties including more participative management of wetlands and conservation decisions however hardly any of the above stipulated fundamental concepts are included in management parameters for lake urmia and it is only through emergent goals that the gap becomes visible between the presentation by kakahaji et al 2013 and the wise use of water the emergent goal is to inform researcher policymakers and decisionmakers to ensure that they are concordant but discordance in the discourse on lake urmia is noticeable for instance the australian curriculum on geography for year 10 covers lake urmia in the following terms see ref 1 reasons for the decline of the lake s level are a combination of prolonged drought and increased diversions for irrigation often people withdraw water illegally without paying for it or take more than they are allocated the above factually correct statements only reveal half of the problem the other half is normally overlooked and includes i information is scarce on the efficacy of the planning system if any and on policy enforcement systems as well on decision making by participation ii a top down approach has been enforced for the massive dam construction program with unknown facilities of sluice gates to allow the passage of compensation flows this point has also been made by hassanzadeh et al 2012 where it is commonly known that inflows to the lake have effectively been cut off iii traditional agricultural system of subsistence changed to pumpage of groundwater and this led to the classic case of the tragedy of the commons as defined by hardin 1968 6 2 3 restoring lake urmia equitable water distribution is normally ascertained through a whole range of strategies including basin management plans water resources plans water cycle studies drought plans and all these plans and strategies are refined through public participation only after the compliance to such a planning system gives legitimacy to blame any misbehaving water users the paper is focussed on hydrology but hydrology and planning should be in tandem with each other there is a national committee for the revival of lake urmia called urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc its restoration program is reproduced in fig 8 see ref 2 positive signs are yet to emerge out of the restoration program by ulrnc the paper argues that the damages to lake urmia and its basin are not permanent and it is never too late to kick start a genuine restoration program this is supported by freak rainstorms in spring 2019 throughout the region which raised the water level in lake urmia by more than 1 m in a few month there is no information on their sources causing the level rise which may be due to direct runoffs from downstream of reservoirs opening of the impounding reservoirs at the panic times of widespread floods or overflows from the reservoirs a more positive planning is the key for balancing the real water needs with the compensation flows meeting the ecology and maintaining water levels of lake urmia without blaming water users whilst water users have to go through an extensive program of extension services training it is never too late to mitigate past impacts a planning system would arguably be only successful if it allows decision making by participation and the authors are aware of a number of workshops held in both west and east azerbaijan provinces by consultants but without any follow up on their efficacy 6 3 status of imm rheo on the ground of the above goals the three testcases reported in the paper provide evidence for the proof of concept for the imm rheo framework equivalent to technical readiness level 4 akin to the nasa classification https www nasa gov sites default files trl png a modelling activity meeting its goal of accuracy is deemed defensible to serve as a decision tool as well as useable to gain an insight into a study area by exploring its emergent goals the pivotal model learning from the application of the imm rheo to the three waterbodies is that the models at level 1 are largely fit for purpose but the models at level 2 can become defensible the paper makes the case for further research until imm rheo reaches its technical readiness level 9 7 conclusion the paper introduces inclusive multiple models imm practices in which the models are used as means to an end through an architecture that extend from model construction to the study of inherent information bands model fit trends and statistical distribution of error residuals as well as using the data and models to inform researcher policymakers and decisionmakers imm results are defensible and are presented as an alternative to existing exclusionary multiple modelling emm practices notably emm results are often fit for purpose for being the end products of anecdotal evidence to identify a superior technique the paper argues that emm practices have their strength in innovation but also impede research agenda imm practices are presented in terms of a framework with four dimensions model reuse mr hierarchy and or recursion hr elastic model learning environment ele and goal orientation go making the acronym of rheo it also formalises the architecture of modelling practices at two levels driven by goal orientation four strategies are formulated the models at level 1 used two variations based on artificial neural networks ann and support vector machine svm the four models at level 1 were found to be fit for purpose in a background where imm avoids the motivation by emm to rank them models at level 1 served as base models for the combiner model at level 2 the models at level 2 formulated four strategies of which strategy 4 is based on simple averaging all of the four imm strategies at level 2 improve accuracy even strategy 4 improves accuracy using simple averaging as well as the quality of the results in terms of reducing the amplitude of the residuals the strategies provide varying degrees of improvements on the quality of the residuals imm is applied to study the decline of water levels in lake urmia in the context of the two other waterbodies of the caspian sea and lake van within the region where their shortest distance is 500 km whilst the caspian sea and lake van are hydrologically vibrant lake urmia is distressed and 90 of its volume has shrunk since 2000 the analysis of the results indicates the imm strategies improved accuracy of even the more dynamic caspian sea and of that of lake van display no significant trend with 73 years of recorded water levels these two testcases are used for confidence building for the imm rheo capability and for transferring the subsequent learning to justify an interpretation of the results of the strategies for lake urmia the received view promoted by the officials attributes primarily the distressed state of lake urmia to climate change however using imm the paper provides evidence to throw doubt on the ability of climate change to undermine the integrity of lake urmia in 15 years instead imm puts the focus on management issues for stimulating the debate imm rheo is at its infancy and this is its weakness but requires the formulation of strategies for improved accuracies to create a step rise in the status of the models from fit for purpose to more defensible models and this is its strength a great deal of more work is needed to understand its further weaknesses and strengths it can also make new possibilities feasible particularly it can bring to fashion user designed strategies appropriate to a study area by studying impacts of past poor practices to promote evidence based sustain future declaration of competing interest the authors

5389,a framework is formulated in this paper for data driven modelling practices to characterise inclusive multiple modelling imm practices with multiple goals of enhancing the extracted information from given datasets and learning from multiple models this can be a shift from traditional practices with the single goal of selecting a superior model from multiple models without a statistical justification which may be referred to as exclusionary multiple modelling emm practices the dimensions of the framework for imm practices are model reuse mr hierarchy and or recursion hr a provision

urmia 50 years of data and lake van 73 years of data approx 500 km apart imm practices are implemented by investigating four strategies for each testcase the learning from the results includes i the imm strategies are capable of enhancing the accuracy of predicted water levels ii the accuracy of predicting the sea state of the caspian sea serves confidence building on accuracy and iii the time length of the record of lake van is long enough for the confidence building on the study of possible trends imm serves a bottom up learning opportunity for lake urmia that its distressed state is due to being deprived of compensation flows without contributions from climate change arguably a good management policy is the key for its restoration imm is at its infancy but arguably its potential

ulrnc urmia lake restoration national committee wi willmott s index 1 introduction the research presented in this paper is focussed on modelling water levels of three waterbodies of the caspian sea and lakes urmia and van in the middle east using data driven techniques the internationally publicised shrinking of lake urmia is the driver for the paper published papers on predicting water levels of lake urmia use some of the state of the art artificial intelligence ai techniques and claim on finding superior models e g see kisi et al 2015 talebizadeh and moridnejad 2011 vaheddoost et al 2016 but without returning the benefits of improvements to the study areas the paper innovates on modelling practices by introducing inclusive multiple modelling imm practices in explicit terms as a framework for enhanced modelling accuracy and thereby creating a heuristic capability to learn trends within residuals of predicted results which may shed light to the shrinkage of lake urmia notably imm is implicit in some of the ongoing research activities see khatibi et al 2017 but its explicit usage paves the way for learning from the results to gain an insight into the nature of a study area the data driven models also known as local models are used by the paper and include artificial neural networks ann and support vector machine svm these typically give rise to predictor estimator problems where the latter is referred to in various ways including inverse problems with a diverse range of techniques for the identification of their inherent parameters building on critical reviews of various techniques given later the paper uses the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and firefly algorithm ffa for the ann models as well as the least squares ls method and ffa for the svm models further algorithms are employed such as multiple linear regression mlr with its inverse problem based on ls they collectively form a set of models each associated with a developmental history and diverse applications the choice of individual models and their variations are deemed classic in modelling and therefore their detailed reviews are outside the scope of the paper but for a review see asce 2000 khatibi et al 2017 2014 and ghorbani et al 2018 among others the paper uses the selected models through imm practices as specified in due course for a modelling study of the above three waterbodies the paper presents a critical view over a range of issues and introduces a number of terms and procedures it refers to existing modelling practices as exclusionary multiple models emm but presents imm practices as an alternative although exclusion and inclusion are normally used in social contexts their key features are depicted in fig 1 and summarised next but are detailed in sections 3 and 4 emm comprises a set of existing models which compete against an innovative model through a testing procedure involving one or a few testcases they invariably identify the innovative model as the best or superior to competing models arguably emm practices identify a superior model but this is at the expense of competing models without using exhaustive sets of cases in statistical sense they are the ends whereas imm treats models as the means to an end the paper is within the scope of data driven local models and innovates by introducing i imm through a framework and ii modelling practices through an architecture where a framework is a set of dimensions selected consensually and architecture is a high level specification of procedures and or the role of the individual dimensions as illustrated in fig 1 the imm framework is introduced through the four dimensions of model reuse mr hierarchy and or recursions hr a provision of elastic model learning environment ele and goal orientation go and hence the acronym of rheo this is complemented by formalising modelling practices through a common architecture involving multiple models mm is in terms of levels of models as follows i level 1 use a set of models as base models each subject to training and testing where their outputs are reused at the next level ii level 2 run base models by a combiner model which is constructed by reusing the outputs of the base models as its inputs for an improved accuracy the rheo dimensions capture scientific thinking and make it possible to integrate knowledge whereas its architecture creates the mindset of model learning in imm practices in contrast to competition in emm practices one way to differentiate these two mindsets is that the results in emm practices should be sought to be fit for purpose in terms of using a set of performance metrics but those of imm practices should be sought to be defensible in terms of ensuring that the extracted information from the models does not depend on modelling assumptions notably the paper refers to competing models in emm practices but in imm practices they are referred to as base models and the innovative model in emm would become the combiner model in imm past imm works are tacit in the works by khatibi et al 2018 2017 nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 2013 and tayfur et al 2014 as reviewed in section 3 the paper introduces the four dimensions of imm rheo and transforms tacit into explicit knowledge on the architecture for each rheo dimension towards a capability in which modelling tasks are implemented through formulating strategies models can be made defensible error residuals can be studied more systematically to identify possible inherent trends and model learning can be used to investigate impacts of past changes the paper applies imm rheo to investigate lake urmia which is currently distressed and shrinking fast it has received a considerable attention by researchers with a plethora of publications e g unep 2012 marden et al 2014 kisi et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 jalili et al 2016 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2017 and alborzi et al 2018 however a significant proportion of the published literature is preoccupied with the accuracy of predicting water levels whereas lake urmia serves no operational function and is not a direct component of any water supply system for what it was the second most saline lake in the world improving the accuracy of predictions of lake urmia water levels is only significant in academic terms but has little return to the management of lake urmia the paper does not offer any new algorithms but imm rethinks modelling practices as promoted by khatibi et al 2018 2017 nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 2013 and ghorbani et al 2018 2 critical review of research on caspian urmia van waterbodies the nearest distance between the furthest of the three waterbodies under study is approx 500 km see fig 2 for their location maps their similarities and differences are outlined below 2 1 the caspian sea the caspian sea lat 36 to 47 n long 47 to 54 e is the largest and deepest inland waterbody in the world its main features include i the sea level lies below the mean ocean level ii in the last 100 year of hydrographic records its level variation has been 25 m to 29 m below mean sea level msl where the range includes secular variations as its recent rise occurred some 100 times faster than the global sea level changes its volume is 78 200 km3 mean surface area 371 000 km2 without the garabogazköl lagoon its drainage basin area is 3 626 000 km2 bathymetric details of the caspian sea is shown in supplementary electronic material which would contribute to dynamic water levels along its coastlines its water level is a balance of inflows which comprise flows from watercourses estimated annual discharge 3000 km3 groundwater estimated annual discharge 4 km3 and direct rainfalls estimated annual discharge 75 km3 and outflows in the form of evaporation from the sea estimated annual discharge 349 km3 sea state of the caspian sea is a complex outcome of its different specific geographical hydrogeological and meteorological variables e g precipitation runoff temperature water salinity evaporation and its low lying aquifers interacting shorelines its variations are also associated with secular scale anomalies as discussed by ozyavas et al 2010 and kislov 2016 currently secular scale variations are not a problem and the data record used in this study are outside any such periods measuring water levels in the caspian sea was initiated in baku in 1830 and is now conducted at more than 20 locations https www britannica com place caspian sea these have been used by various researchers in mathematical models to predict future sea states e g see vaziri 1997 arpe et al 2014 and srivastava et al 2016 various ai techniques have been tested for more accurate predictions and identifying the superior technique e g imani et al 2014 who tested the performances of svm gep and ccnn cascade correlation neural network using satellite altimetry observations from june 1992 to december 2013 and concluded that performances of svm in predicting caspian sea level periods are superior over gep and ccnn and that of svm and gep over ccnn and also they showed that the residuals are normally distributed 2 2 lake urmia main features of lake urmia lat 37 42 n long 45 19 e include i with respect to its baseline in 2000 it was the second most saline lake in the world ii located within the west and east azerbaijan provinces in iran it is distressed due to being deprived of its natural compensation flows at least over the last 10 years due to impounding almost all of its rivers and watercourses iii it is registered under the ramsar convention in 1975 site no 38 and therefore is supposed to be protected from anthropogenic impacts but to no avail iv its water level fluctuated but this was an annual natural cycle its mean surface area prior to 2000 was 5 200 km2 whereas its drainage basin area is 52 000 km2 and as such most of the hinterland sides of the mountains in the east and west azerbaijan provinces are drained to lake urmia more than 20 watercourses and rivers flow into lake urmia and the main ones include the river jighati zarrine rud the river aji the river tatovu simineh rud shaharchay nazlichay zolachay sofichay prior to 2000 the lake was shallower to the south it was the narrowest approximately in its middle and to the north the lake was as deep as 16 m its average water volume prior to 2000 was approximately 33 km3 being a closed waterbody water level at lake urmia is solely a balance of inflows from watercourses groundwater and evaporations from the lake as its outflows as well as on hydrological and meteorological variables e g precipitation runoff temperature evaporation water salinity and its coastal aquifers the water budget for lake urmia is affected by annual cycle episodes of droughts and the recent catastrophe at the lake the account below is a simplified the average annual inflow to the lake prior to 2000 was approx 4 3 km3 and the runoffs in the watercourses approx 7 km3 lotfi 2012 the annual evaporation capacity at the lake is approx 1 5 m but this is a complex function due to the shallow depth of the lake however during its pristine time the value could have been roughly 5 km3 inflows to the lake are cut off to almost zero following extensive dam construction projects without allowing for compensation flows to maintain ecological functions at their downstream thus without inflows the lake will disappear the root of the catastrophe of lake urmia goes back to circa 1990 prior to which the catchment was nearly in its pristine condition but only received some effluents from residential industrial areas near cities such as tabriz and urmia the basin has undergone an extensive program of change since 1990 in two forms dam construction projects and expansion of pumpage programs at the 12 aquifers surrounding the lake superseding their ingenious set of qanat systems woven into the fabric of a rather affluent agricultural practices but these are not the subject of the paper overall the number of planned dams is 71 of which 35 are operational their reported total capacity in 2006 was 1 7 km3 see hassanzadeh et al 2012 according to which 9 further dams are under construction with a reported capacity of 1 5 km3 and 23 are under design with a reported capacity of 0 7 km3 a total of 3 9 km3 but these figures are likely not to include the capacity of the river jighati as discussed in section 6 which is approx equal to 1 1 km3 a reduction of 3 9 km3 alone is capable of severely damaging the lake and thereby of contravening the ramsar convention measuring water levels in lake urmia goes back to 1964 and research has recently been active on developing predictive water levels for the lake there are more than 100 papers in refereed journals published on various aspects of the subject two main reviews include garousi et al 2013 and aghakouchak et al 2015 and in between them they refer to some 80 papers a further review by the paper is unlikely to add value but there are problems on explaining the causes for the catastrophe of lake urmia instead of an exhaustive review the paper suffices to a critical overview to identify the missing issues in the literature as follows i being a hypersaline waterbody lake urmia has no significance for water resources though its basin has a vital role ii the lake never had an operational water management status to require accurately predicted water levels and therefore research to this end only fulfils scientific curiosity iii often euphemistic concepts diffused into the media justify a raft of reasons for the shrinkage of the lake e g climate change but in reality this is a closed hydrological system and its outflows by evaporation must be replenished else the lake will disappear and therefore other factors are significant but secondary iv lake urmia is not even like the aral sea where the sea was a pivotal link in its microclimatic hydrological cycle comprised the sea two major rivers groundwater northern sides of the himalayan mountains and evaporations from the lake destined to the himalayan mountains whereas lake urmia just conditions the local microclimate without having any pivotal role in its hydrological cycle hence the hydrological damage is not permanent v if compensation flows are maintained lake urmia ought to recover in hydrological terms but damage on its habitat e g urmina artemia is likely to remain evidently the distressed state of lake urmia is a direct outcome of dams which started impounding runoff circa 2000 2 3 lake van lake van lat 38 38 n long 42 57 e is the largest and deepest inland waterbody in turkey fig 2 the largest soda lake degens et al 1984 on the earth and one of the 10 largest endorheic closed basin salty lakes in the world the main features of lake van include i its depth varies mean 162 m and max 453 m ii its 75 years of recorded water levels indicate that water level has episodes of abrupt rises 3 98 m between 1940s to date iii low agricultural activity 3222 km2 which consist of irrigated area as 670 km2 fallow land as 1036 km2 and dry land farming as 1536 km2 tsi 2014 its drainage area is approx 15 500 km2 that includes the lake its surface area and volume changed in 1943 to 2016 between 3550 km2 and 3620 km2 avg 3580 km2 and between 560 km3 and 575 km3 avg 568 km3 at minimum and maximum water level respectively aydin and karakuş 2016 as a closed waterbody water level in lake van is a balance of inflows from precipitation watercourses and groundwater and losses as evaporations the water budget components of lake van for 1960 2009 data consist of precipitation mean 1 7 km3 year runoff mean 2 km3 year and submarine groundwater discharge 1 4 km3 year as inputs and evaporation loss 5 km3 year as an output duzen 2011 sorman 2002 notably water levels of lake van increased relatively between 1965 to date for its inputs exceeded its losses water levels in the lake are also outcomes of specific hydro meteorological effects e g precipitation runoff temperature water salinity evaporation but with a limited interactions with its shorelines or onshore processes some 8 watercourses and rivers flow into lake van fed by rain and meltwater it may be divided bathymetrically into two sub basins to define its hydrological regimes the main body of water to the west is deep and reaches a maximum depth of 452 9 m its maximum depth is 460 m litt et al 2009 and a narrow passage separates it from the much shallower eastern sub basin extending to northern and southern directions its northern shores are generally steep and lined with cliffs but its southern shore is sinuous and eroded degens and kurtman 1978 measuring water levels in lake van was initiated in the early 1940s and there are various research reports on developing a predictive model to predict its water levels water level fluctuations of the lake van have been studied by various researchers including şen et al 1999 used cluster regression model şen et al 2000 and aksoy et al 2013 used stochastic modelling altunkaynak and şen 2007 used fuzzy logic model altunkaynak 2007 and doğan et al 2016 used artificial neural network to predict daily and monthly water level of lake van and khatibi et al 2014 used low dimensional chaos to predict water levels the previous studies are in the tradition of emm practices the paper focuses on imm rheo for lake van to learn from them and return the benefits of the learning from its 73 years of data to the lakes in the region 3 scientific thinking in modelling practices a critical review is outlined on modelling practices using local models data driven as prediction tools by contrasting emm and imm practices as shown in fig 1 emm practices follow invariably a formal modelling procedure but imm capabilities need a formalised procedure 3 1 existing practices a critical review 3 1 1 categorising existing techniques existing modelling practices developed since 1960 use local models by selecting a set of modelling techniques from a very large array of possibilities these include transfer function regression techniques the paradigm of time series analysis dynamic time series analysis chaos theory and catastrophe theory ai models often emulating deeper natural processes machine learning models and deep learning emulating the working of higher species e g firefly algorithm ffa these capabilities normally within emm practices may be categorised into generations of modelling techniques all share one feature they select one from mms and dispose the rest without reusing or leaning from them 3 1 2 modelling procedure existing practices use a best practice procedure and khatibi et al 2017 argue that such practices for a particular problem area are an integration of i defining model structures ii developing a set of models referred to here as competing models of which one is a new application iii each model involves a set of model parameters to be identified through training and testing iv assessing performance measures while avoiding overfitting underfitting and selecting the best model often by using the superlative of a superior model 3 1 3 critical views over emm practices the mindset behind emm is a successful driver for innovation as literally model brands have diversified however emm practices on predictive local models with a single goal of selecting the superior model are evidently at the expense of rejecting the competing models the multiple models in a set often comprise as few as two but often no more than five one of which is an innovative technique and competes with the rest competing models in the exercise of benchmarking using a set of performance metrics any reported superior model in reality uses only a few testcases and is arguably biased towards the used testcases arguably experience shows that subsequent superior models i use anecdotal evidence without statistical justification ii different performance criteria may suggest different superior models and iii claims on superiority of emm models are not defensible arguably the discourse on emm can benefit from abandoning superlative terms of superiority but use the term of fit for purpose 3 2 existing aspirations for improvements the rejected models in emm practices are often fit for purpose for containing a level of information in terms of performance metrics and therefore their rejections are tantamount to rejecting information khatibi et al 2014 likens the situation to throwing the baby out with the bathwater critical views against emm practices are also reflected by khatibi et al 2017 2012 2011a b who promote pluralism in modelling in terms of considering it legitimate to test any relevant alternatives however existing practices are not seemingly aspired towards pluralism capabilities on combining models go back to 1960s with the following tendencies i coupling and connecting different components of the hydrological cycle using distributed models in one modelling platform e g meteorological models for global circulation models konvicka 1999 and james 1994 ii perturbing the parameters of the same distributed models and running ensemble models see for a general account in druyan 2012 robertson et al 2004 and iii the emergence of local models and combining their performances together imm is rooted on the latter two types of models and implemented in various ways clemen 1989 presents a review of model combination practices by using regression analysis and simple averaging which sets regression coefficients to a constant value other model combination strategies include step wise modelling promoted by haitjema 1995 using analytic element modelling originally introduced by strack 1999 groundwater multimodel analysis ye et al 2008 bayesian model averaging e g combining conceptual groundwater multiple models by tsai 2010 the above initiatives all may be considered as a way of implementing imm and further techniques are outlined in due course these may be categorised as i tacit or implicit imm in which there is no explicit reasoning or no bespoke platform capability e g past ensemble models and ii explicit imm in which there is a bespoke platform e g bayesian model averaging the term imm is introduced here as an umbrella term to essentially cover all the streams of model combination platforms when competing models in emm are also used in tacit imm they are combined by an algorithm the simplest algorithm is to average the models in which case a constant and equal weight is prescribed to each model notably based on the review by nadiri et al 2019 there is a mathematical basis that even simple averaging is an effective strategy capable of producing improvements in a more sophisticated tacit imm the weights may be set by regression analysis but kadkhodaie ilkhchi et al 2009 used ga to assign linearly varying weights for model combinations the linearity limitation imposed by ga was removed by nadiri et al 2013 using ann and this was followed by testing a range of strategies by nadiri et al 2017 2018a b tayfur et al 2014 khatibi et al 2018 and ghorbani et al 2018 3 3 explicit imm frameworks bayesian model averaging is arguably one example of an explicit model combination platform which uses bayesian statistics as a model combination algorithm more algorithms platforms are feasible to formalise imm both in terms of its rheo dimensions and their architectures as outlined below 3 3 1 dimension 1 model reuse mr reuse is a feature of the recent culture in social discourses since the 1980s and its features may be found in tacit imm practices arguably the reuse dimension is the pillar of the imm practices whilst models in emm are products of tendencies for diversification driven by the need for innovation next generation capabilities may be characterised by the reuse dimension the roots of which may go to the 1980s this dimension is a simple acknowledgement to make models more efficacious than emm practices and to promote the onset of imm practices with wide implications as outlined by khatibi 2009 but without referencing to imm the paper defines mr in terms of using the outputs of one model as inputs to another model mr suggests connectivity interconnectivity between models without specifying the mechanism for the connection implicit usage of mr may be found in nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 and khatibi et al 2018 2017 3 3 2 dimension 2 hierarchy and or recursion hr the introduction of two levels of models base models and a combiner model outlined above is in fact a mark of introducing hierarchy generally hierarchy is a pivotal concept of systems science which has emerged since the 1950s but recursion is a concept of mathematics where a model algorithm reuses another model algorithm hr is used tacitly in some of existing modelling practices by various research teams in tabriz university in relation to local models as discussed above the paper only makes hierarchy explicit by using a level 2 model as a combiner acting over the base models at level 1 where the connection is 1 way i e data is passed from level 1 to level 2 arguably problems associated with emm practices stem from not imposing a hierarchy an alternative to hierarchy is recursion or the creation of interacting models e g actor critic neural networks the architecture for which there is an ann model at level 1 actor and another ann model at level 2 critic to facilitate reinforced learning e g see grondman et al 2012 the bayesian model averaging bma by draper 1994 and hoeting et al 1999 is another systematic approach as discussed by moazamnia et al 2019 which applies bayesian statistics to combine ensemble of models and to quantify their uncertainty 3 3 3 dimension 3 model learning environment the connectivity among the models characterises the nature of the model learning environment in the emm and imm practices in emm practices model learning is side lined as individual modelling techniques in a set of competing models are discrete standalone and disposable after one time usage unless they are selected as a superior model as such convergences and divergences between the competing modelling results are overlooked and hence emm learning environments are arguably a plastic model learning environment ple the authors are not aware of any critical views raised by other researchers against practices giving rise to ple the subtlety in imm is that the competing models may or may not include any machine learning deep learning or statistical learning techniques but once they are organised in levels 1 and 2 base and combiner models a new kind of learning kicks in the paper calls this as elastic model learning environment eme and khatibi et al 2018 2017 and nadiri et al 2018a b 2017 express it as reaping benefits of synergy or learning from convergence and divergence among the models 3 3 4 dimension 4 goal orientation go the paper takes preliminary steps to lay out the requirements for goal orientation in imm practices through stating the goals and formulating strategies for their realisations goals are discussed further in the discussion section but for now the following two goals are identified i the default goal improving performances in terms of maximising correlation or minimising errors and this is the default position for both imm or emm as well as enhancing the quality of the fit by reducing error residuals and ii emergent goals model learning in imm rheo should bring to fashion the use of the results to define the baseline and subsequently to explain changes or impacts when an insight emerges these may be translated into new goals which were not evident in the first place and hence emergent or bottom up goals goal orientation is a concept that emerged in systems science in the 1950s singleton 1974 argues that the traditional directive to the design engineer is that he should do the best he can with a given sort of problem but argues that objectives should be specified in terms of inputs outputs times and costs to jenkins 1969 systems engineers synthesise the various sub systems components together so that they work together towards achieving an overall objective although the above concepts on go are five decades old they are still true to explain both emm and imm practices khatibi and cluckie 2012 discuss tacit presence of goal orientation in flood prediction and warning practices the characteristic of goal orientation is that once goals are stated explicitly it has to trigger measurements and monitoring facilities until their demonstrable realisations and their requirements are embedded in policies planning and strategies this transforms a system from one off initiative to living systems 3 4 review of roles of learning in imm the concept of model learning presented by the paper is a bottom up process and already implicit in computer sciences as opposed to top down learning theories outlined below to clear possible misunderstanding in the appropriate terminology the oxford dictionary definition of learning is the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study experience or being taught hobart mowrer 1907 87 remarks that the psychology of learning is confused fragmented and disordered mowrer 1970 he searches for roots of learning and states that learning has been formalised by the paradigm of learning in a range of disciplines including education computer sciences social sciences management science and philosophy of science each discipline is served with top down paradigms and theories with some 40 theories see https www learning theories org doku php id learning paradigms typically paradigms theories and models compete with one another with little attention to learning each focus on a certain aspect but overlook others bottom up learning theories have also been developed in computer science bousquet et al 2004 differentiate between machine learning and computational learning theory according to whom the goal of machine learning is to automate a process through a simple process for inductive inference or machine learning through observing a phenomenon constructing its model and making predictions using the model whereas the goal of learning theory is to formalise the process the provision of imm rheo provides an inclusive environment but at a heuristic basis which splits the discipline into plastic and elastic learning where the latter may be tacit or explicit 4 architecture for imm rheo the above scientific thinking on imm rheo is transformed into a methodology through the followings i outlining the architecture to make models defensible ii formalising modelling procedure through formulating modelling strategies iii and outlining performance metric 4 1 modelling techniques used by the paper the paper uses the following equation for the models 1 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 h t 4 h t 5 where h t is the unknown water level at time t and f is an unknown function to be determined from the input data and hence the term data driven of water levels lagging at time steps of t 1 t 5 notably eq 1 implicitly included an error term particularly when uncertainty estimation is explicit in the modelling capability the various models categorised in the paper in section 3 1 includes the following choices selected in this study artificial neural networks ann support vector machine svm and multiple linear regression mlr the application of these techniques is identical in both emm and imm practices and models are implemented in two modes the prediction mode and model fitting mode inverse problem but this generic term may change according to the technique in which case the inverse problem of ann backpropagation uses the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and firefly algorithm ffa svm uses least squares ls method and ffa and mlr uses the ls technique standard accounts of these models are now deemed unnecessary but each is specified as below with the intention of making these models reproducible by a third party anns are parallel information processing systems which consist of a set of neurons arranged in layers to transform input signals into output signals by using suitable functions called actuation functions with a system of weights each neuron in a layer is connected to all the neurons of the next layer but not among themselves the type of ann used in this study is a multi layer feed forward perceptron mlp network the ann topology comprises three layers i input layer ii hidden layer and iii output target layer the paper uses the following approaches to identify the values of the parameters between the input to hidden and hidden to output layers i the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and hence mlp lm and ii ffa and hence mlp ffa the topology of ann models is identified through a trial and error procedure implementations of mlp lm and mlp ffa are detailed by khatibi et al 2017 haykin 1999 and yang 2010 the paper uses matlab 2016 software to implement the mlp lm and mlp ffa models svm is based on statistical learning theory vapnik 1999 which is a kernel based learning approach and uses a linear high dimensional hypothesis space called feature space for implicit kernel functions to map the data onto the feature space it is now a widely applied tool where the implementation of both estimator predictor problems are similar to neural networks with similar weights and bias there are a number of techniques to identify the values of the weights and bias and the paper uses i the least squares ls technique to formulate an optimisation problem to minimise the euclidian norm in the training process and hence this model is referred to as svm ls and ii ffa is used and hence svm ffa for more details on the authors implementation see khatibi et al 2017 and ghorbani et al 2018 the paper uses matlab 2016 software to implement the svm ls and svm ffa models mlr is a predictive linear regression approach most commonly used to explain the data with the stated dependent variables and independent variable its simplicity is at the expense of the need for its compliance with its assumptions i residuals must be normally distributed ii a linear relationship is assumed between dependent and independent variables and iii the residuals are homoscedastic and approximately rectangular shaped the paper uses ls to identify the values of the parameters the paper uses spss17 0 0 spss software 2008 to implement the mlr models 4 2 architecture for each dimension in imm practices the options for investigation are far greater as there is no urge to select a superior model but to achieve a number of goals such as to improved enhanced accuracy through a selection of modelling strategies an account of the imm rheo framework with respect to the testcases is presented below during which the architecture for imm modelling practices is formalised as follows 4 2 1 model reuse r the base models can be from any suitable modelling technique brand and can include innovatory or traditional technique algorithm there is no architecture for mr as it is a statement of cultural tendency the paper selects a set of four models to serve as base models without interacting with each other and each is run by using a model structure as discussed later in terms of eq 1 and by deriving a full benefit from their individual best practice procedure once their outputs are available they are reused as input data for another model as discussed below 4 2 2 hierarchy and or recursion the architecture for hr is to organise the models and their associated activities in a study some of recursive strategies are outlined above but this paper uses hierarchical levels to organise models as follows at level 0 decide modelling structures select base models and combiner models form strategies and process the dataset level 1 train and test individual base models using the same input data and target data to identify the values of their training parameters and to produce their output results to be reused as inputs to level 2 models level 2 train and test the combiner model s using their input data derived from level 1 and the same target data to produce results as used in inter comparison studies modelling at two or more levels requires formulating modelling strategies as discussed later in this section 4 2 3 elastic learning environment connecting mr with hr creates a new context where i models are connected and their accuracy at level 1 can influence those at level 2 ii as detailed by nadiri et al 2019 there is a mathematical evidence that the variance of the error residuals between the modelled and observed values of the combined results at level 2 should be lower than that of the mean variance of the base models at level 1 iii the results of any data driven model is broken to model fits quantified in terms of performance metrics trends identifiable by the scatter diagram of error residuals and residual analysis through statistical distributions and iv referring to these three components as the information band imm at level 2 creates a closure which is absent at level 1 and not feasible naturally different closures are possible by different modelling strategies and different hierarchies and or recursions the above lays the foundation for an architecture to model learning through defensible modelling results in the following terms i formulate strategies at two or more levels as detailed in section 4 3 ii check visually the error residuals for trends through the scatter diagram of error residuals and iii explain the errors residuals by a statistical distribution the procedure is already tacit in existing practices but without a closure in their information bands the closure in the information band gives rise to defensible modelling results and provides a scientific basis for model learning from the results towards evidence based decision making the defensibility in this context is a statement that stems from the closure in the information band 4 2 4 goal orientation by connecting mr hr and ele it becomes necessary to state explicitly the goals to facilitate model learning e g to maximise the information extracted from site specific data but this is a minimum amount and more goals become feasible which are discussed later in the paper the architecture for go is to formalise the modelling procedure through formulating strategies and stating objective through producing defensible results 4 3 formulating imm strategies 4 3 1 level 0 modelling strategies this study uses ai models and formulates four strategies as depicted in fig 3 each strategy is formulated through the following levels level 0 comprises parsing out the results possible decisions on modelling structures using eq 1 for both levels 1 and 2 level 1 for each strategy select its base models from a set of the above four modelling techniques level 2 select the combiner model algorithm to combine base models imm strategies are currently implemented manually the four strategies depicted in fig 3 are specified as follows strategy 1 at level 1 the selected two base models are svm ls and svm ffa at level 2 the combiner model is ann model imm ann strategy 2 at level 1 the selected two base models are mlp lm and mlp ffa at level 2 the combiner model is ann model imm svm strategy 3 at level 1 the selected four base models are svm ls svm ffa mlp lm and mlp ffa at level 2 the combiner model is mlr model imm mlr strategy 4 at level 1 the selected 4 base models are svm ls svm ffa mlp lm and mlp ffa at level 2 the combiner algorithm is simple averaging sa imm sa 4 3 2 level 0 model structures level 0 includes decisions on selecting appropriate model structures for each of the waterbodies water level is modelled by each of the base model at level 1 through the following model structure the model structures studied in the paper through a trial and error procedure are 1 1 h t f h t 1 1 2 h t f h t 1 h t 2 1 3 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 1 4 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 h t 4 1 5 h t f h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 h t 4 h t 5 the paper uses mlp lm mlp ffa svm ls and svm ffa specified below to describe eq 1 but model combinations are expressed as 2 h t a t l e v e l 2 ϕ h t l e v e l 1 m 1 h t l e v e l 1 m 2 where m1 m2 refer to model 1 model 2 for a particular strategy where eq 2 may be expressed for each strategy at level 2 as follows 2 1 h t s t r a t e g y 1 ϕ h t s v m l s h t s v m f f a 2 2 h t s t r a t e g y 2 ϕ h t m l p l m h t m l p f f a 2 3 h t s t r a t e g y 3 ϕ h t s v m l s h t s v m f f a h t m l p l m h t m l p f f a 2 4 h t s t r a t e g y 4 h t s v m l s h t s v m f f a h t m l p l m h t m l p f f a 4 where ϕ is a function which fits an appropriate relationship to eq 2 and is determined by the training procedure the combiners model at level 2 are mlp lm svm ls mlr and the simple averaging algorithm i e using a constant and equal value of weights for each input data in general eq 2 is pivotal which expresses the learning for convergences and divergences between input data and target data as depicted in fig 3 models at both levels 1 and 2 use target observed values notably target data refer to observed values and in the case of local models constructed by the paper observed data are the basis for forming input data and observed data 4 3 3 level 0 examination of local data for model structure most of the inherent and salient characteristics of hydrologic systems are reviewed by sivakumar 2017 before embarking on a full scale modelling preliminary ideas should be developed at level 0 to understand possible structures in the data and anticipate appropriate model structures to guide the formulation of modelling strategies the usual procedure includes i plotting time series and ii deriving statistics other investigations e g cross correlation autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation matrices were investigated but not presented for simplicity 4 4 assessing each component of the information band 4 4 1 performance metrics the study uses the following performance measures coefficient of correlation cc or r values root means square errors rmse nash sutcliff efficiency nse coefficient and willmott s index wi of agreement cc is a scale independent fitness metric and its values vary between 1 and 1 in which a value near zero indicate poor but that approaching 1 indicates a near perfect performances rmse values range from 0 the perfect model to higher real numbers and is a global measure of fit costs between the observed and modelled values it is scale dependent and sensitive to outliers nse is a scale independent fitness metric with values ranging from 1 to the closer its value to 1 the more accurate is the prediction wi is a descriptive measure and applies for cross comparisons the value of which varies between 0 and 1 0 reflects poor agreements but 1 reflects the perfect agreement willmott 1981 points that the relatively high wi values may be obtained even for poor model fits susceptible to outliers 4 4 2 trend studies among a diverse range of statistical metrics to study model performances scatter diagrams provides a visual insight into model fitting additionally the paper uses scatter diagrams of residual errors to identify possible trends in the data similar to jha and sahoo 2015 and mohanty et al 2013 as stated by sivakumar 2017 there are no proven automatic methods to identify the trend component in a system the authors are not aware of any theoretical basis for studying trends by error residuals of scatter diagrams and assume this to be a heuristic approach although visual reviews of scatter diagrams of error residuals are widespread among practitioners trend analysis is well developed in statistics see anscombe and tukey 1963 and sneyers 1991 and on floods and precipitation models see madsen et al 2014 for a review 4 4 3 homoscedasticity of error residuals the error residual component of the information band is examined by the null hypothesis that they are homoscedastic at a given level of significance this means that the models have extracted all the information from the dataset without the introduction of any systematic error to the residuals and thereby the residuals have no more information for extraction if the null hypothesis does not pass the alternative hypothesis is significant and further investigations are needed to explain possible presence of trend or similar sources of significant information in this study the xlstat 2014 application is used for their analysis by i breusch pagan test and ii white test see koenker 1981 and white 1980 4 5 hydrometric record of the lakes under study as per review in section 4 1 it is expected that water level in the caspian sea depends partially on the location within it therefore the recorded values at one observation station are not necessarily the same as those for other stations as the underlying dynamics should prevail over its middle and southern caspian the variability for lake urmia is not expected to be particularly high and its dynamics to be low due to its shallow water depths the scope for dynamics at lake van is expected to be significant as it is a deep lake statistics of the recorded water levels and the location of the gauges are presented in table 1 5 results the modelling results are presented for the four imm strategies defined in fig 3 and their presentation for each strategy is structured as level 0 specify decisions for the model structures level 1 present results of the base models and level 2 present results of combiner models 5 1 level 0 model structure the data records for the three waterbodies are displayed in fig 4 and these are used to form datasets for the imm strategies using the model structures defined by eqs 1 and 2 the datasets were parsed out prior to modelling in a number of ways but are not presented for not making the results over complicated the presentation suffices to the statistics of the data in table 1 and their time plots in fig 4 in which the latter displays the dynamic character of the data notably there are two outliers in the recorded levels of lake urmia but were ignored and these may impact the results overall the results at level 0 provide some insight into the data structure as a result of which the sea state for the caspian sea is highly dynamics that for lake urmia reflects drastic changes since 2000 and lake van displays the dynamic state with four significant jumps over four periods the data were divided into two sets for the training phase and testing phase in the proportion of 80 and 20 the data used for the testing phase was not used in the training phase 5 2 performance of imm level 1 base models equivalent to emm the base models for strategy 1 svm ls and svm ffa require the identification of model structures defined by eqs 1 1 1 5 and table 2 gives the performance metrics for the selected model and its most representative the better performing model structures at level 1 overall the models at level 1 are considered as fit for purpose notably electronic supplementary material esm gives more detailed results including svm model parameters and the performance metrics for each of the five model structures the base models for strategy 2 mlp lm and mlp ffa tested the model structures defined by eqs 1 1 1 5 and detailed results are presented in esm but table 2 summarises them by giving the performance metrics for the selected model as most representative model structures at level 1 overall these models at level 1 are considered as fit for purpose the results are further presented in figs 5a 5b and 6 for both base models of strategies 1 and 2 by displaying predicted hydrographs and their scatter diagrams for a visual assessment these results together with those presented in table 2 are suggestive of the following salient conclusions i the quality of selected models in the testing phase drops slightly compared with that of the training phase and this is expected and ii better performing models are deemed fit for purpose and selected using performance metrics of the testing phase but not of the training phase also decisions may require other considerations when their behaviours are inconsistent if the investigations presented in the paper followed emm practices the total of four base models would be ranked as follows mlp ffa svm ffa for the first and second rank and there would be competition for the third and fourth rank between mlp lm and svm ls arguably ranking or expression of superiority is not helpful and to be avoided in imm practices 5 3 performances of imm level 2 combiner models strategies 1 4 the results presented below are driven by the default goal of the study by investigating ways of improving modelling accuracy through imm rheo strategy 1 uses imm ann as its combiner model at level 2 and is formulated as per fig 3 but its topology is yet unknown which is identified by the best practice procedure through varying the number of the neurons in the hidden layer from 1 to 20 the selected topologies are given in table 2 but more detailed results are given in esm the table presents the parameter values used for running the ann models fig 5a presents the predicted values and their scatter diagrams for each waterbody and the subsequent improvements are discussed further below strategy 2 uses imm svm as its combiner model at level 2 and is formulated as per fig 3 but its parameters are yet unknown which are identified by the best practice procedure its values are given in table 2 but more detailed results are in esm predicted values and their scatter diagrams are presented in figs 5a and 5b and improvements are discussed further below strategy 3 is formulated by using the base models svm ls svm ffa mlp lm and mlp ffa but the combiner model is based on the mlr technique likewise strategy 4 is formulated as in strategy 3 but the combiner algorithm comprises a simple averaging rule the results for strategies 1 4 are presented in table 3a and are discussed below a comparative study of the performance metrics of the four strategies is presented in tables 3a and 3b which provide evidence for the efficacy of the four imm strategies as follows i there are improvements in the accuracy of the models at level 2 compared with those at level 1 so much as to justify imm practices ii the defensible strategy for the three waterbodies is strategy 2 at training and testing phases and strategy 3 is nearly just as good performances of strategy 4 in terms of rmse is interesting and according to the discussion by nadiri et al 2019 the rmse of strategy 4 has to be less than the mean of the rmse of the base models consider this for lake urmia i the rmse of strategy 4 is 0 149 ii the mean rmse of the four base models is 0 173 0 196 0 157 0 188 0 150 4 0 and iii hence the conditions holds true as also discussed by nadiri et al 2019 owing to improvements by strategy 4 it serves here as a benchmark 5 4 visual trend through scatter diagram of error residuals levels 1 and 2 error residuals at levels 1 and 2 for the results of strategies 1 and 2 are displayed in fig 6 the figure provides evidence that there is some waviness in the residuals of the models for the caspian and urmia waterbodies at level 2 of strategy 1 where no such waviness is observed for the results at level 1 therefore even if strategy 1 produces enhanced accuracy they are not necessarily reliable and the strategy can be removed from further considerations this observation is a good evidence that alternative strategies at level 2 are required a clearer inter comparison of strategies 1 to 4 is shown in fig 7 in terms of their residual scatter diagrams the pattern in the residuals is clear the amplitudes of the scatters depend on the strategy for strategy 1 the performances are good for the caspian sea and lake van but fit for purpose for lake urmia for strategies 2 and 3 the amplitudes in each of the three waterbodies are remarkably narrow for strategy 4 significant scatters in the residuals for all three waterbodies are strikingly evident the scatter diagram of the error residuals of strategies 2 4 displayed in fig 7 for each waterbody clearly shows that there is little sign of any trend the waviness in the scatter diagram of the results the caspian and urmia waterbodies are explained above and attributed to modelling errors 5 5 residual analysis the results presented below are driven by model learning by investigating any hidden trend in the observed data owing to improved accuracy through imm rheo two tests are carried out for testing the homoscedasticity in the error residuals and they are i breusch pagan test and ii white test as discussed in section 4 4 the salient features of the results presented in table 4 are as follows i residuals for strategy 2 are generally homoscedastic with one minor exception for lake urmia testing phase the breusch pagan test did not render homoscedasticity ii residuals for strategies 2 and 3 of the training phases are order of rounding errors and no statistical tests are necessary iii residuals for the models of caspian sea at their training and testing phases are homoscedastic with the exception of the residuals by strategy 1 which are explained below iv residuals for the models of lake urmia at their training phases are homoscedastic but mostly heteroscedastic for the testing phase see the explanation below v residuals for the models of lake van at their training phases are heteroscedastic and largely homoscedastic for the testing phase for models with homoscedastic residuals information extraction is successful and therefore any further information is unlikely to be extracted from the particular model in cases where the residuals are not homoscedastic the inherent heteroscedasticity needs to be explained by possible existence of trends outliers and or ultimately by identifying other possible distributions in the residuals as the training and testing results for lake van show that the residuals are homoscedastic table 4 and their scatter diagrams fig 7c contain no trend this is taken as evidence for the regional behaviour including lake urmia similarly the training results for lake urmia show that the residuals are homoscedastic table 4 and there is no trend in terms of the scatter diagram of error residuals fig 7b and therefore homoscedasticity for their testing results is confirmed but only by the white test the heteroscedasticity by the breusch pagan test is attributed to a single outlier and when this is removed the residuals improve towards homoscedasticity the exceptions are extracted and explained in table 5 6 discussion the focus of imm on results are now discussed with respect to the goals set out for the study 6 1 the goal of improved accuracy there is no similar work to compare the results reported in the paper with those investigated by others the focus of imm on the information band performance metrics trends and homoscedasticity of error residuals are presented in section 5 according to the results there is no difference between emm practices and imm practices at level 1 except that the emm results would normally be processed by ranking the models and identifying a superior one whereas the paper regards them as fit for purpose and avoids such superlatives the introduction of imm rheo practices makes a difference in such a way that a closure to the information band becomes feasible and these can be investigated in a more meaningful way in summary the results indicate that strategies 1 4 in particular strategies 2 and 3 are significantly enhanced by the narrow down in the residuals the model learning from the results includes i the conclusion that the testcase of the caspian sea subject to more dynamic variations provides a stringent test for the accuracy capability of imm rheo ii the testcase of lake van with 73 years of data provides a more realistic data for investigating possible trends in the region such as climate changes and iii the caspian and lake van testcases are used for learning on the performances of the modelling strategies to serve as a mean for confidence building for the study of lake urmia owing to enhanced residuals strategies 1 4 are capable of narrowing down the residuals in particular strategies 2 and 3 extract successfully maximum information from the time series of the three waterbodies to the extent that there are no significant trends in the data as such there is no further information in the residuals to be extracted hence imm rheo is a procedure to identify a strategy which maximises the extracted information this makes the modelling results defensible by a cycle of activities from studying performance measure to error residuals 6 2 emergent goal by applying imm rheo the models investigated by the paper are fit to explore emergent goals for an insight through outlining the baseline and subsequent changes owing to the accuracy of modelling results the narrowing of the amplitude of the residuals and exploring any trend in the data the exploration is confined to lake urmia alone 6 2 1 the baseline the hydrological timeline for lake urmia is defined as follows the first ever dam built in its basin was completed in 1978 with a capacity of 1 1 km3 on the river jighati siminehrud as its major river prior to which the average discharge from the river to the lake was approximately 1 6 km3 per year this did not impact the lake as its water levels up to 2000 remained within the normal range of annual fluctuations major dams were constructed during 1988 2000 thus year 2000 may be taken as the baseline for water level 6 2 2 changes the dams impacted the lake as follows most of dams in the basin of lake urmia have become operational since 2000 in the form of reducing flows into lake urmia to trickles the average water level decline of 0 3 m year impacted the lake induced the catastrophic shrinkage in its surface area by 2018 as much as approx 90 of its surface area has left more than 1 m of salt deposits at the base level and now exposes the at risk population to health hazards in spite of international willingness to help a major element in the official explanation is the attribution of the catastrophe to climate change the study presented in the paper provides some data driven evidence that error residuals of water levels of two major lakes urmia and van in the region are explainable by probability distribution without suggesting any trend the results therefore provide clear signals for explaining the shrinkage of lake urmia that stems from the impacts of constructed dams without compensation flows but not from any trend such as climate change the absence of the signals is similar to the study by the authors investigating the recorded data at three gauging stations of the river jighati within its upper catchments in which no trend was identified see ghorbani et al 2018 though the data went back to 1989 the paper is not detracting from the importance of climate change or population rise but the role of planning on the catastrophe at lake urmia needs more attention the above results demonstrate the role of model learning which can be transformed into emergent goals for the service of the management of the system the alternative is improvements of accuracy for the sake of pure hydrology and this should not be justified for instance consider the study by kakahaji et al 2013 reporting improvements on predicting water level of lake urmia in their modelling studies arguably their study is in the tradition of emm practices they present their results in terms of a requirement for wise use of lake urmia the term wise use is promoted by the ramsar convention https www ramsar org which stipulates a range of conditions as embedded in their definition the wise use of all wetlands being achieved in all parties including more participative management of wetlands and conservation decisions however hardly any of the above stipulated fundamental concepts are included in management parameters for lake urmia and it is only through emergent goals that the gap becomes visible between the presentation by kakahaji et al 2013 and the wise use of water the emergent goal is to inform researcher policymakers and decisionmakers to ensure that they are concordant but discordance in the discourse on lake urmia is noticeable for instance the australian curriculum on geography for year 10 covers lake urmia in the following terms see ref 1 reasons for the decline of the lake s level are a combination of prolonged drought and increased diversions for irrigation often people withdraw water illegally without paying for it or take more than they are allocated the above factually correct statements only reveal half of the problem the other half is normally overlooked and includes i information is scarce on the efficacy of the planning system if any and on policy enforcement systems as well on decision making by participation ii a top down approach has been enforced for the massive dam construction program with unknown facilities of sluice gates to allow the passage of compensation flows this point has also been made by hassanzadeh et al 2012 where it is commonly known that inflows to the lake have effectively been cut off iii traditional agricultural system of subsistence changed to pumpage of groundwater and this led to the classic case of the tragedy of the commons as defined by hardin 1968 6 2 3 restoring lake urmia equitable water distribution is normally ascertained through a whole range of strategies including basin management plans water resources plans water cycle studies drought plans and all these plans and strategies are refined through public participation only after the compliance to such a planning system gives legitimacy to blame any misbehaving water users the paper is focussed on hydrology but hydrology and planning should be in tandem with each other there is a national committee for the revival of lake urmia called urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc its restoration program is reproduced in fig 8 see ref 2 positive signs are yet to emerge out of the restoration program by ulrnc the paper argues that the damages to lake urmia and its basin are not permanent and it is never too late to kick start a genuine restoration program this is supported by freak rainstorms in spring 2019 throughout the region which raised the water level in lake urmia by more than 1 m in a few month there is no information on their sources causing the level rise which may be due to direct runoffs from downstream of reservoirs opening of the impounding reservoirs at the panic times of widespread floods or overflows from the reservoirs a more positive planning is the key for balancing the real water needs with the compensation flows meeting the ecology and maintaining water levels of lake urmia without blaming water users whilst water users have to go through an extensive program of extension services training it is never too late to mitigate past impacts a planning system would arguably be only successful if it allows decision making by participation and the authors are aware of a number of workshops held in both west and east azerbaijan provinces by consultants but without any follow up on their efficacy 6 3 status of imm rheo on the ground of the above goals the three testcases reported in the paper provide evidence for the proof of concept for the imm rheo framework equivalent to technical readiness level 4 akin to the nasa classification https www nasa gov sites default files trl png a modelling activity meeting its goal of accuracy is deemed defensible to serve as a decision tool as well as useable to gain an insight into a study area by exploring its emergent goals the pivotal model learning from the application of the imm rheo to the three waterbodies is that the models at level 1 are largely fit for purpose but the models at level 2 can become defensible the paper makes the case for further research until imm rheo reaches its technical readiness level 9 7 conclusion the paper introduces inclusive multiple models imm practices in which the models are used as means to an end through an architecture that extend from model construction to the study of inherent information bands model fit trends and statistical distribution of error residuals as well as using the data and models to inform researcher policymakers and decisionmakers imm results are defensible and are presented as an alternative to existing exclusionary multiple modelling emm practices notably emm results are often fit for purpose for being the end products of anecdotal evidence to identify a superior technique the paper argues that emm practices have their strength in innovation but also impede research agenda imm practices are presented in terms of a framework with four dimensions model reuse mr hierarchy and or recursion hr elastic model learning environment ele and goal orientation go making the acronym of rheo it also formalises the architecture of modelling practices at two levels driven by goal orientation four strategies are formulated the models at level 1 used two variations based on artificial neural networks ann and support vector machine svm the four models at level 1 were found to be fit for purpose in a background where imm avoids the motivation by emm to rank them models at level 1 served as base models for the combiner model at level 2 the models at level 2 formulated four strategies of which strategy 4 is based on simple averaging all of the four imm strategies at level 2 improve accuracy even strategy 4 improves accuracy using simple averaging as well as the quality of the results in terms of reducing the amplitude of the residuals the strategies provide varying degrees of improvements on the quality of the residuals imm is applied to study the decline of water levels in lake urmia in the context of the two other waterbodies of the caspian sea and lake van within the region where their shortest distance is 500 km whilst the caspian sea and lake van are hydrologically vibrant lake urmia is distressed and 90 of its volume has shrunk since 2000 the analysis of the results indicates the imm strategies improved accuracy of even the more dynamic caspian sea and of that of lake van display no significant trend with 73 years of recorded water levels these two testcases are used for confidence building for the imm rheo capability and for transferring the subsequent learning to justify an interpretation of the results of the strategies for lake urmia the received view promoted by the officials attributes primarily the distressed state of lake urmia to climate change however using imm the paper provides evidence to throw doubt on the ability of climate change to undermine the integrity of lake urmia in 15 years instead imm puts the focus on management issues for stimulating the debate imm rheo is at its infancy and this is its weakness but requires the formulation of strategies for improved accuracies to create a step rise in the status of the models from fit for purpose to more defensible models and this is its strength a great deal of more work is needed to understand its further weaknesses and strengths it can also make new possibilities feasible particularly it can bring to fashion user designed strategies appropriate to a study area by studying impacts of past poor practices to promote evidence based sustain future declaration of competing interest the authors
