19820,the electro peroxone e peroxone process is an emerging ozone based electrochemical advanced oxidation process that combines conventional ozonation with in situ cathodic hydrogen peroxide h2o2 production for oxidative water treatment in this study the effects of the e peroxone pretreatment on disinfection by product dbp formation from chlorination of a synthetic surface water were investigated and compared to conventional ozonation results show that due to the enhanced transformation of ozone o3 to hydroxyl radicals oh by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process considerably enhanced dissolved organic carbon doc abatement and significantly reduced bromate bro3 formation compared to conventional ozonation however natural organic matter nom with high uv254 absorbance which is the major precursors of chlorination dbps was less efficiently abated during the e peroxone process than conventional ozonation consequently while both conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process substantially reduced the formation of dbps trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids during post chlorination higher dbp concentrations were generally observed during chlorination of the e peroxone pretreated waters than conventional ozonation treated in addition because of conventional ozonation or the e peroxone treatment dbps formed during post chlorination shifted to more brominated species the overall yields of brominated dbps exhibited strong correlations with the bromide concentrations in water therefore while the e peroxone process can effectively suppress bromide transformation to bromate it may lead to higher formation of brominated dbps during post chlorination compared to conventional ozonation these results suggest that the e peroxone process can lead to different dbp formation and speciation during water treatment trains compared to conventional ozonation keywords bromate chlorination disinfection by products electrochemical advanced oxidation process haas thms 1 introduction chlorine has been used as a disinfectant in water treatment for more than 100 years chlorine can inactivate a wide range of waterborne pathogens bacteria and viruses and maintain a residual disinfectant in treated water distribution systems crittenden et al 2012 because of its low cost and easy accessibility chlorine is still the most used disinfectant in drinking water treatment globally rosario ortiz et al 2016 however chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom present in source waters to form harmful halogenated disinfection by products dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 hrudey and charrois 2012 reckhow et al 1990 richardson 2011 sedlak and von gunten 2011 among the known specific chlorination dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two most prevalent groups and regulated in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 one option to reduce the dbp formation during chlorination is to pretreat source waters with ozone o3 many studies have shown that ozonation can destruct a considerable fraction of dbp precursors in natural water and therefore reduce the dbp formation during subsequent chlorination chang et al 2002 de vera et al 2016 gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 2013 mao et al 2014 in addition o3 can effectively inactivate some chlorine resistant protozoa e g cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and oxidize many inorganic and organic contaminants e g iron manganese pesticides and pharmaceuticals that may be present in drinking water sources von gunten 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however o3 decays rapidly in water and therefore is unable to provide long lasting secondary disinfection in distribution systems crittenden et al 2012 rosario ortiz et al 2016 therefore post chlorination is still needed to maintain a disinfection residual in most drinking water distribution systems moreover ozonation of bromide containing water can lead to the formation of bromate bro3 von gunten 2003b von gunten and oliveras 1998 which is an oxidation disinfection by product with a low drinking water standard of 10 μg l in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 to reduce bromate formation we have tested combining conventional ozonation with in situ electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from cathodic oxygen o2 reduction li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 the electro generated h2o2 can accelerate o3 transformation to hydroxyl radicals oh thus lowering the residual concentrations of o3 which is an indispensable reactant in the oh induced bromate formation mechanism von gunten 2003b von gunten and oliveras 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition h2o2 can rapidly reduce hypobromous acid hobr a key intermediate for bromate formation in o3 induced processes back to bromide br thus impeding the formation pathways of bromate von gunten and oliveras 1997 consequently significantly less bromate is formed during the combined ozonation and electrochemical process called as the electro peroxone e peroxone process yuan et al 2013 than during conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 furthermore due to the enhanced transformation of o3 to oh the abatement of ozone resistant contaminants e g methylisoborneol and geosmin can be improved in the e peroxone process lin et al 2016 yao et al 2017 while the e peroxone process can effectively inhibit bromate formation during the treatment of bromide containing water li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 its effects on the dbp formation during subsequent chlorination are still not known the electro generation of h2o2 and its enhancement of o3 transformation to oh shift the mechanisms of nom oxidation from mainly selective oxidation with o3 in conventional ozonation to less selective oxidation with oh in the e peroxone process li et al 2015 unlike o3 which reacts preferentially with organics having conjugated double bonds and activated aromatic systems oh is a less selective oxidant and tends to react fast with almost all types of organics hammes et al 2006 von gunten 2003a wert et al 2007 the different mechanisms of the reactions of nom with o3 and oh can have complex and distinct impacts on dbp formation during post chlorination de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 kleiser and frimmel 2000 in fact contradictory results have been reported when comparing dbp formation during chlorination of waters pretreated by conventional ozonation and the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process in some studies conventional peroxone process results in higher thm formation during post chlorination than for conventional ozonation de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 irabelli et al 2008 mosteo et al 2009 wang et al 2013 in contrast others reported that thm formation was generally comparable within experimental errors for waters pretreated by the two processes while haa formation could either increase or decrease when conventional ozonation was changed to the conventional peroxone process lamsal et al 2011 yang et al 2012 these results suggest that the e peroxone process may result in different dbp formation during water treatment trains compared to conventional ozonation which has yet to be evaluated therefore the main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the e peroxone pretreatment on dbp formation during post chlorination synthetic surface waters were prepared according to typical drinking water quality in china and then treated by consecutive conventional ozonation and chlorination o3 cl2 or consecutive e peroxone and chlorination ep cl2 processes the formation of dbps bromate thms and haas during the two consecutive processes were compared the effects of key operational parameters of the e peroxone process o3 doses and applied currents on dbp formation were evaluated systematically 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic surface water samples and reagents synthetic surface water was prepared by adding appropriate amounts of cacl2 mgso4 nahco3 kbr analytical grade and humic acid stock solution to deionized water see table 1 for the main water quality parameters this composition was intended to simulate typical drinking water quality in china wang et al 2013 and similar effects have been observed for the e peroxone process e g reduced bromate formation and enhanced dom mineralization in the synthetic water and in a real surface water li et al 2015 the humic acid stock solution was prepared by dissolving 250 mg humic acid sigma aldrich in 100 ml deionized water at ph 12 followed by filtration through 0 45 μm durapore membrane filters merck ireland the stock solution was then stored in the dark at 4 c before it was used to prepare the synthetic water in addition to investigate the role of bromide for the formation of bromate and brominated dbps during ozonation and chlorination the synthetic water was spiked to achieve an initial bromide concentration of 150 μg l all dbp standards e g trichloromethane trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid were purchased from sigma aldrich the other reagents e g cacl2 mgso4 and kbr were of analytical grade and purchased from modern eastern fine chemical beijing china all solutions were prepared with deionized water 2 2 experimental procedure conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment of 500 ml synthetic surface water were conducted in an acrylic column reactor 5 cm inner diameter 25 cm height using a similar experimental setup described previously bakheet et al 2014 o3 was continuously generated from a pure o2 feed gas 99 9 using an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada and then sparged into the reactor using a fine bubble diffuser at a constant flow rate of 240 ml min during both processes the gas phase o3 concentration in the sparged gas o2 o3 mixture can be adjusted by changing the ozone generator power for conventional ozonation treatment only gas sparging was applied no electrodes were installed in the reactor for the e peroxone treatment a pair of electrodes was installed in the reactor the anode was a ruo2 iro2 coated ti plate 3 cm 5 cm 0 2 cm and the cathode was a carbon polytetrafluoroethylene carbon ptfe electrode 3 cm 5 cm 0 2 cm prepared with vulcan xc 72 carbon powder cabot corp usa ptfe dispersion and anhydrous alcohol wang et al 2012 the distance between the electrodes was 0 5 cm the e peroxone process was initiated by simultaneously applying a constant current to electro generate h2o2 at the cathode and sparging ozone containing oxygen gas through the reactor both ozonation and e peroxone treatments were conducted for 20 min duplicates were conducted for each experiment after the treatments 5 min of nitrogen stripping was used to remove the residual o3 in the samples in addition appropriate amount of catalase was added to quench h2o2 residuals after the e peroxone treatment liu et al 2003 an aliquot sample was then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and used for the analysis of bromide bromate uv254 and doc another aliquot of sample was taken for the determination of thm and haa formation according to the uniform formation condition ufc protocol summers et al 1996 in brief samples were firstly buffered to ph 8 using 2 mm borate buffer then chlorinated at 20 1 c for 24 h chlorine doses were determined by preliminary tests to maintain a residual chlorine concentration of 1 0 0 4 mg l after 24 h incubation next the residual chlorine was quenched with a stoichiometric amount of sodium thiosulfate 99 5 and then extracted immediately for dbp analysis to evaluate oh production during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process additional experiments were conducted by adding 0 5 mg l p cba as a oh probe in the synthetic water prior to each oxidative treatment p cba reacts very slowly with o3 k o3 0 1 m 1 s 1 but rapidly with oh k oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 it is therefore oxidized almost exclusively by oh during ozone based processes von sonntag and von gunten 2012 2 3 analytical methods during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatments the gas phase o3 concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the reactor were monitored using ozone analyzers bmt 964 ozone systems technology international inc germany transferred ozone doses were calculated according to the difference between gas phase o3

measured by an ic metrohm 761 switzerland equipped with anionic column metrosepa supp 7 following the procedure described elsewhere mao et al 2014 chlorine was determined by the n n diethyl p

lc1290 qqq6460 agilent using a protocol described elsewhere yao et al 2016 the thms analyzed in this study included trichloro bromodichloro dibromochloro and tribromomethanes tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm trihaloacetic acids thaas are the sum of trichloro bromodichloro dibromochloro and tribromoacetic acids tcaa bdcaa dbcaa and tbaa whereas dihaloacetic acids dhaas include dichloro bromochloro and dibromoacetic acids dcaa bcaa and dbaa analyses of thms based on usepa method 551 1 usepa 1985 were carried out on a gc agilent 7890a santa clara usa equipped with a db 1 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm

discussion 3 1 conventional ozonation and e peroxone treatment 3 1 1 abatement of doc and uv254 absorbance the carbon ptfe cathode used in this study had a high activity for converting o2 to h2o2 fig 1 shows that when a pure o2 gas was sparged in the synthetic surface water during electrolysis h2o2 concentration increased almost linearly with reaction time which indicates that h2o2 was stably produced from o2 reduction at the cathode in comparison h2o2 concentration increased at a lower rate when an o2 o3 gas o3 7 4 mg l mixture was sparged during electrolysis i e the e peroxone process these observations suggest that some electro generated h2o2 is then consumed in the ensuing reaction with sparged o3 during the e peroxone process bakheet et al 2013 xia et al 2017 due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by electro generated h2o2 higher transferred o3 doses were obtained during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation under the same gas sparging conditions see si table s2 specifically when an o2 o3 gas mixture with 2 5 7 4 mg l o3 was sparged through the reactor for 20 min the transferred ozone doses were 3 6 12 1 mg l and 5 0 13 8 mg l for conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process with an applied current of 90 ma respectively fig 2 a shows that the spiked oh probe p cba was more rapidly abated during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation when the same o2 o3 gas mixture o3 7 4 mg l was sparged during the two processes this observation can be attributed to the enhancement in o3 mass transfer and its ensuing transformation to oh by the electro generated h2o2 during the e peroxone process xia et al 2017 yao et al 2017 consequently more oh could be produced to accelerate p cba oxidation during the e peroxone process than conventional ozonation under the same gas sparging conditions corresponding to the enhanced oh production doc of the synthetic water decreased more rapidly during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation fig 2b in general the results shown above agree well with the previous findings that the electro generation of h2o2 can enhance the transformation o3 to oh and thus improve the abatement of ozone resistant compounds and solution doc during the e peroxone process li et al 2013 lin et al 2016 wang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 in contrast to doc uv254 absorbance of the synthetic water decreased more slowly during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation fig 2c this result can be probably attributed to the different oxidation mechanisms of dom during the two processes li et al 2015 during conventional ozonation direct oxidation with o3 usually dominates the mechanism of nom oxidation lamsal et al 2011 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in comparison due to the enhanced o3 transformation to oh by h2o2 the mechanism of nom oxidation shifts from o3 oxidation to oh oxidation during the conventional peroxone and the e peroxone process de vera et al 2015 irabelli et al 2008 lamsal et al 2011 li et al 2015 o3 is a selective oxidant and reacts preferentially with olefins and activated aromatic moieties of nom von gunten 2003a which are also the main uv absorbing parts of nom hua et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 wenk et al 2013 therefore conventional ozonation can effectively reduce uv254 hua and reckhow 2013 kleiser and frimmel 2000 lamsal et al 2011 mao et al 2014 however nom oxidation by o3 leads to the formation of a variety of oxygenated by products such as ketones and carboxylic acids that are resistant to further o3 oxidation due to their slow second order rate constants for the reaction with o3 von gunten 2003a wert et al 2007 consequently conventional ozonation is usually ineffective at doc abatement lamsal et al 2011 mao et al 2014 yan et al 2010 in contrast to o3 oh is a less selective oxidant and reacts rapidly with most organic compounds oh does not selectively destruct the uv absorbing moieties of nom but reacts with almost all moieties which leads to a partial mineralization nom kleiser and frimmel 2000 lamsal et al 2011 due to the change of nom oxidation mechanisms as well as the enhanced o3 transfer the e peroxone process considerably accelerated dom mineralization compared to conventional ozonation fig 2b nevertheless less efficient uv254 reduction was achieved by the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation fig 2c the effects of ozone doses on the abatement of doc and uv254 absorbance of the synthetic surface water by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process are compared in fig 3 in general both doc and uv254 decreased progressively with increasing transferred o3 doses during the two processes however different extents of doc and uv254 reduction were obtained by the two processes conventional ozonation abated the doc and uv254 absorbance of the synthetic water by 4 8 and 68 84 respectively in comparison the e peroxone process abated doc and uv254 by 17 39 and 41 77 respectively these observations agree with the previous finding that due to the change in dom oxidation mechanisms the e peroxone process was more effective at dom mineralization but less effective at uv254 abatement than conventional ozonation hua and reckhow 2013 kleiser and frimmel 2000 lamsal et al 2011 mao et al 2014 fig 4 shows the effect of applied current on doc and uv254 abatement by the e peroxone process as the applied current was increased from 0 ma conventional ozonation to 120 ma e peroxone doc decreased considerably this trend can be attributed to the fact that increasing applied current increases the rate of h2o2 electro generation wang et al 2015 as well as ozone transfer fig 4a inset consequently more oh could be produced to enhance dom mineralization at higher applied currents fig 4a however due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition at higher currents the more selective oxidation of uv absorbing moieties by o3 diminishes with increasing currents during the e peroxone process consequently uv254 absorbance increased with increasing the applied currents during the e peroxone process fig 4b due to the different mechanisms of nom oxidation conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process resulted in different changes of the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva i e the ratio of uv254 to doc for the synthetic surface water the suva value of a water has been considered a good surrogate for the aromatic and high molecular nom fractions ates et al 2007 hua et al 2015 for both processes suva decreased with increasing ozone doses fig 3b inset highlighting the importance of o3 for the oxidation uv absorbing nom in contrast increasing applied currents during the e peroxone process resulted in less reduction in the suva values fig 4b inset which can be attributed to the shift of nom oxidation mechanisms from o3 oxidation to oh oxidation at higher applied currents in general suva of the synthetic water decreased less after the e peroxone process than after conventional ozonation suggesting that the fraction of nom with high aromaticity is less efficiently transformed during the e peroxone process 3 1 2 bromate formation the fate of br and bro3 in conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treated waters are compared in fig 5 with a transferred o3 dose of 3 6 mg l no detectable bro3 was identified in the water treated by conventional ozonation however bro3 concentrations then largely exceeded the regulatory limit 10 μg l or 0 078 μm for higher transferred o3 doses this result indicates that increasing o3 doses significantly enhances the transformation of br to bro3 during conventional ozonation in agreement with the general finding of previous studies on ozonation of bromide containing waters li et al 2015 von gunten 2003b wang et al 2013 in contrast to conventional ozonation the transformation of br to bro3 is effectively suppressed during the e peroxone process bro3 formation was only observed when the highest transferred o3 dose 13 8 mg l was applied in the e peroxone process and the formed bro3 0 11 μm or 14 5 μg l was significantly less than the concentrations in conventional ozonation at even lower transferred ozone doses e g 1 11 μm or 141 5 μg l at a transferred o3 dose of 12 1 mg l the reduction in bromate formation can be attributed to a combined result of both the h2o2 induced low o3 residual concentrations and rapid hobr reduction to br during the e peroxone process li et al 2015 von gunten and oliveras 1998 yao et al 2017 fig 5b shows that by increasing applied currents during the e peroxone process bro3 formation decreased progressively this change can be attributed to the acceleration of h2o2 electro generation at higher applied currents which in turn enhances both the o3 decomposition and hobr reduction to br and can thus more effectively suppress the transformation of br to bro3 li et al 2015 von gunten and oliveras 1998 yao et al 2017 the sum of br and bro3 in the conventional ozonation or e peroxone treated waters were generally within 92 101 the relative standard deviations of br and bro3 measurements were approximately 4 of the amount of br 1 8 μm spiked into the synthetic surface water fig 5 this observation indicate that the formation of brominated organic dbps is insignificant during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process brominated organics are primarily formed from the reactions of hobr obr with nom during water treatment hua and reckhow 2008 hua et al 2006 however because hobr obr compete with o3 for similar structures in the nom but are present in much lower concentrations than o3 during ozone based processes the formation of brominated organics is usually negligible in ozone based processes von gunten 2003b von sonntag and von gunten 2012 3 2 dbp formation during post chlorination the results presented above show that doc uv254 and suva of the synthetic surface water were changed to various degrees by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process figs 1 and 2 indicating that nom in the water is oxidized via differing mechanisms during the two processes this may in turn affect the reactions of nom with chlorine toward the formation of dbps during subsequent chlorination de vera et al 2015 kleiser and frimmel 2000 moreover while the e peroxone process effectively suppressed br transformation to bro3 higher br residual concentrations left in the e peroxone pretreated water than those pretreated by conventional ozonation fig 5 during chlorination br can be oxidized by hocl clo to hobr bro which can then react with nom to form brominated dbps heeb et al 2014 hua et al 2006 von gunten 2003b therefore the changes of the br and bro3 distribution due to conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment may influence the extent of dbp formation as well as their speciation during subsequent chlorination 3 2 1 impact of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment on dbp yields to evaluate the effects of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment on formation of dbps during post chlorination two groups of dpbs thms and haas were determined after chlorination of the synthetic surface water without or with pretreatment by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process note that thaas and dhaas are discussed separately in the following sections because they are suggested to form from different precursors and reaction pathways hua et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2013 fig 6 shows that in general less thms thaas and dhaas were formed during post chlorination when the synthetic surface water was pretreated by either conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process for both processes the dbp formation decreased with increasing transferred o3 doses however for an equivalent transferred ozone dose conventional ozonation is more effective at reducing the formation of dbps during post chlorination than the e peroxone process for example with the transferred o3 doses of 3 6 12 1 mg l conventional ozonation reduced thm formation by 16 60 compared to no pre ozonation fig 6a in comparison the e peroxone process reduced thm formation only by 1 30 with the transferred o3 doses of 5 0 13 8 mg l the results observed herein are in line with the findings of many previous studies that pretreatment of natural waters with ozonation or o3 based aops such as uv o3 and o3 h2o2 can reduce dbp formation during post chlorination chin and berube 2005 gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 2013 irabelli et al 2008 lamsal et al 2011 yang et al 2012 this improvement can be mainly attributed to the transformation of dbp precursors to non dbp forming moieties due to reactions with o3 or oh specifically for thms and thaas previous studies have suggested that they are mainly formed from aromatic moieties in the nom thus since o3 is highly reactive with activated aromatic moieties conventional ozonation and o3 based aops usually can effectively reduce thm and thaa precursors in source waters chin and berube 2005 hua et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2013 kleiser and frimmel 2000 reckhow et al 1990 wenk et al 2013 however due to the shift of oxidation mechanisms from selective o3 oxidation of activated aromatic moieties in nom toward less selective oh oxidation of all nom fractions thm and thaa precursors are often less efficiently oxidized during ozone based aops than during conventional ozonation chin and berube 2005 de vera et al 2015 kleiser and frimmel 2000 therefore similar to the results often reported for the conventional peroxone process de vera et al 2015 irabelli et al 2008 mosteo et al 2009 wang et al 2013 higher concentrations of thms and thaas were generally formed during post chlorination of the e peroxone treated waters than conventional ozonation treated fig 6a and b the effects of pre oxidation on dhaa formation are more complicated while o3 and oh oxidation can abate some dhaa precursors oxidation of aromatic moieties by o3 and oh generates many smaller hydrophilic carboxylate rich transformation products e g carboxylic acids and aldehydes that can then react with chlorine or bromine to form dhaas gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2013 due to these two contrary mechanisms it is usually difficult to predict how the pretreatment of ozonation or aops would affect dhaa formation which is often reported to be sample and site specific hua and reckhow 2007 2013 yang et al 2012 fig 6c shows that dhaa formation decreased generally with increasing o3 doses during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process this observation can be possibly attributed to the enhanced abatement of dhaa precursors including those newly formed hydrophilic precursors at higher o3 doses mao et al 2014 compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone treated waters generated more dhaas during chlorination fig 6c this observation suggests that for the synthetic surface water tested in this study the precursors of dhaas are less efficiently reduced during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation fig 7 shows that as the applied currents were increased from 0 ma conventional ozonation to 120 ma e peroxone thm thaa and dhaa formation went through a maximum at 60 ma the increase of dbp formation from 0 ma to 60 ma can be probably attributed to the shift of nom oxidation mechanisms from primarily o3 oxidation to oh oxidation as discussed previously however the reasons for the decreased dbp formation at higher currents 90 120 ma are not very clear one possible explanation is that with increasing applied currents more o3 was transferred into the solution fig 4 inset and then transformed to oh this results in more oxidation power in the system which eventually affected the dbp formation even if it is dominated by oh oxidation 3 2 2 correlations of dbps with doc and suva the results presented above indicate that a pretreatment with either conventional ozonation or the e peroxone can substantially reduce dbp formation during subsequent chlorination fig 8 a shows that there exist no correlations r2 0 00 0 22 between the doc concentrations of the water samples the synthetic surface water and those pretreated by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process and the concentrations of dbps thms thaas and dhaas formed during subsequent chlorination in contrast a general trend r2 0 59 for thms or reasonable correlations r2 0 71 and 0 81 for dhaas and thaas were observed between the dbp formation and the suva values this observation suggests that the reduction of chlorination dbps is mainly caused by the transformation of dbp precursors i e aromatic nom moieties with high uv absorbance to non dbp forming organics rather than by partial mineralization of nom during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment correlations between suva and dbp formation have also been reported in previous studies especially for waters with relatively high doc concentrations 3 mg c l and high suva values 2 3 l mg c m ates et al 2007 hua et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 this correlation can be probably attributed to the fact that uv absorbing compounds and aromatic nom moieties are also often the primary sites of chlorine and bromine attack during chlorination heeb et al 2014 reckhow et al 1990 von gunten 2003b due to the different mechanisms of nom oxidation by o3 and oh suva was less efficiently reduced by the e peroxone process than by conventional ozonation fig 3b inset which suggests that dbp precursors are less effectively abated during the e peroxone process consequently more dbps were generally formed during chlorination of the e peroxone pretreated water than conventional ozonation pretreated 3 2 3 impact of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment on dbp speciation the above results show that overall the formation of thms thaas and dhaas during chlorination can be considerably reduced by pretreatment with conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process further analysis indicates that the reduction of thms thaas and dhaas formation are mainly attributed to a significant decrease of fully chlorinated species tcm tcaa and dcaa respectively in these dbp groups figs 4 and 5 in contrast many brominated species mixed bromochlorinated and fully brominated dbps actually increased because of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment see si figs s2 and s3 consequently bromine incorporation factors bif of thms thaas and dhaas calculated according to eqs 2 4 obolensky and singer 2005 increased significantly after conventional ozonation or the e peroxone pretreatment see fig 9 and si s4 2 bif thms bdcm 2 dbcm 3 tbm tcm bdcm dbcm tbm 3 bif thaas bdcaa 2 dbcaa 3 t b a a tcaa bdcaa dbcaa tbaa 4 bif dhaas bcaa 2 dbaa dcaa bcaa dbaa in general bifs for the different dbp groups thms thaas and dhaas followed similar changing trends as o3 doses were increased during conventional ozonation or the e peroxone pre treatment fig 9 for conventional ozonation bif values increased slightly as the o3 gas concentrations were increased from 2 5 mg l to 3 5 mg l but then decreased considerably with a further increase of o3 concentrations in contrast bif values increased monotonically with o3 concentrations applied during the e peroxone process the shift of dbp formation to more brominated species due to pre ozonation has previously been reported by other researchers de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2008 2013 to account for this change hua and reckhow 2013 suggested that o3 can oxidize some hydrophobic nom e g aromatic rich nom to more hydrophilic nom e g carboxylate rich nom that has higher reactivity with bromine toward the formation of dbps another possible explanation is that due to the abatement of chlorine reactive nom moieties by o3 and or oh oxidation during conventional ozonation or the e peroxone treatment chlorine has higher stability during post chlorination heeb et al 2014 this can lead to an enhanced oxidation br to hobr by hocl eq 5 k 1 55 103 m 1 s 1 which is in competition with the consumption of chlorine by nom moieties during chlorination then the hobr which reacts more effectively with dom moieties than hocl will have a better chance to react with them to form brominated species heeb et al 2014 5 hocl br hobr cl fig 9 shows that bif values kept rising with increasing o3 doses during the e peroxone process which can be attributed to the enhanced oxidizing of chlorine reactive moieties at higher o3 doses in contrast bif went through a maximum at a transferred ozone dose of 5 8 mg l during conventional ozonation this observation can be probably attributed to the fact that 40 60 of br in the synthetic surface water had been transformed to bro3 during conventional ozonation at the higher o3 doses see fig 5a as a result less br remained in the conventional ozonation treated waters to react with chlorine and nom to form brominated dbps during post chlorination indeed a close to linear relationship r2 0 90 can be observed between the br concentrations in the synthetic surface water pretreated by conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process and the overall organic brominated dbps sum of the bromide containing species of thms thaas and dhaas formed during chlorination see si fig s5 the results presented above indicate that br in source waters can be converted to undesired bro3 and brominated organic by products during drinking water treatment mainly in ozone and chlorine based processes respectively overall approximately 60 80 of the spiked br 1 8 μm was transformed to bro3 or organic bromine during the consecutive conventional ozonation and chlorination o3 cl2 treatment see fig 10 ozone doses applied in conventional ozonation have a significant effect on the distribution of bromide derived dbps formed during the o3 cl2 consecutive treatment at low o3 doses 3 6 5 8 mg l o3 bro3 concentrations were much lower than brominated organics in the o3 cl2 treated waters in contrast bro3 dominated the overall bromide derived by products during the o3 cl2 treatment train at high o3 doses 9 4 12 1 mg l o3 the e peroxone process significantly reduce bro3 formation compared to conventional ozonation fig 5 consequently overall less br 47 57 spiked into the synthetic water was transformed to the bromide derived dbps bromate and organic bromine during the consecutive ep cl2 process and brominated organics constituted the predominance of the bromide derived by products figs 8 and s6 3 3 implications for dbp control in drinking water treatment ozone has been widely used as disinfectant and oxidant in drinking water treatment for many years historically ozone is mainly used for disinfection purpose von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however with increasing concerns of micropollutants in drinking water sources and dbps formed during chlorination the application of ozone for the abatement of micropollutants and dbp precursors is gaining increasing attention worldwide von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the electro generation of h2o2 during ozonation the e peroxone process has been shown to be able to enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants and suppress the transformation of bromide to bromate compared to conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 therefore the e peroxone process may provide an attractive option to enhance micropollutant abatement during drinking water treatment especially for source waters with high bromide concentrations however the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process may reduce the disinfection efficiency due to the shorter lifetime of o3 in the latter process von gunten 2003b moreover the results of this study indicate that precursors for cl br dbps are less efficiently abated during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation consequently although both processes can considerably reduce the formation of dbps during post chlorination compared to chlorination of the raw water more dbps thms thaas and dhaas are generally formed during chlorination of waters pretreated by the e peroxone process than those pretreated by conventional ozonation figs 4 and 5 moreover the yields of brominated dbps formed during chlorination are found to be closely related to the concentrations of bromide in water to be chlorinated see si fig s5 consequently the suppression of br transformation to bro3 during the e peroxone pretreatment may lead to higher formation of brominated dbps during subsequent chlorination these effects and strategies to cope with them should be taken into account when incorporating the e peroxone process into water treatment trains for practical applications because nom oxidation by o3 or oh can generate some biodegradable organic carbon bdoc or assimilable organic carbon aoc that may promote bacterial regrowth in distribution systems ozonation is almost always followed by a biological activated carbon bac filtration step in water utilities von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while bac filtration is ineffective at removing bromate it can remove considerable amounts of bdoc that can react with chlorine and bromine to form dbps e g thms and haas during chlorination de vera et al 2016 karnik et al 2005 von gunten 2003b yan et al 2010 notably a recent study by de vera et al 2016 showed that similar to the e peroxone process the addition of h2o2 during ozonation i e conventional peroxone process resulted in considerably higher thm and haa formation during post chlorination as compared to conventional ozonation for example 1 88 μm thms and 1 31 μm haas for conventional ozonation and 2 54 μm thms and 1 89 μm haas for conventional peroxone process with a h2o2 o3 molar ratio of 2 however when the conventional ozonation and peroxone processes were followed by a bac filtration step significantly less thms and haas were formed during post chlorination 1 19 μm thms and 0 71 μm haas for conventional ozonation treated water and 1 40 μm thms and 0 85 μm haas for conventional peroxone treated this observation indicates that biodegradable dbp precursors generated during the conventional peroxone process can be effectively removed by bac filtration these results suggest that the e peroxone process may be combined with bac filtration to control the formation of both bromate and chlorination dbps during water treatment trains which will be evaluated in a further study 4 conclusions both conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process can substantially reduce the formation of thms thaas and dhaas during subsequent chlorination of nom containing water this improvement is mainly attributed to the transformation of dbp precursors e g aromatic nom moieties with high uv absorbance to non dbp forming moieties by reactions with o3 and or oh compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone process is less efficient at reducing chlorination dbp precursors due to the shift of nom oxidation mechanisms from o3 oxidation of specific moieties to a less selective oh oxidation of almost all nom fractions consequently higher dbp concentrations were generally observed during chlorination of the e peroxone pretreated waters than conventional ozonation treated a considerable fraction of bromide can be converted to bromate and organic bromine by products during consecutive conventional ozonation and chlorination treatment the transformation of br to bro3 can be significantly reduced in the e peroxone process therefore overall less bromide in the source water was transformed to bromide derived by products which consisted of essentially brominated organics during the consecutive e peroxone and chlorination treatment because of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment dbps formed during post chlorination shifted to more brominated species the amounts of brominated dbps formed during chlorination correlated with the concentrations of bromide in water

19820,the electro peroxone e peroxone process is an emerging ozone based electrochemical advanced oxidation process that combines conventional ozonation with in situ cathodic hydrogen peroxide h2o2 production for oxidative water treatment in this study the effects of the e peroxone pretreatment on disinfection by product dbp formation from chlorination of a synthetic surface water were investigated and compared to conventional ozonation results show that due to the enhanced transformation of ozone o3 to hydroxyl radicals oh by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process considerably enhanced dissolved organic carbon doc abatement and significantly reduced bromate bro3 formation compared to conventional ozonation however natural organic matter nom with high uv254 absorbance which is the major precursors of chlorination dbps was less efficiently abated during the e peroxone process than conventional ozonation consequently while both conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process substantially reduced the formation of dbps trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids during post chlorination higher dbp concentrations were generally observed during chlorination of the e peroxone pretreated waters than conventional ozonation treated in addition because of conventional ozonation or the e peroxone treatment dbps formed during post chlorination shifted to more brominated species the overall yields of brominated dbps exhibited strong correlations with the bromide concentrations in water therefore while the e peroxone process can effectively suppress bromide transformation to bromate it may lead to higher formation of brominated dbps during post chlorination compared to conventional ozonation these results suggest that the e peroxone process can lead to different dbp formation and speciation during water treatment trains compared to conventional ozonation keywords bromate chlorination disinfection by products electrochemical advanced oxidation process haas thms 1 introduction chlorine has been used as a disinfectant in water treatment for more than 100 years chlorine can inactivate a wide range of waterborne pathogens bacteria and viruses and maintain a residual disinfectant in treated water distribution systems crittenden et al 2012 because of its low cost and easy accessibility chlorine is still the most used disinfectant in drinking water treatment globally rosario ortiz et al 2016 however chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom present in source waters to form harmful halogenated disinfection by products dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 hrudey and charrois 2012 reckhow et al 1990 richardson 2011 sedlak and von gunten 2011 among the known specific chlorination dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two most prevalent groups and regulated in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 one option to reduce the dbp formation during chlorination is to pretreat source waters with ozone o3 many studies have shown that ozonation can destruct a considerable fraction of dbp precursors in natural water and therefore reduce the dbp formation during subsequent chlorination chang et al 2002 de vera et al 2016 gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 2013 mao et al 2014 in addition o3 can effectively inactivate some chlorine resistant protozoa e g cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and oxidize many inorganic and organic contaminants e g iron manganese pesticides and pharmaceuticals that may be present in drinking water sources von gunten 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however o3 decays rapidly in water and therefore is unable to provide long lasting secondary disinfection in distribution systems crittenden et al 2012 rosario ortiz et al 2016 therefore post chlorination is still needed to maintain a disinfection residual in most drinking water distribution systems moreover ozonation of bromide containing water can lead to the formation of bromate bro3 von gunten 2003b von gunten and oliveras 1998 which is an oxidation disinfection by product with a low drinking water standard of 10 μg l in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 to reduce bromate formation we have tested combining conventional ozonation with in situ electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from cathodic oxygen o2 reduction li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 the electro generated h2o2 can accelerate o3 transformation to hydroxyl radicals oh thus lowering the residual concentrations of o3 which is an indispensable reactant in the oh induced bromate formation mechanism von gunten 2003b von gunten and oliveras 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition h2o2 can rapidly reduce hypobromous acid hobr a key intermediate for bromate formation in o3 induced processes back to bromide br thus impeding the formation pathways of bromate von gunten and oliveras 1997 consequently significantly less bromate is formed during the combined ozonation and electrochemical process called as the electro peroxone e peroxone process yuan et al 2013 than during conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 furthermore due to the enhanced transformation of o3 to oh the abatement of ozone resistant contaminants e g methylisoborneol and geosmin can be improved in the e peroxone process lin et al 2016 yao et al 2017 while the e peroxone process can effectively inhibit bromate formation during the treatment of bromide containing water li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 its effects on the dbp formation during subsequent chlorination are still not known the electro generation of h2o2 and its enhancement of o3 transformation to oh shift the mechanisms of nom oxidation from mainly selective oxidation with o3 in conventional ozonation to less selective oxidation with oh in the e peroxone process li et al 2015 unlike o3 which reacts preferentially with organics having conjugated double bonds and activated aromatic systems oh is a less selective oxidant and tends to react fast with almost all types of organics hammes et al 2006 von gunten 2003a wert et al 2007 the different mechanisms of the reactions of nom with o3 and oh can have complex and distinct impacts on dbp formation during post chlorination de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 kleiser and frimmel 2000 in fact contradictory results have been reported when comparing dbp formation during chlorination of waters pretreated by conventional ozonation and the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process in some studies conventional peroxone process results in higher thm formation during post chlorination than for conventional ozonation de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 irabelli et al 2008 mosteo et al 2009 wang et al 2013 in contrast others reported that thm formation was generally comparable within experimental errors for waters pretreated by the two processes while haa formation could either increase or decrease when conventional ozonation was changed to the conventional peroxone process lamsal et al 2011 yang et al 2012 these results suggest that the e peroxone process may result in different dbp formation during water treatment trains compared to conventional ozonation which has yet to be evaluated therefore the main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the e peroxone pretreatment on dbp formation during post chlorination synthetic surface waters were prepared according to typical drinking water quality in china and then treated by consecutive conventional ozonation and chlorination o3 cl2 or consecutive e peroxone and chlorination ep cl2 processes the formation of dbps bromate thms and haas during the two consecutive processes were compared the effects of key operational parameters of the e peroxone process o3 doses and applied currents on dbp

filters merck ireland the stock solution was then stored in the dark at 4 c before it was used to prepare the synthetic water in addition to investigate the role of bromide for the formation of bromate and brominated dbps during ozonation and chlorination the synthetic water was spiked to achieve an initial bromide concentration of 150 μg l all dbp standards e g trichloromethane trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid were purchased from sigma aldrich the other reagents e g cacl2 mgso4 and kbr were of analytical grade and purchased from modern eastern fine chemical beijing china all solutions were prepared with deionized water 2 2 experimental procedure conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment of 500 ml synthetic surface water were conducted in an acrylic column reactor 5 cm inner diameter 25 cm height using a similar experimental setup described previously bakheet et al 2014 o3 was continuously generated from a pure o2 feed gas 99 9 using an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada and then sparged into the reactor using a fine bubble diffuser at a constant flow rate of 240 ml min during both processes the gas phase o3 concentration in the sparged gas o2 o3 mixture can be adjusted by changing the ozone generator power for conventional ozonation treatment only gas sparging was applied no electrodes were installed in the reactor for the e peroxone treatment a pair of electrodes was installed in the reactor the anode was a ruo2 iro2 coated ti plate 3 cm 5 cm 0 2 cm and the cathode was a carbon polytetrafluoroethylene carbon ptfe electrode 3 cm 5 cm 0 2 cm prepared with vulcan xc 72 carbon powder cabot corp usa ptfe dispersion and anhydrous alcohol wang et al 2012 the distance between the electrodes was 0 5 cm the e peroxone process was initiated by simultaneously applying a constant current to electro generate h2o2 at the cathode and sparging ozone containing oxygen gas through the reactor both ozonation and e peroxone treatments were conducted for 20 min duplicates were conducted for each experiment after the treatments 5 min of nitrogen stripping was used to remove the residual o3 in the samples in addition appropriate amount of catalase was added to quench h2o2 residuals after the e peroxone treatment liu et al 2003 an aliquot sample was then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and used for the analysis of bromide bromate uv254 and doc another aliquot of sample was taken for the determination of thm and haa formation according to the uniform formation condition ufc protocol summers et al 1996 in brief samples were firstly buffered to ph 8 using 2 mm borate buffer then chlorinated at 20 1 c for 24 h chlorine doses were determined by preliminary tests to maintain a residual chlorine concentration of 1 0 0 4 mg l after 24 h incubation next the residual chlorine was quenched with a stoichiometric amount of sodium thiosulfate 99 5 and then extracted immediately for dbp analysis to evaluate oh production during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process additional experiments were conducted by adding 0 5 mg l p cba as a oh probe in the synthetic water prior to each oxidative treatment p cba reacts very slowly with o3 k o3 0 1 m 1 s 1 but rapidly with oh k oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 it is therefore oxidized almost exclusively by oh

discussion 3 1 conventional ozonation and e peroxone treatment 3 1 1 abatement of doc and uv254 absorbance the carbon ptfe cathode used in this study had a high activity for converting o2 to h2o2 fig 1 shows that when a pure o2 gas was sparged in the synthetic surface water during electrolysis h2o2 concentration increased almost linearly with reaction time which indicates that h2o2 was stably produced from o2 reduction at the cathode in comparison h2o2 concentration increased at a lower rate when an o2 o3 gas o3 7 4 mg l mixture was sparged during electrolysis i e the e peroxone process these observations suggest that some electro generated h2o2 is then consumed in the ensuing reaction with sparged o3 during the e peroxone process bakheet et al 2013 xia et al 2017 due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by electro generated h2o2 higher transferred o3 doses were obtained during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation under the same gas sparging conditions see si table s2 specifically when an o2 o3 gas mixture with 2 5 7 4 mg l o3 was sparged through the reactor for 20 min the transferred ozone doses were 3 6 12 1 mg l and 5 0 13 8 mg l for conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process with an applied current of 90 ma respectively fig 2 a shows that the spiked oh probe p cba was more rapidly abated during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation when the same o2 o3 gas mixture o3 7 4 mg l was sparged during the two processes this observation can be attributed to the enhancement in o3 mass transfer and its ensuing transformation to oh by the electro generated h2o2 during the e peroxone process xia et al 2017 yao et al 2017 consequently more oh could be produced to accelerate p cba oxidation during the e peroxone process than conventional ozonation under the same gas sparging conditions corresponding to the enhanced oh production doc of the synthetic water decreased more rapidly during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation fig 2b in general the results shown above agree well with the previous findings that the electro generation of h2o2 can enhance the transformation o3 to oh and thus improve the abatement of ozone resistant compounds and solution doc during the e peroxone process li et al 2013 lin et al 2016 wang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 in contrast to doc uv254 absorbance of the synthetic water decreased more slowly during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation fig 2c this result can be probably attributed to the different oxidation mechanisms of dom during the two processes li et al 2015 during conventional ozonation direct oxidation with o3 usually dominates the mechanism of nom oxidation lamsal et al 2011 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in comparison due to the enhanced o3 transformation to oh by h2o2 the mechanism of nom oxidation shifts from o3 oxidation to oh oxidation during the conventional peroxone and the e peroxone process de vera et al 2015 irabelli et al 2008 lamsal et al 2011 li et al 2015 o3 is a selective oxidant and reacts preferentially with olefins and activated aromatic moieties of nom von gunten 2003a which are also the main uv absorbing parts of nom hua et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 wenk et al 2013 therefore conventional ozonation can effectively reduce uv254 hua and reckhow 2013 kleiser and frimmel 2000 lamsal et al 2011 mao et al 2014 however nom oxidation by o3 leads to the formation of a variety of oxygenated by products such as ketones and carboxylic acids that are resistant to further o3 oxidation due to their slow second order rate constants for the reaction with o3 von gunten 2003a wert et al 2007 consequently conventional ozonation is usually ineffective at doc abatement lamsal et al 2011 mao et al 2014 yan et al 2010 in contrast to o3 oh is a less selective oxidant and reacts rapidly with most organic compounds oh does not selectively destruct the uv absorbing moieties of nom but reacts with almost all moieties which leads to a partial mineralization nom kleiser and frimmel 2000 lamsal et al 2011 due to the change of nom oxidation mechanisms as well as the enhanced o3 transfer the e peroxone process considerably accelerated dom mineralization compared to conventional ozonation fig 2b nevertheless less efficient uv254 reduction was achieved by the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation fig 2c the effects of ozone doses on the abatement of doc and uv254 absorbance of the synthetic surface water by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process are compared in fig 3 in general both doc and uv254 decreased progressively with increasing transferred o3 doses during the two processes however different extents of doc and uv254 reduction were obtained by the two processes conventional ozonation abated the doc and uv254 absorbance of the synthetic water by 4 8 and 68 84 respectively in comparison the e peroxone process abated doc and uv254 by 17 39 and 41 77 respectively these observations agree with the previous finding that due to the change in dom oxidation mechanisms the e peroxone process was more effective at dom mineralization but less effective at uv254 abatement than conventional ozonation hua and reckhow 2013 kleiser and frimmel 2000 lamsal et al 2011 mao et al 2014 fig 4 shows the effect of applied current on doc and uv254 abatement by the e peroxone process as the applied current was increased from 0 ma conventional ozonation to 120 ma e peroxone doc decreased considerably this trend can be attributed to the fact that increasing applied current increases the rate of h2o2 electro generation wang et al 2015 as well as ozone transfer fig 4a inset consequently more oh could be produced to enhance dom mineralization at higher applied currents fig 4a however due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition at higher currents the more selective oxidation of uv absorbing moieties by o3 diminishes with increasing currents during the e peroxone process consequently uv254 absorbance increased with increasing the applied currents during the e peroxone process fig 4b due to the different mechanisms of nom oxidation conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process resulted in different changes of the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva i e the ratio of uv254 to doc for the synthetic surface water the suva value of a water has been considered a good surrogate for the aromatic and high molecular nom fractions ates et al 2007 hua et al 2015 for both processes suva decreased with increasing ozone doses fig 3b inset highlighting the importance of o3 for the oxidation uv absorbing nom in contrast increasing applied currents during the e peroxone process resulted in less reduction in the suva values fig 4b inset which can be attributed to the shift of nom oxidation mechanisms from o3 oxidation to oh oxidation at higher applied currents in general suva of the synthetic water decreased less after the e peroxone process than after conventional ozonation suggesting that the fraction of nom with high aromaticity is less efficiently transformed during the e peroxone process 3 1 2 bromate formation the fate of br and bro3 in conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treated waters are compared in fig 5 with a transferred o3 dose of 3 6 mg l no detectable bro3 was identified in the water treated by conventional ozonation however bro3 concentrations then largely exceeded the regulatory limit 10 μg l or 0 078 μm for higher transferred o3 doses this result indicates that increasing o3 doses significantly enhances the transformation of br to bro3 during conventional ozonation in agreement with the general finding of previous studies on ozonation of bromide containing waters li et al 2015 von gunten 2003b wang et al 2013 in contrast to conventional ozonation the transformation of br to bro3 is effectively suppressed during the e peroxone process bro3 formation was only observed when the highest transferred o3 dose 13 8 mg l was applied in the e peroxone process and the formed bro3 0 11 μm or 14 5 μg l was significantly less than the concentrations in conventional ozonation at even lower transferred ozone doses e g 1 11 μm or 141 5 μg l at a transferred o3 dose of 12 1 mg l the reduction in bromate formation can be attributed to a combined result of both the h2o2 induced low o3 residual concentrations and rapid hobr reduction to br during the e peroxone process li et al 2015 von gunten and oliveras 1998 yao et al 2017 fig 5b shows that by increasing applied currents during the e peroxone process bro3 formation decreased progressively this change can be attributed to the acceleration of h2o2 electro generation at higher applied currents which in turn enhances both the o3 decomposition and hobr reduction to br and can thus more effectively suppress the transformation of br to bro3 li et al 2015 von gunten and oliveras 1998 yao et al 2017 the sum of br and bro3 in the conventional ozonation or e peroxone treated waters were generally within 92 101 the relative standard deviations of br and bro3 measurements were approximately 4 of the amount of br 1 8 μm spiked into the synthetic surface water fig 5 this observation indicate that the formation of brominated organic dbps is insignificant during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process brominated organics are primarily formed from the reactions of hobr obr with nom during water treatment hua and reckhow 2008 hua et al 2006 however because hobr obr compete with o3 for similar structures in the nom but are present in much lower concentrations than o3 during ozone based processes the formation of brominated organics is usually negligible in ozone based processes von gunten 2003b von sonntag and von gunten 2012 3 2 dbp formation during post chlorination the results presented above show that doc uv254 and suva of the synthetic surface water were changed to various degrees by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process figs 1 and 2 indicating that nom in the water is oxidized via differing mechanisms during the two processes this may in turn affect the reactions of nom with chlorine toward the formation of dbps during subsequent chlorination de vera et al 2015 kleiser and frimmel 2000 moreover while the e peroxone process effectively suppressed br transformation to bro3 higher br residual concentrations left in the e peroxone pretreated water than those pretreated by conventional ozonation fig 5 during chlorination br can be oxidized by hocl clo to hobr bro which can then react with nom to form brominated dbps heeb et al 2014 hua et al 2006 von gunten 2003b therefore the changes of the br and bro3 distribution due to conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment may influence the extent of dbp formation as well as their speciation during subsequent chlorination 3 2 1 impact of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment on dbp yields to evaluate the effects of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment on formation of dbps during post chlorination two groups of dpbs thms and haas were determined after chlorination of the synthetic surface water without or with pretreatment by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process note that thaas and dhaas are discussed separately in the following sections because they are suggested to form from different precursors and reaction pathways hua et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2013 fig 6 shows that in general less thms thaas and dhaas were formed during post chlorination when the synthetic surface water was pretreated by either conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process for both processes the dbp formation decreased with increasing transferred o3 doses however for an equivalent transferred ozone dose conventional ozonation is more effective at reducing the formation of dbps during post chlorination than the e peroxone process for example with the transferred o3 doses of 3 6 12 1 mg l conventional ozonation reduced thm formation by 16 60 compared to no pre ozonation fig 6a in comparison the e peroxone process reduced thm formation only by 1 30 with the transferred o3 doses of 5 0 13 8 mg l the results observed herein are in line with the findings of many previous studies that pretreatment of natural waters with ozonation or o3 based aops such as uv o3 and o3 h2o2 can reduce dbp formation during post chlorination chin and berube 2005 gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 2013 irabelli et al 2008 lamsal et al 2011 yang et al 2012 this improvement can be mainly attributed to the transformation of dbp precursors to non dbp forming moieties due to reactions with o3 or oh specifically for thms and thaas previous studies have suggested that they are mainly formed from aromatic moieties in the nom thus since o3 is highly reactive with activated aromatic moieties conventional ozonation and o3 based aops usually can effectively reduce thm and thaa precursors in source waters chin and berube 2005 hua et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2013 kleiser and frimmel 2000 reckhow et al 1990 wenk et al 2013 however due to the shift of oxidation mechanisms from selective o3 oxidation of activated aromatic moieties in nom toward less selective oh oxidation of all nom fractions thm and thaa precursors are often less efficiently oxidized during ozone based aops than during conventional ozonation chin and berube 2005 de vera et al 2015 kleiser and frimmel 2000 therefore similar to the results often reported for the conventional peroxone process de vera et al 2015 irabelli et al 2008 mosteo et al 2009 wang et al 2013 higher concentrations of thms and thaas were generally formed during post chlorination of the e peroxone treated waters than conventional ozonation treated fig 6a and b the effects of pre oxidation on dhaa formation are more complicated while o3 and oh oxidation can abate some dhaa precursors oxidation of aromatic moieties by o3 and oh generates many smaller hydrophilic carboxylate rich transformation products e g carboxylic acids and aldehydes that can then react with chlorine or bromine to form dhaas gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2013 due to these two contrary mechanisms it is usually difficult to predict how the pretreatment of ozonation or aops would affect dhaa formation which is often reported to be sample and site specific hua and reckhow 2007 2013 yang et al 2012 fig 6c shows that dhaa formation decreased generally with increasing o3 doses during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process this observation can be possibly attributed to the enhanced abatement of dhaa precursors including those newly formed hydrophilic precursors at higher o3 doses mao et al 2014 compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone treated waters generated more dhaas during chlorination fig 6c this observation suggests that for the synthetic surface water tested in this study the precursors of dhaas are less efficiently reduced during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation fig 7 shows that as the applied currents were increased from 0 ma conventional ozonation to 120 ma e peroxone thm thaa and dhaa formation went through a maximum at 60 ma the increase of dbp formation from 0 ma to 60 ma can be probably attributed to the shift of nom oxidation mechanisms from primarily o3 oxidation to oh oxidation as discussed previously however the reasons for the decreased dbp formation at higher currents 90 120 ma are not very clear one possible explanation is that with increasing applied currents more o3 was transferred into the solution fig 4 inset and then transformed to oh this results in more oxidation power in the system which eventually affected the dbp formation even if it is dominated by oh oxidation 3 2 2 correlations of dbps with doc and suva the results presented above indicate that a pretreatment with either conventional ozonation or the e peroxone can substantially reduce dbp formation during subsequent chlorination fig 8 a shows that there exist no correlations r2 0 00 0 22 between the doc concentrations of the water samples the synthetic surface water and those pretreated by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process and the concentrations of dbps thms thaas and dhaas formed during subsequent chlorination in contrast a general trend r2 0 59 for thms or reasonable correlations r2 0 71 and 0 81 for dhaas and thaas were observed between the dbp formation and the suva values this observation suggests that the reduction of chlorination dbps is mainly caused by the transformation of dbp precursors i e aromatic nom moieties with high uv absorbance to non dbp forming organics rather than by partial mineralization of nom during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment correlations between suva and dbp formation have also been reported in previous studies especially for waters with relatively high doc concentrations 3 mg c l and high suva values 2 3 l mg c m ates et al 2007 hua et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 this correlation can be probably attributed to the fact that uv absorbing compounds and aromatic nom moieties are also often the primary sites of chlorine and bromine attack during chlorination heeb et al 2014 reckhow et al 1990 von gunten 2003b due to the different mechanisms of nom oxidation by o3 and oh suva was less efficiently reduced by the e peroxone process than by conventional ozonation fig 3b inset which suggests that dbp precursors are less effectively abated during the e peroxone process consequently more dbps were generally formed during chlorination of the e peroxone pretreated water than conventional ozonation pretreated 3 2 3 impact of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment on dbp speciation the above results show that overall the formation of thms thaas and dhaas during chlorination can be considerably reduced by pretreatment with conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process further analysis indicates that the reduction of thms thaas and dhaas formation are mainly attributed to a significant decrease of fully chlorinated species tcm tcaa and dcaa respectively in these dbp groups figs 4 and 5 in contrast many brominated species mixed bromochlorinated and fully brominated dbps actually increased because of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment see si figs s2 and s3 consequently bromine incorporation factors bif of thms thaas and dhaas calculated according to eqs 2 4 obolensky and singer 2005 increased significantly after conventional ozonation or the e peroxone pretreatment see fig 9 and si s4 2 bif thms bdcm 2 dbcm 3 tbm tcm bdcm dbcm tbm 3 bif thaas bdcaa 2 dbcaa 3 t b a a tcaa bdcaa dbcaa tbaa 4 bif dhaas bcaa 2 dbaa dcaa bcaa dbaa in general bifs for the different dbp groups thms thaas and dhaas followed similar changing trends as o3 doses were increased during conventional ozonation or the e peroxone pre treatment fig 9 for conventional ozonation bif values increased slightly as the o3 gas concentrations were increased from 2 5 mg l to 3 5 mg l but then decreased considerably with a further increase of o3 concentrations in contrast bif values increased monotonically with o3 concentrations applied during the e peroxone process the shift of dbp formation to more brominated species due to pre ozonation has previously been reported by other researchers de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2008 2013 to account for this change hua and reckhow 2013 suggested that o3 can oxidize some hydrophobic nom e g aromatic rich nom to more hydrophilic nom e g carboxylate rich nom that has higher reactivity with bromine toward the formation of dbps another possible explanation is that due to the abatement of chlorine reactive nom moieties by o3 and or oh oxidation during conventional ozonation or the e peroxone treatment chlorine has higher stability during post chlorination heeb et al 2014 this can lead to an enhanced oxidation br to hobr by hocl eq 5 k 1 55 103 m 1 s 1 which is in competition with the consumption of chlorine by nom moieties during chlorination then the hobr which reacts more effectively with dom moieties than hocl will have a better chance to react with them to form brominated species heeb et al 2014 5 hocl br hobr cl fig 9 shows that bif values kept rising with increasing o3 doses during the e peroxone process which can be attributed to the enhanced oxidizing of chlorine reactive moieties at higher o3 doses in contrast bif went through a maximum at a transferred ozone dose of 5 8 mg l during conventional ozonation this observation can be probably attributed to the fact that 40 60 of br in the synthetic surface water had been transformed to bro3 during conventional ozonation at the higher o3 doses see fig 5a as a result less br remained in the conventional ozonation treated waters to react with chlorine and nom to form brominated dbps during post chlorination indeed a close to linear relationship r2 0 90 can be observed between the br concentrations in the synthetic surface water pretreated by conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process and the overall organic brominated dbps sum of the bromide containing species of thms thaas and dhaas formed during chlorination see si fig s5 the results presented above indicate that br in source waters can be converted to undesired bro3 and brominated organic by products during drinking water treatment mainly in ozone and chlorine based processes respectively overall approximately 60 80 of the spiked br 1 8 μm was transformed to bro3 or organic bromine during the consecutive conventional ozonation and chlorination o3 cl2 treatment see fig 10 ozone doses applied in conventional ozonation have a significant effect on the distribution of bromide derived dbps formed during the o3 cl2 consecutive treatment at low o3 doses 3 6 5 8 mg l o3 bro3 concentrations were much lower than brominated organics in the o3 cl2 treated waters in contrast bro3 dominated the overall bromide derived by products during the o3 cl2 treatment train at high o3 doses 9 4 12 1 mg l o3 the e peroxone process significantly reduce bro3 formation compared to conventional ozonation fig 5 consequently overall less br 47 57 spiked into the synthetic water was transformed to the bromide derived dbps bromate and organic bromine during the consecutive ep cl2 process and brominated organics constituted the predominance of the bromide derived by products figs 8 and s6 3 3 implications for dbp control in drinking water treatment ozone has been widely used as disinfectant and oxidant in drinking water treatment for many years historically ozone is mainly used for disinfection purpose von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however with increasing concerns of micropollutants in drinking water sources and dbps formed during chlorination the application of ozone for the abatement of micropollutants and dbp precursors is gaining increasing attention worldwide von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the electro generation of h2o2 during ozonation the e peroxone process has been shown to be able to enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants and suppress the transformation of bromide to bromate compared to conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 therefore the e peroxone process may provide an attractive option to enhance micropollutant abatement during drinking water treatment especially for source waters with high bromide concentrations however the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process may reduce the disinfection efficiency due to the shorter lifetime of o3 in the latter process von gunten 2003b moreover the results of this study indicate that precursors for cl br dbps are less efficiently abated during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation consequently although both processes can considerably reduce the formation of dbps during post chlorination compared to chlorination of the raw water more dbps thms thaas and dhaas are generally formed during chlorination of waters pretreated by the e peroxone process than those pretreated by conventional ozonation figs 4 and 5 moreover the yields of brominated dbps formed during chlorination are found to be closely related to the concentrations of bromide in water to be chlorinated see si fig s5 consequently the suppression of br transformation to bro3 during the e peroxone pretreatment may lead to higher formation of brominated dbps during subsequent chlorination these effects and strategies to cope with them should be taken into account when incorporating the e peroxone process into water treatment trains for practical applications because nom oxidation by o3 or oh can generate some biodegradable organic carbon bdoc or assimilable organic carbon aoc that may promote bacterial regrowth in distribution systems ozonation is almost always followed by a biological activated carbon bac filtration step in water utilities von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while bac filtration is ineffective at removing bromate it can remove considerable amounts of bdoc that can react with chlorine and bromine to form dbps e g thms and haas during chlorination de vera et al 2016 karnik et al 2005 von gunten 2003b yan et al 2010 notably a recent study by de vera et al 2016 showed that similar to the e peroxone process the addition of h2o2 during ozonation i e conventional peroxone process resulted in considerably higher thm and haa formation during post chlorination as compared to conventional ozonation for example 1 88 μm thms and 1 31 μm haas for conventional ozonation and 2 54 μm thms and 1 89 μm haas for conventional peroxone process with a h2o2 o3 molar ratio of 2 however when the conventional ozonation and peroxone processes were followed by a bac filtration step significantly less thms and haas were formed during post chlorination 1 19 μm thms and 0 71 μm haas for conventional ozonation treated water and 1 40 μm thms and 0 85 μm haas for conventional peroxone treated this observation indicates that biodegradable dbp precursors generated during the conventional peroxone process can be effectively removed by bac filtration these results suggest that the e peroxone process may be combined with bac filtration to control the formation of both bromate and chlorination dbps during water treatment trains which will be evaluated in a further study 4 conclusions both conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process can substantially reduce the formation of thms thaas and dhaas during subsequent chlorination of nom containing water this improvement is mainly attributed to the transformation of dbp precursors e g aromatic nom moieties with high uv absorbance to non dbp forming moieties by reactions with o3 and or oh compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone process is less efficient at reducing chlorination dbp precursors due to the shift of nom oxidation mechanisms from o3 oxidation of specific moieties to a less selective oh oxidation of almost all nom fractions consequently higher dbp concentrations were generally observed during chlorination of the e peroxone pretreated waters than conventional ozonation treated a considerable fraction of bromide can be converted to bromate and organic bromine by products during consecutive conventional ozonation and chlorination treatment the transformation of br to bro3 can be significantly reduced in the e peroxone process therefore overall less bromide in the source water was transformed to bromide derived by products which consisted of essentially brominated organics during the consecutive e peroxone and chlorination treatment because of conventional ozonation and the e peroxone pretreatment dbps formed during post chlorination shifted to more brominated species the amounts of brominated dbps formed during chlorination correlated with the concentrations of bromide in water

19821,simultaneous recovery of calcium phosphate granules cap granules and methane from vacuum collected black water bw using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor was previously investigated it was calculated that only 2 of the total phosphorus p fed was present as cap granules whereas 51 of the p accumulated dispersed in the reactor limiting the applicability of this process for recovery of phosphate this study proposes adding calcium to increase the p accumulation in the reactor and the production of cap granules calcium was added in a lab scale uasb reactor fed with bw an identical uasb reactor was used as reference to which no calcium was added the treatment performance was evaluated by weekly monitoring of influent effluent and produced biogas sludge bed development and cap granulation were assessed through particle size analysis the composition and structure of cap granules were chemically and optically assessed calcium addition increased

keywords phosphate recovery calcium phosphate anaerobic treatment black water uasb reactor 1 introduction recovery of phosphate from wastewater is crucial for the sustainable use of resources cordell et al 2011 european regulation requires removal of phosphorus p from wastewater schröder et al 2010 due to the severe environmental impact of p discharge in natural water courses jarvie et al 2006 on the other hand the processing and extraction costs of natural phosphate rock p rock which is the present main source of p are significantly increasing due to the decrease in ore quality and its geographic distribution aydin et al 2010 koppelaar and weikard 2013 thus the need to remove p from wastewater and the increasing concerns about the future availability of p have lead many researchers to focus on developing processes to recover phosphate from wastewater streams by vacuum collection of source separated black water bw which uses 1 l of water per toilet flush concentrations of total p

as the start up and adaptation period of the sludge inoculum about once a month sludge was removed to keep the sludge bed volume approximately at 70 3 5 l of the total working volume of the reactor during the first 150 days of phase 1 the concentration of ca2 addition increased gradually every 50 days by steps of 100 mg l 1 bw starting from 250 mg l 1 bw after 150 days the addition of ca2 decreased to 200 mg l 1 bw until phase 2 350 days in order to decrease the saturation of ca2 in the reactor phase 2 lasted from day 350 to 460 during phase 2 the dosed ca2 loading in r2 was gradually

concentration of cap granules particles 0 4 mm diameter in the sludge bed at the end of phase 1 350 days increased from 29 r1 to 46 r2 gtss kg 1sludge representing 63 and 81 of the total concentration of solids respectively fig 4 then both the concentration of total solids and cap granules remained stable for r2 during phase 2 while a decrease in the total sludge concentration was observed in r1 in this phase a more frequent sampling was conducted which made it unnecessary to purge sludge from the top of the sludge bed for both reactors the detailed overview of the particle size distribution of the sludge bed of r1 and r2 for each of the sampling days is in appendix f the discharge rate production of total solids in r2 1 075 0 179 gtss d 1 and 0 131 gtss g 1codinfluent was higher than in r1 0 691 0 078 gtss d 1 and 0 102 gtss g 1codinfluent but the discharge rate of vss was similar in both reactors 0 074 and 0 083 gvss g 1codinfluent for r1 and r2 respectively fig 5 a and b the calculated vss yield was 0 087 and 0 085 gvss g 1codinfluent for r1 and r2 respectively representing a deviation of 15 and 3 for r1 and r2 respectively when compared with the measured vss production dash line fig 5a and b the average concentration of total solids inside the reactor during phase 2 was 34 1 and 39 3 gtss l 1reactor for r1 and r2 respectively the major difference between r1 and r2 was the ash concentration in the discharged sludge 0 184 0 135 and 0 395 0 271 gash d 1 respectively a two fold increase in the ash discharge rate was observed by adding ca2 in r2 moreover the ash discharged rate in both r1 and r2 was proportional to the mass sum of p ca and mg accumulated in the reactor solid line fig 5a and b during phase 2 the cumulative rates were calculated from the cumulative difference between influent and effluent p ca and mg concentrations n 28 the sum of accumulated p ca and mg was 0 03 and 0 07 g l 1reactor d 1 for r1 and r2 respectively the vss ash and p concentrations as cap granules particles 0 4 mm diameter over the height of both reactors is presented in fig 5c and d the standard deviation was determined for averages of samples taken on days 350 425 436 and 460 thus for r1 without ca2 addition both the concentration 27 3 gtss kg 1sludge and composition 20 2 gvss kg 1sludge 8 1 gash kg 1sludge and 1 0 0 2 gp kg 1sludge of cap granules were relatively constant along the reactor height by adding ca2 r2 an increase in concentration of cap granules from top 22 1 gtss kg 1sludge to bottom 75 5 gtss kg 1sludge was observed moreover the ratio ash vss in cap granules increased from top 0 4 0 2 to bottom 1 2 0 4 of the sludge bed along with the p concentration as cap granules fig 5d 3 4 composition and structure of calcium phosphate granules ca2 addition resulted in overall higher p content in the granules fig 6 this is observed in the lower part of the reactor heights 5 10 and 20 cm and not at the top the p content of particles 0 4 mm diameter from the reactor with ca2 addition r2 was lower than particles with the same size range from r1 the highest p content was observed for granules with diameter between 2 and 2 5 mm in r2 located at 5 cm from the bottom 82 10 mgp g 1tss during phase 2 the ca p molar ratio in cap granules was 1 14 0 14 for reactor r1 and for reactor r2 it increases during phase 2 from 1 68 0 11 on day 350 to 2 04 0 06 on day 460 the p enrichment was associated with a decrease in vss content for all size fractions in r2 fig 6e sem and sem edx images of sliced granules from r1 and r2 are shown in fig 7 cax po4 y precipitation in the granules which is represented by green overlay between cyan ca and yellow p in the edx images was enhanced by ca2 addition besides cax po4 y mg phosphate precipitates were also found in granules from r1 but not in r2 4 discussion 4 1 effect of ca2 on treatment performance and p removal ca2 addition has shown to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on biological anaerobic treatment of wastewater anaerobic treatment of swine wastewater in an egg shape digester fresh leachate from municipal wastewater in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor and synthetic wastewater mixture of peptone glucose and meat extract in a uasb reactor was inhibited for values of ca2 to codtotal above 0 04 0 07 and 0 15 g g 1 respectively ahn et al 2006 dang et al 2014 yu et al 2001 formation of inorganic particles caco3 and consequent increase in mass transfer limitations between substrates and microorganisms caused the inhibition dang et al 2014 yu et al 2001 yet for lower ratios of ca2 to codtotal ca2 showed a beneficial effect on the anaerobic treatment performance this was mainly due to two factors one was neutralization of inhibitory effect of for instance long chain fatty acids lcfa in the liquid by precipitation of lcfa ca salts and thereby increasing affinity to other organic substrates such as propionate and valerate ahn et al 2006 dang et al 2014 the other was increasing retention of sludge in the reactor by enhancing microbial granulation mechanisms such as adsorption adhesion and multiplication due to the capacity of ca2 to bridge with electronegative functional groups characteristic of the outer surface of microorganisms cao et al 2014 shen et al 1993 yu et al 2001 although ca2 was added in r2 0 043 0 016 g ca2 g 1codtotal no significant inhibition was observed after the process stabilization phase 2 because cod removal and ch4 production were nearly equal in both reactors moreover the measured vss yield was similar for both reactors fig 5a and b indicating that biomass growth was comparable with and without ca2 addition thus addition of extra ca2 in r2 as described in fig 2 did not affect the bw treatment without ca2 addition r1 the po4 3 removal was largely influenced by the ca2 concentration in the influent bw according to geochemical modelling in bw a change in ca2 from 40 to 50 mg l 1 triggers supersaturation for amorphous calcium phosphate acp which is a precursor of apatite the more stable cax po4 y phase the si for acp increased from 0 258 to 0 257 acp has kinetical advantage to form over apatite due to the higher solubility product constant ksp ksp values for acp and apatite considered in this study are 5 6 10 29 and 4 7 10 45 respectively visual minteq supersaturation for octacalcium phosphate ocp which is an intermediate phase between acp and apatite habraken et al 2013 was also triggered by the increase in ca2 si rose from 0 568 to 0 118 since cax po4 y precursors are undersaturated for ca2 concentrations in the influent bw below 50 mg l 1 fig 3a hydrolysed organic p is not precipitated and leaves the reactor in the effluent this explains the negative removal of po4 3 and confirms that ca2 in bw is limiting the p accumulation in the reactor by adding ca2 the po4 3 removal further increases up to 89 accumulation of non hydrolysable solid p was nearly complete even without ca2 addition this is mostly due to the capacity for retention of solids in the gas liquid solid separator gls on top of the uasb reactor fig 1 the possible mineral phases for p in the uasb reactor considering the chemical composition of the influent bw are mgnh4po4 struvite and cax po4 y graaff et al 2011 tervahauta et al 2014 moreover the theoretical ca p molar ratio of cax po4 y phases ranges between 1 1 and 1 67 where the highest is for apatite habraken et al 2013 thus considering the ca p molar ratio of p and ca retained in the reactor without ca2 addition 0 78 p accumulated as both struvite and cax po4 y the increased supersaturation of cax po4 y phases led to the dissolution of struvite in r2 this is supported by the higher concentration of soluble mg mg2 in r2 effluent 37 13 mg l 1 compared to r1 effluent 13 3 mg l 1 the higher mg content in cap granules from r1 than from r2 and xrd analysis appendix b on particles from r1 where struvite was identified for values of influent ca2 between 144 and 350 mg l 1 p and ca accumulated mainly as cax po4 y in r2 fig 3c for higher influent ca2 concentrations from 350 to 460 mg l 1 the ca p molar ratio of p and ca retained in the reactor 3 01 exceed the reference 1 67 and the po4 3 removal was not significantly higher when compared with lower influent ca2 concentrations as shown in fig 3a this suggests that added ca2 likely co precipitated as caco3 langerak et al 1998 and complexed with microorganisms extracellular polymeric substances eps and humic acids due to their negatively charged functional groups jia et al 1993 liao et al 2001 morgan et al 1990 wilén et al 2003 the concentration of humic acids in r2 effluent 47 8 9 6 mgc l 1 was on average lower than in r1 effluent 59 5 5 5 mgc l 1 indicating complexation of ca2 with humic acids note that in the influent bw the concentration of humic acids was 88 3 5 7 mgc l 1 therefore addition of ca2 above 250 mg l 1 total of 300 mgca2 l 1 in the reactor or a ca2 po4 3 molar ratio higher than 5 is not contributing to further p accumulation after the process stabilization but rather inducing undesired ca2 bonds such co precipitation of caco3 4 2 effect of ca2 on the particle size distribution and composition particle size composition and distribution in the sludge bed are crucial features for further improvement of harvesting separation and use of cap granules granulation is commonly observed when shear force which is induced by the generally applied upflow velocity in uasb reactors 1 3 m h 1 creates a selection pressure in the microbial community causing preferable retention of microbial aggregates over suspended biomass hulshoff pol et al 2004 liu and tay 2004 zhou et al 2006 however for bw treatment this selection pressure is reduced due to the low upflow velocity in the uasb reactor 0 01 m h 1 which is required to ensure the disintegration hydrolysis of solid cod in bw according to hulshoff pol et al 2004 microorganisms have ecological advantages when attached to a surface such as stability protection against toxic compounds kinetic advantage for uptake of substrates and facilitation of syntrophic relationships between microorganisms hulshoff pol et al 2004 schmidt and ahring 1996 yoda et al 1989 thus the microbial colonization on seed particles e g caco3 acp or ocp which can act as a nucleus and the consequent development of an outer biofilm is likely the initiation mechanism for cap granulation the higher p content in particles 0 4 mm diameter 38 8 and 31 9 mgp g 1vss for r1 and r2 respectively when compared to common anaerobic biomass 10 14 mgp g 1vss supports the presence of particles containing p in the bulk which could serve as initial seeds arne alphenaar et al 1993 langerak et al 1998 then due to local favorable conditions higher ph cax po4 y prevails grows and recrystallizes to more stable phases in the granule core as previously suggested by cunha et al 2017 and mañas et al 2012a b the higher ph is probably induced by degradation of organic acids and conversion of h2 h and hco3 into ch4 in the outer biofilm the reduction of p content in fine particles 0 4 mm diameter from r2 fig 6a is the result of ca2 addition which stimulated formation and enrichment of cax po4 y in existing granules over bulk precipitation supplementation of ca2 increased the overall concentration of cap granules 0 4 mm diameter in the uasb reactor the role of ca2 on the formation of cap granules consisted of increasing the concentration of seed particles that served as initial nuclei for cap granulation and stimulating the agglomeration of biomass the latter was due to bridging between extracellular proteins developing an organic matrix which plays a key role in strengthening the granular structure batstone et al 2002 caudan et al 2014 ismail et al 2010 ren et al 2008 the measured and theoretical vss production was similar in both reactors fig 5 but a larger fraction of the produced vss were in cap granules for the reactor where ca2 was added 69 when compared with no ca2 addition 56 this supports the beneficial effect of ca2 on biomass agglomeration which contributes to the formation and growth of cap granules regarding the core ca2 directly participates in the formation of cax po4 y precipitates and growth of the existing cax po4 y core by supplying ca2 the cax po4 y enrichment in cap granules correlated with the granule size and it decreased from bottom to top of the sludge bed figs 5 and 6 yet for granules 2 5 mm diameter the p content was lower than granules between 0 9 and 2 5 fig 6 this is most likely caused by the fast growth of the outer biofilm resulting in a large granule with high vss and low p contents then along with cax po4 y core maturation recrystallization of amorphous phases into more stable cax po4 y phases and agglomeration of cax po4 y crystals occur mañas et al 2012a b leading to a reduction in the pore size distribution compactness habraken et al 2013 consequently less mineral surface is available for the outer biofilm and the biological activity in the granules is pushed towards the edge of the granule developing an outer layer 50 100 μm thick as shown in fig 7 then due to the higher density of the cax po4 y core and consequent higher settling velocity when compared with organic material mature cap granules settled at the bottom of the reactor which is in this study the recommended harvesting location at the bottom of r2 with ca2 addition cap granules contained 6 7 1 2 wt p 36 wt as apatite with a ca p molar ratio of 1 68 which is close to the typical ratio of apatite moreover the mg content in cap granules was below 0 5 wt indicating low levels of struvite and mgco3 however the outer biofilm vss of cap granules represented 47 3 wt at the bottom which could limit the use of cap granules as replacement for p rock the remaining mass 17 wt consisted of ash from the vss caco3 and other trace elements when a post separation concentration step using for instance flotation and or vibrating sieves would be applied the organic fraction vss in the cap granules could be reduced due to the density difference between the cax po4 y core and the outer biofilm this would increase p content and reduce the organic proportion in the recovered product 4 3 recovery of calcium phosphate granules and outlook for process optimization the p recovery as cap granules 0 4 mm diameter was 31 with ca2 addition and 14 without ca2 addition considering the granules sampled during phase 2 and the total incoming p in bw of the total p sampled 94 and 72 was in cap granules with and without ca2 addition respectively for both r1 and r2 the production of cap granules was considerably higher than previously observed by tervahauta et al 2014 who reported only 2 of the p as granules the higher p recovery efficiency in r1 when compared with tervahauta et al 2014 is explained by the higher accumulation of p in the reactor 68 versus 51 this can be explained by a reduction in hco3 concentration in bw during this study from 3 6 tervahauta et al 2014 to 1 7 g l 1 decreasing the si of caco3 and increasing the si of cax po4 y phases by increasing the ionic activity of ca2 cunha et al 2017 the higher accumulation of p stimulated the formation of cap granules and p enrichment in the granules leading to a higher recovery efficiency by supplying ca2 the p accumulation further increases to 89 and thereby the recovery of p as cap granules however the aforementioned recovery is largely underestimated because cap granules were also taken from the upper part of the sludge bed where cap granules are not fully mature and the p content is lower moreover issues with the design of the uasb reactor led to scaling of a substantial amount of p at the inlet system and bottom of both reactors observed where sampling was not possible thus in order to decrease the loss of p by non recoverable scaling and to enhance cap granulation incoming p needs to be efficiently mixed in the sludge bed this will stimulate cap granulation due to the higher contact time between p added ca2 inorganic particles and microorganisms consequently the microbial colonization of these particles is intensified leading to the faster development of cap granules improved reactor design and scale can overcome these issues and in that case the recovery potential can increase up to 334 gp person 1 year 1 producing simultaneously 4 38 m3ch4 person 1 year 1 in a single reactor for use of cap granules in agriculture or industry a compositional characterization of the final product should be performed to evaluate actual feasibility safeness and bioavailability nevertheless tervahauta et al 2014 measured the heavy metals content in cap granules and found that the levels were lower when compared to sewage sludge and bio p sludge and comparable to p rock furthermore gell et al 2011 observed that pathogens in struvite produced from bw where below dutch regulatory levels and butkovskyi et al 2017 assessed the concentration of organic micropollutants in excess sludge from a uasb reactor treating source separated bw and because of the low values the authors recommended its use as soil amendment based on these preliminary insights cap granules produced during anaerobic treatment of bw are a promising solution as p recovered product but further process optimization is required to improve p recovery efficiency 5 conclusions ca2 added during the treatment of source separated bw in a uasb reactor r2 increased accumulation of p and stimulated formation and growth of cap granules without affecting the treatment performance in both reactors total cod removal was above 80 and methanization rate was on average 0 47 0 19 gcod ch4 g 1codtotal bw according to po4 3 removal and ca p molar ratio of retained ca and p addition of 250 mgca2 l 1 of bw was found to be the optimum cap granulation was enhanced by ca2 addition the percentage of particles 0 4 mm diameter cap granules in the sludge bed increased from 63 in r1 to 81 in r2 after 350 days of operation moreover cap granules from r2 contained 56 15 gp g 1tss while granules from r1 contained only 37 3 gp g 1tss the p recovery efficiency was 2 2 times higher in r2 31 than in r1 14 however the recovery efficiency was hindered by p scaling at the bottom of both the reactors and retention of solids containing p in the inlet systems considering the total p in the sludge taken from the sludge bed and in the effluent the p recovery as cap granules increases to 68 in r2 and 29 in r1 acknowledgments the authors thank joana neiva and the institute s technical and analytical teams for their contribution in

19821,simultaneous recovery of calcium phosphate granules cap granules and methane from vacuum collected black water bw using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor was previously investigated it was calculated that only 2 of the total phosphorus p fed was present as cap granules whereas 51 of the p accumulated dispersed in the reactor limiting the applicability of this process for recovery of phosphate this study proposes adding calcium to increase the p accumulation in the reactor and the production of cap granules calcium was added in a lab scale uasb reactor fed with bw an identical uasb reactor was used as reference to which no calcium was added the treatment performance was evaluated by weekly monitoring of influent effluent and produced biogas sludge bed development and cap granulation were assessed through particle size analysis the composition and structure of cap granules were chemically and optically assessed calcium addition increased accumulation of p in the reactor and formation and growth of granules with size 0 4 mm diameter cap granules moreover with calcium addition cap granules contained 5 6 1 5 wt of p while without calcium a lower p content was observed 3 7 0 3 wt by adding ca 89 of the incoming p from bw accumulated in the reactor and 31 was sampled as cap granules 0 4 mm diameter addition of 250 mgca l 1 of bw was the optimum loading found in this study furthermore no significant reduction in codtotal removal 80 and ch4 production 0 47 0 10 gcod ch4 g 1codtotal bw was observed therefore adding calcium can significantly increase the cap granulation without inhibiting the simultaneous ch4 recovery this further indicates the potential of this process for phosphate recovery graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphate recovery calcium phosphate anaerobic treatment black water uasb reactor 1 introduction recovery of phosphate from wastewater is crucial for the sustainable use of resources cordell et al 2011 european regulation requires removal of phosphorus p from wastewater schröder et al 2010 due to the severe environmental impact of p discharge in natural water courses jarvie et al 2006 on the other hand the processing and extraction costs of natural phosphate rock p rock which is the present main source of p are significantly increasing due to the decrease in ore quality and its geographic distribution aydin et al 2010 koppelaar and weikard 2013 thus the need to remove p from wastewater and the increasing concerns about the future availability of p have lead many researchers to focus on developing processes to recover phosphate from wastewater streams by vacuum collection of source separated black water bw which uses 1 l of water per toilet flush concentrations of total p ranging from 0 15 up to 0 22 gp l 1 of bw are obtained graaff et al 2011 measurements show that in the netherlands up to 480 gp person 1 year 1 could potentially be recovered considering a bw production of 6 l person 1 day 1 kujawa roeleveld and zeeman 2006 tervahauta et al 2013 if this number is extrapolated for the global population the phosphate recovery from bw would represent up to 14

full scale since 2006 in sneek the netherlands graaf and hell 2014 at 25 c and hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 days 54 of the chemical oxygen demand cod in bw is effectively converted into methane ch4 and 61 of the total incoming p leaves the reactor in the effluent mostly as soluble phosphate po4 3 graaff et al 2010 a new process for simultaneous recovery of calcium phosphate granules cap granules and ch4 in a uasb reactor treating bw was proposed by tervahauta et al 2014 this proposal was based on observed calcium phosphate granulation cap granulation which started after an increase in soluble calcium ca2 in bw triggering the formation of seed particles that served as initial nuclei for microbial colonization and calcium phosphate cax po4 y precipitation tervahauta et al 2014 as a result the accumulation of p in the uasb reactor increased from 39 to 51 graaff et al 2011 tervahauta et al 2014 however only 2 of the total incoming p from bw was present as cap granules after 988 days tervahauta et al 2014 limiting the applicability of combined recovery of cap granules and ch4 from bw previous research has shown that ca2 addition in the effluent of a uasb reactor treating bw increased p precipitation cunha et al 2017 therefore this study proposes adding ca2 directly in the uasb reactor to increase both the accumulation of p in the reactor and the production of cap granules without significantly affecting the conversion of cod into ch4 this was experimentally investigated by running two identical lab scale uasb reactors fed with bw under similar operational conditions except for the ca2 loading 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experimental setup consisted of two identical glass uasb reactors 5 1 l fed with bw as shown in fig 1 bw was collected from a neighborhood equipped with vacuum toilets in sneek the netherlands and stored at 7 c prior use graaff et al 2010 the inoculum 2 l was taken from the uasb reactor described in graaf and hell 2014 and sieved before inoculation to remove particles larger 0 4 mm diameter both reactors were operated for 460 days reactor r1 served as a control while reactor r2 was dosed with cacl2 2h2o to test the influence of ca2 addition p accumulation and extent of cap granulation the overall operational period was divided in two phases phase 1 lasted from day 0 to 350 and it was considered as the start up and adaptation period of the sludge inoculum about once a month sludge was removed to keep the sludge bed volume approximately at 70 3 5 l of the total working volume of the reactor during the first 150 days of phase 1 the concentration of ca2 addition increased gradually every 50 days by steps of 100 mg l 1 bw starting from 250 mg l 1 bw after 150 days the addition of ca2 decreased to 200 mg l 1 bw until phase 2 350 days in order to decrease the saturation of ca2 in the reactor phase 2 lasted from day 350 to 460 during phase 2 the dosed ca2 loading in r2 was gradually increased once more from 150 mg l 1 bw on day 350 to 200 250 300 and 400 mg l 1 bw on day 370 390 420 and 440 respectively sludge bed sampling during phase 2 was performed on days 350 415 436 and 460

compared with the sum of total accumulated ca p and mg during the period between days 350 and 460 g d 1 this accumulation was calculated from the difference between weekly determined influent bw and effluent concentrations of total p ca and mg for each reactor the p recovery efficiency as cap granules particles 0 4 mm diameter was calculated by dividing the total mass of p in cap granules harvested from the reactor and the total incoming p from bw during phase 2 the total mass of p harvested as cap granules p r e c o v e r e d mgp was calculated according to eq 4 for each of the

longer than the obtained srt for both reactors and the srt became shorter during phase 2 however in both phases the srt was higher in r2 than in r1 table 1 3 2 phosphorus removal the removal of total 176 66 mgp l 1 and soluble p 50 17 mgpo4 3 p l 1 from bw was significantly enhanced by adding ca2 fig 3 without ca2 addition r1 the removal of total p was 68 10 and the removal of soluble p fluctuated with the ca2 concentration in the influent fig 3a for values of soluble ca2 below 40 mg l 1 the po4 3 concentration increased in the effluent during the treatment the effluent concentration of po4 3 in r1 was 46 13 mgpo4 3 p l 1 the increase of ca2 from 144 21 to 460 13 mg l 1 increased po4 3 removal from 74 9 to 89 2 the removal of total p in r2 was 89 5 during the entire operational period fig 3a based on the difference between influent and effluent ca and p concentrations in r1 and r2 the ca p molar ratio of the ca and p retained in the reactors is calculated and correlated with the influent ca2 concentration fig 3c for r1 the retained ca p molar ratio was 0 78 0 17 at a ca2 concentration in bw of 52 10 mg l 1 while in r2 this ratio increases with the increase of the ca2 concentration to 1 19 0 06 at 144 21 mgca2 l 1 bw and further to 3 01 0 21 at 460 13 mgca2 l 1 bw 3 3 particle size distribution of the sludge bed and discharge of solids over time by adding ca2 the concentration of cap granules particles 0 4 mm diameter in the sludge bed at the end of phase 1 350 days increased from 29 r1 to 46 r2 gtss kg 1sludge representing 63 and 81 of the total concentration of solids respectively fig 4 then both the concentration of total solids and cap granules remained stable for r2 during phase 2 while a decrease in the total sludge concentration was observed in r1 in this phase a more frequent sampling was conducted which made it unnecessary to purge sludge from the top of the sludge bed for both reactors the detailed overview of the particle size distribution of the sludge bed of r1 and r2 for each of the sampling days is in appendix f the discharge rate production of total solids in r2 1 075 0 179 gtss d 1 and 0 131 gtss g 1codinfluent was higher than in r1 0 691 0 078 gtss d 1 and 0 102 gtss g 1codinfluent but the discharge rate of vss was similar in both reactors 0 074 and 0 083 gvss g 1codinfluent for r1 and r2 respectively fig 5 a and b the calculated vss yield was 0 087 and 0 085 gvss g 1codinfluent for r1 and r2 respectively representing a deviation of 15 and 3 for r1 and r2 respectively when compared with the measured vss production dash line fig 5a and b the average concentration of total solids inside the reactor during phase 2 was 34 1 and 39 3 gtss l 1reactor for r1 and r2 respectively the major difference between r1 and r2 was the ash concentration in the discharged sludge 0 184 0 135 and 0 395 0 271 gash d 1 respectively a two fold increase in the ash discharge rate was observed by adding ca2 in r2 moreover the ash discharged rate in both r1 and r2 was proportional to the mass sum of p ca and mg accumulated in the reactor solid line fig 5a and b during phase 2 the cumulative rates were calculated from the cumulative difference between influent and effluent p ca and mg concentrations n 28 the sum of accumulated p ca and mg was 0 03 and 0 07 g l 1reactor d 1 for r1 and r2 respectively the vss ash and p concentrations as cap granules particles 0 4 mm diameter over the height of both reactors is presented in fig 5c and d the standard deviation was determined for averages of samples taken on days 350 425 436 and 460 thus for r1 without ca2 addition both the concentration 27 3 gtss kg 1sludge and composition 20 2 gvss kg 1sludge 8 1 gash kg 1sludge and 1 0 0 2 gp kg 1sludge of cap granules were relatively constant along the reactor height by adding ca2 r2 an increase in concentration of cap granules from top 22 1 gtss kg 1sludge to bottom 75 5 gtss kg 1sludge was observed moreover the ratio ash vss in cap granules increased from top 0 4 0 2 to bottom 1 2 0 4 of the sludge bed along with the p concentration as cap granules fig 5d 3 4 composition and structure of calcium phosphate granules ca2 addition resulted in overall higher p content in the granules fig 6 this is observed in the lower part of the reactor heights 5 10 and 20 cm and not at the top the p content of particles 0 4 mm diameter from the reactor with ca2 addition r2 was lower than particles with the same size range from r1 the highest p content was observed for granules with diameter between 2 and 2 5 mm in r2 located at 5 cm from the bottom 82 10 mgp g 1tss during phase 2 the ca p molar ratio in cap granules was 1 14 0 14 for reactor r1 and for reactor r2 it increases during phase 2 from 1 68 0 11 on day 350 to 2 04 0 06 on day 460 the p enrichment was associated with a decrease in vss content for all size fractions in r2 fig 6e sem and sem edx images of sliced granules from r1 and r2 are shown in fig 7 cax po4 y precipitation in the granules which is represented by green overlay between cyan ca and yellow p in the edx images was enhanced by ca2 addition besides cax po4 y mg phosphate precipitates were also found in granules from r1 but not in r2 4 discussion 4 1 effect of ca2 on treatment performance and p removal ca2 addition has shown to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on biological anaerobic treatment of wastewater anaerobic treatment of swine wastewater in an egg shape digester fresh leachate from municipal wastewater in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor and synthetic wastewater mixture of peptone glucose and meat extract in a uasb reactor was inhibited for values of ca2 to codtotal above 0 04 0 07 and 0 15 g g 1 respectively ahn et al 2006 dang et al 2014 yu et al 2001 formation of inorganic particles caco3 and consequent increase in mass transfer limitations between substrates and microorganisms caused the inhibition dang et al 2014 yu et al 2001 yet for lower ratios of ca2 to codtotal ca2 showed a beneficial effect on the anaerobic treatment performance this was mainly due to two factors one was neutralization of inhibitory effect of for instance long chain fatty acids lcfa in the liquid by precipitation of lcfa ca salts and thereby increasing affinity to other organic substrates such as propionate and valerate ahn et al 2006 dang et al 2014 the other was increasing retention of sludge in the reactor by enhancing microbial granulation mechanisms such as adsorption adhesion and multiplication due to the capacity of ca2 to bridge with electronegative functional groups characteristic of the outer surface of microorganisms cao et al 2014 shen et al 1993 yu et al 2001 although ca2 was added in r2 0 043 0 016 g ca2 g 1codtotal no significant inhibition was observed after the process stabilization phase 2 because cod removal and ch4 production were nearly equal in both reactors moreover the measured vss yield was similar for both reactors fig 5a and b indicating that biomass growth was comparable with and without ca2 addition thus addition of extra ca2 in r2 as described in fig 2 did not affect the bw treatment without ca2 addition r1 the po4 3 removal was largely influenced by the ca2 concentration in the influent bw according to geochemical modelling in bw a change in ca2 from 40 to 50 mg l 1 triggers supersaturation for amorphous calcium phosphate acp which is a precursor of apatite the more stable cax po4 y phase the si for acp increased from 0 258 to 0 257 acp has kinetical advantage to form over apatite due to the higher solubility product constant ksp ksp values for acp and apatite considered in this study are 5 6 10 29 and 4 7 10 45 respectively visual minteq supersaturation for octacalcium phosphate ocp which is an intermediate phase between acp and apatite habraken et al 2013 was also triggered by the increase in ca2 si rose from 0 568 to 0 118 since cax po4 y precursors are undersaturated for ca2 concentrations in the influent bw below 50 mg l 1 fig 3a hydrolysed organic p is not precipitated and leaves the reactor in the effluent this explains the negative removal of po4 3 and confirms that ca2 in bw is limiting the p accumulation in the reactor by adding ca2 the po4 3 removal further increases up to 89 accumulation of non hydrolysable solid p was nearly complete even without ca2 addition this is mostly due to the capacity for retention of solids in the gas liquid solid separator gls on top of the uasb reactor fig 1 the possible mineral phases for p in the uasb reactor considering the chemical composition of the influent bw are mgnh4po4 struvite and cax po4 y graaff et al 2011 tervahauta et al 2014 moreover the theoretical ca p molar ratio of cax po4 y phases ranges between 1 1 and 1 67 where the highest is for apatite habraken et al 2013 thus considering the ca p molar ratio of p and ca retained in the reactor without ca2 addition 0 78 p accumulated as both struvite and cax po4 y the increased supersaturation of cax po4 y phases led to the dissolution of struvite in r2 this is supported by the higher concentration of soluble mg mg2 in r2 effluent 37 13 mg l 1 compared to r1 effluent 13 3 mg l 1 the higher mg content in cap granules from r1 than from r2 and xrd analysis appendix b on particles from r1 where struvite was identified for values of influent ca2 between 144 and 350 mg l 1 p and ca accumulated mainly as cax po4 y in r2 fig 3c for higher influent ca2 concentrations from 350 to 460 mg l 1 the ca p molar ratio of p and ca retained in the reactor 3 01 exceed the reference 1 67 and the po4 3 removal was not significantly higher when compared with lower influent ca2 concentrations as shown in fig 3a this suggests that added ca2 likely co precipitated as caco3 langerak et al 1998 and complexed with microorganisms extracellular polymeric substances eps and humic acids due to their negatively charged functional groups jia et al 1993 liao et al 2001 morgan et al 1990 wilén et al 2003 the concentration of humic acids in r2 effluent 47 8 9 6 mgc l 1 was on average lower than in r1 effluent 59 5 5 5 mgc l 1 indicating complexation of ca2 with humic acids note that in the influent bw the concentration of humic acids was 88 3 5 7 mgc l 1 therefore addition of ca2 above 250 mg l 1 total of 300 mgca2 l 1 in the reactor or a ca2 po4 3 molar ratio higher than 5 is not contributing to further p accumulation after the process stabilization but rather inducing undesired ca2 bonds such co precipitation of caco3 4 2 effect of ca2 on the particle size distribution and composition particle size composition and distribution in the sludge bed are crucial features for further improvement of harvesting separation and use of cap granules granulation is commonly observed when shear force which is induced by the generally applied upflow velocity in uasb reactors 1 3 m h 1 creates a selection pressure in the microbial community causing preferable retention of microbial aggregates over suspended biomass hulshoff pol et al 2004 liu and tay 2004 zhou et al 2006 however for bw treatment this selection pressure is reduced due to the low upflow velocity in the uasb reactor 0 01 m h 1 which is required to ensure the disintegration hydrolysis of solid cod in bw according to hulshoff pol et al 2004 microorganisms have ecological advantages when attached to a surface such as stability protection against toxic compounds kinetic advantage for uptake of substrates and facilitation of syntrophic relationships between microorganisms hulshoff pol et al 2004 schmidt and ahring 1996 yoda et al 1989 thus the microbial colonization on seed particles e g caco3 acp or ocp which can act as a nucleus and the consequent development of an outer biofilm is likely the initiation mechanism for cap granulation the higher p content in particles 0 4 mm diameter 38 8 and 31 9 mgp g 1vss for r1 and r2 respectively when compared to common anaerobic biomass 10 14 mgp g 1vss supports the presence of particles containing p in the bulk which could serve as initial seeds arne alphenaar et al 1993 langerak et al 1998 then due to local favorable conditions higher ph cax po4 y prevails grows and recrystallizes to more stable phases in the granule core as previously suggested by cunha et al 2017 and mañas et al 2012a b the higher ph is probably induced by degradation of organic acids and conversion of h2 h and hco3 into ch4 in the outer biofilm the reduction of p content in fine particles 0 4 mm diameter from r2 fig 6a is the result of ca2 addition which stimulated formation and enrichment of cax po4 y in existing granules over bulk precipitation supplementation of ca2 increased the overall concentration of cap granules 0 4 mm diameter in the uasb reactor the role of ca2 on the formation of cap granules consisted of increasing the concentration of seed particles that served as initial nuclei for cap granulation and stimulating the agglomeration of biomass the latter was due to bridging between extracellular proteins developing an organic matrix which plays a key role in strengthening the granular structure batstone et al 2002 caudan et al 2014 ismail et al 2010 ren et al 2008 the measured and theoretical vss production was similar in both reactors fig 5 but a larger fraction of the produced vss were in cap granules for the reactor where ca2 was added 69 when compared with no ca2 addition 56 this supports the beneficial effect of ca2 on biomass agglomeration which contributes to the formation and growth of cap granules regarding the core ca2 directly participates in the formation of cax po4 y precipitates and growth of the existing cax po4 y core by supplying ca2 the cax po4 y enrichment in cap granules correlated with the granule size and it decreased from bottom to top of the sludge bed figs 5 and 6 yet for granules 2 5 mm diameter the p content was lower than granules between 0 9 and 2 5 fig 6 this is most likely caused by the fast growth of the outer biofilm resulting in a large granule with high vss and low p contents then along with cax po4 y core maturation recrystallization of amorphous phases into more stable cax po4 y phases and agglomeration of cax po4 y crystals occur mañas et al 2012a b leading to a reduction in the pore size distribution compactness habraken et al 2013 consequently less mineral surface is available for the outer biofilm and the biological activity in the granules is pushed towards the edge of the granule developing an outer layer 50 100 μm thick as shown in fig 7 then due to the higher density of the cax po4 y core and consequent higher settling velocity when compared with organic material mature cap granules settled at the bottom of the reactor which is in this study the recommended harvesting location at the bottom of r2 with ca2 addition cap granules contained 6 7 1 2 wt p 36 wt as apatite with a ca p molar ratio of 1 68 which is close to the typical ratio of apatite moreover the mg content in cap granules was below 0 5 wt indicating low levels of struvite and mgco3 however the outer biofilm vss of cap granules represented 47 3 wt at the bottom which could limit the use of cap granules as replacement for p rock the remaining mass 17 wt consisted of ash from the vss caco3 and other trace elements when a post separation concentration step using for instance flotation and or vibrating sieves would be applied the organic fraction vss in the cap granules could be reduced due to the density difference between the cax po4 y core and the outer biofilm this would increase p content and reduce the organic proportion in the recovered product 4 3 recovery of calcium phosphate granules and outlook for process optimization the p recovery as cap granules 0 4 mm diameter was 31 with ca2 addition and 14 without ca2 addition considering the granules sampled during phase 2 and the total incoming p in bw of the total p sampled 94 and 72 was in cap granules with and without ca2 addition respectively for both r1 and r2 the production of cap granules was considerably higher than previously observed by tervahauta et al 2014 who reported only 2 of the p as granules the higher p recovery efficiency in r1 when compared with tervahauta et al 2014 is explained by the higher accumulation of p in the reactor 68 versus 51 this can be explained by a reduction in hco3 concentration in bw during this study from 3 6 tervahauta et al 2014 to 1 7 g l 1 decreasing the si of caco3 and increasing the si of cax po4 y phases by increasing the ionic activity of ca2 cunha et al 2017 the higher accumulation of p stimulated the formation of cap granules and p enrichment in the granules leading to a higher recovery efficiency by supplying ca2 the p accumulation further increases to 89 and thereby the recovery of p as cap granules however the aforementioned recovery is largely underestimated because cap granules were also taken from the upper part of the sludge bed where cap granules are not fully mature and the p content is lower moreover issues with the design of the uasb reactor led to scaling of a substantial amount of p at the inlet system and bottom of both reactors observed where sampling was not possible thus in order to decrease the loss of p by non recoverable scaling and to enhance cap granulation incoming p needs to be efficiently mixed in the sludge bed this will stimulate cap granulation due to the higher contact time between p added ca2 inorganic particles and microorganisms consequently the microbial colonization of these particles is intensified leading to the faster development of cap granules improved reactor design and scale can overcome these issues and in that case the recovery potential can increase up to 334 gp person 1 year 1 producing simultaneously 4 38 m3ch4 person 1 year 1 in a single reactor for use of cap granules in agriculture or industry a compositional characterization of the final product should be performed to evaluate actual feasibility safeness and bioavailability nevertheless tervahauta et al 2014 measured the heavy metals content in cap granules and found that the levels were lower when compared to sewage sludge and bio p sludge and comparable to p rock furthermore gell et al 2011 observed that pathogens in struvite produced from bw where below dutch regulatory levels and butkovskyi et al 2017 assessed the concentration of organic micropollutants in excess sludge from a uasb reactor treating source separated bw and because of the low values the authors recommended its use as soil amendment based on these preliminary insights cap granules produced during anaerobic treatment of bw are a promising solution as p recovered product but further process optimization is required to improve p recovery efficiency 5 conclusions ca2 added during the treatment of source separated bw in a uasb reactor r2 increased accumulation of p and stimulated formation and growth of cap granules without affecting the treatment performance in both reactors total cod removal was above 80 and methanization rate was on average 0 47 0 19 gcod ch4 g 1codtotal bw according to po4 3 removal and ca p molar ratio of retained ca and p addition of 250 mgca2 l 1 of bw was found to be the optimum cap granulation was enhanced by ca2 addition the percentage of particles 0 4 mm diameter cap granules in the sludge bed increased from 63 in r1 to 81 in r2 after 350 days of operation moreover cap granules from r2 contained 56 15 gp g 1tss while granules from r1 contained only 37 3 gp g 1tss the p recovery efficiency was 2 2 times higher in r2 31 than in r1 14 however the recovery efficiency was hindered by p scaling at the bottom of both the reactors and retention of solids containing p in the inlet systems considering the total p in the sludge taken from the sludge bed and in the effluent the p recovery as cap granules increases to 68 in r2 and 29 in r1 acknowledgments the authors thank joana neiva and the institute s technical and analytical teams for their contribution in

19822,a non supervised k means and a supervised k nearest neighbour in combination with genetic algorithm optimisation k nn ga pattern recognition algorithms were applied for evaluating and interpreting a large complex matrix of water quality wq data collected during five years 2008 2010 2013 in the paute river basin southern ecuador 21 physical chemical and microbiological parameters collected at 80 different wq sampling stations were examined at first the k means algorithm was carried out to identify classes of sampling stations regarding their associated wq status by considering three internal validation indexes i e silhouette coefficient davies bouldin and caliński harabasz as a result two wq classes were identified representing low c1 and high c2 pollution the k nn ga algorithm was applied on the available data to construct a classification model with the two wq classes previously defined by the k means algorithm as the dependent variables and the 21 physical chemical and microbiological parameters being the independent ones this algorithm led to a significant reduction of the multidimensional space of independent variables to only nine which are likely to explain most of the structure of the two identified wq classes these parameters are namely electric conductivity faecal coliforms dissolved oxygen chlorides total hardness nitrate total alkalinity biochemical oxygen demand and turbidity further the land use cover of the study basin revealed a very good agreement with the wq spatial distribution suggested by the k means algorithm confirming the credibility of the main results of the used wq data mining approach graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality pattern recognition genetic algorithm land cover 1 introduction present day changes to fluvial systems include a great variety of direct and indirect anthropogenic activities which in many cases result in a drastic deterioration of the water quality barnett et al 2008 harper et al 2008 a variety of contaminants in addition to a multitude of imprudent water management practices and destructive land uses are currently threatening aquatic systems on a world wide scale sanderson et al 2002 moreover water of good quality is a crucial component for sustainable socio economic development in any region of the world bartram and ballance 1996 in response to this and owing to spatial temporal variations in water chemistry a monitoring program that provides a representative and reliable estimation of the water quality wq is necessary simeonov et al 2003 the large number of samples that need to be considered in appropriate wq assessments and the number of constituents that must be considered per sample gives rise to data sets of enormous size and complexity furthermore the relationships investigated in these data sets usually cannot be expressed in quantitative terms and they are better expressed in terms of similarity or dissimilarity among groups of multivariate data lavine and rayens 2009 herein the application of different supervised and non supervised pattern recognition techniques has the potential of facilitating the interpretation of complex data matrices and as such of understanding the wq status of the studied systems without losing important information moreover they constitute valuable tools for reliable management of water resources shrestha and kazama 2007 juahir et al 2010 bücker et al 2010 in ecuador governmental efforts have been carried out in the past to establish various wq monitoring programs in some particular locations of the country and more recently to a national level senagua 2016 however the resulting observed data are not really public available and as such the data can hardly be used for research or management purposes nevertheless the ecuadorian national secretary of water senagua santiago river hydrographic demarcation dhs generated and made available to the current study an extensive database derived from 80 monitoring stations located in the paute river basin which is one of the most important hydrographic systems of southern ecuador as such in the present study a large and complex database including data on 14427 observations collected throughout a 5 year monitoring program year 2008 and period 2010 2013 was used in the context of supervised and non supervised pattern recognition techniques that were applied with the aim of handling the complexity of the database and mining relevant information about i the wq similarities or dissimilarities between the 80 monitoring stations based on the measured river wq parameters ii the most significant wq related parameters that explain the wq classes identified through the previous objective and iii the correspondence among the identified wq classes the most significant wq related parameters and the land cover of the study river basin 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area and water quality wq monitoring sites the study area the paute river basin is located in the south of ecuador fig 1 it has a surface of about 6442 km2 and its main reach length is approximately 120 4 km this is one of the most important hydrographic systems of ecuador due to the exploitation of part of its enormous hydroelectric potential which currently enables covering about 40 of the energetic demand of the country conelec 2011 the annual average discharge of the river is 136 3 m3 s 1 in its lower part its temporal variation is strongly influenced by the presence of some hydroelectric generation subsystems such as mazar amaluza and sopladora that are conforming the integrated paute generation system conelec 2009 the paute river provides water resources to rural agricultural urban and industrial areas of an important part of the southern andes of ecuador da ros 1995 and discharges into the upano river which belongs to the amazon river system two important cities are located inside the river basin respectively cuenca and azogues with approximately 500000 and 33850 inhabitants the main pollutant loads from both point and non point sources include domestic wastewaters agricultural runoff animal husbandry and industrial effluents da ros 1995 the geological features of the basin are very complex primarily due to the subduction of the nazca plate towards the south american plate which causes that this basin is still in the process of rising sharpening its slope resulting in large amounts of suspended sediments that are transported by the river to the amazon basin astudillo et al 2010 the elevation ranges approximately between 500 and 4250 m above the sea level a s l with the majority 61 3 of the basin in the elevation range 2550 3575 m 4 3 in the range 500 1525 m 13 7 in the elevation band 1525 2550 m and 20 7 of the basin is situated above 3575 m in average terms slopes vary between 25 and 50 in the upper part of the basin west a mountainous relief is dominant whilst a gentler relief is representative in the central and lower parts east multi year average temperature varies between 4 4 c and 18 6 c the lower temperatures correspond to the western andes range with an average of 6 c páramo while the warmest areas are situated in the valleys and subtropical zones amazonia regions with an average temperature fluctuating between 22 c and 26 c due to the wide elevation range rainfall oscillates in intensity and duration with maximum annual averages between 2500 mm and 3000 mm at higher elevations and minimum annual averages between 600 mm and 800 mm in the valleys the sampling design was planned to cover a wide range of parameters 21 in total at key monitoring sites 80 in total fig 1 aiming at representing as accurately as possible the wq distribution in the study

and water temperature wt on average the monitoring stations were visited five times per year except in 2008 when they were only sampled three times some stations were sampled more often because they were located either in highly polluted sites or on the contrary in unaltered environmental i e reference locations as a result of the applied monitoring protocol a large and complex wq database was established for the nsp 80 monitoring stations upon nrep 687 sampling replicates and the surveying of the nv 21 wq parameters per replicate and monitoring station resulting in a total of nobs nrep x nv 14427 observations that are represented by xi j with i 1 2 nv and j 1 2 nrep fig 2 unfortunately despite the fact that this is a very interesting and rich data set there was never a scientifically driven monitoring plan to collect it but rather its structure responds to political personal initiatives that varied throughout time table 1 lists the basic statistics for each of the studied wq parameters 2 3 processing land coverage data for assessing the spatial congruency of wq classification the correspondence of the spatial distribution of the wq classes was assessed by comparing it with the land cover distribution of the paute river basin using as well auxiliary topographical information land cover raster data was available for the year 2001 covering the whole extent of the study catchment this is the most recent dataset that is available publicly geographical information systems gis algorithms were applied on the original land cover data so that it was reclassified to a more convenient form which enabled a direct association between land cover and the spatial distribution of the wq classes the considered land cover classes were i altered vegetation ii woody native vegetation iii without cover urbanised and iv páramo unaltered additionally a digital elevation raster model of the whole catchment was available with a resolution of 50 50 m2 the referred congruency assessment was based on the visual inspection of the geographical distribution of the wq classes the land cover and the topography arcgis was used for all gis analyses including the latter visual inspection 2 4 data processing and multivariate statistical assessment fig 2 depicts the multivariate statistical protocol applied in this study all the statistical analyses involved in it were implemented with matlab hanselman and littlefield 2012 version 2014 as a first step the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 was used to evaluate whether the distributions of the wq parameters were normal this test showed with a 95 confidence level that none of the wq parameters are normally distributed p probability value 0 0001 lower than the significance level α 0 05 exhibiting in all cases a positive skew table 1 therefore it was decided to continue with the statistical assessment by using a central tendency value i e aggregated value of the distribution of every wq parameter for a given monitoring station instead of using the whole set of available observations further this aggregated parameter was standardised through range scaling so that a more normal associated distribution could be obtained this kind of standardisation procedure is recommended in a cluster analysis particularly for the k means method steinley 2004 herein the applied aggregation procedure reduced the dimension of the analysis to nmed nv x nsp 1680 median observations x i m with i 1 2 nv and m 1 2 nsp given the significant skewness of the wq parameters distributions the use of median rather than of mean values was preferred since the median is expected to be a better central tendency measure anderson and finn 1996 helsel and hirsch 2002 standardisation of x i m was achieved by means of 1 z i m x i m l m u m l m for i 1 2 n v and m 1 2 n sp where lm and um are the minimum and maximum limits of the parameter range so that zi m varies between 0 and 1 frank and todeschini 1994 then the aggregated dataset of nmed 1680 zi m values was used in the context of the k means algorithm macqueen 1967 a non hierarchical cluster analysis ca and a non supervised pattern recognition method were carried out with the intention of defining k groups of monitoring stations with common wq characteristics as a prior process validation indices wang et al 2009 were calculated to determine the number of wq clusters k for the application of the k means method once the k wq groups of monitoring stations were defined through the k means process fig 2 for a given monitoring station the respective identifier or label of the corresponding wq k means group or class was assigned to the original observations of the station after following this procedure for all of the sampling stations on the resulting new data matrix of nobs observations xi j the k nearest neighbour k nn a supervised pattern recognition method in combination with a genetic algorithm ga for optimisation was applied it is worth noticing that the wq related parameters frequently are of different nature or have different units many pattern recognition techniques like the ones used in this study are very sensitive to these issues todeschini et al 2015 therefore range scaling eq 1 was used to eliminate this dependence on the referred issues regardless of whether the applied recognition techniques were parametric or non parametric 2 4 1 the non supervised k means agglomerative method the goal of ca is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabelled i e unclassified data upon the similar characteristics that their members possess frank and todeschini 1994 in this context non hierarchical clustering techniques such as k means have been widely used in different applications among them the investigation of the hydro chemical processes in stream water quality güler et al 2002 caccia and boyer 2005 cluster membership is determined by calculating the centroid for each group and assigning each object to the group with the closest centroid which minimises the overall within cluster dispersion by iterative reallocation of cluster members hartigan and wong 1979 in this study this method was applied using the euclidean distance expressed in the units of measure of v as the measure of similarity between objects chen et al 2002 2 d i j v 1 v n v z i v z j v 2 where zi v and zj v are the values of the normalised parameter v for object i and j respectively where i is different from j and both are nsp further the evaluation of clustering solutions is fundamental in ca validity indices both external and internal are used for this purpose wang et al 2009 an external index measures the agreement between a priori known clustering structure and the result from a current clustering procedure dudoit and fridlyand 2002 whilst an internal index measures the appropriateness or goodness of a clustering partition without external information using quantities and features inherent in the data thalamuthu et al 2006 internal validity indices were applied in the current analysis namely the silhouette coefficient sc the davies bouldin db index and the caliński harabasz ch index in this context the cluster validity analysis platform cvap was used for this purpose wang et al 2009 these were adopted herein since they are widely used for k estimation and clustering quality evaluation wang et al 2009 sc kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 is a dimensionless measure that evaluates the quality of compactness and separation of clusters with an upper bound equal to 1 the optimum k value corresponds to its largest average chen et al 2002 db davies and bouldin 1979 is a function of the ratio of the sum of within cluster scatter to between cluster separation as such the objective is to minimise it which implies minimising the within cluster scatter and maximising the between cluster separation ray and turi 1999 ch caliński and harabasz 1974 or variance ratio criterion is a measure of the between cluster isolation and the within cluster coherence the objective is to maximise it kryszczuk and hurley 2010 each of the nsp 80 monitoring stations was assigned to either of the identified k wq clusters as the result of the application of the k means methodology for a given wq monitoring station the identifier id of the associated wq cluster was designated to all the parameters and temporal replicates sampled at this station fig 2 this was done for all 80 monitoring stations and 687 temporal replicates in this way the whole matrix of original data had associated k wq clusters and was ready for the k nn ga supervised pattern recognition analysis fig 2 2 4 2 the supervised k nearest neighbour k nn classification algorithm in combination with a genetic algorithm ga supervised pattern recognition methods identify models or classification rules which can carry out a cluster partitioning using local information provided by descriptive parameters lavine and rayens 2009 in the current study the k nn method fix and hodges 1951 was used in combination with a ga to i verify the allocation of monitoring stations or objects or samples into the classes determined previously by the k means method according to the descriptive parameters of the stations pattern recognition and ii identify the descriptive parameters that explain most of the internal structure of the wq classes parameters that should be monitored in future reducing in this way the complexity of the original database since the other monitored parameters would not really be necessary for this explanation the k nn is a non parametric algorithm through which a sample point is classified according to the majority vote of its k nearest neighbouring points frank and todeschini 1994 thus for a given sample point and for defining its nearest neighbours nn distances euclidian herein are evaluated from the sample point to every other point in the data set based on the class label defined previously in this study through the k means of most of the nn in a sample point the sample point is assigned that class when the newly assigned class matches the previously assigned class of the sample point defined by the k means method the k nn algorithm is considered successful lavine and rayens 2009 thus the k nn classification has two steps namely i the definition of the neighbouring points nn points of the sample point and ii the subsequent determination of the class of the sample point using the information provided by those nn points the k nn algorithm performance was measured through the non error rate ner which is defined as the percentage of monitoring stations correctly assigned by the k nn algorithm to the classes determined previously fig 2 by the k means method classification accuracy criteria hand 2012 in this study ner was estimated using a testing data set i e 40 of total data sample points were classified according to the wq parameters physicochemical and microbiological that are known to be indirectly related to wq usually through some undetermined mathematical relationships a training data set i e 60 of the total data for which the property of interest wq and the indirectly related descriptors in the current case the physicochemical and microbiological parameters measured at every wq monitoring station are known was used for developing a classification rule that was in turn utilised to predict the wq of data samples that were not part of the training set lavine and rayens 2009 besides the fact that in general the more the number of measured parameters the more a classification algorithm gets confused for the particular case of the k nn algorithm there are three main limitations namely frank and todeschini 1994 suguna and thanushkodi 2010 i calculation complexity due to the fact that all of the similarities between the training sample points must be calculated for classification ii the performance of the classification algorithm is over dependent on the training set and iii there is no weight difference between the training sample points despite the implicit differences in terms of available data for every one of those points thus the combination of the k nn algorithm with a ga was applied to overcome these limitations by i generating a profile about the internal data structure of every class and ii getting the contribution of individual related parameters measured at every wq monitoring station to the classification of the main property of interest in the current case wq in this context gas demonstrated to be robust searching techniques that in most cases outperform traditional optimisation methods in water resources applications mulligan and brown 1998 ng and perera 2003 liu et al 2007 through the emulation of evolution by natural selection and genetic inheritance so that a population of competing solutions evolve over time to converge to a single optimal one holland 1975 thus every model parameter every wq related parameter in this study is a gene while a complete set of genes 21 parameters is a chromosome every gene adopts the value of the respective wq related parameter encoded as a variable length binary number the length of this binary number depends on the magnitude of the wq parameter value for example if a gene represents ph 4 17 ph 9 43 the length of the respective binary number will be shorter than the corresponding length when a given gene represents say faecal coliforms varying between 0 and 16000 owing to the magnitude difference of the values adopted by ph and faecal coliforms the advantage of using this binary system is that very small value variations of a given wq parameter can be taken into account in the analysis the optimisation process is carried out by using three biological operators sivanandam and deepa 2008 liu et al 2007 namely i selection ii cross over reproduction and iii mutation selection makes sure that only the best chromosomes solutions could cross over or mutate during successive iterations generations initial chromosomes evolves into stronger ones by reproduction among members of the previous generation each ga run consists of several generations with constant population size of chromosomes the strength of each chromosome is evaluated by means of a fitness function in the current study a pattern recognition function through a classification model ner was used to characterise the performance of the k nn ga method regarding the prior classification produced by the unsupervised k means method so the highest ner values were obtained for a cross over probability of 60 a mutation probability of 3 and a constant population of 21 chromosomes that were evolved over 100 generations thus subsequent generations are formed by combining stronger chromosomes with associated higher fitness values from the previous or parent population further a random change of the value of a gene to form a new chromosome is achieved through mutation on a bit by bit basis from 0 to 1 or in reverse order the combination of the k nn and ga that was used in the current study follows to a great extent the approach presented by suguna and thanushkodi 2010 alternatives are for instance chang and lippmann 1990 and raymer et al 2000 hereafter the approach involved the following steps i data processing in general including the encoding of the genes that form the chromosomes ii selecting the distance or similarity measure among the test stations whose category are being predicted and the respective neighbouring training stations iii choosing the k number of samples or objects from the training set to generate the initial population on which genetic operators are applied during optimisation iv calculating the distance measures among testing and training samples through a goodness of fit or similarity index v choosing the chromosome with the highest goodness of fit value and storing it as the global maximum and vi refining the global maximum the latter step is performed through an iterative procedure that is based on the application of genetic operators namely reproduction crossing over and mutation to get a new population upon which a newer evaluation of the goodness of fit measure takes place to define a local maximum only if the newer goodness of fit measure local maximum is higher than the one associated to the older global maximum the chromosome that corresponds to the newer local maximum is the newer global maximum the iterative process is over once the total number of generations 100 in this study are taken into account the chromosome that corresponds to the global maximum has the optimum k neighbours and the respective classification results 3 results 3 1 land cover processing based on the adopted classes the land cover percentages within the study basin are respectively altered vegetation 37 12 woody native vegetation 34 38 without cover urbanised 3 54 and páramo unaltered vegetation 24 96 fig 3 illustrates in addition to the distribution of land cover the wq class c1 or c2 of each monitoring station and the bounds of the 18 sub basins in which the paute river basin was sub divided the altered vegetation is present particularly in the mid corridor of the basin both the higher western and lower eastern sides of the basin still have a significant presence of woody native vegetation and páramo woody native vegetation is present for instance in the sub basins negro 77 8 juval 86 4 pulpito 77 3 and machángara 76 4 páramo unaltered is present in the sub basins yanuncay 60 1 pulpito 59 5 machángara 56 7 and tomebamba 48 3 further the paute basin includes important extents of protected areas fig 1 the most renowned are the cajas national park pnc located in the western higher extreme of the basin mosquera et al 2017 which is a ramsar convention ramsar wetland site and the sangay national park pns located at the north east extreme both recognised by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco as world heritage sites nearly 41 of the paute basin area is subjected to management and conservation programs 3 2 k means algorithm spatial similarity and monitoring stations grouping the maximum sc value scmax the minimum db value dbmin and the maximum ch value chmax were all obtained for k 2 table 2 that is implying that there are two statistically significant clusters as for the results of the k means method these two groups of sites in the paute river basin coincide with prior wq studies in the study region da ros 1995 pauta calle and chang gómez 2014 cluster 1 c1 corresponds to relatively less polluted sites 67 monitoring stations while cluster 2 c2 matches highly polluted sites 13 monitoring stations fig 3 highlights as it might be expected that most wq monitoring stations belonging to c1 are situated at the upper lands and in areas with a high level of conservation and good land management on the other hand the monitoring stations classified as c2 are associated to sites that receive pollution from both point and non point sources such as agricultural fields orchard plantations and municipal and industrial wastewater effluents particularly those stations located in the burgay sub basin near the azogues city the rest of the wq monitoring stations belonging to c2 13 stations are located in the magdalena and pindilig sub basins which are in the vicinity of the burgay and the santa bárbara sub basins all these sub basins are located in the middle elevation part of the paute river basin 3 3 k nn ga pattern recognition performance and significant wq parameters in this analysis for a given monitoring station the respective k means wq class was the dependent grouping variable whilst the corresponding measured parameters constituted the independent variables a good classification accuracy was obtained with the k nn ga algorithm since the average ner for 100 runs fig 4 a was about 0 87 std 0 006 implying that about 87 of the wq monitoring stations were correctly assigned with respect to the previously k means derived wq classes with the objective of getting the most important independent variables i e measured parameters that explain the structure of the two wq classes the final stepwise selection with the best ner indicated that nine parameters are the optimum to interpret the two wq classes fig 4b namely ec fc do th cl n no3 bod5 talk and tu that account for most of the expected spatial variations of the wq in the paute river basin fig 4c further the frequency of the k nn ga variable selection throughout the classification process fig 4c illustrates that the ec parameter is the most significant by the classification model whilst the remaining 8 wq parameters seem to have a similar lower significance in the following the sub index c1 indicates that a given parameter or characteristic is associated to the wq class c1 whilst the sub index c2 refers to wq class c2 fig 5 shows the box plots of the 9 significant wq parameters as a function of the two wq classes c1 less polluted and c2 highly polluted in general the values adopted by ec fig 5a fc fig 5b th fig 5d cl fig 5e n no3 fig 5f and tu fig 5i are higher for the sampling points belonging to c2 than for the ones belonging to c1 average values are ecc1 87 7 μs cm 1 ecc2 280 3 μs cm 1 fcc1 3936 7 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 fcc2 11794 3 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 thc1 37 3 mg l 1 thc2 84 5 mg l 1 clc1 1 7 mg l 1 clc2 13 2 mg l 1 n no3 c1 0 3 mg l 1 n no3 c2 1 5 mg l 1 and tuc1 14 7 mg l 1 tuc2 53 5 mg l 1 for the do fig 5c the inverse condition was observed that is lower values for waters in c2 average 6 32 mg l 1 than for the waters in c1 average 6 90 mg l 1 for talk fig 5g and bod5 fig 5h no considerable differences between waters belonging to c1 and the ones belonging to c2 were observed average talkc1 0 62 mg l 1 talkc2 0 61 mg l 1 and bod5 c1 6 43 mg l 1 bod5 c2 9 92 mg l 1 however the dispersion is slightly lower for the peak values of waters in c2 than for the waters in c1 similarly to what is observed for the do it is important to observe that most of the peak values fig 5 were observed at the burgay sub basin fig 3 thus they do not seem to be outliers but they are simply characterising the extreme wq conditions taking place within such sub basin 4 discussion because the pre selection of the number of clusters k at the start of the k means method strongly influences its outcome güler et al 2002 the reliability of the two clusters was satisfactorily tested through the internal validation indexes sc db and ch in the current case a sc value of 0 6 corresponds to a reasonable structure has been found category kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 db and ch are not valued with a categorization likewise sc however the fact that both suggest two wq classes emphasises the similarity with the results of the k means algorithm that partitioned the monitoring stations into two homogeneous groups further the current application of the k means algorithm was based on a non conventional approximation namely due to the significant skewness present in the original wq parameters a simplified data matrix of the median values of the wq parameters that were previously standardised was used ouyang 2005 standardisation of the wq parameters was achieved by considering their ranges of variation rather than by using the z scale procedure as conventionally done in most wq studies shrestha and kazama 2007 kannel et al 2007 singh et al 2004 in this context steinley 2004 concludes that standardisation of the studied parameters by considering their range of variation was the most effective approach while using the k means method in classification models parametric methods such as the linear discriminant analysis widely used in surface water resources hajigholizadeh and melesse 2017 gholizadeh et al 2016 kovács et al 2014 require a priori knowledge of the probability density functions of the classes however in most real world applications these statistical properties are very hard to be known in advance lavine and rayens 2009 and or classes substantially depart from normality hirsch and alexander 1991 consequently parametric methods are no longer adequate huberty and olejnik 2006 and non parametric methods such as the k nn algorithm are a more appropriate alternative hirsch et al 1982 towler et al 2009 despite of which the k nn approach is normally not chosen as a primary classification method in surface water studies the k nn ga method gave relevant results in selecting appropriate explanatory variables representative of the wq status in the study basin hence the method yielded an important data reduction as it identified only nine ec fc do th cl n no3 bod5 talk and tu out of the 21 wq measured parameters that are explaining about 86 of the cluster assignations in supervised pattern recognition reflecting most of the wq spatial variation in the study basin hence the average ecc2 280 3 μs cm 1 was almost three times higher than the respective value for ecc1 87 7 μs cm 1 because ec increases nearly linearly with increasing ion concentration it implies that inorganic inputs are high in waters belonging to c2 most of c2 associated monitoring stations belong to the burgay sub basin fig 3 where wastewater effluents often contain high amounts of dissolved salts from inorganic pollution sources such as domestic sewage municipal storm water drainage and industrial effluent discharges da ros 1995 pauta calle and chang gómez 2014 further other variables related to inorganic pollution sources such as th cl tu n no3 and talk have similar evolution to the one of ec in this regard olajire and imeokparia 2001 daniel et al 2002 and begum et al 2009 observed in similar studies that in water with high ec values nitrate and chloride ions and calcium or magnesium salts are predominant the high th values associated to c2 might be linked to the use of inorganic fertilisers who 1998 hereafter high concentrations of the nitrate ions inorganic nutrient associated to c2 might be attributed to the runoff of fertiliser residues from agricultural lands mainly urea ch4n2o further fc do and bod5 normally reflect contamination by microbial communities and human activities liou et al 2004 hereafter the trends observed for these variables suggest an important organic pollution from anthropogenic source associated to the wq monitoring sites belonging to c2 resulting in high oxygen demand consumption characterised by average bod5 values higher in c2 9 92 mg l 1 than in c1 6 43 mg l 1 a similar trend was found in other studies such as vega et al 1998 singh et al 2004 and kannel et al 2007 which reported that high levels of dissolved organic matter dom i e carbohydrates proteins lipids etc consume large amounts of oxygen which deploys the amount of available do the latter is in line with the results of the current study however on the contrary to what is addressed in those studies in our study basin the do did not drop to a minimum level and as such did not induce anaerobic fermentation leading to development of ammonia and organic acids this is emphasised by the evolution of the ph distributions associated to the c1 and c2 monitoring sites which shows that the acidity of the c2 associated waters is not systematically higher than the one recorded in the c1 associated waters except for very few ph data near the lower i e acidic extreme of the phc2 range of variation phc1 range 5 3 9 43 phc2 range 4 17 8 95 several authors emphasised the importance of finding land use cover attributes that explain the spatial variation of wq bücker et al 2010 bu et al 2014 cunha et al 2016 examination of the spatial distribution of both the c1 and c2 stations as well as the land cover suggest that most of the wqc2 monitoring stations fig 3 are not directly exposed to nor have a significant influence from native forest and unaltered vegetation cover which is particularly the case in the burgay sub basin where most of the wqc2 monitoring stations are located and where 55 3 of the surface has altered native forest and vegetation resulting from the introduction of exotic species such as eucalyptus or replacement of native vegetation by pastures further besides the azogues city which does not possess a water treatment system prior to final in river disposal this sub basin has an important number of small villages that produces a significant contribution of untreated sewage da ros 1995 this problem is even accentuated by the industrial production of cement da ros 1995 pauta calle and chang gómez 2014 similarly the neighbouring magdalena sub basin has a very high proportion 70 7 of its surface covered by altered vegetation and a limited native forests cover 24 2 which explains the presence of a wqc1 station located in the native forest area and a wqc2 station by the outlet of the sub basin both the burgay and the magdalena sub basins do not have adequate land management programs in the other sub basins with the presence of wqc2 stations paute pindilig and sta bárbara the proportion of surface with altered vegetation cover is significant even though the majority of the wq sampling stations are classified as c1 all wq sampling stations of the paute sub basin fig 3 except one are classified as c1 and are located in areas where no significant human settlements are present only the wq station located at the outlet of the sub basin is classified as c2 which can be explained not only by the direct influence of human settlements located immediately upstream along the river course but also by the direct contribution from the magdalena sub basin into the lower part of the paute sub basin figs 2 and 3 for the pindilig and santa bárbara sub basins that contain wqc2 stations the location of the wqc1 stations is congruent with its location near a native forest and unaltered vegetation further a significant proportion of their surface 50 2 for the santa bárbara sub basin and 32 6 for the pindilig sub basin is covered by altered vegetation and there is only a very scarce presence of human settlements in this regard once again the land cover distribution suggests point source pollution from focalised human settlements which is accentuated in the santa bárbara sub basin by the fact that the average fcc2 13573 1 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 doubles the respective average fcc1 6272 4 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 for the pindilig sub basin this is confirmed by the average fcc2 value 12621 4 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 that nearly doubles the fcc1 value 6909 8 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 as well as by the fact that the average bod5 c2 value 22 6 mg l 1 triplicates the respective bod5 c1 value 6 1 mg l 1 hereafter point source pollution locations seem to have a low influence on the downstream wq as the presence of human settlements nearly vanishes there exists an increment of discharge and the presence of native and altered vegetation prevails particularly the presence of native vegetation has the potential of determining the existence of riparian ecosystems in several spots along the river courses forming buffer systems for the enhancement of riparian ecosystems and finally of the downstream wq formation of these riparian buffers should be encouraged in the study basin for instance for the removal of nitrates lowrance et al 1997 sweeney and newbold 2014 connolly et al 2015 that in wqc2 sites reaches an average value of 1 51 mg l 1 which is about 5 times the average in the wqc1 sites 0 31 mg l 1 on the other hand the sampling sites located by cuenca city tomebamba and yanuncay sub basins are classified as belonging to the c1 group despite of being located at the most urbanised area of the paute river basin this is logic and explained by the fact that in the city of cuenca an acceptable treatment of most of the wastewater takes place with favourable consequences for the wq of the paute river in the remaining sub basins of the paute river basin the presence of native forest and unaltered vegetation such as páramo is significant and the level of anthropisation is low which emphasises the congruency of the current wq classification results 5 conclusions the study illustrated the usefulness of the utilised non supervised k means and supervised k nn ga pattern recognition algorithms for the analysis and interpretation of complex data sets in the context of river wq assessment the identification of pollution sources factors and the understanding of spatial variations in river wq offering the potential of contributing positively to effective river wq management in the study basin such as reducing the number of parameters to be monitored in the future which shall result in a significant reduction of the monitoring costs without surrendering on accuracy hence the study revealed as well the worth of combining data mining techniques and common gis tools to cross check on congruency of results acknowledgements this study was conducted in the context of the master s thesis national university of la plata argentine

19822,a non supervised k means and a supervised k nearest neighbour in combination with genetic algorithm optimisation k nn ga pattern recognition algorithms were applied for evaluating and interpreting a large complex matrix of water quality wq data collected during five years 2008 2010 2013 in the paute river basin southern ecuador 21 physical chemical and microbiological parameters collected at 80 different wq sampling stations were examined at first the k means algorithm was carried out to identify classes of sampling stations regarding their associated wq status by considering three internal validation indexes i e silhouette coefficient davies bouldin and caliński harabasz as a result two wq classes were identified representing low c1 and high c2 pollution the k nn ga algorithm was applied on the available data to construct a classification model with the two wq classes previously defined by the k means algorithm as the dependent variables and the 21 physical chemical and microbiological parameters being the independent ones this algorithm led to a significant reduction of the multidimensional space of independent variables to only nine which are likely to explain most of the structure of the two identified wq classes these parameters are namely electric conductivity faecal coliforms dissolved oxygen chlorides total hardness nitrate total alkalinity biochemical oxygen demand and turbidity further the land use cover of the study basin revealed a very good agreement with the wq spatial distribution suggested by the k means algorithm confirming the credibility of the main results of the used wq data mining approach graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality pattern recognition genetic algorithm land cover 1 introduction present day changes to fluvial systems include a great variety of direct and indirect anthropogenic activities which in many cases result in a drastic deterioration of the water quality barnett et al 2008 harper et al 2008 a variety of contaminants in addition to a multitude of imprudent water management practices and destructive land uses are currently threatening aquatic systems on a world wide scale sanderson et al 2002 moreover water of good quality is a crucial component for sustainable socio economic development in any region of the world bartram and ballance 1996 in response to this and owing to spatial temporal variations in water chemistry a monitoring program that provides a representative and reliable estimation of the water quality wq is necessary simeonov et al 2003 the large number of samples that need to be considered in appropriate wq assessments and the number of constituents that must be considered per sample gives rise to data sets of enormous size and complexity furthermore the relationships investigated in these data sets usually cannot be expressed in quantitative terms and they are better expressed in terms of similarity or dissimilarity among groups of multivariate data lavine and rayens 2009 herein the application of different supervised and non supervised pattern recognition techniques has the potential of facilitating the interpretation of complex data matrices and as such of understanding the wq status of the studied systems without losing important information moreover they constitute valuable tools for reliable management of water resources shrestha and kazama 2007 juahir et al 2010 bücker et al 2010 in ecuador governmental efforts have been carried out in the past to establish various wq monitoring programs in some particular locations of the country and more recently to a national level senagua 2016 however the resulting observed data are not really public available and as such the data can hardly be used for research or management purposes nevertheless the ecuadorian national secretary of water senagua santiago river hydrographic demarcation dhs generated and made available to the current study an extensive database derived from 80 monitoring stations located in the paute river basin which is one of the most important hydrographic systems of southern ecuador as such in the present study a large and complex database including data on 14427 observations collected throughout a 5 year monitoring program year 2008 and period 2010 2013 was used in the context of supervised and non supervised pattern recognition techniques that were applied with the aim of handling the complexity of the database and mining relevant information about i the wq similarities or dissimilarities between the 80 monitoring stations based on the measured river wq parameters ii the most significant wq related parameters that explain the wq classes identified through the previous objective and iii the correspondence among the identified wq classes the most significant wq related parameters and the land cover of the study river basin 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area and water quality wq monitoring sites the study area the paute river basin is located in the south of ecuador fig 1 it has a surface of about 6442 km2 and its main reach length is approximately 120 4 km this is one of the most important hydrographic systems of ecuador due to the exploitation of part of its enormous hydroelectric potential which currently enables covering about 40 of the energetic demand of the country conelec 2011 the annual average discharge of the river is 136 3 m3 s 1 in its lower part its temporal variation is strongly influenced by the presence of some hydroelectric generation subsystems such as mazar amaluza and sopladora that are conforming the integrated paute generation system conelec 2009 the paute river provides water resources to rural agricultural urban and industrial areas of an important part of the southern andes of ecuador da ros 1995 and discharges into the upano river which belongs to the amazon river system two important cities are located inside the river basin respectively cuenca and azogues with approximately 500000 and 33850 inhabitants the main pollutant loads from both point and non point sources include domestic wastewaters agricultural runoff animal husbandry and industrial effluents da ros 1995 the geological features of the basin are very complex primarily due to the subduction of the nazca plate towards the south american plate which causes that this basin is still in the process of rising sharpening its slope resulting in large amounts of suspended sediments that are transported by the river to the amazon basin astudillo et al 2010 the elevation ranges approximately between 500 and 4250 m above the sea level a s l with the majority 61 3 of the basin in the elevation range 2550 3575 m 4 3 in the range 500 1525 m 13 7 in the elevation band 1525 2550 m and 20 7 of the basin is situated above 3575 m in average terms slopes vary between 25 and 50 in the upper part of the basin west a mountainous relief is dominant whilst a gentler relief is representative in the central and lower parts east multi year average temperature varies between 4 4 c and 18 6 c the lower temperatures correspond to the western andes range with an average of 6 c páramo while the warmest areas are situated in the valleys and subtropical zones amazonia regions with an average temperature fluctuating between 22 c and 26 c due to the wide elevation range rainfall oscillates in intensity and duration with maximum annual averages between 2500 mm and 3000 mm at higher elevations and minimum annual averages between 600 mm and 800 mm in the valleys the sampling design was planned to cover a wide range of parameters 21 in total at key monitoring sites 80 in total fig 1 aiming at representing as accurately as possible the wq distribution in the study

and water temperature wt on average the monitoring stations were visited five times per year except in 2008 when they were only sampled three times some stations were sampled more often because they were located either in highly polluted sites or on the contrary in unaltered environmental i e reference locations as a result of the applied monitoring protocol a large and complex wq database was established for the nsp 80 monitoring stations upon nrep 687 sampling replicates and the surveying of the nv 21 wq parameters per replicate and monitoring station resulting in a total of nobs nrep x nv 14427 observations that are represented by xi j with i 1 2 nv and j 1 2 nrep fig 2 unfortunately despite the fact that this is a very interesting and rich data set there was never a scientifically driven monitoring plan to collect it but rather its structure responds to political personal initiatives that varied throughout time table 1 lists the basic statistics for each of the studied wq parameters 2 3 processing land coverage data for assessing the spatial congruency of wq classification the correspondence of the spatial distribution of the wq classes was assessed by comparing it with the land cover distribution of the paute river basin using as well auxiliary topographical information land cover raster data was available for the year 2001 covering the whole extent of the study catchment this is the most recent dataset that is available publicly geographical information systems gis algorithms were applied on the original land cover data so that it was reclassified to a more convenient form which enabled a direct association between land cover and the spatial distribution of the wq classes the considered land cover classes were i altered vegetation ii woody native vegetation iii without cover urbanised and iv páramo unaltered additionally a digital elevation raster model of the whole catchment was available with a resolution of 50 50 m2 the referred congruency assessment was based on the visual inspection of the geographical distribution of the wq classes the land cover and the topography arcgis was used for all gis analyses including the latter visual inspection 2 4 data processing and multivariate statistical assessment fig 2 depicts the multivariate statistical protocol applied in this study all the statistical analyses involved in it were implemented with matlab hanselman and littlefield 2012 version 2014 as a first step the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 was used to evaluate whether the distributions of the wq parameters were normal this test showed with a 95 confidence level that none of the wq parameters are normally distributed p probability value 0 0001 lower than the significance level α 0 05 exhibiting in all cases a positive skew table 1 therefore it was decided to continue with the statistical assessment by using a central tendency value i e aggregated value of the distribution of every wq parameter for a given monitoring station instead of using the whole set of available observations further this aggregated parameter was standardised through range scaling so that a more normal associated distribution could be obtained this kind of standardisation procedure is recommended in a cluster analysis particularly for the k means method steinley 2004 herein the applied aggregation procedure reduced the dimension of the analysis to nmed nv x nsp 1680 median observations x i m with i 1 2 nv and m 1 2 nsp given the significant skewness of the wq parameters distributions the use of median rather than of mean values was preferred since the median is expected to be a better central tendency measure anderson and finn 1996 helsel and hirsch 2002 standardisation of x i m was achieved by means of 1 z i m x i m l m u m l m for i 1 2 n v and m 1 2 n sp where lm and um are the minimum and maximum limits of the parameter range so that zi m varies between 0 and 1 frank and todeschini 1994 then the aggregated dataset of nmed 1680 zi m values was used in the context of the k means algorithm macqueen 1967 a non hierarchical cluster analysis ca and a non supervised pattern recognition method were carried out with the intention of defining k groups of monitoring stations with common wq characteristics as a prior process validation indices wang et al 2009 were calculated to determine the number of wq clusters k for the application of the k means method once the k wq groups of monitoring stations were defined through the k means process fig 2 for a given monitoring station the respective identifier or label of the corresponding wq k means group or class was assigned to the original observations of the station after following this procedure for all of the sampling stations on the resulting new data matrix of nobs observations xi j the k nearest neighbour k nn a supervised pattern recognition method in combination with a genetic algorithm ga for optimisation was applied it is worth noticing that the wq related parameters frequently are of different nature or have different units many pattern recognition techniques like the ones used in this study are very sensitive to these issues todeschini et al 2015 therefore range scaling eq 1 was used to eliminate this dependence on the referred issues regardless of whether the applied recognition techniques were parametric or non parametric 2 4 1 the non supervised k means agglomerative method the goal of ca is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabelled i e unclassified data upon the similar characteristics that their members possess frank and todeschini 1994 in this context non hierarchical clustering techniques such as k means have been widely used in different applications among them the investigation of the hydro chemical processes in stream water quality güler et al 2002 caccia and boyer 2005 cluster membership is determined by calculating the centroid for each group and assigning each object to the group with the closest centroid which minimises the overall within cluster dispersion by iterative reallocation of cluster members hartigan and wong 1979 in this study this method was applied using the euclidean distance expressed in the units of measure of v as the measure of similarity between objects chen et al 2002 2 d i j v 1 v n v z i v z j v 2 where zi v and zj v are the values of the normalised parameter v for object i and j respectively where i is different from j and both are nsp further the evaluation of clustering solutions is fundamental in ca validity indices both external and internal are used for this purpose wang et al 2009 an external index measures the agreement between a priori known clustering structure and the result from a current clustering procedure dudoit and fridlyand 2002 whilst an internal index measures the appropriateness or goodness of a clustering partition without external information using quantities and features inherent in the data thalamuthu et al 2006 internal validity indices were applied in the current analysis namely the silhouette coefficient sc the davies bouldin db index and the caliński harabasz ch index in this context the cluster validity analysis platform cvap was used for this purpose wang et al 2009 these were adopted herein since they are widely used for k estimation and clustering quality evaluation wang et al 2009 sc kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 is a dimensionless measure that evaluates the quality of compactness and separation of clusters with an upper bound equal to 1 the optimum k value corresponds to its largest average chen et al 2002 db davies and bouldin 1979 is a function of the ratio of the sum of within cluster scatter to between cluster separation as such the objective is to minimise it which implies minimising the within cluster scatter and maximising the between cluster separation ray and turi 1999 ch caliński and harabasz 1974 or variance ratio criterion is a measure of the between cluster isolation and the within cluster coherence the objective is to maximise it kryszczuk and hurley 2010 each of the nsp 80 monitoring stations was assigned to either of the identified k wq clusters as the result of the application of the k means methodology for a given wq monitoring station the identifier id of the associated wq cluster was designated to all the parameters and temporal replicates sampled at this station fig 2 this was done for all 80 monitoring stations and 687 temporal replicates in this way the whole matrix of original data had associated k wq clusters and was ready for the k nn ga supervised pattern recognition analysis fig 2 2 4 2 the supervised k nearest neighbour k nn classification algorithm in combination with a genetic algorithm ga supervised pattern recognition methods identify models or classification rules which can carry out a cluster partitioning using local information provided by descriptive parameters lavine and rayens 2009 in the current study the k nn method fix and hodges 1951 was used in combination with a ga to i verify the allocation of monitoring stations or objects or samples into the classes determined previously by the k means method according to the descriptive parameters of the stations pattern recognition and ii identify the descriptive parameters that explain most of the internal structure of the wq classes parameters that should be monitored in future reducing in this way the complexity of the original database since the other monitored parameters would not really be necessary for this explanation the k nn is a non parametric algorithm through which a sample point is classified according to the majority vote of its k nearest neighbouring points frank and todeschini 1994 thus for a given sample point and for defining its nearest neighbours nn distances euclidian herein are evaluated from the sample point to every other point in the data set based on the class label defined previously in this study through the k means of most of the nn in a sample point the sample point is assigned that class when the newly assigned class matches the previously assigned class of the sample point defined by the k means method the k nn algorithm is considered successful lavine and rayens 2009 thus the k nn classification has two steps namely i the definition of the neighbouring points nn points of the sample point and ii the subsequent determination of the class of the sample point using the information provided by those nn points the k nn algorithm performance was measured through the non error rate ner which is defined as the percentage of monitoring stations correctly assigned by the k nn algorithm to the classes determined previously fig 2 by the k means method classification accuracy criteria hand 2012 in this study ner was estimated using a testing data set i e 40 of total data sample points were classified according to the wq parameters physicochemical and microbiological that are known to be indirectly related to wq usually through some undetermined mathematical relationships a training data set i e 60 of the total data for which the property of interest wq and the indirectly related descriptors in the current case the physicochemical and microbiological parameters measured at every wq monitoring station are known was used for developing a classification rule that was in turn utilised to predict the wq of data samples that were not part of the training set lavine and rayens 2009 besides the fact that in general the more the number of measured parameters the more a classification algorithm gets confused for the particular case of the k nn algorithm there are three main limitations namely frank and todeschini 1994 suguna and thanushkodi 2010 i calculation complexity due to the fact that all of the similarities between the training sample points must be calculated for classification ii the performance of the classification algorithm is over dependent on the training set and iii there is no weight difference between the training sample points despite the implicit differences in terms of available data for every one of those points thus the combination of the k nn algorithm with a ga was applied to overcome these limitations by i generating a profile about the internal data structure of every class and ii getting the contribution of individual related parameters measured at every wq monitoring station to the classification of the main property of interest in the current case wq in this context gas demonstrated to be robust searching techniques that in most cases outperform traditional optimisation methods in water resources applications mulligan and brown 1998 ng and perera 2003 liu et al 2007 through the emulation of evolution by natural selection and genetic inheritance so that a population of competing solutions evolve over time to converge to a single optimal one holland 1975 thus every model parameter every wq related parameter in this study is a gene while a complete set of genes 21 parameters is a chromosome every gene adopts the value of the respective wq related parameter encoded as a variable length binary number the length of this binary number depends on the magnitude of the wq parameter value for example if a gene represents ph 4 17 ph 9 43 the length of the respective binary number will be shorter than the corresponding length when a given gene represents say faecal coliforms varying between 0 and 16000 owing to the magnitude difference of the values adopted by ph and faecal coliforms the advantage of using this binary system is that very small value variations of a given wq parameter can be taken into account in the analysis the optimisation process is carried out by using three biological operators sivanandam and deepa 2008 liu et al 2007 namely i selection ii cross over reproduction and iii mutation selection makes sure that only the best chromosomes solutions could cross over or mutate during successive iterations generations initial chromosomes evolves into stronger ones by reproduction among members of the previous generation each ga run consists of several generations with constant population size of chromosomes the strength of each chromosome is evaluated by means of a fitness function in the current study a pattern recognition function through a classification model ner was used to characterise the performance of the k nn ga method regarding the prior classification produced by the unsupervised k means method so the highest ner values were obtained for a cross over probability of 60 a mutation probability of 3 and a constant population of 21 chromosomes that were evolved over 100 generations thus subsequent generations are formed by combining stronger chromosomes with associated higher fitness values from the previous or parent population further a random change of the value of a gene to form a new chromosome is achieved through mutation on a bit by bit basis from 0 to 1 or in reverse order the combination of the k nn and ga that was used in the current study follows to a great extent the approach presented by suguna and thanushkodi 2010 alternatives are for instance chang and lippmann 1990 and raymer et al 2000 hereafter the approach involved the following steps i data processing in general including the encoding of the genes that form the chromosomes ii selecting the distance or similarity measure among the test stations whose category are being predicted and the respective neighbouring training stations iii choosing the k number of samples or objects from the training set to generate the initial population on which genetic operators are applied during optimisation iv calculating the distance measures among testing and training samples through a goodness of fit or similarity index v choosing the chromosome with the highest goodness of fit value and storing it as the global maximum and vi refining the global maximum the latter step is performed through an iterative procedure that is based on the application of genetic operators namely reproduction crossing over and mutation to get a new population upon which a newer evaluation of the goodness of fit measure takes place to define a local maximum only if the newer goodness of fit measure local maximum is higher than the one associated to the older global maximum the chromosome that corresponds to the newer local maximum is the newer global maximum the iterative process is over once the total number of generations 100 in this study are taken into account the chromosome that corresponds to the global maximum has the optimum k neighbours and the respective classification results 3 results 3 1 land cover processing based on the adopted classes the land cover percentages within the study basin are respectively altered vegetation 37 12 woody native vegetation 34 38 without cover urbanised 3 54 and páramo unaltered vegetation 24 96 fig 3 illustrates in addition to the distribution of land cover the wq class c1 or c2 of each monitoring station and the bounds of the 18 sub basins in which the paute river basin was sub divided the altered vegetation is present particularly in the mid corridor of the basin both the higher western and lower eastern sides of the basin still have a significant presence of woody native vegetation and páramo woody native vegetation is present for instance in the sub basins negro 77 8 juval 86 4 pulpito 77 3 and machángara 76 4 páramo unaltered is present in the sub basins yanuncay 60 1 pulpito 59 5 machángara 56 7 and tomebamba 48 3 further the paute basin includes important extents of protected areas fig 1 the most renowned are the cajas national park pnc located in the western higher extreme of the basin mosquera et al 2017 which is a ramsar convention ramsar wetland site and the sangay national park pns located at the north east extreme both recognised by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco as world heritage sites nearly 41 of the paute basin area is subjected to management and conservation programs 3 2 k means algorithm spatial similarity and monitoring stations grouping the maximum sc value scmax the minimum db value dbmin and the maximum ch value chmax were all obtained for k 2 table 2 that is implying that there are two statistically significant clusters as for the results of the k means method these two groups of sites in the paute river basin coincide with prior wq studies in the study region da ros 1995 pauta calle and chang gómez 2014 cluster 1 c1 corresponds to relatively less polluted sites 67 monitoring stations while cluster 2 c2 matches highly polluted sites 13 monitoring stations fig 3 highlights as it might be expected that most wq monitoring stations belonging to c1 are situated at the upper lands and in areas with a high level of conservation and good land management on the other hand the monitoring stations classified as c2 are associated to sites that receive pollution from both point and non point sources such as agricultural fields orchard plantations and municipal and industrial wastewater effluents particularly those stations located in the burgay sub basin near the azogues city the rest of the wq monitoring stations belonging to c2 13 stations are located in the magdalena and pindilig sub basins which are in the vicinity of the burgay and the santa bárbara sub basins all these sub basins are located in the middle elevation part of the paute river basin 3 3 k nn ga pattern recognition performance and significant wq parameters in this analysis for a given monitoring station the respective k means wq class was the dependent grouping variable whilst the corresponding measured parameters constituted the independent variables a good classification accuracy was obtained with the k nn ga algorithm since the average ner for 100 runs fig 4 a was about 0 87 std 0 006 implying that about 87 of the wq monitoring stations were correctly assigned with respect to the previously k means derived wq classes with the objective of getting the most important independent variables i e measured parameters that explain the structure of the two wq classes the final stepwise selection with the best ner indicated that nine parameters are the optimum to interpret the two wq classes fig 4b namely ec fc do th cl n no3 bod5 talk and tu that account for most of the expected spatial variations of the wq in the paute river basin fig 4c further the frequency of the k nn ga variable selection throughout the classification process fig 4c illustrates that the ec parameter is the most significant by the classification model whilst the remaining 8 wq parameters seem to have a similar lower significance in the following the sub index c1 indicates that a given parameter or characteristic is associated to the wq class c1 whilst the sub index c2 refers to wq class c2 fig 5 shows the box plots of the 9 significant wq parameters as a function of the two wq classes c1 less polluted and c2 highly polluted in general the values adopted by ec fig 5a fc fig 5b th fig 5d cl fig 5e n no3 fig 5f and tu fig 5i are higher for the sampling points belonging to c2 than for the ones belonging to c1 average values are ecc1 87 7 μs cm 1 ecc2 280 3 μs cm 1 fcc1 3936 7 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 fcc2 11794 3 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 thc1 37 3 mg l 1 thc2 84 5 mg l 1 clc1 1 7 mg l 1 clc2 13 2 mg l 1 n no3 c1 0 3 mg l 1 n no3 c2 1 5 mg l 1 and tuc1 14 7 mg l 1 tuc2 53 5 mg l 1 for the do fig 5c the inverse condition was observed that is lower values for waters in c2 average 6 32 mg l 1 than for the waters in c1 average 6 90 mg l 1 for talk fig 5g and bod5 fig 5h no considerable differences between waters belonging to c1 and the ones belonging to c2 were observed average talkc1 0 62 mg l 1 talkc2 0 61 mg l 1 and bod5 c1 6 43 mg l 1 bod5 c2 9 92 mg l 1 however the dispersion is slightly lower for the peak values of waters in c2 than for the waters in c1 similarly to what is observed for the do it is important to observe that most of the peak values fig 5 were observed at the burgay sub basin fig 3 thus they do not seem to be outliers but they are simply characterising the extreme wq conditions taking place within such sub basin 4 discussion because the pre selection of the number of clusters k at the start of the k means method strongly influences its outcome güler et al 2002 the reliability of the two clusters was satisfactorily tested through the internal validation indexes sc db and ch in the current case a sc value of 0 6 corresponds to a reasonable structure has been found category kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 db and ch are not valued with a categorization likewise sc however the fact that both suggest two wq classes emphasises the similarity with the results of the k means algorithm that partitioned the monitoring stations into two homogeneous groups further the current application of the k means algorithm was based on a non conventional approximation namely due to the significant skewness present in the original wq parameters a simplified data matrix of the median values of the wq parameters that were previously standardised was used ouyang 2005 standardisation of the wq parameters was achieved by considering their ranges of variation rather than by using the z scale procedure as conventionally done in most wq studies shrestha and kazama 2007 kannel et al 2007 singh et al 2004 in this context steinley 2004 concludes that standardisation of the studied parameters by considering their range of variation was the most effective approach while using the k means method in classification models parametric methods such as the linear discriminant analysis widely used in surface water resources hajigholizadeh and melesse 2017 gholizadeh et al 2016 kovács et al 2014 require a priori knowledge of the probability density functions of the classes however in most real world applications these statistical properties are very hard to be known in advance lavine and rayens 2009 and or classes substantially depart from normality hirsch and alexander 1991 consequently parametric methods are no longer adequate huberty and olejnik 2006 and non parametric methods such as the k nn algorithm are a more appropriate alternative hirsch et al 1982 towler et al 2009 despite of which the k nn approach is normally not chosen as a primary classification method in surface water studies the k nn ga method gave relevant results in selecting appropriate explanatory variables representative of the wq status in the study basin hence the method yielded an important data reduction as it identified only nine ec fc do th cl n no3 bod5 talk and tu out of the 21 wq measured parameters that are explaining about 86 of the cluster assignations in supervised pattern recognition reflecting most of the wq spatial variation in the study basin hence the average ecc2 280 3 μs cm 1 was almost three times higher than the respective value for ecc1 87 7 μs cm 1 because ec increases nearly linearly with increasing ion concentration it implies that inorganic inputs are high in waters belonging to c2 most of c2 associated monitoring stations belong to the burgay sub basin fig 3 where wastewater effluents often contain high amounts of dissolved salts from inorganic pollution sources such as domestic sewage municipal storm water drainage and industrial effluent discharges da ros 1995 pauta calle and chang gómez 2014 further other variables related to inorganic pollution sources such as th cl tu n no3 and talk have similar evolution to the one of ec in this regard olajire and imeokparia 2001 daniel et al 2002 and begum et al 2009 observed in similar studies that in water with high ec values nitrate and chloride ions and calcium or magnesium salts are predominant the high th values associated to c2 might be linked to the use of inorganic fertilisers who 1998 hereafter high concentrations of the nitrate ions inorganic nutrient associated to c2 might be attributed to the runoff of fertiliser residues from agricultural lands mainly urea ch4n2o further fc do and bod5 normally reflect contamination by microbial communities and human activities liou et al 2004 hereafter the trends observed for these variables suggest an important organic pollution from anthropogenic source associated to the wq monitoring sites belonging to c2 resulting in high oxygen demand consumption characterised by average bod5 values higher in c2 9 92 mg l 1 than in c1 6 43 mg l 1 a similar trend was found in other studies such as vega et al 1998 singh et al 2004 and kannel et al 2007 which reported that high levels of dissolved organic matter dom i e carbohydrates proteins lipids etc consume large amounts of oxygen which deploys the amount of available do the latter is in line with the results of the current study however on the contrary to what is addressed in those studies in our study basin the do did not drop to a minimum level and as such did not induce anaerobic fermentation leading to development of ammonia and organic acids this is emphasised by the evolution of the ph distributions associated to the c1 and c2 monitoring sites which shows that the acidity of the c2 associated waters is not systematically higher than the one recorded in the c1 associated waters except for very few ph data near the lower i e acidic extreme of the phc2 range of variation phc1 range 5 3 9 43 phc2 range 4 17 8 95 several authors emphasised the importance of finding land use cover attributes that explain the spatial variation of wq bücker et al 2010 bu et al 2014 cunha et al 2016 examination of the spatial distribution of both the c1 and c2 stations as well as the land cover suggest that most of the wqc2 monitoring stations fig 3 are not directly exposed to nor have a significant influence from native forest and unaltered vegetation cover which is particularly the case in the burgay sub basin where most of the wqc2 monitoring stations are located and where 55 3 of the surface has altered native forest and vegetation resulting from the introduction of exotic species such as eucalyptus or replacement of native vegetation by pastures further besides the azogues city which does not possess a water treatment system prior to final in river disposal this sub basin has an important number of small villages that produces a significant contribution of untreated sewage da ros 1995 this problem is even accentuated by the industrial production of cement da ros 1995 pauta calle and chang gómez 2014 similarly the neighbouring magdalena sub basin has a very high proportion 70 7 of its surface covered by altered vegetation and a limited native forests cover 24 2 which explains the presence of a wqc1 station located in the native forest area and a wqc2 station by the outlet of the sub basin both the burgay and the magdalena sub basins do not have adequate land management programs in the other sub basins with the presence of wqc2 stations paute pindilig and sta bárbara the proportion of surface with altered vegetation cover is significant even though the majority of the wq sampling stations are classified as c1 all wq sampling stations of the paute sub basin fig 3 except one are classified as c1 and are located in areas where no significant human settlements are present only the wq station located at the outlet of the sub basin is classified as c2 which can be explained not only by the direct influence of human settlements located immediately upstream along the river course but also by the direct contribution from the magdalena sub basin into the lower part of the paute sub basin figs 2 and 3 for the pindilig and santa bárbara sub basins that contain wqc2 stations the location of the wqc1 stations is congruent with its location near a native forest and unaltered vegetation further a significant proportion of their surface 50 2 for the santa bárbara sub basin and 32 6 for the pindilig sub basin is covered by altered vegetation and there is only a very scarce presence of human settlements in this regard once again the land cover distribution suggests point source pollution from focalised human settlements which is accentuated in the santa bárbara sub basin by the fact that the average fcc2 13573 1 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 doubles the respective average fcc1 6272 4 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 for the pindilig sub basin this is confirmed by the average fcc2 value 12621 4 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 that nearly doubles the fcc1 value 6909 8 bacteria 100 1 ml 1 as well as by the fact that the average bod5 c2 value 22 6 mg l 1 triplicates the respective bod5 c1 value 6 1 mg l 1 hereafter point source pollution locations seem to have a low influence on the downstream wq as the presence of human settlements nearly vanishes there exists an increment of discharge and the presence of native and altered vegetation prevails particularly the presence of native vegetation has the potential of determining the existence of riparian ecosystems in several spots along the river courses forming buffer systems for the enhancement of riparian ecosystems and finally of the downstream wq formation of these riparian buffers should be encouraged in the study basin for instance for the removal of nitrates lowrance et al 1997 sweeney and newbold 2014 connolly et al 2015 that in wqc2 sites reaches an average value of 1 51 mg l 1 which is about 5 times the average in the wqc1 sites 0 31 mg l 1 on the other hand the sampling sites located by cuenca city tomebamba and yanuncay sub basins are classified as belonging to the c1 group despite of being located at the most urbanised area of the paute river basin this is logic and explained by the fact that in the city of cuenca an acceptable treatment of most of the wastewater takes place with favourable consequences for the wq of the paute river in the remaining sub basins of the paute river basin the presence of native forest and unaltered vegetation such as páramo is significant and the level of anthropisation is low which emphasises the congruency of the current wq classification results 5 conclusions the study illustrated the usefulness of the utilised non supervised k means and supervised k nn ga pattern recognition algorithms for the analysis and interpretation of complex data sets in the context of river wq assessment the identification of pollution sources factors and the understanding of spatial variations in river wq offering the potential of contributing positively to effective river wq management in the study basin such as reducing the number of parameters to be monitored in the future which shall result in a significant reduction of the monitoring costs without surrendering on accuracy hence the study revealed as well the worth of combining data mining

19823,sludge treatment and disposal have become important environmental issues in china mechanical dewatering is widely used to reduce the amount of sludge to be disposed and relieve the rapid growth pressure of waste sludge in comparison to traditional sludge dewatering processes pressure electro osmotic dewatering has many advantages on sludge dewatering efficiency low conditioner dosage and concentrated cake are both beneficial to further recycling of waste sludge in general complex electrochemical effects eg electrochemical oxidation ohmic heating and ph gradient effect are accompanied by the pressure electro osmotic dewatering process these electrochemical effects will inevitably cause solubilization and or degradation of key constituents of wastewater sludge extracellular polymeric substances eps in this study the effects of voltage ph and ionic strength on sludge electro osmotic dewatering performance and electrochemical effects were investigated the solubilization and degradation of eps were analyzed by examining the variation of dissolved organic matter dom in the filtrate and the relationships between microstructural properties of sludge cake and dom and electro osmosis dewatering performance in electro dewatering process was examined it was found that electro dewatering properties were improved by raising the operating voltage or decreasing the ph value while dewatering rate initially increased at low ionic strength it decreases with increased ionic strength in addition the porous structure of cathodic cake was more plentiful than that at the anode at the cathode the eps dissolution was mainly related to alkalization while the oxidation and acidification were responsible for release of eps at the anode meanwhile electrophoresis effect was able to promote migration of eps toward the anode the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 79 p 0 02 and at the cathode r2 0 87 p 0 03 strongly correlated with the volume of pore of sludge cake there was no correlation between the total content of anodic dom r2 0 31 p 0 08 and electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode however the content of cathodic dom r2 0 62 p 0 09 negatively correlated with average electro osmosis dewatering rate of cathode since cathode is the main water permeable side in sludge electro dewatering and the sticky biopolymers proteins and humic subtances could not be converted into small molecules higher eps release was associated with worse sludge filterability as for the anode the biopolymers were degraded into small molecules due to electrochemical oxidation which greatly reduced the impact of dom on dewatering effect therefore the operating conditions voltage ph and ionic strength caused changes in electrochemical effects which played a crucial role in compartmentalization of sludge eps dissolution and consequently sludge electro dewatering behavior graphical abstract image 1 keywords electro osmotic dewatering extracellular polymeric substances electrical reaction sludge dewatering 1 introduction wastewater treatment processes produce large quantities of sludge commonly containing over 90 water mahmoud et al 2011 the management of wastewater sludge accounts for a major portion of the cost of the wastewater treatment process and involves significant technical challenges in order to reduce the costs of transportation and handling the most important part of sludge treatment prior to disposal is the reduction of the sludge volume by solid liquid separation niu et al 2013 qi et al 2011 one separation method mechanical dewatering via ﬁltration and compression is widely used in ﬁelds as varied as chemicals and pharmaceuticals production minerals extraction and wastewater treatment however for many applications it cannot achieve a sufﬁciently low water content therefore current research seeks to develop potential alternatives to enhance the dewatering ability of conventional processes mahmoud et al 2010 2016 2011 olivier et al 2015 electrically assisted mechanical dewatering processes are especially suited to the dewatering of materials insufﬁciently treated by conventional methods for the reduction of water content saveyn et al 2005 a wide ﬁeld of application is the colloidal systems in which dewatering is complicated because of the strong surface effects due to the high bonding forces of water to solid matter and strong electrostatic forces between small particles strong mechanical forces have to be applied at room temperature for purely mechanical dewatering bergins et al 1999 wakeman and tarleton 1999 other applications of these combined techniques are ﬁne particle sludge gelatinous sludge vegetable juices extraction vegetable waste and activated sludge which can barely be ﬁltered although the molecular interactions play a far smaller role they still dominate the kinetics of the reduction of the water content mahmoud et al 2010 the electro osmotic dewatering mechanism is principally based on the interplay between the applied electric ﬁeld and the electric charge density of ions existing in the liquid close to the particle surface thus under the effect of the electric ﬁeld water displacement is ensured by the propagation of ionized mobile liquid on a solid liquid interface which drives the neutral liquid in the central channel through viscous momentum transfer yang et al 2009 the dewatering rate is also inﬂuenced by electrochemical reactions at the electrodes which affect the cake morphology and the chemistry of sludge citeau et al 2012b mahmoud et

hydroxide electrolytic ions and gases citeau et al 2012b the mechanism of pressurized electro osmotic dewatering process peod of activated and anaerobically digested sludge is very complex due to the

are present both outside of cells and in the interior of microbial aggregates used the abbreviation eps as a more general and comprehensive term to represent different classes of macromolecules such as polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids lipids and other polymeric compounds presented in the interior of various microbial aggregates sheng et al 2010 eps eps and water held within the eps structure accounts for 80 of the mass of waste activated sludge and many studies suggested that the sludge composition was the major factor affecting sludge dewatering performance mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the distribution and chemical composition of eps had signiﬁcant effect on sludge dewatering property eps can be separated into two fraction soluble eps and bound eps for soluble eps centrifugation is always used whereas for bound eps many different extraction methods have been developed sheng et al 2010 wingender et al 1999 electrochemical effects eg electrochemical oxidation and reduction ohmic heating and ph gradient effect will inevitably causing solubilization and or degradation of eps and these electrochemical effects lead to compartmentalization in electro dewatering

effects of operating conditions on sludge electrical osmotic dewatering performance fig 2 shows the filtration dewatering performance of pressurized electro osmotic dewatering rate under different operating conditions fig s1 see in supporting information indicated the average electro osmotic dewatering rate variation in the absence of an external electric filed the dewatering rate of two electrodes was similar while it differed greatly under electric assistance mitchell and soga 2005 suggested that the dewatering rate difference between two electrodes rd can used to reflect the electro osmotic effect fig 2 a and d showed the dewatering rate at the anode and cathode under different voltages fig s1 a and d showed the variation of average electro osmotic dewatering rate as voltage increased it can be seen that dewatering rate of anode did not change significantly but the dewatering rate at the cathode increased the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode increased from 0 074 ml s to 0 089 ml s when voltage raised from 0 v to 55 v as show in fig s1 a d in electric dewatering process there was complex electrokinetic phenomena which contains electrophoresis electromigration and electro osmotic electro osmotic which takes place at the solid liquid interface of the medium induces a displacement of the bulk water molecule mahmoud et al 2010 according to the report of mahmoud et al 2010 the electro osmotic ﬂow velocity for a system can be calculated by an extension of this theory to the overall porous medium 1 v d ζ 4 π μ φ where d is the dielectric constant of the medium μ is the ﬂuid medium dynamic viscosity and ζ is the zeta potential φ is the applied electrical field according to equation 1 the electro osmotic flow velocity is proportional to voltage so increasing voltage is able to accelerate the dewatering rate of cathode fig 2 g presented the rd value variation under different voltages where rd increased with increasing voltage indicating that the electro osmotic effect was intensified at the same time fig s2 shows that the moisture content of sludge cake decrease from 75 5 to 66 3 by increasing voltage from 0 v to 55 v fig 2 b and e presents the dewatering rate at the anode and cathode at different ph levels fig s1 b and e shows the variation of average electro osmotic dewatering rate it can be seen that the dewatering rates at the two electrodes both decreased with increased ph according to our previous research it was found that acidic conditions were conductive to sludge filtration dewatering since the negative charge on the surface of sludge flocs could be neutralized under acid condition which was able to cause sludge flocs coagulation conversely alkaline conditions led to the deterioration of sludge dewaterability because bound eps was dissolved under alkaline conditions due to deprotonation of anionic functional groups and those sticky biopolymers such as proteins released blocked filter cloth and increase the resistance to filtration of sludge wang and xu 2007 zhang et al 2016a 2016b equation 1 also revealed that electro osmotic dewatering rate was inversely proportional to the viscosity of sludge so the dewatering rate of both two electrodes reduced by ph increasing from 4 to 10 fig 2 h presents the variation of rd under different ph conditions where it is clear that rd decreased with increasing ph suggesting that the electro osmotic effect was weakened under this condition fig 2 c and f presents the dewatering rate for both electrodes under different ionic strength the variations of average electro osmotic dewatering rate can be found in fig s1 c and f fig 2 i shows the rd value variation at different ionic strengths it can be seen that the average electro osmotic dewatering rate of cathode increased initialy and then decreased sharply as the ionic strength increased it reached to the maximum value at 0 103 ml s when ionic strength at 1 16 g l and rd was consistent with dewatering rate of cathode as shown in fig s1 c and f these results indicate that an increase in the ionic strength was able to enhance the electro osmotic effect and then electro osmotic dewatering rate but ionic strength at higher than 1 16 g l resulted in deterioration of sludge dewatering process as depicted in fig s2 cake moisture content was consistent with electro osmotic effect the moisture content of sludge cake decreased to the minimum of 59 4 when ionic strength at 1 16 g l it was noted that there was strong correlation between electro osmotic effect rd and average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode in the electro osmotic dewatering process there are different electrochemical reactions electrochemical effect at the anode and cathode mahmoud et al 2010 and they have a significant influence on sludge properties cake microstructure and eps which consequently play a crucial role in enhancing sludge dewatering therefore the variation of sludge cake structure and eps composition needed to be investigated under different operating conditions in the electro osmotic dewatering process 3 2 current change and electrical reaction in electro osmotic dewatering process under different conditions 3 2 1 current change fig 3 presents the dynamic variation of electric current in electro osmotic dewatering process under different operating conditions it can be seen that the current rapidly raised at the beginning of electro osmotic dewatering process it reached maximum at about 5 min and then quickly fell this result was consistent with the report of mahmoud et al they found that in the early period the electric resistance of the sludge deceases as the anode to cathode distance decreases with dewatering thereafter it increase under the influence of the unsaturated sludge layer formed in the dewatered sludge meanwhile the gas evolution at both electrodes leads to the appearance of void spaces within the bed and increases the electrical resistance of the system mahmoud et al 2011 the current value increased as voltage raised and the current value also increased after adjusting ph and raising ionic strength in the electro osmotic dewatering process the current value could reflect the reaction rate of electrical chemistry and the higher current implied the faster electron transfer on the electrode and more intensively chemical reaction bard and faulkner 2001 in addition the electrical resistance of sludge increased with the electro osmotic dewatering process according to the joule s law 2 q i 2 r it was evident that the ohmic heating effect can be enhanced with an increased electric resistance fig s3 shows that the sludge cake temperature increased quickly and reached a maximum after 10 min the variation of ohmic heating was consistent with the report of mahmoud et al 2011 they investigated the ohmic heating change of two electrodes and found the temperature profiles of two electrodes both show an increase where voltage is applied followed by a decrease mahmoud et al 2011 the joule s heat generated in electro dewatering process could also decreased sludge viscosity mahmoud et al 2011 at the same time it caused solubilization of sludge eps fraction 3 2 2 electrochemical reaction according to equations 3 5 it can be seen that anode produced active oxidants o2 cl2 and h while oh was generated at cathode bard and faulkner 2001 so there are anodic oxidation and ph gradient effects in electro osmotic dewatering process it was found that oxidation and ph caused evolution of sludge eps zhang et al 2016b fig 4 a and b present the filtration ph variation at both electrodes under different operating conditions it can be seen that there was no significant change in filtrate ph at two electrodes with increased voltage this result was not consistent with the report of mahmoud et al 2011 who found that the ph at the cathode filtrate can reached around 10 the main reason for this situation may be the conductivity difference between sludge sample and then result in the difference of electrochemical reaction intensity sludge conductivity was increased after ph adjustment and or addition of nacl so there is an evident ph gradient between both electrodes after under these conditions fig 4 c and d show that the filtrate ph at the anode decreased while the cathodic filtrate ph increased after ph adjustment fig 4 e and f clearly presents an obvious ph gradient at two electrodes with addition of nacl the ph of anode filtrate was decreased to 1 96 while the cathodic filtrate ph was increased to 12 5 when the ionic strength was 4 29 g l 3 at anode 2 h 2 o l 4 h o 2 4 e 4 c l 2 e c l 2 g 5 at cathode 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 o h a q h 2 g 3 3 microstructural properties of sludge cake according to the report of novak and huang 1988 the clogging or blinding of pores in the ﬁlter cake was primarily responsible for the deterioration in ﬁltration rather than the blinding of the ﬁltering media tanaka et al 2015 also found that the pore structure was an important influence on the electro osmotic dewatering effect the sludge cakes at both electrodes were cut from both sides of the sludge cake with a thin blade and the sludge samples were processed with freeze drying treatment it was observed from fig 5 a that the pore volume of cathodic cake was higher than that at anode with increased voltage the pore volume of cathodic cake also increased but there was no obvious variation in the pore volume of the anodic sludge cake this was because the electrophoresis effect was enhanced as the voltage raised which promoted the transfer of sludge flocs to anode and hence the cake formed at the cathode was more compact than at the anode this result was consistent with the research of lee 2005 they found that the porosity at the cathode was generally lower than that at the anode lee 2005 fig 5 b shows the pore volume of cake at both two electrodes was decreased as ph raised from 4 to 10 the porous structure of cathodic cake was more plentiful than that at anode but the difference in cake morphology at both electrodes decreased by raising sludge ph since electro osmotic effect weakened at higher ph levels fig 5 c shows that the pore volume of cathode cake increased initially and then decreased with increasing ionic strength reaching the maximum at 0 14 cm 3 g when the ionic strength was 1 16 g l however the difference in the pore volume of cake between both electrodes became most divergent when the ionic strength was 1 16 g l which was in agreement with electro osmotic effect fig 6 presents the pearson correlation between the average electro osmotic dewatering rate and the pore volume of sludge cake it is clear that the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 79 p 0 02 and the cathode r2 0 87 p 0 03 strongly correlated with the pore volume of the sludge cake demonstrating that the more porous the structure of sludge cake the faster the electro osmotic dewatering rate 3 4 effects of operating conditions on compartmentalization of eps solubilization many studies have suggested that eps is the major factor affecting sludge dewatering behavior higgins and novak 1997 houghton et al 2001 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 in this test we investigated the compartmentalization of eps solubilization by analyzing the content and composition of dom in the filtrate 3 4 1 dom concentration fig 7 a presents the effects of different voltages on the dom concentration in the electro osmotic dewatering process where the anodic dom concentration increased with increased voltage but the cathodic dom concentration did not change significantly as mentioned earlier there was no significant ph difference in filtrate between both electrodes and it can be inferred that the electro osmotic and electrophoresis effect increased for increased voltage and negatively charged sludge flocs migrated toward the anode meanwhile anode can produce oxidized substances such as o2 and cl2 and also cause dissolution of eps fig 7 b shows the effects of ph variation on dom concentration in electro osmotic dewatering process it can be seen that the dom concentration of both electrodes increased after ph adjustment and the dom concentration under alkaline condition was significantly higher than under acidic condition this result was consistent with our previous research it was found that alkalization is stronger than acidification in solubilizing eps zhang et al 2016b the regional distribution of the dom concentration varied with ph such that the anodic dom concentration was higher than the cathodic concentration under acidic conditions while the anodic dom concentration was lower than the cathodic concentration under alkaline conditions anodic oxidation also caused dissolution of eps so the anodic dom concentration of anode was higher than the cathodic concentration under acidic conditions however the cathodic alkalization effect was increased under alkaline conditions which resulted in intensification of eps dissolution and release at the cathode fig 7 c depicts the effects of ionic strength on dom concentration in electro osmotic dewatering process and fig s4 shows the dom concentration variation in the absence and presence of an electrical field it can be seen that the addition of inorganic salts showed no effects on dom in the absence of an electric field while eps dissolution was intensified with increasing ionic strength when an electric field was applied the anodic dom concentration increased with ionic strength and then decreased after peak value with an ionic strength of 1 16 g l which was in agreement with the observed electro osmotic effect the dom content at the cathode increased with increased ionic strength since the cathodic alkalization was evidently enhanced at higher ionic strength which promoted solubilization and the release of a large amount of eps in the electro osmotic dewatering process the dom concentration presented different regional distribution characteristics at varying operating parameters it influenced the content and composition of dom through affecting the effects of electrochemical and electro osmotic effects at the cathode the eps dissolution was mainly related to alkalization which caused dissolution of eps due to the de protonation of anionic functional groups as for the anode the oxidation and acidification were responsible for the release of eps and the degradation of eps released might happen at the same time and the alkalization process had a more important role in eps dissolution on the other hand electrophoresis effect also could promote eps migrated to anode fig 8 shows the pearson correlation between the average electro osmotic dewatering rate and dom concentration at the both electrodes it is evident that there was no correlation between anodic dom concentration r2 0 31 p 0 08 and the electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode but the cathodic dom concentration r2 0 62 p 0 09 negatively correlated with average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode therefore it can be inferred that dom composition might have a more significant impact on the electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode in order to get insights into the changes in chemical composition of dom filtrate samples were characterized by excitation emission matrix eem and high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec shown later 3 4 2 dom composition 3 4 2 1 3d eem analysis fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and selective tool and had been extensively utilized to characterize natural organic matter nom especially from microbial activity henderson et al 2009 fig s5 shows eem profile of dom at both electrodes it can be seen that there were three main fluorescent peaks in the dom from both electrodes peak a λ ex em 280 335 tryptophan like protein peak b λ ex em 230 330 aromatic protein and peak c λ ex em 350 420 humic acid table 2 presented the fluorescent intensities variation of three peaks under different operating conditions it found that the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c in anodic dom decreased with increasing voltage the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c were 951 4 800 3 283 8 when voltage was 0 v and they were reduced to 531 6 397 130 7 when the voltage 55 v these results indicate that the protein and humic acid substances in dom were degraded due to generation of active oxygen and cl2 at anode the fluorescent intensities of three peaks in cathodic dom did not change significantly which was consistent with the cathodic dom concentration at different ph conditions the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c both increased as ph raised the intensities of peak a peak b and peak c of anodic dom were 209 8 201 3 112 4 when ph was 4 and they were increased to 547 1 379 132 2 and 1188 1894 159 6 when ph increased to 7 and 10 the intensities of protein and humic acid in anodic dom were decreased under acidic condition according to zhang et al report the anodic oxidation was enhanced under acid condition zhang et al 2015 so the fluorescent intensities of protein and humic acid in anodic dom were decreased evidently under acid condition the variation of intensities of three peaks in cathodic dom was consistent with the content of cathodic dom where they were increased by raising ph the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c of anodic dom both decreased with increasing ionic strength the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c decreased from 547 1 379 132 2 to 182 2 153 5 65 69 with ionic strength increased from 0 13 g l to 4 29 g l the anodic oxidation effect was significantly enhanced with increased ionic strength and the protein and humic acid substances were both significantly degraded however at high nacl concentration the protein and humic substances from eps dissolution increased and accumulated near the cathode side which caused blockage of filter media and cake structure 3 4 2 2 hpsec for the interpretation of size exclusion chromatography sec chromatograms three main molar mass fractions can be distinguished a macromolecular weight fraction 4000da mainly consisting of carbohydrates and proteins a mid molecular weight fraction 1000 4000da consisting of humic substances and peptides a low molecular weight fraction 1000da consisting of building blocks and organic acids lyko et al 2008 from fig s6 it can be seen that there mainly five main peaks in the filtrate including one low molecular weight peak 350da three mid molecular peaks 1100da 2100da 3500da and one macromolecular peak 45000da fig 9 a and b showed the variation of molecular peaks under different voltages where the peak intensities of the mid molecular weight peaks 1100da 2100da and 3500da in anodic dom were decreased by raising operating voltage but the low molecular weight peak 350da was significantly increased indicating that the content of humic acid and peptides were oxidized into low molecular substance from fig s6 c and d it can be seen that the mid molecular weight peak 2100da and 3500da in anodic dom disappeared and the value of the peak intensity of 350da was enhanced because of stronger anodic oxidation under acidic condition under alkaline condition there was also anodic oxidization so mid molecules and macromolecular molecules could be degraded and then accumulated from fig s6 e and f it can be seen that the three mid molecular weight peaks 1100da 2100da 3500da in anodic dom both disappeared with increased ionic strength for the sludge bulk but the peak of 350da was obviously increased moreover new low molecular peaks of 210da and 950da were produced which might be byproducts from biopolymers degradation fig s7 shows the correlation between the intensities of the three fluorescent dom peaks and average electro osmotic dewatering rate where it can be seen that electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode side no correlation with the fluorescent peaks intensities of trytophan protein r2 0 02 p 0 28 aomatic protein r2 0 08 p 0 15 and humic acid r2 0 20 p 0 17 however there were a strong negative correlations between electro osmotic dewatering rate and the fluorescent peaks intensities of trytophan protein r2 0 85 p 0 08 aomatic protein r2 0 66 p 0 18 and humic acid r2 0 83 p 0 09 at cathode side indicating that the biopolymers such as proteins and humic substances in cathode dom exhibited more important influence on the electro osmotic dewatering than that in the anode it was demonstrated that cathode was the main water permeable side in electro dewatering process the cathode alkalization could caused solubilization and release of large amount of eps which could not be degraded these biopolymers with high molecular weight such as proteins and humic substances resulted in deterioration of sludge filterability on the contrary the eem and hpsec revealed that the anode oxidation effect led to decomposition of protein and humic substances into small molecules and it was more obvious under acidic conditions which greatly reduced the impact of sticky biopolymers on sludge electro dewatering performance it is well known that the harmful pollutants such as organic contaminants and heavy metals in wastewater were always removed through interaction with eps e g through the hydrophobic effect electrostatic effect and complexation adsorption etc as mentioned above eps solubilization and degradation showed obvious regionalization features in electro dewatering cell which would inevitably cause the release of organic contaminants and heavy metals therefore further investigations are required to understand the migration and transformation of harmful pollutants in different regions of electro dewatering cell 4 conclusion in this study the effects of voltage ph and ionic strength on sludge electro osmotic dewatering rate and electro osmotic effect were evaluated and the relationship between microstructural properties of sludge cake and dom and electro osmotic dewatering rate was established in wastewater sludge electro dewatering process the operating conditions voltage ph and ionic strength caused changes in electrochemical effects which played a crucial role in compartmentalization of sludge eps dissolution and consequently sludge electro dewatering behavior the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode correlated well with electro osmotic effect both of them were enhanced with increased operating voltage or decreased sludge ph while they improved initial and then deteriorated with an increased ionic strength in the electro osmotic dewatering process because the electrophoresis effect promoted sludge flocs migration toward anode the porous structure of cathodic cake was more plentiful than that at anode the stronger the electro osmotic effect the greater porous structure difference of sludge cake between both electrodes in the electro osmotic dewatering process the eps dissolution was mainly related to alkalization at the cathode while the oxidation and acidification were responsible for release of eps at the anode and the degradation of eps release might happen at the same time the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 79 p 0 02 and cathode r2 0 87 p 0 03 strongly correlated with the pore volume of the sludge cake since the solubilized eps was converted into small molecules due to anodic oxidation there was no correlation between the content of anodic dom r2 0 31 p 0 08 and the electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode but the content of cathodic dom r2 0 62 p 0 09

19823,sludge treatment and disposal have become important environmental issues in china mechanical dewatering is widely used to reduce the amount of sludge to be disposed and relieve the rapid growth pressure of waste sludge in comparison to traditional sludge dewatering processes pressure electro osmotic dewatering has many advantages on sludge dewatering efficiency low conditioner dosage and concentrated cake are both beneficial to further recycling of waste sludge in general complex electrochemical effects eg electrochemical oxidation ohmic heating and ph gradient effect are accompanied by the pressure electro osmotic dewatering process these electrochemical effects will inevitably cause solubilization and or degradation of key constituents of wastewater sludge extracellular polymeric substances eps in this study the effects of voltage ph and ionic strength on sludge electro osmotic dewatering performance and electrochemical effects were investigated the solubilization and degradation of eps were analyzed by examining the variation of dissolved organic matter dom in the filtrate and the relationships between microstructural properties of sludge cake and dom and electro osmosis dewatering performance in electro dewatering process was examined it was found that electro dewatering properties were improved by raising the operating voltage or decreasing the ph value while dewatering rate initially increased at low ionic strength it decreases with increased ionic strength in addition the porous structure of cathodic cake was more plentiful than that at the anode at the cathode the eps dissolution was mainly related to alkalization while the oxidation and acidification were responsible for release of eps at the anode meanwhile electrophoresis effect was able to promote migration of eps toward the anode the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 79 p 0 02 and at the cathode r2 0 87 p 0 03 strongly correlated with the volume of pore of sludge cake there was no correlation between the total content of anodic dom r2 0 31 p 0 08 and electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode however the content of cathodic dom r2 0 62 p 0 09 negatively correlated with average electro osmosis dewatering rate of cathode since cathode is the main water permeable side in sludge electro dewatering and the sticky biopolymers proteins and humic subtances could not be converted into small molecules higher eps release was associated with worse sludge filterability as for the anode the biopolymers were degraded into small molecules due to electrochemical oxidation which greatly reduced the impact of dom on dewatering effect therefore the operating conditions voltage ph and ionic strength caused changes in electrochemical effects which

management of wastewater sludge accounts for a major portion of the cost of the wastewater treatment process and involves significant technical challenges in order to reduce the costs of transportation and handling the most important part of sludge treatment prior to disposal is the reduction of the sludge volume by solid liquid separation niu et al 2013 qi et al 2011 one separation method mechanical dewatering via ﬁltration and compression is widely used in ﬁelds as varied as chemicals and pharmaceuticals production minerals extraction and wastewater treatment however for many applications it cannot achieve a sufﬁciently low water content therefore current research seeks to develop potential alternatives to enhance the dewatering ability of conventional processes mahmoud et al 2010 2016 2011 olivier et al 2015 electrically assisted mechanical dewatering processes are especially suited to the dewatering of materials insufﬁciently treated by conventional methods for the reduction of water content saveyn et al 2005 a wide ﬁeld of application is the colloidal systems in which dewatering is complicated because of the strong surface effects due to the high bonding forces of water to solid matter and strong electrostatic forces between small particles strong mechanical forces have to be applied at room temperature for purely mechanical dewatering bergins et al 1999 wakeman and tarleton 1999 other applications of these combined techniques are ﬁne particle sludge gelatinous sludge vegetable juices extraction vegetable waste and activated sludge which can barely be ﬁltered although the molecular interactions play a far smaller role they still dominate the kinetics of the reduction of the water content mahmoud et al 2010 the electro osmotic dewatering mechanism is principally based on the interplay between the applied electric ﬁeld and the electric charge density of ions existing in the liquid close to the particle surface thus under the effect of the electric ﬁeld water displacement is ensured by the propagation of ionized mobile liquid on a solid liquid interface which drives the neutral liquid in the central channel through viscous momentum transfer yang et al 2009 the dewatering rate is also inﬂuenced by electrochemical reactions at the electrodes which affect the cake morphology and the chemistry of sludge citeau et al 2012b mahmoud et al 2010 the possible electrochemical reactions occurring at electrodes made from insoluble material not consumed coulometrically are based on the electrolysis of water producing notably hydronium and hydroxide electrolytic ions and gases citeau et al 2012b the mechanism of pressurized electro osmotic dewatering process peod of activated and anaerobically digested sludge is very complex due to the high number of factors inﬂuencing the process behavior such as sludge characteristics type of ﬂocculants used electrical treatment parameters and regimes electrodes shape and material electrochemical

are present both outside of cells and in the interior of microbial aggregates used the abbreviation eps as a more general and comprehensive term to represent different classes of macromolecules such as polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids lipids and other polymeric compounds presented in the interior of various microbial aggregates sheng et al 2010 eps eps and water held within the eps structure accounts for 80 of the mass of waste activated sludge and many studies suggested that the sludge composition was the major factor affecting sludge dewatering performance mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the distribution and chemical composition of eps had signiﬁcant effect on sludge dewatering property eps can be separated into two fraction soluble eps and bound eps for soluble eps centrifugation is always used whereas for bound eps many different extraction methods have been developed sheng et al 2010 wingender et al 1999 electrochemical effects eg electrochemical oxidation and reduction ohmic heating and ph gradient effect will inevitably causing solubilization and or degradation of eps and these electrochemical effects lead to compartmentalization in electro dewatering

effects of operating conditions on sludge electrical osmotic dewatering performance fig 2 shows the filtration dewatering performance of pressurized electro osmotic dewatering rate under different operating conditions fig s1 see in supporting information indicated the average electro osmotic dewatering rate variation in the absence of an external electric filed the dewatering rate of two electrodes was similar while it differed greatly under electric assistance mitchell and soga 2005 suggested that the dewatering rate difference between two electrodes rd can used to reflect the electro osmotic effect fig 2 a and d showed the dewatering rate at the anode and cathode under different voltages fig s1 a and d showed the variation of average electro osmotic dewatering rate as voltage increased it can be seen that dewatering rate of anode did not change significantly but the dewatering rate at the cathode increased the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode increased from 0 074 ml s to 0 089 ml s when voltage raised from 0 v to 55 v as show in fig s1 a d in electric dewatering process there was complex electrokinetic phenomena which contains electrophoresis electromigration and electro osmotic electro osmotic which takes place at the solid liquid interface of the medium induces a displacement of the bulk water molecule mahmoud et al 2010 according to the report of mahmoud et al 2010 the electro osmotic ﬂow velocity for a system can be calculated by an extension of this theory to the overall porous medium 1 v d ζ 4 π μ φ where d is the dielectric constant of the medium μ is the ﬂuid medium dynamic viscosity and ζ is the zeta potential φ is the applied electrical field according to equation 1 the electro osmotic flow velocity is proportional to voltage so increasing voltage is able to accelerate the dewatering rate of cathode fig 2 g presented the rd value variation under different voltages where rd increased with increasing voltage indicating that the electro osmotic effect was intensified at the same time fig s2 shows that the moisture content of sludge cake decrease from 75 5 to 66 3 by increasing voltage from 0 v to 55 v fig 2 b and e presents the dewatering rate at the anode and cathode at different ph levels fig s1 b and e shows the variation of average electro osmotic dewatering rate it can be seen that the dewatering rates at the two electrodes both decreased with increased ph according to our previous research it was found that acidic conditions were conductive to sludge filtration dewatering since the negative charge on the surface of sludge flocs could be neutralized under acid condition which was able to cause sludge flocs coagulation conversely alkaline conditions led to the deterioration of sludge dewaterability because bound eps was dissolved under alkaline conditions due to deprotonation of anionic functional groups and those sticky biopolymers such as proteins released blocked filter cloth and increase the resistance to filtration of sludge wang and xu 2007 zhang et al 2016a 2016b equation 1 also revealed that electro osmotic dewatering rate was inversely proportional to the viscosity of sludge so the dewatering rate of both two electrodes reduced by ph increasing from 4 to 10 fig 2 h presents the variation of rd under different ph conditions where it is clear that rd decreased with increasing ph suggesting that the electro osmotic effect was weakened under this condition fig 2 c and f presents the dewatering rate for both electrodes under different ionic strength the variations of average electro osmotic dewatering rate can be found in fig s1 c and f fig 2 i shows the rd value variation at different ionic strengths it can be seen that the average electro osmotic dewatering rate of cathode increased initialy and then decreased sharply as the ionic strength increased it reached to the maximum value at 0 103 ml s when ionic strength at 1 16 g l and rd was consistent with dewatering rate of cathode as shown in fig s1 c and f these results indicate that an increase in the ionic strength was able to enhance the electro osmotic effect and then electro osmotic dewatering rate but ionic strength at higher than 1 16 g l resulted in deterioration of sludge dewatering process as depicted in fig s2 cake moisture content was consistent with electro osmotic effect the moisture content of sludge cake decreased to the minimum of 59 4 when ionic strength at 1 16 g l it was noted that there was strong correlation between electro osmotic effect rd and average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode in the electro osmotic dewatering process there are different electrochemical reactions electrochemical effect at the anode and cathode mahmoud et al 2010 and they have a significant influence on sludge properties cake microstructure and eps which consequently play a crucial role in enhancing sludge dewatering therefore the variation of sludge cake structure and eps composition needed to be investigated under different operating conditions in the electro osmotic dewatering process 3 2 current change and electrical reaction in electro osmotic dewatering process under different conditions 3 2 1 current change fig 3 presents the dynamic variation of electric current in electro osmotic dewatering process under different operating conditions it can be seen that the current rapidly raised at the beginning of electro osmotic dewatering process it reached maximum at about 5 min and then quickly fell this result was consistent with the report of mahmoud et al they found that in the early period the electric resistance of the sludge deceases as the anode to cathode distance decreases with dewatering thereafter it increase under the influence of the unsaturated sludge layer formed in the dewatered sludge meanwhile the gas evolution at both electrodes leads to the appearance of void spaces within the bed and increases the electrical resistance of the system mahmoud et al 2011 the current value increased as voltage raised and the current value also increased after adjusting ph and raising ionic strength in the electro osmotic dewatering process the current value could reflect the reaction rate of electrical chemistry and the higher current implied the faster electron transfer on the electrode and more intensively chemical reaction bard and faulkner 2001 in addition the electrical resistance of sludge increased with the electro osmotic dewatering process according to the joule s law 2 q i 2 r it was evident that the ohmic heating effect can be enhanced with an increased electric resistance fig s3 shows that the sludge cake temperature increased quickly and reached a maximum after 10 min the variation of ohmic heating was consistent with the report of mahmoud et al 2011 they investigated the ohmic heating change of two electrodes and found the temperature profiles of two electrodes both show an increase where voltage is applied followed by a decrease mahmoud et al 2011 the joule s heat generated in electro dewatering process could also decreased sludge viscosity mahmoud et al 2011 at the same time it caused solubilization of sludge eps fraction 3 2 2 electrochemical reaction according to equations 3 5 it can be seen that anode produced active oxidants o2 cl2 and h while oh was generated at cathode bard and faulkner 2001 so there are anodic oxidation and ph gradient effects in electro osmotic dewatering process it was found that oxidation and ph caused evolution of sludge eps zhang et al 2016b fig 4 a and b present the filtration ph variation at both electrodes under different operating conditions it can be seen that there was no significant change in filtrate ph at two electrodes with increased voltage this result was not consistent with the report of mahmoud et al 2011 who found that the ph at the cathode filtrate can reached around 10 the main reason for this situation may be the conductivity difference between sludge sample and then result in the difference of electrochemical reaction intensity sludge conductivity was increased after ph adjustment and or addition of nacl so there is an evident ph gradient between both electrodes after under these conditions fig 4 c and d show that the filtrate ph at the anode decreased while the cathodic filtrate ph increased after ph adjustment fig 4 e and f clearly presents an obvious ph gradient at two electrodes with addition of nacl the ph of anode filtrate was decreased to 1 96 while the cathodic filtrate ph was increased to 12 5 when the ionic strength was 4 29 g l 3 at anode 2 h 2 o l 4 h o 2 4 e 4 c l 2 e c l 2 g 5 at cathode 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 o h a q h 2 g 3 3 microstructural properties of sludge cake according to the report of novak and huang 1988 the clogging or blinding of pores in the ﬁlter cake was primarily responsible for the deterioration in ﬁltration rather than the blinding of the ﬁltering media tanaka et al 2015 also found that the pore structure was an important influence on the electro osmotic dewatering effect the sludge cakes at both electrodes were cut from both sides of the sludge cake with a thin blade and the sludge samples were processed with freeze drying treatment it was observed from fig 5 a that the pore volume of cathodic cake was higher than that at anode with increased voltage the pore volume of cathodic cake also increased but there was no obvious variation in the pore volume of the anodic sludge cake this was because the electrophoresis effect was enhanced as the voltage raised which promoted the transfer of sludge flocs to anode and hence the cake formed at the cathode was more compact than at the anode this result was consistent with the research of lee 2005 they found that the porosity at the cathode was generally lower than that at the anode lee 2005 fig 5 b shows the pore volume of cake at both two electrodes was decreased as ph raised from 4 to 10 the porous structure of cathodic cake was more plentiful than that at anode but the difference in cake morphology at both electrodes decreased by raising sludge ph since electro osmotic effect weakened at higher ph levels fig 5 c shows that the pore volume of cathode cake increased initially and then decreased with increasing ionic strength reaching the maximum at 0 14 cm 3 g when the ionic strength was 1 16 g l however the difference in the pore volume of cake between both electrodes became most divergent when the ionic strength was 1 16 g l which was in agreement with electro osmotic effect fig 6 presents the pearson correlation between the average electro osmotic dewatering rate and the pore volume of sludge cake it is clear that the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 79 p 0 02 and the cathode r2 0 87 p 0 03 strongly correlated with the pore volume of the sludge cake demonstrating that the more porous the structure of sludge cake the faster the electro osmotic dewatering rate 3 4 effects of operating conditions on compartmentalization of eps solubilization many studies have suggested that eps is the major factor affecting sludge dewatering behavior higgins and novak 1997 houghton et al 2001 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 in this test we investigated the compartmentalization of eps solubilization by analyzing the content and composition of dom in the filtrate 3 4 1 dom concentration fig 7 a presents the effects of different voltages on the dom concentration in the electro osmotic dewatering process where the anodic dom concentration increased with increased voltage but the cathodic dom concentration did not change significantly as mentioned earlier there was no significant ph difference in filtrate between both electrodes and it can be inferred that the electro osmotic and electrophoresis effect increased for increased voltage and negatively charged sludge flocs migrated toward the anode meanwhile anode can produce oxidized substances such as o2 and cl2 and also cause dissolution of eps fig 7 b shows the effects of ph variation on dom concentration in electro osmotic dewatering process it can be seen that the dom concentration of both electrodes increased after ph adjustment and the dom concentration under alkaline condition was significantly higher than under acidic condition this result was consistent with our previous research it was found that alkalization is stronger than acidification in solubilizing eps zhang et al 2016b the regional distribution of the dom concentration varied with ph such that the anodic dom concentration was higher than the cathodic concentration under acidic conditions while the anodic dom concentration was lower than the cathodic concentration under alkaline conditions anodic oxidation also caused dissolution of eps so the anodic dom concentration of anode was higher than the cathodic concentration under acidic conditions however the cathodic alkalization effect was increased under alkaline conditions which resulted in intensification of eps dissolution and release at the cathode fig 7 c depicts the effects of ionic strength on dom concentration in electro osmotic dewatering process and fig s4 shows the dom concentration variation in the absence and presence of an electrical field it can be seen that the addition of inorganic salts showed no effects on dom in the absence of an electric field while eps dissolution was intensified with increasing ionic strength when an electric field was applied the anodic dom concentration increased with ionic strength and then decreased after peak value with an ionic strength of 1 16 g l which was in agreement with the observed electro osmotic effect the dom content at the cathode increased with increased ionic strength since the cathodic alkalization was evidently enhanced at higher ionic strength which promoted solubilization and the release of a large amount of eps in the electro osmotic dewatering process the dom concentration presented different regional distribution characteristics at varying operating parameters it influenced the content and composition of dom through affecting the effects of electrochemical and electro osmotic effects at the cathode the eps dissolution was mainly related to alkalization which caused dissolution of eps due to the de protonation of anionic functional groups as for the anode the oxidation and acidification were responsible for the release of eps and the degradation of eps released might happen at the same time and the alkalization process had a more important role in eps dissolution on the other hand electrophoresis effect also could promote eps migrated to anode fig 8 shows the pearson correlation between the average electro osmotic dewatering rate and dom concentration at the both electrodes it is evident that there was no correlation between anodic dom concentration r2 0 31 p 0 08 and the electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode but the cathodic dom concentration r2 0 62 p 0 09 negatively correlated with average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode therefore it can be inferred that dom composition might have a more significant impact on the electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode in order to get insights into the changes in chemical composition of dom filtrate samples were characterized by excitation emission matrix eem and high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec shown later 3 4 2 dom composition 3 4 2 1 3d eem analysis fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and selective tool and had been extensively utilized to characterize natural organic matter nom especially from microbial activity henderson et al 2009 fig s5 shows eem profile of dom at both electrodes it can be seen that there were three main fluorescent peaks in the dom from both electrodes peak a λ ex em 280 335 tryptophan like protein peak b λ ex em 230 330 aromatic protein and peak c λ ex em 350 420 humic acid table 2 presented the fluorescent intensities variation of three peaks under different operating conditions it found that the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c in anodic dom decreased with increasing voltage the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c were 951 4 800 3 283 8 when voltage was 0 v and they were reduced to 531 6 397 130 7 when the voltage 55 v these results indicate that the protein and humic acid substances in dom were degraded due to generation of active oxygen and cl2 at anode the fluorescent intensities of three peaks in cathodic dom did not change significantly which was consistent with the cathodic dom concentration at different ph conditions the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c both increased as ph raised the intensities of peak a peak b and peak c of anodic dom were 209 8 201 3 112 4 when ph was 4 and they were increased to 547 1 379 132 2 and 1188 1894 159 6 when ph increased to 7 and 10 the intensities of protein and humic acid in anodic dom were decreased under acidic condition according to zhang et al report the anodic oxidation was enhanced under acid condition zhang et al 2015 so the fluorescent intensities of protein and humic acid in anodic dom were decreased evidently under acid condition the variation of intensities of three peaks in cathodic dom was consistent with the content of cathodic dom where they were increased by raising ph the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c of anodic dom both decreased with increasing ionic strength the fluorescent intensities of peak a peak b and peak c decreased from 547 1 379 132 2 to 182 2 153 5 65 69 with ionic strength increased from 0 13 g l to 4 29 g l the anodic oxidation effect was significantly enhanced with increased ionic strength and the protein and humic acid substances were both significantly degraded however at high nacl concentration the protein and humic substances from eps dissolution increased and accumulated near the cathode side which caused blockage of filter media and cake structure 3 4 2 2 hpsec for the interpretation of size exclusion chromatography sec chromatograms three main molar mass fractions can be distinguished a macromolecular weight fraction 4000da mainly consisting of carbohydrates and proteins a mid molecular weight fraction 1000 4000da consisting of humic substances and peptides a low molecular weight fraction 1000da consisting of building blocks and organic acids lyko et al 2008 from fig s6 it can be seen that there mainly five main peaks in the filtrate including one low molecular weight peak 350da three mid molecular peaks 1100da 2100da 3500da and one macromolecular peak 45000da fig 9 a and b showed the variation of molecular peaks under different voltages where the peak intensities of the mid molecular weight peaks 1100da 2100da and 3500da in anodic dom were decreased by raising operating voltage but the low molecular weight peak 350da was significantly increased indicating that the content of humic acid and peptides were oxidized into low molecular substance from fig s6 c and d it can be seen that the mid molecular weight peak 2100da and 3500da in anodic dom disappeared and the value of the peak intensity of 350da was enhanced because of stronger anodic oxidation under acidic condition under alkaline condition there was also anodic oxidization so mid molecules and macromolecular molecules could be degraded and then accumulated from fig s6 e and f it can be seen that the three mid molecular weight peaks 1100da 2100da 3500da in anodic dom both disappeared with increased ionic strength for the sludge bulk but the peak of 350da was obviously increased moreover new low molecular peaks of 210da and 950da were produced which might be byproducts from biopolymers degradation fig s7 shows the correlation between the intensities of the three fluorescent dom peaks and average electro osmotic dewatering rate where it can be seen that electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode side no correlation with the fluorescent peaks intensities of trytophan protein r2 0 02 p 0 28 aomatic protein r2 0 08 p 0 15 and humic acid r2 0 20 p 0 17 however there were a strong negative correlations between electro osmotic dewatering rate and the fluorescent peaks intensities of trytophan protein r2 0 85 p 0 08 aomatic protein r2 0 66 p 0 18 and humic acid r2 0 83 p 0 09 at cathode side indicating that the biopolymers such as proteins and humic substances in cathode dom exhibited more important influence on the electro osmotic dewatering than that in the anode it was demonstrated that cathode was the main water permeable side in electro dewatering process the cathode alkalization could caused solubilization and release of large amount of eps which could not be degraded these biopolymers with high molecular weight such as proteins and humic substances resulted in deterioration of sludge filterability on the contrary the eem and hpsec revealed that the anode oxidation effect led to decomposition of protein and humic substances into small molecules and it was more obvious under acidic conditions which greatly reduced the impact of sticky biopolymers on sludge electro dewatering performance it is well known that the harmful pollutants such as organic contaminants and heavy metals in wastewater were always removed through interaction with eps e g through the hydrophobic effect electrostatic effect and complexation adsorption etc as mentioned above eps solubilization and degradation showed obvious regionalization features in electro dewatering cell which would inevitably cause the release of organic contaminants and heavy metals therefore further investigations are required to understand the migration and transformation of harmful pollutants in different regions of electro dewatering cell 4 conclusion in this study the effects of voltage ph and ionic strength on sludge electro osmotic dewatering rate and electro osmotic effect were evaluated and the relationship between microstructural properties of sludge cake and dom and electro osmotic dewatering rate was established in wastewater sludge electro dewatering process the operating conditions voltage ph and ionic strength caused changes in electrochemical effects which played a crucial role in compartmentalization of sludge eps dissolution and consequently sludge electro dewatering behavior the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode correlated well with electro osmotic effect both of them were enhanced with increased operating voltage or decreased sludge ph while they improved initial and then deteriorated with an increased ionic strength in the electro osmotic dewatering process because the electrophoresis effect promoted sludge flocs migration toward anode the porous structure of cathodic cake was more plentiful than that at anode the stronger the electro osmotic effect the greater porous structure difference of sludge cake between both electrodes in the electro osmotic dewatering process the eps dissolution was mainly related to alkalization at the cathode while the oxidation and acidification were responsible for release of eps at the anode and the degradation of eps release might happen at the same time the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode r2 0 79 p 0 02 and cathode r2 0 87 p 0 03 strongly correlated with the pore volume of the sludge cake since the solubilized eps was converted into small molecules due to anodic oxidation there was no correlation between the content of anodic dom r2 0 31 p 0 08 and the electro osmotic dewatering rate at the anode but the content of cathodic dom r2 0 62 p 0 09 negatively correlated with the average electro osmotic dewatering rate at the cathode acknowledgement this study was ﬁnancially supported by national natural science foundation of china 51678546 and

19824,ammonium oxidation to nitrite and then to nitrate nitrification is a key process in many waterworks treating groundwater to make it potable in rapid sand filters nitrifying microbial communities may evolve naturally from groundwater bacteria entering the filters however in new filters this may take several months and in some cases the nitrification process is never sufficiently rapid to be efficient or is only performed partially with nitrite as an undesired end product the present study reports the first successful priming of nitrification in a rapid sand filter treating groundwater it is shown that nitrifying communities could be enriched by microbiomes from well functioning rapid sand filters in waterworks and that the enriched nitrifying consortium could be used to inoculate fresh filters significantly shortening the time taken for the nitrification process to start the key nitrifiers in the enrichment were different from those in the well functioning filter but similar to those that initiated the nitrification process in fresh filters without inoculation whether or not the nitrification was primed with the enriched nitrifying consortium the bacteria performing the nitrification process during start up appeared to be slowly outcompeted by nitrospira the dominant nitrifying bacterium in well functioning rapid sand filters keywords rapid sand filters waterworks nitrification bioaugmentation microbiome priming 1 introduction ammonium oxidation to nitrite and then to nitrate nitrification is a key process in many waterworks treating groundwater to make it potable in northern europe in particular but in many other places as well microbial oxidation is preferred over chemical oxidation with chlorine in rapid sand filters which are widespread in the purification of groundwater for use as drinking water nitrifying microbial communities may evolve naturally from the groundwater bacteria that enter the filters lytle et al 2007 rittmann et al 2012 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 in most cases nitrification starts within one to four months of operation during which time the water cannot be distributed to consumers lytle et al 2007 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 in some cases the nitrification process is never rapid enough to be efficient or is only partial with nitrite as an undesired end product e g van der aa et al 2002 de vet et al 2011 de vet et al 2012 lytle et al 2013 in denmark for example 20 of waterworks experience challenges with the nitrification process lee 2014 in any event a faster and more reliable start of the nitrification process in waterworks sand filters would be of great benefit to drinking water production companies microbial nitrification has traditionally been viewed as two separate processes ammonium oxidation was thought to be carried out by nitrosomonas a betaproteobacterium white et al 2012 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 and nitrite oxidising bacteria such as nitrospira and nitrobacter were expected to complete the nitrification process de vet et al 2009 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 albers et al 2015a recently however it has been shown that the complete nitrification process may be carried out by comammox nitrospira bacteria van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 and that these may be present in sand filters used for water purification pinto et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 the scientific literature on nitrification in rapid sand filters treating groundwater is vast but few studies have been published on attempts to prime the nitrification process during the start up of new filters in the few cases where priming of the nitrification process has been attempted the approach was to stimulate the nitrifying microbes by adding trace elements such as phosphorous and copper van der aa et al 2002 de vet et al 2012 lytle et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 or by subsurface aeration de vet et al 2011 attempts have also been made to transfer nitrifying microorganisms from well functioning sand filters either as sand material or backwash water stembal et al 2004 lytle et al 2007 although a positive effect on nitrification compared to non inoculated filters has not been observed in the present study we took a different and novel approach this involved i enriching a nitrifying bacterial consortium from a well functioning sand filter and ii adding inoculating the enriched consortium to new filters the primary purpose of the inoculation was to ensure rapid nitrification either by functioning until the local groundwater bacteria took over the process or as a substitute for local groundwater bacteria if these were unable to establish a nitrifying population furthermore the study aimed to describe the evolution of nitrifying communities in new sand filters with and without inoculation this was done by extracting dna from the original filter material from the enrichment and during the start up of new filters and then by characterising the bacterial communities by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 2 materials methods 2 1 chemical analyses commercial spectrophotometric kits and a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan were used to analyse ammonium merck

samples for the analysis of ammonium and nitrate were stored cold and analysed on the day of sampling samples for analysis of nitrate were kept frozen until analysis 2 2 enrichment and maintenance of nitrifying bacteria the nitrifying consortium was enriched from filter material that originated in a rapid sand filter located at islevbro waterworks copenhagen denmark the sand filter community in this particular filter has previously been described and compared with other rapid sand filters in danish waterworks albers et al 2015a the filter is 27 years old and its primary function is to remove manganese and ammonium it receives water from a chalk aquifer 11 93 m depth below surface and before the groundwater enters the filter it is aerated and most of the dissolved iron removed the concentration of ammonium in the filter s inlet water is 0 3 mg l in march 2015 filter sand was sampled from the top of the second filter i e after pre filtration into sterilised glass jars and stored at 5 c until enrichment of the nitrifying consortium the enrichment procedure started in sterile 500 ml blue cap bottles with 200 g sterilised quartz sand 1 2 2 0 mm inoculated with 10 g original filter material supplemented with 250 ml mineral growth medium according to pitcher et al 2010 the ammonium concentration used was 1 mm 18 mg l 1 after two weeks all ammonium in the bottle was degraded and 2 g of sand was transferred to a bottle with 200 g sterilised quartz sand and 250 ml fresh medium this transfer was repeated four times at intervals of 8 15 days following complete ammonium degradation in the bottle the enrichment was undertaken in darkness at 10 c on an orbital shaker the enriched nitrifying consortium was maintained on quartz sand 1 2 2 0 mm in an incubator at 10 c the growth medium in the bottles was refreshed at 14 days intervals by removing the supernatant and adding fresh medium attempts to make cryocultures or to freeze dry the consortium failed to yield regrowth of a functional nitrifying consortium it was therefore essential to maintain the active nitrifying consortium production of larger volumes of the enriched nitrifying consortium for laboratory columns and mesocosm sand filter experiment starter culture was done under similar conditions as the enrichment described above but in 1 l bottles containing 750 g sterilised quartz sand and 500 ml growth medium 2 3 laboratory column setup the nitrifying consortium was further tested and enriched in laboratory columns h20 ø1 6 cm run at 10 c with a continuous upward flow of 4 8 ml h which gave an approximate water residence time of 3 h the medium used was the same as that used during isolation but was diluted five times to give an ammonium concentration of 3 6 mg l quartz sand 0 8 1 4 mm 99 0 sio2 dki denmark was steam sterilised mixed with sand containing the enriched nitrifying consortium and wet packed into the columns sterilised with 0 01 m naoh the columns were not operated under strictly sterile conditions at the end of the experiment sand was sampled in triplicate from the inlet middle and outlet parts of the columns for extraction of dna and further processing by qpcr and sequencing dna was extracted using the powerlyzer powersoil dna isolation 159 kit mobio carlsbad california as previously described by ellegaard jensen et al 2016 2 4 mesocosm sand filter experiment in a waterworks a pilot scale sand filter system was set up at the same waterworks from where the enriched nitrifying consortium originated islevbro copenhagen and was run for eight weeks the system consisted of four parallel filter columns each made of a plexiglas cylinder h200 ø18 cm operated with adjustable downward flow fig 1 the columns were filled with 78 cm quartz sand 1 2 2 0 mm 99 3 sio2 dki denmark on top of 20 cm coarser material 10 cm 50 80 mm quartz and 10 cm 30 50 mm quartz after one day of operation and one backwashing procedure 4 cm 1 l of sand containing the enriched nitrifying consortium was added on top of two filters and 4 cm of non inoculated sand was added to two control columns the sand filters received water from the waterworks just after aeration of the abstracted raw water with no pre filtration the key water parameters of the inlet water were 0 3 0 4 mg l ammonium 2 mg l iron 0 04 mg l manganese 10 mg l oxygen 2 mg l non volatile organic carbon 0 02 mg l nitrite 0 05 mg l nitrate 0 02 mg l methane ph of 7 3 and a temperature of 9 10 c the water flow was 70 l h which corresponded to 2 8 m h or an empty bed contact time in the 80 cm filters of 17 min this corresponded to a water residence time of 7 min assuming a porosity of 0 40 backwashing was performed every four days with filtrated water only 8 min 20 l min water was sampled from three ports at each filter located 10 cm below the sand filter surface 70 cm below the surface and at the outlets of the columns samples for ammonium nitrite and nitrate analysis were collected in 15 ml centrifuge tubes sarstedt germany after filtration in the field 0 22 μm q max polyethersulfone filters frisenette denmark within the day of sampling the water was analysed for ammonium and nitrite while samples for nitrate analysis were stored frozen until analysis oxygen and ph were measured in a flow cell in the field using a multimeter multi 3420 wtw germany filter material was sampled weekly from the top of the filters using a sterilised spoon and on three occasions also from a 40 cm depth using a custom made pipe system albers et al 2015b three subsamples of 0 5 g wet weight were transferred to 2 ml tubes sc micro tube pcr pt sarstedt germany the tubes were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c the samples were freeze dried and weighed to determine dry weight before co extraction of dna and rna using a modified protocol with the power microbiome rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad usa albers et al 2015b the extracted rna was immediately converted to cdna as previously described feld et al 2016 in addition dna extractions were made at selected time points for amplicon sequencing of the 16 rrna gene using the powerlyzer powersoil dna isolation 159 kit mobio carlsbad california 2 5 qpcr total bacterial numbers and activity were quantified by qpcr targeting the 16s rrna sequence using forward primer 341f 5

al 2016 modified to use 5 μl of the pcr product as the template with an elongation step of 40 s at 68 c in the pcr cycle the final pcr products were purified with highprep pcr magnetic beads magbio genomics inc gaithersburg maryland us according to the manufacturer s instructions and eluted in 27 μl te buffer the concentrations of the amplified and purified dna samples were measured on a qubit 2

results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of the enriched nitrifying bacterial consortium the original waterworks sand filter was found to contain 109 total bacteria per gram of filter material while the enriched nitrifying consortium contained 107 total bacteria per gram of sand sequencing of these samples revealed that the bacterial community in the original sand filter was dominated by nitrospira which constituted 88 at class level fig 2 other classes identified were in decreasing abundance betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria opitutae sphingobacteria fig s1 the sand containing the enriched nitrifying consortium was dominated by gammaproteobacteria 81 followed by betaproteobacteria 10 sphingobacteria 3 cytophagia 2 and alphaproteobacteria 2 as well as three more classes all 1 and unclassified other fig 2 and fig s1 nitrospira was not detectable in the consortium the gammaproteobacteria found to be highly abundant in the nitrifying consortium were a single otu that could not be classified to lower phylogenetic level in the silva database this otu was present in all samples even in the sterilised quartz sand suggesting that it was either contamination from the dna extraction kits from the other reagents salter et al 2014 or from dna persisting in the quartz sand after autoclaving unnithan et al 2015 a blast search of this sequence in the ncbi database indicated that it is a member of the pseudomonas genus and therefore not likely to be of relevance in nitrification processes we will therefore not consider this otu further in the discussion of the nitrifying consortium with the focus on otus involved in the nitrification processes the original sand filter material was dominated by nitrospira 88 with a detectable but low abundance of candidatus nitrotoga nitrite oxidisers and nitrosomonas ammonium oxidisers both at 0 02 fig s1 the enriched nitrifying consortium did not contain any nitrospira but the nitrifying betaproteobacteria candidatus nitrotoga and nitrosomonas had increased 1000 times in relative abundance fig s1 excluding the unknown gammaproteobacterium whose dna was also present in the sterilised sand this increase was even higher making the nitrite oxidiser candidatus nitrotoga the most abundant bacterium in the enriched nitrifying consortium in conclusion the nitrifying bacteria that were enriched were different from the established ones that dominated the original filter material it has been shown that the complete nitrification process may be carried out by certain nitrospira bacteria van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 and that these may be present in water purification systems pinto et al 2016 the high dominance of nitrospira in the original sand filter suggests that this was the case at the islevbro waterworks the reason for the enrichment of candidatus nitrotoga and nitrosomonas was most likely the diverging laboratory conditions high static concentration of ammonium compared to the conditions at the waterworks low concentrations with high flow this is discussed further in section 3 3 1 3 2 initiation of nitrification in laboratory filters we used the enriched nitrifying consortium as an inoculation culture in laboratory column experiments to evaluate its function under conditions closer to those found in a waterworks sand filter i e with continuous flow but under controlled conditions the results showed that nitrification was complete within a month regardless of the amount of enriched sand 1 10 or 50 mixed into sterilised sand fig 3 a however the more inoculum there was the quicker the start up of the nitrification process and at 1 enriched sand nitrite oxidation could not keep pace with the ammonium oxidation resulting in nitrite in the outlet between two and four weeks after start up the experiment was repeated with 4 enriched sand in triplicate columns which showed a quick start up of ammonium oxidation but with some nitrite leaking from the columns in the first four weeks fig 3b the difference between replicate columns was small a control column without inoculation showed no nitrification except some nitrite formation at the very end of the experiment the reason for this was most likely colonisation with ammonium oxidising bacteria from laboratory air as the solutions and equipment has been sterilised before the experiment the nitrite oxidiser candidatus nitrotoga was the most abundant bacterium in the inoculated columns at the end of the experiment it increased in abundance from 11 start inoc to 55 5 inlet 42 6 middle and 36 11 outlet at the end of the experiment fig s1 the ammonium oxidising nitrosomonas also increased in relative abundance from 0 1 to 8 0 2 inlet 9 2 middle and 5 2 outlet fig s1 these in addition to other betaprotobacteria account for the dominance of this phylogenetic class at the end of the experiment fig s2 together nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrotoga must be responsible for the complete nitrification process fig 3b given that no nitrospira or other nitrifying bacteria were found in the laboratory columns analysis by qpcr revealed that the total number of bacteria increased drastically during the laboratory column experiment from 2 105 16s rrna gene copies per gram sand to 108 g 1 in all three inoculated columns since nitrifying bacteria dominated in the inoculated columns most of this increase must be due to growth of bacteria present in the nitrifying inoculum however the number of otus increased from 21 4 4 enriched consortium mixed with autoclaved sand to 65 4 inlet 60 3 middle and 66 5 outlet bacterial growth in the columns was therefore not exclusively due to the growth of nitrifying bacteria in the non inoculated column 6 106 16s gene copies per gram of sand were present at the end of the experiment corresponding to approximately 20 times less than in the inoculated columns sequencing of dna extracted from sand from this column showed that 60 otus were present at all depths somewhat similar to the inoculated columns at the end of the experiment the ammonium oxidising nitrosomonas was relatively abundant 7 25 depending on depth while nitrite oxidisers candidatus nitrotoga were only detected at one depth middle in 0 1 abundance this fits well with the observation that nitrite started leaking from the non inoculated column at day 36 3 3 priming of nitrification in pilot scale sand filters at a waterworks to move one step closer to full scale sand filters an experiment was conducted at a waterworks with pilot scale sand filters operated exactly like full scale filters but with smaller volumes the smaller volumes allowed inoculum sand to be produced in a standard research laboratory and the construction of replicate filters with good monitoring opportunities such as multilevel sampling ports fig 1 the inlet concentrations in the aerated raw water were stable at 0 31 0 35 mg l ammonium n and the filters experienced no major breakdown during the 56 days of operation conditions were therefore relatively stable for the inoculated bacteria as well as for the groundwater bacteria colonising the filters from experience full nitrification under such conditions takes between one and several months and on occasion full nitrification is never achieved in the present case nitrification was found to be complete 0 01 mg l nitrite n in the outlets after 42 days in the non inoculated filters and after 31 days in the inoculated filters fig 4 as in the laboratory columns a nitrite peak was observed in the pilot scale sand filters this nitrite formation started roughly 10 days earlier in the inoculated filters than in the non inoculated ones and also ended roughly 10 days earlier the total oxygen consumption of the inoculated filters was also much higher than in the non inoculated filters from day 17 31 fig s3 extractions of dna and rrna from the top of the filters confirmed a higher total density as well as activity of bacteria in the inoculated filters throughout the study period but especially during the first three weeks fig s4 a 10 day earlier start up will be an environmental as well as an economic benefit to water production companies by reducing the amount of abstracted water that is wasted and the energy that is used during start up for example the yearly waste of water and energy during start up of new rapid sand filters is estimated to 5 10 million m3 groundwater and 1 million kwh just in danish waterworks peter borch krüger a s pers comm however it is very likely that more research in producing an inoculum with more cells than we were able to achieve in the culture flasks 105 106 16s rrna gene copies per gram sand would shorten the start up time of inoculated sand filters additionally the priming technology will have the greatest benefits in waterworks where new sand filters require several months or even years to establish a satisfying nitrification process also a more predictable start up of new rapid sand filters may make biological treatment of groundwater more widespread with the added benefits of less consumption of energy and chemicals depth profiles for the three nitrogen compounds in the filters showed an interesting pattern fig 5 although the filters were inoculated at the top ammonium oxidation occurred throughout the filters as soon as this process started fig 5 days 17 and 28 this seems also to have been the case for nitrite oxidation fig 5 day 28 these results show that the inoculated bacteria had a priming effect outside the inoculated top part of the filters most likely by seeding deeper parts the groundwater bacteria that colonise the non inoculated filters seemed to result in a similar overall depth pattern but delayed compared to the inoculated filters fig 5 ammonium oxidation has recently been studied in the 27 year old full scale rapid sand filter at the islevbro waterworks from which the enriched nitrifying consortium originated lee et al 2014 in that study it was concluded that ammonium oxidation was complete within the top 20 cm with more than 50 occurring in the top 10 cm the experimental filters were therefore probably not at steady state after 56 days of operation and changes in the depth pattern could be expected after prolonged operation 3 3 1 bacterial community analysis in pilot scale sand filters sequencing data showed that overall the bacterial communities in both the inoculated and non inoculated sand filters were similar at class level throughout the period of operation fig s5 betaproteobacteria dominated the communities mainly represented by members of nitrosomonadales with gallionella iron oxidisers nitrosomonas ammonium oxidisers and candidatus nitrotoga nitrite oxidisers as the most abundant fig 6 a principal coordinate analysis comparing all otus across all sequenced top samples shows at least three very interesting features fig 7 first of all variation between replicates of both inoculated and non inoculated sand filters is very small showing that two replicate filters is sufficient to compare tendencies in inoculated and non inoculated filters secondly along the first axis explaining almost two third of the dataset variation there is a clear change with time in both inoculated and non inoculated filters showing that they all change toward a common community composition at day 56 thirdly it seems that inoculated filters are about 10 days ahead in this microbial community change this is similar to the behaviour observed with regards to nitrification figs 4 and 5 the pattern and development in the relative abundance of the specific bacterial groups known to be involved in the nitrification can be seen in fig 8 it is clear that nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrotoga were much more abundant in the inoculated filters the first month after inoculation as would be expected from the laboratory column experiments interestingly however the same two species slowly colonised the non inoculated filters over time fig 8 with a delay corresponding well with the delay in nitrification figs 4 and 5 by the end of the experiment the nitrite oxidising candidatus nitrotoga were equally abundant in the inoculated and non inoculated filters while the ammonium oxidising nitrosomonas started to decrease in relative abundance in the inoculated filters this suggests that other ammonium oxidising bacteria start to take over the process of ammonium oxidation once it is fully established in the original fully established filter at the waterworks nitrospira was the dominant bacterial group fig 2 and nitrosomonas had a very low abundance fig s1 it is therefore likely that species within nitrospira carried out both nitrification steps in the original fully established filter this supports the recent identification of comammox like nitrospira at the same waterworks palomo et al 2016 it is therefore very interesting that nitrospira slowly colonised both the inoculated and non inoculated filters over time fig 6 the most obvious interpretation of this is that slow growing commamox nitrospira will be the most important nitrifiers in fully established rapid sand filters no matter if these are inoculated with the nitrifying consortium or not the inoculation is therefore accelerating the normal nitrification start up process but not changing the final nitrification functionality in the filters a shortcut might be to use a microbiome of the final nitrifiers commamox nitrospira to prime sand filters however enrichment of these organisms may be very difficult to attain and it is uncertain if these potentially slow growing bacteria in reality can shorten start up time significantly the number of bacterial otus was stable at around 120 over time in both inoculated and non inoculated filters which was twice the number in the laboratory columns the reason for the higher number of otus was most likely that the seeding occurred from the diverse groundwater community and perhaps more importantly that diversity in energy sources in groundwater was greater compared to the prepared medium with ammonium as the only added source of energy for example the iron oxidisers such as the abundant gallionella would not find suitable energy sources in the laboratory setup sampling of sand for sequencing was also performed at 40 cm depth at certain time points however extractions of these samples provided insufficient amounts of dna for sequencing to be successful except on day 56 when the experiment was terminated at that time all three nitrifying bacterial groups observed at the top of the filters nitrosomonas candidatus nitrotoga nitrospira were abundant also at depth fig 6 constituting 23 42 of the otus overall this suggests that nitrification also occurred at this depth which corresponds well with the depth profiles of nitrogen compounds in the filters fig 5 in conclusion the bacterial community analysis showed at least two important findings in order to understand the observed development in nitrification figs 4 and 5 firstly nitrification started up with betaproteobacteria nitrosomonas candidatus nitrotoga as the dominant nitrifiers this happened whether or not the filters were inoculated with the enriched nitrifying consortium the only difference between inoculated and non inoculated filters was the time taken for the nitrification to start secondly nitrospira seemed to take over the nitrification process in both the non inoculated and inoculated filters and both of these therefore slowly adapted towards the bacterial community in the original fully established filter it was not possible to determine the time taken until some kind of steady state would be reached in the filters in the present study but it did seem to be much longer than the 40 50 days that it took for nitrification to be complete with half saturation constants km of between 9 and 27 μm nitrite and a low maximum nitrite oxidation specific activity nitrospira bacteria are known as k strategists adapted to live at very low nitrite concentrations nowka et al 2015 nitrotoga are less studied but one nitrotoga species has been found to have a half saturation constant of 58 μm nitrite somewhat higher than the nitrospira species nowka et al 2015 differences in life strategies including nitrite affinity may therefore be an important reason for nitrotoga being enriched in the laboratory cultures as well as during initial stages in the sand filter however the low km of nitrospira allowed it to reach high population densities despite nitrite limitation as will occur when nitrification is complete in the sand filters therefore nitrospira became more dominant by the end of the sand filter experiment fig 6 and is often found to be dominant in well functioning rapid sand filters de vet et al 2009 white et al 2012 albers et al 2015a pinto et al 2016 nitrospira was also very abundant in the original sand filter from which the nitrifying consortium was enriched fig 2 similarly nitrospira in laboratory flow through systems has recently been found to dominate at low loading concentrations of nitrite while candidatus nitrotoga dominated at higher loading conditions kinnunen et al 2017 future studies should investigate whether a life strategy benefiting from low fluxes of substrate is also true for comammox nitrospira which is likely to be a key player in waterworks treating groundwater that depend on the biological oxidation of ammonium 4 conclusions our study featured the first successful priming of nitrification in a groundwater treating rapid sand filter it was demonstrated that nitrifying communities can be enriched by microbiomes from well functioning rapid sand filters in waterworks and that the enriched nitrifying consortium can be used to inoculate fresh filters significantly shortening the start up time of the nitrification process the key nitrifiers in the enrichment were different from the ones in the well functioning filter but similar to the ones that initiate the nitrification process in fresh filters without inoculation irrespective of whether the nitrification was primed with the enriched nitrifying consortium the bacteria performing the nitrification process during start up seemed to be outcompeted slowly by nitrospira the dominant nitrifying bacterium in the well functioning rapid sand filter more investigations should be carried out to obtain a final technology to be used in real waterworks however there are excellent prospects if it becomes possible to control the start up process of nitrification in this type of biological rapid sand filter enormous quantities of water may be saved during the start up of new filters and a more stable start up may make biological treatment of groundwater more widespread with the added benefits of less consumption of energy and chemicals in waterworks

19824,ammonium oxidation to nitrite and then to nitrate nitrification is a key process in many waterworks treating groundwater to make it potable in rapid sand filters nitrifying microbial communities may evolve naturally from groundwater bacteria entering the filters however in new filters this may take several months and in some cases the nitrification process is never sufficiently rapid to be efficient or is only performed partially with nitrite as an undesired end product the present study reports the first successful priming of nitrification in a rapid sand filter treating groundwater it

nitrification bioaugmentation microbiome priming 1 introduction ammonium oxidation to nitrite and then to nitrate nitrification is a key process in many waterworks treating groundwater to make it potable in northern europe in particular but in many other places as well microbial oxidation is preferred over chemical oxidation with chlorine in rapid sand filters which are widespread in the purification of groundwater for use as drinking water nitrifying microbial communities may evolve naturally from the groundwater bacteria that enter the filters lytle et al 2007 rittmann et al 2012 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 in most cases nitrification starts within one to four months of operation during which time the water cannot be distributed to consumers lytle et al 2007 tekerlekopoulou et

process in waterworks sand filters would be of great benefit to drinking water production companies microbial nitrification has traditionally been viewed as two separate processes ammonium oxidation was thought to be carried out by nitrosomonas a betaproteobacterium white et al 2012 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 and nitrite oxidising bacteria such as nitrospira and nitrobacter were expected to complete the nitrification process de vet et al 2009 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 albers et al 2015a recently however it has been shown that the complete nitrification process may be carried out by

samples for the analysis of ammonium and nitrate were stored cold and analysed on the day of sampling samples for analysis of nitrate were kept frozen until analysis 2 2 enrichment and maintenance of nitrifying bacteria the nitrifying consortium was enriched from filter material that originated in a rapid sand filter located at islevbro waterworks copenhagen denmark the sand filter community in this particular filter has previously been described and compared with other rapid sand filters in danish waterworks albers et al 2015a the filter is 27 years old and its primary function is to remove manganese and ammonium it receives water from a chalk aquifer 11 93 m depth below surface and before the groundwater enters the filter it is aerated and most of the dissolved iron removed the concentration of ammonium in the filter s inlet water is 0 3 mg l in march 2015 filter sand was sampled from the top of the second filter i e after pre filtration into sterilised glass jars and stored at 5 c until enrichment of the nitrifying consortium the enrichment procedure started in sterile 500 ml blue cap bottles with 200 g sterilised quartz sand 1 2 2 0 mm inoculated with 10 g original filter material supplemented with 250 ml mineral growth medium according to pitcher et al 2010 the ammonium concentration used was 1 mm 18 mg l 1 after two weeks all ammonium in the bottle was degraded and 2 g of sand was transferred to a bottle with 200 g sterilised quartz sand and 250 ml fresh medium this transfer was repeated four times at intervals of 8 15 days following complete ammonium degradation in the bottle the enrichment was undertaken in darkness at 10 c on an orbital shaker the enriched nitrifying consortium was maintained on quartz sand 1 2 2 0 mm in an incubator at 10 c the growth medium in the bottles was refreshed at 14 days intervals by removing the supernatant and adding fresh medium attempts to make cryocultures or to freeze dry the consortium failed to yield regrowth of a functional nitrifying consortium it was therefore essential to maintain the active nitrifying consortium production of larger volumes of the enriched nitrifying consortium for laboratory columns and mesocosm sand filter experiment starter culture was done under similar conditions as the enrichment described above but in 1 l bottles containing 750 g sterilised quartz sand and 500 ml growth medium 2 3 laboratory column setup the nitrifying consortium was further tested and enriched in laboratory columns h20 ø1 6 cm run at 10 c with a continuous upward flow of 4 8 ml h which gave an approximate water residence time of 3 h the medium used was the same as that used during isolation but was diluted five times to give an ammonium concentration of 3 6 mg l quartz sand 0 8 1 4 mm 99 0 sio2 dki denmark was steam sterilised mixed with sand containing the enriched nitrifying consortium and wet packed into the columns sterilised with 0 01 m naoh the columns were not operated under strictly sterile conditions at the end of the experiment sand was sampled in triplicate from the inlet middle and outlet parts of the columns for extraction of dna and further processing by qpcr and sequencing dna was extracted using the powerlyzer powersoil dna isolation 159 kit mobio carlsbad california as previously described by ellegaard jensen et al 2016 2 4 mesocosm sand filter experiment in a waterworks a pilot scale sand filter system was set up at the same waterworks from where the enriched nitrifying consortium originated islevbro copenhagen and was run for eight weeks the system consisted of four parallel filter columns each made of a plexiglas cylinder h200 ø18 cm operated with adjustable downward flow fig 1 the columns were filled with 78 cm quartz sand 1 2 2 0 mm 99 3 sio2 dki denmark on top of 20 cm coarser material 10 cm 50 80 mm quartz and 10 cm 30 50 mm quartz after one day of operation and one backwashing procedure 4 cm 1 l of sand containing the enriched nitrifying consortium was added on top of two filters and 4 cm of non inoculated sand was added to two control columns the sand filters received water from the waterworks just after aeration of the abstracted raw water with no pre filtration the key water parameters of the inlet water were 0 3 0 4 mg l ammonium 2 mg l iron 0 04 mg l manganese 10 mg l oxygen 2 mg l non volatile organic carbon 0 02 mg l nitrite 0 05 mg l nitrate 0 02 mg l methane ph of 7 3 and a temperature of 9 10 c the water flow was 70 l h which corresponded to 2 8 m h or an empty bed contact time in the 80 cm filters of 17 min this corresponded to a water residence time of 7 min assuming a porosity of 0 40 backwashing was performed every four days with filtrated water only 8 min 20 l min water was sampled from three ports at each filter located 10 cm below the sand filter surface 70 cm below the surface and at the outlets of the columns samples for ammonium nitrite and nitrate analysis were collected in 15 ml centrifuge tubes sarstedt germany after filtration in the field 0 22 μm q max polyethersulfone filters frisenette denmark within the day of sampling the water was analysed for ammonium and nitrite while samples for nitrate analysis were stored frozen until analysis oxygen and ph were measured in a flow cell in the field using a multimeter multi 3420 wtw germany filter material was sampled weekly from the top of the filters using a sterilised spoon and on three occasions also from a 40 cm depth using a custom made pipe system albers et al 2015b three subsamples of 0 5 g wet weight were transferred to 2 ml tubes sc micro tube pcr pt sarstedt germany the tubes were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c the samples were freeze dried and weighed to determine dry weight before co extraction of dna and rna using a modified protocol with the power microbiome rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad usa albers et al 2015b the extracted rna was immediately converted to cdna as previously described feld et al 2016 in addition dna extractions were made at selected time points for amplicon sequencing of the 16 rrna gene using the powerlyzer

results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of the enriched nitrifying bacterial consortium the original waterworks sand filter was found to contain 109 total bacteria per gram of filter material while the enriched nitrifying consortium contained 107 total bacteria per gram of sand sequencing of these samples revealed that the bacterial community in the original sand filter was dominated by nitrospira which constituted 88 at class level fig 2 other classes identified were in decreasing abundance betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria opitutae sphingobacteria fig s1 the sand containing the enriched nitrifying consortium was dominated by gammaproteobacteria 81 followed by betaproteobacteria 10 sphingobacteria 3 cytophagia 2 and alphaproteobacteria 2 as well as three more classes all 1 and unclassified other fig 2 and fig s1 nitrospira was not detectable in the consortium the gammaproteobacteria found to be highly abundant in the nitrifying consortium were a single otu that could not be classified to lower phylogenetic level in the silva database this otu was present in all samples even in the sterilised quartz sand suggesting that it was either contamination from the dna extraction kits from the other reagents salter et al 2014 or from dna persisting in the quartz sand after autoclaving unnithan et al 2015 a blast search of this sequence in the ncbi database indicated that it is a member of the pseudomonas genus and therefore not likely to be of relevance in nitrification processes we will therefore not consider this otu further in the discussion of the nitrifying consortium with the focus on otus involved in the nitrification processes the original sand filter material was dominated by nitrospira 88 with a detectable but low abundance of candidatus nitrotoga nitrite oxidisers and nitrosomonas ammonium oxidisers both at 0 02 fig s1 the enriched nitrifying consortium did not contain any nitrospira but the nitrifying betaproteobacteria candidatus nitrotoga and nitrosomonas had increased 1000 times in relative abundance fig s1 excluding the unknown gammaproteobacterium whose dna was also present in the sterilised sand this increase was even higher making the nitrite oxidiser candidatus nitrotoga the most abundant bacterium in the enriched nitrifying consortium in conclusion the nitrifying bacteria that were enriched were different from the established ones that dominated the original filter material it has been shown that the complete nitrification process may be carried out by certain nitrospira bacteria van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 and that these may be present in water purification systems pinto et al 2016 the high dominance of nitrospira in the original sand filter suggests that this was the case at the islevbro waterworks the reason for the enrichment of candidatus nitrotoga and nitrosomonas was most likely the diverging laboratory conditions high static concentration of ammonium compared to the conditions at the waterworks low concentrations with high flow this is discussed further in section 3 3 1 3 2 initiation of nitrification in laboratory filters we used the enriched nitrifying consortium as an inoculation culture in laboratory column experiments to evaluate its function under conditions closer to those found in a waterworks sand filter i e with continuous flow but under controlled conditions the results showed that nitrification was complete within a month regardless of the amount of enriched sand 1 10 or 50 mixed into sterilised sand fig 3 a however the more inoculum there was the quicker the start up of the nitrification process and at 1 enriched sand nitrite oxidation could not keep pace with the ammonium oxidation resulting in nitrite in the outlet between two and four weeks after start up the experiment was repeated with 4 enriched sand in triplicate columns which showed a quick start up of ammonium oxidation but with some nitrite leaking from the columns in the first four weeks fig 3b the difference between replicate columns was small a control column without inoculation showed no nitrification except some nitrite formation at the very end of the experiment the reason for this was most likely colonisation with ammonium oxidising bacteria from laboratory air as the solutions and equipment has been sterilised before the experiment the nitrite oxidiser candidatus nitrotoga was the most abundant bacterium in the inoculated columns at the end of the experiment it increased in abundance from 11 start inoc to 55 5 inlet 42 6 middle and 36 11 outlet at the end of the experiment fig s1 the ammonium oxidising nitrosomonas also increased in relative abundance from 0 1 to 8 0 2 inlet 9 2 middle and 5 2 outlet fig s1 these in addition to other betaprotobacteria account for the dominance of this phylogenetic class at the end of the experiment fig s2 together nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrotoga must be responsible for the complete nitrification process fig 3b given that no nitrospira or other nitrifying bacteria were found in the laboratory columns analysis by qpcr revealed that the total number of bacteria increased drastically during the laboratory column experiment from 2 105 16s rrna gene copies per gram sand to 108 g 1 in all three inoculated columns since nitrifying bacteria dominated in the inoculated columns most of this increase must be due to growth of bacteria present in the nitrifying inoculum however the number of otus increased from 21 4 4 enriched consortium mixed with autoclaved sand to 65 4 inlet 60 3 middle and 66 5 outlet bacterial growth in the columns was therefore not exclusively due to the growth of nitrifying bacteria in the non inoculated column 6 106 16s gene copies per gram of sand were present at the end of the experiment corresponding to approximately 20 times less than in the inoculated columns sequencing of dna extracted from sand from this column showed that 60 otus were present at all depths somewhat similar to the inoculated columns at the end of the experiment the ammonium oxidising nitrosomonas was relatively abundant 7 25 depending on depth while nitrite oxidisers candidatus nitrotoga were only detected at one depth middle in 0 1 abundance this fits well with the observation that nitrite started leaking from the non inoculated column at day 36 3 3 priming of nitrification in pilot scale sand filters at a waterworks to move one step closer to full scale sand filters an experiment was conducted at a waterworks with pilot scale sand filters operated exactly like full scale filters but with smaller volumes the smaller volumes allowed inoculum sand to be produced in a standard research laboratory and the construction of replicate filters with good monitoring opportunities such as multilevel sampling ports fig 1 the inlet concentrations in the aerated raw water were stable at 0 31 0 35 mg l ammonium n and the filters experienced no major breakdown during the 56 days of operation conditions were therefore relatively stable for the inoculated bacteria as well as for the groundwater bacteria colonising the filters from experience full nitrification under such conditions takes between one and several months and on occasion full nitrification is never achieved in the present case nitrification was found to be complete 0 01 mg l nitrite n in the outlets after 42 days in the non inoculated filters and after 31 days in the inoculated filters fig 4 as in the laboratory columns a nitrite peak was observed in the pilot scale sand filters this nitrite formation started roughly 10 days earlier in the inoculated filters than in the non inoculated ones and also ended roughly 10 days earlier the total oxygen consumption of the inoculated filters was also much higher than in the non inoculated filters from day 17 31 fig s3 extractions of dna and rrna from the top of the filters confirmed a higher total density as well as activity of bacteria in the inoculated filters throughout the study period but especially during the first three weeks fig s4 a 10 day earlier start up will be an environmental as well as an economic benefit to water production companies by reducing the amount of abstracted water that is wasted and the energy that is used during start up for example the yearly waste of water and energy during start up of new rapid sand filters is estimated to 5 10 million m3 groundwater and 1 million kwh just in danish waterworks peter borch krüger a s pers comm however it is very likely that more research in producing an inoculum with more cells than we were able to achieve in the culture flasks 105 106 16s rrna gene copies per gram sand would shorten the start up time of inoculated sand filters additionally the priming technology will have the greatest benefits in waterworks where new sand filters require several months or even years to establish a satisfying nitrification process also a more predictable start up of new rapid sand filters may make biological treatment of groundwater more widespread with the added benefits of less consumption of energy and chemicals depth profiles for the three nitrogen compounds in the filters showed an interesting pattern fig 5 although the filters were inoculated at the top ammonium oxidation occurred throughout the filters as soon as this process started fig 5 days 17 and 28 this seems also to have been the case for nitrite oxidation fig 5 day 28 these results show that the inoculated bacteria had a priming effect outside the inoculated top part of the filters most likely by seeding deeper parts the groundwater bacteria that colonise the non inoculated filters seemed to result in a similar overall depth pattern but delayed compared to the inoculated filters fig 5 ammonium oxidation has recently been studied in the 27 year old full scale rapid sand filter at the islevbro waterworks from which the enriched nitrifying consortium originated lee et al 2014 in that study it was concluded that ammonium oxidation was complete within the top 20 cm with more than 50 occurring in the top 10 cm the experimental filters were therefore probably not at steady state after 56 days of operation and changes in the depth pattern could be expected after prolonged operation 3 3 1 bacterial community analysis in pilot scale sand filters sequencing data showed that overall the bacterial communities in both the inoculated and non inoculated sand filters were similar at class level throughout the period of operation fig s5 betaproteobacteria dominated the communities mainly represented by members of nitrosomonadales with gallionella iron oxidisers nitrosomonas ammonium oxidisers and candidatus nitrotoga nitrite oxidisers as the most abundant fig 6 a principal coordinate analysis comparing all otus across all sequenced top samples shows at least three very interesting features fig 7 first of all variation between replicates of both inoculated and non inoculated sand filters is very small showing that two replicate filters is sufficient to compare tendencies in inoculated and non inoculated filters secondly along the first axis explaining almost two third of the dataset variation there is a clear change with time in both inoculated and non inoculated filters showing that they all change toward a common community composition at day 56 thirdly it seems that inoculated filters are about 10 days ahead in this microbial community change this is similar to the behaviour observed with regards to nitrification figs 4 and 5 the pattern and development in the relative abundance of the specific bacterial groups known to be involved in the nitrification can be seen in fig 8 it is clear that nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrotoga were much more abundant in the inoculated filters the first month after inoculation as would be expected from the laboratory column experiments interestingly however the same two species slowly colonised the non inoculated filters over time fig 8 with a delay corresponding well with the delay in nitrification figs 4 and 5 by the end of the experiment the nitrite oxidising candidatus nitrotoga were equally abundant in the inoculated and non inoculated filters while the ammonium oxidising nitrosomonas started to decrease in relative abundance in the inoculated filters this suggests that other ammonium oxidising bacteria start to take over the process of ammonium oxidation once it is fully established in the original fully established filter at the waterworks nitrospira was the dominant bacterial group fig 2 and nitrosomonas had a very low abundance fig s1 it is therefore likely that species within nitrospira carried out both nitrification steps in the original fully established filter this supports the recent identification of comammox like nitrospira at the same waterworks palomo et al 2016 it is therefore very interesting that nitrospira slowly colonised both the inoculated and non inoculated filters over time fig 6 the most obvious interpretation of this is that slow growing commamox nitrospira will be the most important nitrifiers in fully established rapid sand filters no matter if these are inoculated with the nitrifying consortium or not the inoculation is therefore accelerating the normal nitrification start up process but not changing the final nitrification functionality in the filters a shortcut might be to use a microbiome of the final nitrifiers commamox nitrospira to prime sand filters however enrichment of these organisms may be very difficult to attain and it is uncertain if these potentially slow growing bacteria in reality can shorten start up time significantly the number of bacterial otus was stable at around 120 over time in both inoculated and non inoculated filters which was twice the number in the laboratory columns the reason for the higher number of otus was most likely that the seeding occurred from the diverse groundwater community and perhaps more importantly that diversity in energy sources in groundwater was greater compared to the prepared medium with ammonium as the only added source of energy for example the iron oxidisers such as the abundant gallionella would not find suitable energy sources in the laboratory setup sampling of sand for sequencing was also performed at 40 cm depth at certain time points however extractions of these samples provided insufficient amounts of dna for sequencing to be successful except on day 56 when the experiment was terminated at that time all three nitrifying bacterial groups observed at the top of the filters nitrosomonas candidatus nitrotoga nitrospira were abundant also at depth fig 6 constituting 23 42 of the otus overall this suggests that nitrification also occurred at this depth which corresponds well with the depth profiles of nitrogen compounds in the filters fig 5 in conclusion the bacterial community analysis showed at least two important findings in order to understand the observed development in nitrification figs 4 and 5 firstly nitrification started up with betaproteobacteria nitrosomonas candidatus nitrotoga as the dominant nitrifiers this happened whether or not the filters were inoculated with the enriched nitrifying consortium the only difference between inoculated and non inoculated filters was the time taken for the nitrification to start secondly nitrospira seemed to take over the nitrification process in both the non inoculated and inoculated filters and both of these therefore slowly adapted towards the bacterial community in the original fully established filter it was not possible to determine the time taken until some kind of steady state would be reached in the filters in the present study but it did seem to be much longer than the 40 50 days that it took for nitrification to be complete with half saturation constants km of between 9 and 27 μm nitrite and a low maximum nitrite oxidation specific activity nitrospira bacteria are known as k strategists adapted to live at very low nitrite concentrations nowka et al 2015 nitrotoga are less studied but one nitrotoga species has been found to have a half saturation constant of 58 μm nitrite somewhat higher than the nitrospira species nowka et al 2015 differences in life strategies including nitrite affinity may therefore be an important reason for nitrotoga being enriched in the laboratory cultures as well as during initial stages in the sand filter however the low km of nitrospira allowed it to reach high population densities despite nitrite limitation as will occur when nitrification is complete in the sand filters therefore nitrospira became more dominant by the end of the sand filter experiment fig 6 and is often found to be dominant in well functioning rapid sand filters de vet et al 2009 white et al 2012 albers et al 2015a pinto et al 2016 nitrospira was also very abundant in the original sand filter from which the nitrifying consortium was enriched fig 2 similarly nitrospira in laboratory flow through systems has recently been found to dominate at low loading concentrations of nitrite while candidatus nitrotoga dominated at higher loading conditions kinnunen et al 2017 future studies should investigate whether a life strategy benefiting from low fluxes of substrate is also true for comammox nitrospira which is likely to be a key player in waterworks treating groundwater that depend on the biological oxidation of ammonium 4 conclusions our study featured the first successful priming of nitrification in a groundwater treating rapid sand filter it was demonstrated that nitrifying communities can be enriched by microbiomes from well functioning rapid sand filters in waterworks and that the enriched nitrifying consortium can be used to inoculate fresh filters significantly shortening the start up time of the nitrification process the key nitrifiers in the enrichment were different from the ones in the well functioning filter but similar to the ones that initiate the nitrification process in fresh filters without inoculation irrespective of whether the nitrification was primed with the enriched nitrifying consortium the bacteria performing the nitrification process during start up seemed to be outcompeted slowly by nitrospira the dominant nitrifying bacterium in the well functioning rapid sand filter more investigations should be carried out to obtain a final technology to be used in real waterworks however there are excellent prospects if it becomes possible to control the start up process of nitrification in this type of biological rapid sand filter enormous quantities of water may be saved during the start up of new filters and a more stable start up may make biological treatment of groundwater more widespread with the added benefits of less consumption of energy and chemicals in waterworks
