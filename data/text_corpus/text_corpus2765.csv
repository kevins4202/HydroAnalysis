13825,biochar a solid carbon rich residue is derived from wide variety of abundantly available raw materials like forest and agricultural waste industrial by products and waste and municipal solid waste through pyrolysis besides enhancing soil fertility thereby agricultural productivity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions biochar based sorbents are widely being employed in waste water treatment owing to their attributes viz high porosity large surface area affinity towards metals surface modifications stability recyclability and even safe disposal in this comprehensive review latest trends w r t synthesis protocols modifications mechanisms metal removal comparison thermo kinetics mechanisms regeneration and safe disposal methods have been presented and discussed synthesis through slow pyrolysis 300 700 c 0 01 2 c s nanoscale modifications with metal oxides especially based on iron to magnetise the biochar regeneration through acids and complexation agents are found to be highly promising while ion exchange and electrostatic interactions are found to be common mechanisms of metal removal which in turn depends on nature of biomass process conditions and metal it is found that modifications and mechanisms are strongly interrelated from our studies biochar based sorbents gave heavy metal adsorption capacities in mg g of 1217 ag 560 pb 288 cu 216 cd 204 as 130 cr

on biomass have been widely employed in waste water treatment to remove harmful contaminants like fluorides and heavy metals 1 4 heavy metal pollution which negatively affects human health is a major global concern heavy metals are non biodegradable and are transferred along the food chain through the process of bioaccumulation heavy metals such as nickel copper lead chromium and arsenic pose a risk to both indigenous habitats and human health 5 alike table 1 summarizes a list of heavy metals with current maximum permissible amounts of contaminants by indian standards 6 the human body requires only trace amounts of these metals and exceeding these limits could prove to be fatal hence the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water is both important and urgent 7 for example cadmium is a prevalent heavy metal that causes adverse effects in humans such as nausea diarrhoea and liver damage when ingested inhaled or absorbed by the skin another heavy metal that causes serious environmental and human health related problems is nickel which also happens to be a carcinogen responsible for lung and bone cancer in addition to triggering dermatitis and eczema 8 copper zinc and mercury are some of the other metals commonly found industrial effluents excess concentrations of these metals in the water stream can cause maladies related to liver kidneys as well as affect the nervous gastrointestinal and hematopoietic systems 9 lead pb has long been one of the most recyclable and reusable heavy metals it is employed in the manufacture and recycling of batteries particularly in the automotive paint pipe and petrol industries lead adversely affects the nervous system gastrointestinal tract the lungs and reproductive system and induces neurobehavioral deficiencies 10 similarly other metals such as chromium arsenic and silver have also been classified as extremely hazardous for the biosphere hence effective methods for remediating the contamination caused by these metals is of utmost importance to the general well being of the biosphere the ongoing worldwide trends indicate a stronger need to accomplish better ecological norms with minimal utilization of resources for the treatment of effluents cost effectiveness and specialized pertinence are the two vital criteria in the choice of effective adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in the recent past adsorption 11 technology was found to be widely deployed in the treatment of wastewater adsorption owing to its various pros such as operation with green sorbents cost effectiveness higher efficiency a wide selection of established adsorbents derived from agricultural and industrial wastes easy regeneration low energy requirements etc is highly popular adsorption 11 is the strategy of mass exchange by which the material is moved from the fluid stage to the surface of solid and bound by chemical physical interactions traditional methods such as adsorption 12 15 chemical precipitation 16 19 membrane filtration 20 ion exchange 21 25 and electrochemical treatment technologies 26 were found to be costly affairs and thus not beneficial for low concentration of heavy metals 27 precipitation produces large amounts of relatively low quality sludge which may pose problems with dewatering and disposal 28 such processes were shown to be successful at experimental stages but not on an industrial scale to overcome these problems studies are being conducted on biosorption biosorption is a process independent of energy where heavy metals are adsorbed on the cell surface or active site of an adsorbate the main benefits of biosorption are in its high efficiency in the removal of heavy metal ions and the use of low cost biosorbents these methods are more suited for the treatment of dilute heavy metal wastewater 29 bio sorbents are most commonly produced through the simple carbonization of economical and abundantly available biomass materials viz bagasse straw shells of different materials like peanuts eggs etc besides microbes like bacteria and algae 30 biochar is one such biosorbent derived from the pyrolysis of various types of biomass materials mentioned above while bio sorbents also include the adsorbents derived from biomass from various other carbonization routes of the biomass including modifications 11 31 36 biochar also known as pyrogenic black carbon as it is produced through pyrolysis is nothing but a carbon rich material with attractive attributes like high permeability good porosity large surface area 5 37 38 besides these attributes its affinity towards different functional groups makes it an attractive option to adsorb various heavy metals onto its surface thereby leading to effective wastewater treatment there have been studies to utilize cottonwood corn stalk pinewood chestnut shell clay egg white and other agricultural wastes modification of the chemical structure of biochar based sorbents is a promising and attractive way to confer biochar specificity the process for the elimination of heavy metals relies on the concentration of the pollutants and the chemical properties of the adsorbent surface 39 the variations in organic composition electrical properties and functional groups of biochar based sorbents provide significant explanations for the difference in the observed adsorption mechanisms 40 fig 1 demonstrates the general mechanism for adsorption approaches to the alteration of biochar based sorbents including chemical modification impregnation of mineral sorbents steam activation and magnetic modification have been widely studied 41 43 harikishore kumar reddy lee 2014 44 used pine bark waste loaded with cobalt and iron to remove heavy metal from metal industry effluent pine bark after modification showed excellent results in the removal of cd ii and fe ii ions similarly a study was done by xiao et al 2020 45 on cow bone modified with the ball milling technique showed good results in the removal of cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions the use of untreated biosorbents poses difficulties such as a low adsorption efficiency and high release of organic material which consequentially increases cod bod and toc pre treatment is frequently advised to maintain adsorption efficiency in most cases it increases removal efficiency and selectivity in comparison to unmodified biosorbents this pre treatment can enhance ion exchange ability improve the formation of functional groups and provide a greater number of binding sites which in turn favours metal uptake it has been found that pre treatment modifications led to improved attributes in biochar based sorbents and thereby enhancing its performance fig 2 shows these trends 11 47 49 in a study by ahmad et al 2018 50 a banana peel compost was given thermal treatment it was observed that biochar based sorbents productivity was high due to the catalytic action of k during the pyrolytic conversion of the feedstock similarly modification of biochar based sorbents with nano zero valent iron increased its removal efficiency the existence of iron on the surface of biochar based sorbents increased the number of species of oxygen containing functional groups and enhanced complexation fig 3 displays the overall adsorption power of various ions using modified biochar in addition to the properties of adsorption the regenerative properties of the adsorbent are also important for an adsorbent to possess any sort of an industrial application it is imperative that it displays good cyclic stability for example a study by lata 2015 58 shows that desorption rates are high with a low concentration of acid but a low ph destroys the biochar based sorbents which in turn reduces the biomass however adsorption and desorption are opposite phenomena which means that the greater the adsorption capacity the more the affinity between the metal ions and the adsorbent which implies that the desorption process will be more unfavorable desorption is equally important however since it contributes to regeneration and recovery of the adsorbent and adsorbate molecules respectively reducing secondary pollution and the cost of the process the major challenge in the deployment of biosorbents in the field of metal removal is the recovery of liquid solvents which were used to regenerate the sorbents and researchers are hence focussing on the development of safe and green options in the downstream processing 11 several biochar based sorbents studies have been conducted to improve its adsorption properties and many have been successful magnetization impregnation of nanoparticles preparation of composites with other adsorbents and other modifications have been made by researchers in the last few years to make biochar based sorbents suitable for industrial applications this paper compiles the results of the recently prepared biochar based adsorbents where adsorbent adsorption capacity and process conditions have been discussed this paper also highlights the merits and demerits of each adsorbent produced making it easier to compare adsorbents synthesis techniques have been discussed to give the reader a better understanding of the requirements for the preparation of specific adsorbents 2 synthesis of biochar based adsorbents development of appropriate synthesis protocols is very critical in achieving the desired attributes in the adsorbent materials thereby leading to improved performance in terms of metal removal efficiency these synthesis protocols also control the overall process economics and impact on environment several methods have been used for the synthesis and modification of biochar based adsorbents the most common methods are shown in the table 2 below the properties of biosorbents are found to be dependent on the nature of biomass synthesis protocols employed along with modifications used besides the critical process and design parameters of the synthesis protocol viz temperature ph pyrolysis time material size etc 59 62 several factors like cost of preparation ease of synthesis specific area pore size mechanical strength adsorption capacity etc are considered to assess the efficacy of these methods biochar among various biosorbents has been found to be the most economical environmentally benign and effective biosorbent in heavy metal removal from waste water 63 64 its attributes like carbon richness large surface area high porosity and great affinity for heavy metals 65 pristine biochar can be prepared by slow pyrolysis fast pyrolysis gasification and combustion methods a variety of biomass wastes were reported to be used in the synthesis of biochar viz paper mill waste peanut hulls pine chips poultry litters forest plant biomass cotton seed hulls manures tyres animal bones agro industrial biomass municipal solid waste etc the nature of biomass material and pyrolysis conditions were found to play a critical role on the properties of biochar greater biochar yield is obtained with higher lignin content in the biomass while higher cellulose or hemicellulose content led to simpler thermal or chemical modifications to induce functional groups in slow pyrolysis longer residence times high pressures low temperatures of 300 c 700 c low heating rates of 0 01 2 c s are used this led to the production of larger quantities of biochar with greater particle size higher ash and lignin contents therefore this slow pyrolysis could be a low cost and robust option for small scale production of biochar in contrast to slow pyrolysis fast pyrolysis employs shorter residence times 2 s higher temperatures of 500 1000 c and rapid heating rates of 2 c s the drawback of this method is the lower yield of biochar 12 as well as high yield of bio oil 75 and non condensable gases 13 it was also found that fast pyrolysis at lower temperatures resulted in partly pyrolyzed biochar fractions vis a vis slow pyrolysis with longer residence times the third method of gasification to produce biochar leads to the conversion of biomass to gases like co2 co h2 and small amounts of ch4 by placing the biomass source in controlled oxygen environment at high temperatures of 700 800 c biochar produced is 10 through this method with remaining being gases and tar in the recent past modified biosorbents are being widely for improved metal removal efficiency even at low concentrations easy recovery and reuse due to several limitations of pristine biochar and other biosorbents metal induced sorbents or magnetic biosorbents biochar are being developed by incorporating metal nanoparticles viz iron nickel chromium titanium zirconium zinc copper and alloys 66 in the form of salts oxides etc which were found to have improved surface area pore size thermal stability crystalline nature surface functionality leading to higher adsorption capacity and easy recovery 67 the properties of magnetic biosorbents were found to be dependent on the nature of biomass itself metal nano particles modification methods besides process parameters like pyrolysis temperature and duration particle size 59 60 extent of magnetisation of biochar was found to be proportional to pyrolysis temperatures i e 4 28 emu g at 400 c and 36 8 emu g at 650 c ultrafine nanoparticles like metal oxides synthesized through various methods like sol gel aqueous sol gel ball milling hydrothermal precipitation methods could be used as successful modifiers to enhance the structural and thermal stability of the adsorbents 68 different types of modifications viz pre treatment single step post treatment modification double step microwave assisted modification hydrothermal modification etc are employed in the synthesis of magnetic biosorbents in the pre treatment method metal nanoparticles are incorporated into biomass before pyrolysis leading to a larger surface area porosity and superparamagnetic behaviour in the second method of post treatment biosorbents and nanoparticles are prepared separately before mixing however this is less efficient and more expensive than the pre treatment method microwave assisted synthesis of magnetic biosorbents is being used in the recent past as it is very rapid taking only 5 10 min but with highly improved adsorption capacity surface area pore volume 48 but with some difficulty in customization this method is replacing conventional pyrolysis in the synthesis of magnetic biochar though used less hydrothermal method is also reported where biomass feedstock is mixed with water at 100 350 c to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as they are held by water in very recent times engineering biochar and magnetic biosorbents are being explored as an innovative approach where plant tissues with bioaccumulation of metals or nanoparticles can be directly employed as biosorbents without any complex modification this is still in experimental phase and needs to be explored further 69 70 as they are found to exhibit improved physico chemical attributes and adsorption capacity magnetic biochar can also be produced using co precipitation method where a solute precipitates out from a solution through a carrier which forces the solute to bind it together instead of being dissolved this occurs through mechanisms of inclusion occlusion or surface adsorption calcination is also employed along with above mentioned methods to synthesize magnetic adsorbents in this process a carbon material is heated in the absence of fusion in a pressurized autoclave to remove water drive off gases and other volatile constituents leading to thermal decomposition 71 magnetic biochar synthesized using this method with fecl3 6h2o resulted in larger surface area diverse morphology from macro mesoporous structure high crystallinity besides simple recovery and reusability 72 in the recent past a scavenger of mg al layered double hydroxide mg al ldh with ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid edta intercalated between the layers has been found extremely successful in the removal of heavy metals like cu cd and cr vi from waste water very rapidly in a few minutes an optimum ph 73 74 biochar without appropriate modification and functionalization was not very competent in the metal removal and hence there is a strong need to develop these novel and effective techniques to enhance the utility of biochar fig 4 table 2 describe synthesis methods used depending on the requirements by examining their advantages and disadvantages 3 overall comparison of various biochar based adsorbents biochar is a novel and a well sought after adsorbent as it could be prepared from a wide variety of cheap and abundant feedstocks viz agricultural and industrial waste clays bones etc 94 the choice of adsorbent to be used for a specific application depends on various factors such as its cost its selectivity for different metals its adsorption efficiency reusability and regeneration the adsorption and desorption rates its ease of synthesis and mechanical strength the nature of biochar was found to be strongly influenced by biomass and pyrolysis conditions used besides the physicochemical modifications that led to its activation and performance enhancement additionally biomass pyrolysis should be performed under controlled conditions to capture chemical compounds that can be used as precursors for the preparation of other essential compounds for instance adsorption studies by shi 2019 95 demonstrated that sorption increasing pyrolysis temperatures lead to increased capacities of rice husk biochar for pb biochar is a porous material whose ability for sorption is greatly affected by its surface area as a result increasing its surface area by adding nanoparticles increases its potential for metal sorption for example yan 2015 49 synthesized magnetic biochar zns composites by depositing zns nanocrystals onto magnetic biochar based sorbents the biochar based sorbents showed a maximum sorption capacity of pb up to 368 mg g 10 times that of the unmodified biochar to modulate the properties of biochar based sorbents for heavy metal removal a range of biochar modification methods have been adopted popular approaches are chemical alteration and physical alteration chemical alteration is the most common form of alteration used this primarily involves acid alteration alkalinity alteration oxidizing agent modification metal salts or oxidizing agent modification and carbonaceous material modification physical alteration primarily includes the purging of steam and gas 96 metal nanoparticles in particular iron 97 100 are the most cost effective and advantageous modification materials due to their ferromagnetic properties for the preparation of magnetic biosorbents magnetic biosorbents boost surface areas functional groups and active sites and consequently improve removal performance while nanoparticles have high adsorption capacities they are typically not used directly in practical applications due to their expensive regeneration as a result the regeneration of the adsorbent is an extremely difficult process therefore to solve this problem and simplify the process of regeneration nanoparticles with magnetic properties have been synthesized 51 upon completion of the adsorption process an external magnetic field is applied to separate the magnetic chitosan particles from the solution this has made it quite easy to extract the adsorbent from the solution 3 1 metal removal by biochar based sorbents other than adsorbent properties there are other several factors like ph temperature adsorbent dosage agitation speed on which the process of biosorption depends various studies have shown that ph plays a very important role in determining the adsorption capacity it governs the dissociation of functional groups and the charge on active sites at low ph excess hydronium ions compete with the heavy metal ions to access the adsorption sites of the biosorbent resulting in blockage for heavy metal adsorption experiments by shang et al 2017 101 showed better results at low ph due to presence of humic acid which promotes chromium removal similar experiments by l lin et al 2017 102 showed better adsorption of arsenic at low ph as it helps in manganese oxidation in addition the interaction of oxygen containing functional groups in the fmbc promoted the formation of as iii to as v at a high ph heavy metal ions form a precipitate with coexisting ions or in the form of their hydroxides therefore generally the best performance of an adsorbent is observed in neutral or slightly acidic conditions another significant parameter on which biosorption depends is biosorbent dosage an initial increase in the percentage of metallic ions adsorbed is observed with an increase in biosorbent doses which may be due to an increase in the adsorbent surface region raising the number of adsorption sites available for adsorption at biosorbent doses higher than the optimal dosage value a decrease in the percentage of metal ion biosorbed can be due to the concentration gradient between adsorbate and biosorbent increasing biomass concentration may cause a decrease in the number of metallic ions adsorbed per gram of biomass in a few studies removal reaches a maximum and then decreases due to the saturation of the sorbent 103 most biosorption processes are endothermic in nature hence on increasing the temperature there is an increase in the removal percentage due to an increase in surface activity which in turn increases the number of reactive sites however the temperature should be maintained within a certain range if the temperature is increased to a very high value biomolecules will start to degrade resulting in a decrease in removal percentage 104 moreover high temperatures support metal ions binding with the biosorbent applying le chatelier s principle for exothermic reactions an increase in temperature decreases adsorption and vice versa 81 agitation speed is one of the critical design parameters in influencing the adsorption efficacy and mechanism with the increase in agitation speed turbulence increases leading to a decrease in boundary layer thickness around the sorbent particles and improved blending reported studies have shown that the boundary layer and intra particle diffusion were the controlling steps in the adsorption mechanism and the optimal speeds employed were 120 rpm 200 rpm 105 3 2 kinetics studies kinetics is used to study the rates of a chemical reaction examination of chemical kinetics incorporates cautious checking of the trial conditions which affect the speed of a chemical reaction and thus help accomplish equilibrium in the time allotted such examinations yield data about the conceivable mechanism of adsorption and the different progress states while in transit to the arrangement of the final adsorbate adsorbent complex and help create fitting numerical models to depict the interactions when the reaction rates also the dependent elements are explicitly known the equivalent can be used to create adsorbent materials for the modern application what s more will help understand the complex dynamics of the adsorption process 106 107 investigation of the kinetic model for biosorption study is essential to comprehend the reaction pathway mechanism of biosorption and dynamics of the biosorption procedure it helps in deciding physiochemical interaction mass transport and rate determining steps in the biosorption process different kinetic models like first order pseudo 1st order second order pseudo 2nd order and elovich models have been tested to explain the adsorption phenomena the first order model was proposed by lagergren according to lagergren s theory the metal sorption process is first order in nature as the process depends only on a specific number of metal ions present at an interval in solution it has been found that the pseudo 2nd order model was the most effective and commonly employed as depicted in fig 5 in which the amount of adsorbate on the sorbent surface played a critical role this shows that chemisorption was more predominant than physisorption it was also reported that pseudo 1 st order was followed during the initial stages of adsorption and the fast adsorption processes especially in liquid stage frameworks 102 104 106 108 where q1 and qe are metal sorbed at time t and equilibrium respectively in mmol g k1 is the first order rate constant h 1 k2 is the second order apparent rate constants kg mmol 1 h 1 α mmol kg 1 h 1 β kg mmol 1 are initial elovich sorption desorption constant at time t fig 6 3 3 thermodynamic studies equilibrium models and adsorption isotherms demonstrate the nature of interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate 109 it helps in understanding the biosorption mechanism and assists with determining the course of action of biosorption sites and biosorption of metal particles on the outside of the sorbent it helps in improving the utilization of biosorbent for a specific framework the linear regression analysis has recently been among the most prominent and feasible methods commonly used to analyze experimental results from the adsorption process it has been utilized to characterize the best fitting relationship that evaluates the dissemination of adsorbates and furthermore in the check of the consistency of adsorption models and the theoretical assumptions of adsorption models 110 studies have indicated that the error structure of experimental information is normally changed during the change of adsorption isotherms into their linearized structures 111 it is against this background nonlinearized regression examination got undeniable since it gives a numerical technique to determine adsorption parameters in utilizing a unique form of isotherm conditions 112 113 in contrast to linear regression nonlinear regression normally includes the minimal error between the observational data and the expected isotherm 114 this activity is not at this point computationally troublesome in view of the accessibility of computer calculations 115 116 few common equilibrium models reportedly used to explain this biochar based adsorption were langmuir freundlich langmuir freundlich redlich peterson double langmuir model etc langmuir model uptake of metal happens on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption the model likewise delineates the connection between metal adsorption on the sorbent surface and its equilibrium concentration in the effluent this model depends on three assumptions that are adsorption can happen at a specific site present on a surface adsorption can only take place in a monolayer design just one layer of atoms will append to the sorbent surface and adsorbate is emphatically pulled in to sorbent in a solution freundlich isotherm portrayed a superior fit at lower concentrations it has the ability of portraying the biosorption procedure on a wide variety of biosorbents this model additionally communicates the sorbent surface as heterogeneous and adsorption as multilayer with various intermolecular interactions among these the langmuir model based on single layer adsorption was found to be the best fit followed by the freundlich model based on multilayer heterogeneous process 117 122 process shraboni mukherjee et al 107 123 have done thermokinetic studies on defluoridation using various biosorbents their studies mostly found the process to follow langmuir and pseudo second order models as per the process parameters and nature of biomass they have also found biosorptive removal of heavy metals like fe cu and as using superheated steam activated biochar ssab derived from colocasia esculenta to follow same thermokinetic behaviour 108 table 3 summarizes the recent methods of synthesis and alteration of biosorbents their use in the removal of heavy metals methods of processing kinetics isotherms and their recovery for recycling 4 mechanisms of metal removal by biochar based adsorbents mechanisms of heavy metal removal is vital as they control the efficacy of the process to have deeper insight into the micro aspects of the process and to develop novel sorbents through effective synthesis and modification protocols as they are strongly correlated heavy metal removal by biochar based sorbents follow different mechanisms like physical adsorption electrostatic interaction complexation ion exchange precipitation metal removal is found to occur through individual or combination of mechanisms stated above biochar based adsorbents have high surface area with diverse pore network ranging from micro meso and macropores 176 pore volumes with high affinity towards metals can follow adsorption negatively charges surface of the sorbent can attract positive metals through electrostatic attraction ligands and various modifiers can form complexes or precipitates with metals to be removed 177 179 in physical adsorption metal removal occurs through diffusional movement of metal ions through pores without any chemical bond formation higher carbonization temperatures favour this mechanism due to enhanced surface area and pore volume and the mechanism could be better explained by film pore diffusion model in ion exchange mechanism the ionisable cations on the sorbent are exchanged with heavy metals in solution whose efficiency depends on the contaminant size and surface functionality it has been found that non woody and grassy biochars with high o content and acidic sites exhibit higher cation exchange capacity 180 in electrostatic interaction surface charged sorbent and metal ions leads to their immobilization the ph point of zero charge pzc and carbonization temperatures are found to play a critical role in this mechanism 176 181 in the mechanism of complexation the ligands and metals are found to form multi atom complexes this is mostly prevalent in the presence of transition metals oxygen containing functional groups and employing plant derived biochars in the last mechanism of precipitation which is very common in the removal of metals and rare earth elements immobilization occurs by the formation of solids either in solution or on the sorbent surface during the sorption process precipitation mechanism is widely observed at high ph and mineral content in both plant and animal derived biochars 182 183 as discussed in the preceding sections biochar by itself is inferior in metal removal hence modifications of various kinds viz mineral impregnation nanoscale metal additions surface oxidation and surface reduction these modifications are found to enhance the performance of biochar in terms of metal removal capacity thermal and structural stability desired morphology easy recovery and reuse 99 133 149 184 186 it has been found that modifications and mechanisms of metal removal are strongly correlated characterization studies revealed that carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups introduced through modification underwent complexation with heavy metals before and after adsorption also oxygen containing functional groups are found to release h after ion exchange thereby reducing solution ph 187 the charge characteristics on the sorbent surface are found to affect the strength of materials through electrostatic adsorption with ph playing a vital role in achieving the desired metal removal capacity it is found that when ph is more than phzpc point of zero discharge the negatively charged surface due to deprotonation led to strong electrostatic attraction towards the metals leading to enhanced removal conversely with ph higher than phzpc the positively charged surface due to protonation led to lower affinity towards the metal besides lower availability of sites due to competition between protons and metal thereby leading to lower metal removal 188 189 besides above said mechanisms the modified biochar is also found to follow precipitation and reduction mechanisms to further enhance affinity towards metals oxygen containing functional groups were found to follow electrostatic attraction ion exchange and complexation mechanisms which is illustrated by stronger oxidizing ability of hno3 vis a vis kmno4 xps and ftir spectra studies revealed the changes in these functional groups before and after adsorption 190 191 the presence of metals in the feedstock or through modification is found to enhance metal removal through the formation of precipitates like carbonates phosphates silicates with metals 171 192 nanoscale modifications in the biochar based adsorbents led to metal removal through the mechanisms of electrostatic attraction and ion exchange 133 193 variable valence metals like cr pb are found to follow reduction mechanism primarily in metal removal besides others 194 195 the fig 7 below illustrates the interplay between modifications and mechanisms while table 4 summarizes different mechanisms followed by different biochar based adsorbent materials as discussed since modification methods have a strong bearing on mechanisms selection of appropriate modification methods and their combinations is very much essential to achieve desired performance in terms of removal efficiency stability recyclability and safe disposal it is interesting to note that if co2 is used instead of n2 in pyrolysis process it is found to give more favourable results in terms of surface modifications and hence the adsorptive performance it was also found that using ferromanganese dioxide during modification instead of separate ferrum and manganese oxide led to stronger affinity towards metals higher magnetization and stability microwave assisted heating along with other modifications is found to have positive influence therefore the future research should focus on using a combination of appropriate modification protocols during synthesis to have much desired safe and green metal removal from wastewater 5 regeneration of the sorbents biochar based sorbents regeneration is an inverse adsorption operation to make the adsorption cycle more efficient adsorbent regeneration is essential a good adsorbent would convey a high reuse and recycling capacity for industrial applications and could substantially reduce the cost of biochar sorbents as a repeated sorption desorption process 196 197 the adsorption regeneration process may be repeated a few times which indicates that the adsorption efficiency can decrease slightly during the regeneration period adsorption efficiency is often reduced by the number of cycles the biochar undergoes 198 200 there are two concepts of regeneration adsorbate desorption and adsorbate decomposition some regeneration techniques are thermal regeneration 198 solvent regeneration 196 197 microwave irradiation regeneration 197 and supercritical fluid regeneration effective desorption involves the proper selection of elutants which is highly dependent on the form of biosorbent and the mechanism of biosorption elutants must not harm biochar and must be cost effective and environment friendly 201 fig 8 low concentrations of acids or bases 0 1 0 2 m are recommended for the desorption of contaminants from magnetic bio sorbents reported studies have shown that acids bases viz hcl hno3 h2so4 edta ca no3 2 naoh nano3 were attempted as reagents for in the regeneration it was found that as could be desorbed from magnetic sorbents using 0 5 m naoh 11 202 with even better desorption levels with hcl hno3 and h2so4 as eluents metal ion desorption is preferred over the use of acids as solvents as acidic conditions could hamper the adsorption of metal ions 203 204 the acidic environment favours the removal of iron and aluminium oxide silicate adsorption surfaces thus favouring the discharge of adsorbed metals 205 adding a strong acid will create competition for heavy metal ions and h3o and h for active sites for example it can be seen from the kołodyńska 2017 206 analysis that cu was desorbed by 3 5 m hno3 with an efficiency of 95 percent but higher acid concentrations can damage the biochar structure and thus reduce sorption and desorption efficiency 206 therefore acidic eluents should only be used if the adsorbent has good mechanical strength and stability high rates of desorption can also be achieved by using chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta such agents have a high number of electrons donating groups such as carboxylic and amine groups which have a high affinity to metal ions and can form stable complexes with them metal ions are then separated from the adsorbent and form complexes with these chelating agents in the study reported by hu and shipley 2013 207 edta and common ion solutions such as nano3 nacl cacl2 nahco3 mgso4 and nahpo4 were used to assess the ability of nano tio2 to recover pb ii cu ii and zn ii the use of common ion solutions caused in minimal desorption whereas the use of edta solutions produced 92 percent desorption increased regeneration cycles lead to a decrease in overall adsorption and desorption possibly due to the stronger chelating properties of edta the reason proposed to explain this increased adsorption capability was the activation of new adsorption sites by edta 4na it was observed that the degree of protonation of the adsorbent surface reduced with the introduction of an alkali medium which in turn causes desorption also heavy metal s from chemical adsorbents viz manganese coated powder iron coated powder nano zero valent iron fe iii oxide or hydroxide nanoparticle based agglomerate suspension and magnetic wheat straw were found to be removed using alkalis 58 in an experiment by s wang et al 2017 131 it was seen that adsorption equilibrium was reached and arsenic was successfully desorbed with 0 1 m naoh after a 24 h desorption 98 2 percent arsenic was released from the spent adsorbents 131 208 upon completion of the desorption cycle the adsorbent adsorption sites are simply reactivated by making the ph of the medium neutral with the support of an acid or alkali the final disposal of the spent adsorbent should be done with care biosorption moves sorbate from the aqueous solution to the solid phase biosorbent which raises operational concerns regarding the final safe handling of the filled biosorbent and sorbate while these laboratory studies have demonstrated the potential to regenerate biosorbents using acids alkalis and complexing agents the feasibility of the entire process on an industrial scale remains doubtful 6 safe disposal of spent biochar based sorbents few studies regarding biochar focus on regeneration and utilization of spent adsorbent without giving proper insight into the final disposal of biosorbent disposal of spent biomaterials contaminated with harmful organic ions also poses social and environmental problems especially in developing nations where furnaces and engineered landfills are deficient 209 211 the disposal of biochar containing heavy metals may take place after the recovery of heavy metals or immediately after the adsorption process in both situations there maybe be secondary pollution from used biochar and the chemicals used to prepare the biochar 212 even then biochar loaded with heavy metals have lethal effects on the environment and humans henceforth used biochar should be released in nature only after the complete recovery of heavy metals from the biochar surface 58 oladipo et al 2019 9 in their experiment used banana peels if banana peel waste is not effectively managed it creates odor and subsequently produces greenhouse gases prior to the commercialization of biosorbent proper attention towards final disposal should be paid in general there are five methods which can be considered for final disposal i e incineration 213 regeneration and reuse 214 landfill 215 216 fertilizer 214 217 and other safe disposal techniques 218 219 biosorbents have an ample number of biomolecules such as cellulose and lignin using incineration as a method of final disposal not only reduces volume and mass of spent biomass but also helps us in heavy metal and thermal energy recovery energy 220 work is done by ding et al 2014 221 on hexacyanoferrate functionalized walnut shell biosorbents for removal of caesium ions used incineration method for final disposal of the spent adsorbent in this study significant reduction of mass and volume was observed but caesium ion did not volatise from adsorbent whereas a study on pinecone shell conducted by martín lara et al 2016 222 for adsorption of cu2 and pb2 in a solution studied pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere for final disposal it was found biomass left after pyrolysis had a higher amount of carbon content lower amount of oxygen nitrogen and sulphur content when compared to coal which indicated lower corrosive and toxic gas and a new source of thermal energy on combustion another method for disposal of spent adsorbent can be treating the biomass in landfill 215 216 the operation of this method is also simple and inexpensive similar to domestic landfill 223 biosorbent containing toxic metal ion should be desorbed before using this method in order to avoid secondary pollution after proper desorption waste biomass could be spread on the surface of the land or could be buried underneath and later natural decomposition could complete the final disposal disposal and regeneration in many cases are interlinked processes regeneration and reuse of spent biomass are other effective methods for undergoing the final disposal method biochar has the ability to re adsorb heavy metal after regeneration this property of biosorbent can be used for increasing the life span of biosorbent and in turn reducing the need for generation of fresh biosorbent in a study reported by jeon and park 2005 224 the edta metal complex was effectively separated into edta solid and metals chloride by using hcl after the regeneration process the successful separation of edta metal complex into 2 different parts can be a permanent solution for disposal of used biochar as it can be reused several times and efficiency of the same after 5 6 cycles remain nearly the same 207 magnetic and centrifugal sedimentation can also be possible methods for the separation of iron iron oxide modified biosorbent 225 spent biosorbent can be recycled to produce bricks and cement for the construction industry but usage in large quantities can affect its mechanical strength also heavy metals loaded on biochar based sorbents can be used for the production of supercapacitors for example microwave oxidation carried out with ni2 loaded bc reduces the carbon content and increases oxygen content which increases the capacitance charge discharge capacity and power density 52 226 227 research shows that bc has a high potential for replacing expensive synthetic carbon nanoparticles for future supercapacitors 228 generally the raw material for biochar comprises algae microbes forestry and agricultural waste organic substances present in these materials are useful for the poor quality of soil hence these biomasses can also be used as fertilizers 214 217 in a study conducted to remove zn2 from wastewater with the help of marine algal biomass spent biomass was finally disposed of in the form of fertilizer to enhance soil quality 214 similarly a study conducted by tay et al 2016 217 on fishbone meat waste on lead reported that waste biomass could be used as organic compost or composite filler material in the downstream industry there are other paths too apart from these conventional methods which were followed to aid safe disposal of biosorbent after use in a work by vilar et al 2007 229 spent biomass was sterilized with the help of microwave irradiation and then was given seal treatment while placing it into inert material another option for safe disposal is using plants to phyto remediate these contaminants later these plants can be used for biochar synthesis few researchers ramrakhiani et al 2017 mccloy and goel 2017 218 230 also reported that phosphate glass being inert material can be used to immobilize the waste biosorbent a study conducted by ramrakhiani et al 2017 218 on the preparation of glass using 25 spent biomass showed no leeching of heavy metal ion up to 35 days in incubation further research needs to be conducted on the regeneration of biochar so that it could provide better results and can be a permanent solution for biochar disposal 7 conclusions this study summarized the recent advances of biochar based sorbents induced heavy metal removal from wastewater covering wide range of aspects of synthesis modifications mechanisms metal removal analysis thermos kinetics and regeneration methods the predominant heavy metal removal differed for variety of biochar based sorbents and metal pollutants it was seen that modification of biochar based sorbents resulted in higher adsorption capacity than unmodified or pristine biochar process parameters played a key role in adsorption some processes favoured acidic mediums whereas some favoured basic or neutral mediums impregnation of iron on biochar based sorbents resulted in maximum adsorption capacity among all modifications albeit with reduced pore volumes the difficulties faced in isolating and treating biochar based sorbents from aqueous solutions using conventional methods filtration and centrifugation were a major obstacle in the realistic treatment of biochar wastewater a few studies have shown that the magnetic separation approach is a promising technique for the separation of solid liquid phases therefore substantial studies on how to manufacture magnetic biochar based sorbents with excellent adsorption ability are required research shows that endothermic processes are useful for the elimination of heavy metals from contaminated water biosorption has been studied for many years but is yet to be brought into commercial use it has been seen that modification of biochar gave better results in comparison to unmodified biochar one of the main problems is in scaling up regeneration and disposal studies recovery and reincorporation of extracted metal from spent sorbet are often studied to add more economical value to the method most of the studies are done on aqueous solution in presence of a single ion these studies are often extended to real industrial effluent because it contains more than one ion however there is still a paucity of research in the application of biochar based sorbents as possible filters for the removal of heavy metals in addition future work on the development of large scale biochar based sorbents is required to determine the economic and environmental viability declaration of competing interest the

13825,biochar a solid carbon rich residue is derived from wide variety of abundantly available raw materials like forest and agricultural waste industrial by products and waste and municipal solid waste through pyrolysis besides enhancing soil fertility thereby agricultural productivity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions biochar based sorbents are widely being employed in waste water treatment owing to their attributes viz high porosity large surface area affinity towards metals surface modifications stability recyclability and even safe disposal in this comprehensive review latest trends w r t synthesis protocols modifications mechanisms metal removal comparison thermo kinetics mechanisms regeneration and safe disposal methods have been presented and discussed synthesis through slow pyrolysis 300 700 c 0 01 2 c s nanoscale modifications with metal oxides especially based on iron to magnetise the biochar regeneration through acids and complexation agents are found to be highly promising while ion exchange and electrostatic interactions are found to be common mechanisms of metal removal which in turn depends on nature of biomass process conditions and metal it is found that modifications and mechanisms are strongly interrelated from our studies biochar based sorbents gave heavy metal adsorption capacities in mg g of 1217 ag 560 pb 288 cu 216 cd 204 as 130 cr 58 ni 48 hg etc under optimal conditions though the nature of kinetic models and isotherms do depend on the material and process conditions pseudo kinetic models first and second order along with

on biomass have been widely employed in waste water treatment to remove harmful contaminants like fluorides and heavy metals 1 4 heavy metal pollution which negatively affects human health is a major global concern heavy metals are non biodegradable and are transferred along the food chain through the process of bioaccumulation heavy metals such as nickel copper lead chromium and arsenic pose a risk to both indigenous habitats and human health 5 alike table 1 summarizes a list of heavy metals with current maximum permissible amounts of contaminants by indian standards 6 the human body requires only trace amounts of these metals and exceeding these limits could prove to be fatal hence the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water is both important and urgent 7 for example cadmium is a prevalent heavy metal that causes adverse effects in humans such as nausea diarrhoea and liver damage when ingested inhaled or absorbed by the skin another heavy metal that causes serious environmental and human health related problems is nickel which also happens to be a carcinogen responsible for lung and bone cancer in addition to triggering dermatitis and eczema 8 copper zinc and mercury are some of the other metals commonly found industrial effluents excess concentrations of these metals in the water stream can cause maladies related to liver kidneys as well as affect the nervous gastrointestinal and hematopoietic systems 9 lead pb has long been one of the most recyclable and reusable heavy metals it is employed in the manufacture and recycling of batteries particularly in the automotive paint pipe and petrol industries lead adversely affects the nervous system gastrointestinal tract the lungs and reproductive system and induces neurobehavioral deficiencies 10 similarly other metals such as chromium arsenic and silver have also been classified as extremely hazardous for the biosphere hence effective methods for remediating the contamination caused by these metals is of utmost importance to the general well being of the biosphere the ongoing worldwide trends indicate a stronger need to accomplish better ecological norms with minimal utilization of resources for the treatment of effluents cost effectiveness and specialized pertinence are the two vital criteria in the choice of effective adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in the recent past adsorption 11 technology was found to be widely deployed in the treatment of wastewater adsorption owing to its various pros such as operation with green sorbents cost effectiveness higher efficiency a wide selection of established adsorbents derived from agricultural and industrial wastes easy regeneration low energy requirements etc is highly popular adsorption 11 is the strategy of mass exchange by which the material is moved from the fluid stage to the surface of solid and bound by chemical physical interactions traditional methods such as adsorption 12 15 chemical precipitation 16 19 membrane filtration 20 ion exchange 21 25 and electrochemical treatment technologies 26 were found to be costly affairs and thus not beneficial for low concentration of heavy metals 27 precipitation produces large amounts of relatively low quality sludge which may pose problems with dewatering and disposal 28 such processes were shown to be successful at experimental stages but not on an industrial scale to overcome these problems studies are being conducted on biosorption biosorption is a process independent of energy where heavy metals are adsorbed on the cell surface or active site of an adsorbate the main benefits of biosorption are in its high efficiency in the removal of heavy metal ions and the use of low cost biosorbents these methods are more suited for the treatment of dilute heavy metal wastewater 29 bio sorbents are most commonly produced through the simple carbonization of economical and abundantly available biomass materials viz bagasse straw shells of different materials like peanuts eggs etc besides microbes like bacteria and algae 30 biochar is one such biosorbent derived from the pyrolysis of various types of biomass materials mentioned above while bio sorbents also include the adsorbents derived from biomass from various other carbonization routes of the biomass including modifications 11 31 36 biochar also known as pyrogenic black carbon as it is produced through pyrolysis is nothing but a carbon rich material with attractive attributes like high permeability good porosity large surface area 5 37 38 besides these attributes its affinity towards different functional groups makes it an attractive option to adsorb various heavy metals onto its surface thereby leading to effective wastewater treatment there have been studies to utilize cottonwood corn stalk pinewood chestnut shell clay egg white and other agricultural wastes modification of the chemical structure of biochar based sorbents is a promising and attractive way to confer biochar specificity the process for the elimination of heavy metals relies on the concentration of the pollutants and the chemical properties of the adsorbent surface 39 the variations in organic composition electrical properties and functional groups of biochar based sorbents provide significant explanations for the difference in the observed adsorption mechanisms 40 fig 1 demonstrates the general mechanism for adsorption approaches to the alteration of biochar based sorbents including chemical modification impregnation of mineral sorbents steam activation and magnetic modification have been widely studied 41 43 harikishore kumar reddy lee 2014 44 used pine bark waste loaded with cobalt and iron to remove heavy metal from metal industry effluent pine bark after modification showed excellent results in the removal of cd ii and fe ii ions similarly a study was done by xiao et al 2020 45 on cow bone modified with the ball milling technique showed good results in the removal of cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions the use of untreated biosorbents poses difficulties such as a low adsorption efficiency and high release of organic material which consequentially increases cod bod and toc pre treatment is frequently advised to maintain adsorption efficiency in most cases it increases removal efficiency and selectivity in comparison to unmodified biosorbents this pre treatment can enhance ion exchange ability improve the formation of functional groups and provide a greater number of binding sites which in turn favours metal uptake it has been found that pre treatment modifications led to improved attributes in biochar based sorbents and thereby enhancing its performance fig 2 shows these trends 11 47 49 in a study by ahmad et al 2018 50 a banana peel compost was given thermal treatment it was observed that biochar based sorbents productivity was high due to the catalytic action of k during the pyrolytic conversion of the feedstock similarly modification of biochar based sorbents with nano zero valent iron increased its removal efficiency the existence of iron on the surface of biochar based sorbents increased the number of species of oxygen containing functional groups and enhanced complexation fig 3 displays the overall adsorption power of various ions using modified biochar in addition to the properties of adsorption the regenerative properties of the adsorbent are also important for an adsorbent to possess any sort of an industrial application it is imperative that it displays good cyclic stability for example a study by lata 2015 58 shows that desorption rates are high with a low concentration of acid but a low ph destroys the biochar based sorbents which in turn reduces the biomass however adsorption and desorption are opposite phenomena which means that the greater the adsorption capacity the more the affinity between the metal ions and the adsorbent which implies that the desorption process will be more unfavorable desorption is equally important however since it contributes to regeneration and recovery of the adsorbent and adsorbate molecules respectively reducing secondary pollution and the cost of the process the major challenge in the deployment of biosorbents in the field of metal removal is the recovery of liquid solvents which were used to regenerate the sorbents and researchers are hence focussing on the development of safe and green options in the downstream processing 11 several biochar based sorbents studies have been conducted to improve its adsorption properties and many have been successful magnetization impregnation of nanoparticles preparation of composites with other adsorbents and other modifications have been made by researchers in the last few years to make biochar based sorbents suitable for industrial applications this paper compiles the results of the recently prepared biochar based adsorbents where adsorbent adsorption capacity and process conditions have been discussed this paper also highlights the merits and demerits of each adsorbent produced making it easier to compare adsorbents synthesis techniques have been discussed to give the reader a better understanding of the requirements for the preparation of specific adsorbents 2 synthesis of biochar based adsorbents development of appropriate synthesis protocols is very critical in achieving the desired attributes in the adsorbent materials thereby leading to improved performance in terms of metal removal efficiency these synthesis protocols also control the overall process economics and impact on environment several methods have been used for the synthesis and modification of biochar based adsorbents the most common methods are shown in the table 2 below the properties of biosorbents are found to be dependent on the nature of biomass synthesis protocols employed along with modifications used besides the critical process and design parameters of the synthesis protocol viz temperature ph pyrolysis time material size etc 59 62 several factors like cost of preparation ease of synthesis specific area pore size mechanical strength adsorption capacity etc are considered to assess the efficacy of these methods biochar among various biosorbents has been found to be the most economical environmentally benign and effective biosorbent in heavy metal removal from waste water 63 64 its attributes like carbon richness large surface area high porosity and great affinity for heavy metals 65 pristine biochar can be prepared by slow pyrolysis fast pyrolysis gasification and combustion methods a variety of biomass wastes were reported to be used in the synthesis of biochar viz paper mill waste peanut hulls pine chips poultry litters forest plant biomass cotton seed hulls manures tyres animal bones agro industrial biomass municipal solid waste etc the nature of biomass material and pyrolysis conditions were found to play a critical role on the properties of biochar greater biochar yield is obtained with higher lignin content in the biomass while higher cellulose or hemicellulose content led to simpler thermal or chemical modifications to induce functional groups in slow pyrolysis longer residence times high pressures low temperatures of 300 c 700 c low heating rates of 0 01 2 c s are used this led to the production of larger quantities of biochar with greater particle size higher ash and lignin contents therefore this slow pyrolysis could be a low cost and robust option for small scale production of biochar in contrast to slow pyrolysis fast pyrolysis employs shorter residence times 2 s higher temperatures of 500 1000 c and rapid heating rates of 2 c s the drawback of this method is the lower yield of biochar 12 as well as high yield of bio oil 75 and non condensable gases 13 it was also found that fast pyrolysis at lower temperatures resulted in partly pyrolyzed biochar fractions vis a vis slow pyrolysis with longer residence times the third method of gasification to produce biochar leads to the conversion of biomass to gases like co2 co h2 and small amounts of ch4 by placing the biomass source in controlled oxygen environment at high temperatures of 700 800 c biochar produced is 10 through this method with remaining being gases and tar in the recent past modified biosorbents are being widely for improved metal removal efficiency even at low concentrations easy recovery and reuse due to several limitations of pristine biochar and other biosorbents metal induced sorbents or magnetic biosorbents biochar are being developed by incorporating metal nanoparticles viz iron nickel chromium titanium zirconium zinc copper and alloys 66 in the form of salts oxides etc which were found to have improved surface area pore size thermal stability crystalline nature surface functionality leading to higher adsorption capacity and easy recovery 67 the properties of magnetic biosorbents were found to be dependent on the nature of biomass itself metal nano particles modification methods besides process parameters like pyrolysis temperature and duration particle size 59 60 extent of magnetisation of biochar was found to be proportional to pyrolysis temperatures i e 4 28 emu g at 400 c and 36 8 emu g at 650 c ultrafine nanoparticles like metal oxides synthesized through various methods like sol gel aqueous sol gel ball milling hydrothermal precipitation methods could be used as successful modifiers to enhance the structural and thermal stability of the adsorbents 68 different types of modifications viz pre treatment single step post treatment modification double step microwave assisted modification hydrothermal modification etc are employed in the synthesis of magnetic biosorbents in the pre treatment method metal nanoparticles are incorporated into biomass before pyrolysis leading to a larger surface area porosity and superparamagnetic behaviour in the second method of post treatment biosorbents and nanoparticles are prepared separately before mixing however this is less efficient and more expensive than the pre treatment method microwave assisted synthesis of magnetic biosorbents is being used in the recent past as it is very rapid taking only 5 10 min but with highly improved adsorption capacity surface area pore volume 48 but with some difficulty in customization this method is replacing conventional pyrolysis in the synthesis of magnetic biochar though used less hydrothermal method is also reported where biomass feedstock is mixed with water at 100 350 c to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as they are held by water in very recent times engineering biochar and magnetic biosorbents are being explored as an innovative approach where plant tissues with bioaccumulation of metals or nanoparticles can be directly employed as biosorbents without any complex modification this is still in experimental phase and needs to be explored further 69 70 as they are found to exhibit improved physico chemical attributes and adsorption capacity magnetic biochar can also be produced using co precipitation method where a solute precipitates out from a solution through a carrier which forces the solute to bind it together instead of being dissolved this occurs through mechanisms of inclusion occlusion or surface adsorption calcination is also employed along with above mentioned methods to synthesize magnetic adsorbents in this process a carbon material is heated in the absence of fusion in a pressurized autoclave to remove water drive off gases and other volatile constituents leading to thermal decomposition 71 magnetic biochar synthesized using this method with fecl3 6h2o resulted in larger surface area diverse morphology from macro mesoporous structure high crystallinity besides simple recovery and reusability 72 in the recent past a scavenger of mg al layered double hydroxide mg al ldh with ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid edta intercalated between the layers has been found extremely successful in the removal of heavy metals like cu cd and cr vi from waste water very rapidly in a few minutes an optimum ph 73 74 biochar without appropriate modification and functionalization was not very competent in the metal removal and hence there is a strong need to develop these novel and effective techniques to enhance the utility of biochar fig 4 table 2 describe synthesis methods used depending on the requirements by examining their advantages and disadvantages 3 overall comparison of various biochar based adsorbents biochar is a novel and a well sought after adsorbent as it could be prepared from a wide variety of cheap and abundant feedstocks viz agricultural and industrial waste clays bones etc 94 the choice of adsorbent to be used for a specific application depends on various factors such as its cost its selectivity for different metals its adsorption efficiency reusability and regeneration the adsorption and desorption rates its ease of synthesis and mechanical strength the nature of biochar was found to be strongly influenced by biomass and pyrolysis conditions used besides the physicochemical modifications that led to its activation and performance enhancement additionally biomass pyrolysis should be performed under controlled conditions to capture chemical compounds that can be used as precursors for the preparation of other essential compounds for instance adsorption studies by shi 2019 95 demonstrated that sorption increasing pyrolysis temperatures lead to increased capacities of rice husk biochar for pb biochar is a porous material whose ability for sorption is greatly affected by its surface area as a result increasing its surface area by adding nanoparticles increases its potential for metal sorption for example yan 2015 49 synthesized magnetic biochar zns composites by depositing zns nanocrystals onto magnetic biochar based sorbents the biochar based sorbents showed a maximum sorption capacity of pb up to 368 mg g 10 times that of the unmodified biochar to modulate the properties of biochar based sorbents for heavy metal removal a range of biochar modification methods have been adopted popular approaches are chemical alteration and physical alteration chemical alteration is the most common form of alteration used this primarily involves acid alteration alkalinity alteration oxidizing agent modification metal salts or oxidizing agent modification and carbonaceous material modification physical alteration primarily includes the purging of steam and gas 96 metal nanoparticles in particular iron 97 100 are the most cost effective and advantageous modification materials due to their ferromagnetic properties for the preparation of magnetic biosorbents magnetic biosorbents boost surface areas functional groups and active sites and consequently improve removal performance while nanoparticles have high adsorption capacities they are typically not used directly in practical applications due to their expensive regeneration as a result the regeneration of the adsorbent is an extremely difficult process therefore to solve this problem and simplify the process of regeneration nanoparticles with magnetic properties have been synthesized 51 upon completion of the adsorption process an external magnetic field is applied to separate the magnetic chitosan particles from the solution this has made it quite easy to extract the adsorbent from the solution 3 1 metal removal by biochar based sorbents other than adsorbent properties there are other several factors like ph temperature adsorbent dosage agitation speed on which the process of biosorption depends various studies have shown that ph plays a very important role in determining the adsorption capacity it governs the dissociation of functional groups and the charge on active sites at low ph excess hydronium ions compete with the heavy metal ions to access the adsorption sites of the biosorbent resulting in blockage for heavy metal adsorption experiments by shang et al 2017 101 showed better results at low ph due to presence of humic acid which promotes chromium removal similar experiments by l lin et al 2017 102 showed better adsorption of arsenic at low ph as it helps in manganese oxidation in addition the interaction of oxygen containing functional groups in the fmbc promoted the formation of as iii to as v at a high ph heavy metal ions form a precipitate with coexisting ions or in the form of their hydroxides therefore generally the best performance of an adsorbent is observed in neutral or slightly acidic conditions another significant parameter on which biosorption depends is biosorbent dosage an initial increase in the percentage of metallic ions adsorbed is observed with an increase in biosorbent doses which may be due to an increase in the adsorbent surface region raising the number of adsorption sites available for adsorption at biosorbent doses higher than the optimal dosage value a decrease in the percentage of metal ion biosorbed can be due to the concentration gradient between adsorbate and biosorbent increasing biomass concentration may cause a decrease in the number of metallic ions adsorbed per gram of biomass in a few studies removal reaches a maximum and then decreases due to the saturation of the sorbent 103 most biosorption processes are endothermic in nature hence on increasing the temperature there is an increase in the removal percentage due to an increase in surface activity which in turn increases the number of reactive sites however the temperature should be maintained within a certain range if the temperature is increased to a very high value biomolecules will start to degrade resulting in a decrease in removal percentage 104 moreover high temperatures support metal ions binding with the biosorbent applying le chatelier s principle for exothermic reactions an increase in temperature decreases adsorption and vice versa 81 agitation speed is one of the critical design parameters in influencing the adsorption efficacy and mechanism with the increase in agitation speed turbulence increases leading to a decrease in boundary layer thickness around the sorbent particles and improved blending reported studies have shown that the boundary layer and intra particle diffusion were the controlling steps in the adsorption mechanism and the optimal speeds employed were 120 rpm 200 rpm 105 3 2 kinetics studies kinetics is used to study the rates of a chemical reaction examination of chemical kinetics incorporates cautious checking of the trial conditions which affect the speed of a chemical reaction and thus help accomplish equilibrium in the time allotted such examinations yield data about the conceivable mechanism of adsorption and the different progress states while in transit to the arrangement of the final adsorbate adsorbent complex and help create fitting numerical models to depict the interactions when the reaction rates also the dependent elements are explicitly known the equivalent can be used to create adsorbent materials for the modern application what s more will help understand the complex dynamics of the adsorption process 106 107 investigation of the kinetic model for biosorption study is essential to comprehend the reaction pathway mechanism of biosorption and dynamics of the biosorption procedure it helps in deciding physiochemical interaction mass transport and rate determining steps in the biosorption process different kinetic models like first order pseudo 1st order second order pseudo 2nd order and elovich models have been tested to explain the adsorption phenomena the first order model was proposed by lagergren according to lagergren s theory the metal sorption process is first order in nature as the process depends only on a specific number of metal ions present at an interval in solution it has been found that the pseudo 2nd order model was the most effective and commonly employed as depicted in fig 5 in which the amount of adsorbate on the sorbent surface played a critical role this shows that chemisorption was more predominant than physisorption it was also reported that pseudo 1 st order was followed during the initial stages of adsorption and the fast adsorption processes especially in liquid stage frameworks 102 104 106 108 where q1 and qe are metal sorbed at time t and equilibrium respectively in mmol g k1 is the first order rate constant h 1 k2 is the second order apparent rate constants kg mmol 1 h 1 α mmol kg 1 h 1 β kg mmol 1 are initial elovich sorption desorption constant at time t fig 6 3 3 thermodynamic studies equilibrium models and adsorption isotherms demonstrate the nature of interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate 109 it helps in understanding the biosorption mechanism and assists with determining the course of action of biosorption sites and biosorption of metal particles on the outside of the sorbent it helps in improving the utilization of biosorbent for a specific framework the linear regression analysis has recently been among the most prominent and feasible methods commonly used to analyze experimental results from the adsorption process it has been utilized to characterize the best fitting relationship that evaluates the dissemination of adsorbates and furthermore in the check of the consistency of adsorption models and the theoretical assumptions of adsorption models 110 studies have indicated that the error structure of experimental information is normally changed during the change of adsorption isotherms into their linearized structures 111 it is against this background nonlinearized regression examination got undeniable since it gives a numerical technique to determine adsorption parameters in utilizing a unique form of isotherm conditions 112 113 in contrast to linear regression nonlinear regression normally includes the minimal error between the observational data and the expected isotherm 114 this activity is not at this point computationally troublesome in view of the accessibility of computer calculations 115 116 few common equilibrium models reportedly used to explain this biochar based adsorption were langmuir freundlich langmuir freundlich redlich peterson double langmuir model etc langmuir model uptake of metal happens on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption the model likewise delineates the connection between metal adsorption on the sorbent surface and its equilibrium concentration in the effluent this model depends on three assumptions that are adsorption can happen at a specific site present on a surface adsorption can only take place in a monolayer design just one layer of atoms will append to the sorbent surface and adsorbate is emphatically pulled in to sorbent in a solution freundlich isotherm portrayed a superior fit at lower concentrations it has the ability of portraying the biosorption procedure on a wide variety of biosorbents this model additionally communicates the sorbent surface as heterogeneous and adsorption as multilayer with various intermolecular interactions among these the langmuir model based on single layer adsorption was found to be the best fit followed by the freundlich model based on multilayer heterogeneous process 117 122 process shraboni mukherjee et al 107 123 have done thermokinetic studies on defluoridation using various biosorbents their studies mostly found the process to follow langmuir and pseudo second order models as per the process parameters and nature of biomass they have also found biosorptive removal of heavy metals like fe cu and as using superheated steam activated biochar ssab derived from colocasia esculenta to follow same thermokinetic behaviour 108 table 3 summarizes the recent methods of synthesis and alteration of biosorbents their use in the removal of heavy metals methods of processing kinetics isotherms and their recovery for recycling 4 mechanisms of metal removal by biochar based adsorbents mechanisms of heavy metal removal is vital as they control the efficacy of the process to have deeper insight into the micro aspects of the process and to develop novel sorbents through effective synthesis and modification protocols as they are strongly correlated heavy metal removal by biochar based sorbents follow different mechanisms like physical adsorption electrostatic interaction complexation ion exchange precipitation metal removal is found to occur through individual or combination of mechanisms stated above biochar based adsorbents have high surface area with diverse pore network ranging from micro meso and macropores 176 pore volumes with high affinity towards metals can follow adsorption negatively charges surface of the sorbent can attract positive metals through electrostatic attraction ligands and various modifiers can form complexes or precipitates with metals to be removed 177 179 in physical adsorption metal removal occurs through diffusional movement of metal ions through pores without any chemical bond formation higher carbonization temperatures favour this mechanism due to enhanced surface area and pore volume and the mechanism could be better explained by film pore diffusion model in ion exchange mechanism the ionisable cations on the sorbent are exchanged with heavy metals in solution whose efficiency depends on the contaminant size and surface functionality it has been found that non woody and grassy biochars with high o content and acidic sites exhibit higher cation exchange capacity 180 in electrostatic interaction surface charged sorbent and metal ions leads to their immobilization the ph point of zero charge pzc and carbonization temperatures are found to play a critical role in this mechanism 176 181 in the mechanism of complexation the ligands and metals are found to form multi atom complexes this is mostly prevalent in the presence of transition metals oxygen containing functional groups and employing plant derived biochars in the last mechanism of precipitation which is very common in the removal of metals and rare earth elements immobilization occurs by the formation of solids either in solution or on the sorbent surface during the sorption process precipitation mechanism is widely observed at high ph and mineral content in both plant and animal derived biochars 182 183 as discussed in the preceding sections biochar by itself is inferior in metal removal hence modifications of various kinds viz mineral impregnation nanoscale metal additions surface oxidation and surface reduction these modifications are found to enhance the performance of biochar in terms of metal removal capacity thermal and structural stability desired morphology easy recovery and reuse 99 133 149 184 186 it has been found that modifications and mechanisms of metal removal are strongly correlated characterization studies revealed that carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups introduced through modification underwent complexation with heavy metals before and after adsorption also oxygen containing functional groups are found to release h after ion exchange thereby reducing solution ph 187 the charge characteristics on the sorbent surface are found to affect the strength of materials through electrostatic adsorption with ph playing a vital role in achieving the desired metal removal capacity it is found that when ph is more than phzpc point of zero discharge the negatively charged surface due to deprotonation led to strong electrostatic attraction towards the metals leading to enhanced removal conversely with ph higher than phzpc the positively charged surface due to protonation led to lower affinity towards the metal besides lower availability of sites due to competition between protons and metal thereby leading to lower metal removal 188 189 besides above said mechanisms the modified biochar is also found to follow precipitation and reduction mechanisms to further enhance affinity towards metals oxygen containing functional groups were found to follow electrostatic attraction ion exchange and complexation mechanisms which is illustrated by stronger oxidizing ability of hno3 vis a vis kmno4 xps and ftir spectra studies revealed the changes in these functional groups before and after adsorption 190 191 the presence of metals in the feedstock or through modification is found to enhance metal removal through the formation of precipitates like carbonates phosphates silicates with metals 171 192 nanoscale modifications in the biochar based adsorbents led to metal removal through the mechanisms of electrostatic attraction and ion exchange 133 193 variable valence metals like cr pb are found to follow reduction mechanism primarily in metal removal besides others 194 195 the fig 7 below illustrates the interplay between modifications and mechanisms while table 4 summarizes different mechanisms followed by different biochar based adsorbent materials as discussed since modification methods have a strong bearing on mechanisms selection of appropriate modification methods and their combinations is very much essential to achieve desired performance in terms of removal efficiency stability recyclability and safe disposal it is interesting to note that if co2 is used instead of n2 in pyrolysis process it is found to give more favourable results in terms of surface modifications and hence the adsorptive performance it was also found that using ferromanganese dioxide during modification instead of separate ferrum and manganese oxide led to stronger affinity towards metals higher magnetization and stability microwave assisted heating along with other modifications is found to have positive influence therefore the future research should focus on using a combination of appropriate modification protocols during synthesis to have much desired safe and green metal removal from wastewater 5 regeneration of the sorbents biochar based sorbents regeneration is an inverse adsorption operation to make the adsorption cycle more efficient adsorbent regeneration is essential a good adsorbent would convey a high reuse and recycling capacity for industrial applications and could substantially reduce the cost of biochar sorbents as a repeated sorption desorption process 196 197 the adsorption regeneration process may be repeated a few times which indicates that the adsorption efficiency can decrease slightly during the regeneration period adsorption efficiency is often reduced by the number of cycles the biochar undergoes 198 200 there are two concepts of regeneration adsorbate desorption and adsorbate decomposition some regeneration techniques are thermal regeneration 198 solvent regeneration 196 197 microwave irradiation regeneration 197 and supercritical fluid regeneration effective desorption involves the proper selection of elutants which is highly dependent on the form of biosorbent and the mechanism of biosorption elutants must not harm biochar and must be cost effective and environment friendly 201 fig 8 low concentrations of acids or bases 0 1 0 2 m are recommended for the desorption of contaminants from magnetic bio sorbents reported studies have shown that acids bases viz hcl hno3 h2so4 edta ca no3 2 naoh nano3 were attempted as reagents for in the regeneration it was found that as could be desorbed from magnetic sorbents using 0 5 m naoh 11 202 with even better desorption levels with hcl hno3 and h2so4 as eluents metal ion desorption is preferred over the use of acids as solvents as acidic conditions could hamper the adsorption of metal ions 203 204 the acidic environment favours the removal of iron and aluminium oxide silicate adsorption surfaces thus favouring the discharge of adsorbed metals 205 adding a strong acid will create competition for heavy metal ions and h3o and h for active sites for example it can be seen from the kołodyńska 2017 206 analysis that cu was desorbed by 3 5 m hno3 with an efficiency of 95 percent but higher acid concentrations can damage the biochar structure and thus reduce sorption and desorption efficiency 206 therefore acidic eluents should only be used if the adsorbent has good mechanical strength and stability high rates of desorption can also be achieved by using chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta such agents have a high number of electrons donating groups such as carboxylic and amine groups which have a high affinity to metal ions and can form stable complexes with them metal ions are then separated from the adsorbent and form complexes with these chelating agents in the study reported by hu and shipley 2013 207 edta and common ion solutions such as nano3 nacl cacl2 nahco3 mgso4 and nahpo4 were used to assess the ability of nano tio2 to recover pb ii cu ii and zn ii the use of common ion solutions caused in minimal desorption whereas the use of edta solutions produced 92 percent desorption increased regeneration cycles lead to a decrease in overall adsorption and desorption possibly due to the stronger chelating properties of edta the reason proposed to explain this increased adsorption capability was the activation of new adsorption sites by edta 4na it was observed that the degree of protonation of the adsorbent surface reduced with the introduction of an alkali medium which in turn causes desorption also heavy metal s from chemical adsorbents viz manganese coated powder iron coated powder nano zero valent iron fe iii oxide or hydroxide nanoparticle based agglomerate suspension and magnetic wheat straw were found to be removed using alkalis 58 in an experiment by s wang et al 2017 131 it was seen that adsorption equilibrium was reached and arsenic was successfully desorbed with 0 1 m naoh after a 24 h desorption 98 2 percent arsenic was released from the spent adsorbents 131 208 upon completion of the desorption cycle the adsorbent adsorption sites are simply reactivated by making the ph of the medium neutral with the support of an acid or alkali the final disposal of the spent adsorbent should be done with care biosorption moves sorbate from the aqueous solution to the solid phase biosorbent which raises operational concerns regarding the final safe handling of the filled biosorbent and sorbate while these laboratory studies have demonstrated the potential to regenerate biosorbents using acids alkalis and complexing agents the feasibility of the entire process on an industrial scale remains doubtful 6 safe disposal of spent biochar based sorbents few studies regarding biochar focus on regeneration and utilization of spent adsorbent without giving proper insight into the final disposal of biosorbent disposal of spent biomaterials contaminated with harmful organic ions also poses social and environmental problems especially in developing nations where furnaces and engineered landfills are deficient 209 211 the disposal of biochar containing heavy metals may take place after the recovery of heavy metals or immediately after the adsorption process in both situations there maybe be secondary pollution from used biochar and the chemicals used to prepare the biochar 212 even then biochar loaded with heavy metals have lethal effects on the environment and humans henceforth used biochar should be released in nature only after the complete recovery of heavy metals from the biochar surface 58 oladipo et al 2019 9 in their experiment used banana peels if banana peel waste is not effectively managed it creates odor and subsequently produces greenhouse gases prior to the commercialization of biosorbent proper attention towards final disposal should be paid in general there are five methods which can be considered for final disposal i e incineration 213 regeneration and reuse 214 landfill 215 216 fertilizer 214 217 and other safe disposal techniques 218 219 biosorbents have an ample number of biomolecules such as cellulose and lignin using incineration as a method of final disposal not only reduces volume and mass of spent biomass but also helps us in heavy metal and thermal energy recovery energy 220 work is done by ding et al 2014 221 on hexacyanoferrate functionalized walnut shell biosorbents for removal of caesium ions used incineration method for final disposal of the spent adsorbent in this study significant reduction of mass and volume was observed but caesium ion did not volatise from adsorbent whereas a study on pinecone shell conducted by martín lara et al 2016 222 for adsorption of cu2 and pb2 in a solution studied pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere for final disposal it was found biomass left after pyrolysis had a higher amount of carbon content lower amount of oxygen nitrogen and sulphur content when compared to coal which indicated lower corrosive and toxic gas and a new source of thermal energy on combustion another method for disposal of spent adsorbent can be treating the biomass in landfill 215 216 the operation of this method is also simple and inexpensive similar to domestic landfill 223 biosorbent containing toxic metal ion should be desorbed before using this method in order to avoid secondary pollution after proper desorption waste biomass could be spread on the surface of the land or could be buried underneath and later natural decomposition could complete the final disposal disposal and regeneration in many cases are interlinked processes regeneration and reuse of spent biomass are other effective methods for undergoing the final disposal method biochar has the ability to re adsorb heavy metal after regeneration this property of biosorbent can be used for increasing the life span of biosorbent and in turn reducing the need for generation of fresh biosorbent in a study reported by jeon and park 2005 224 the edta metal complex was effectively separated into edta solid and metals chloride by using hcl after the regeneration process the successful separation of edta metal complex into 2 different parts can be a permanent solution for disposal of used biochar as it can be reused several times and efficiency of the same after 5 6 cycles remain nearly the same 207 magnetic and centrifugal sedimentation can also be possible methods for the separation of iron iron oxide modified biosorbent 225 spent biosorbent can be recycled to produce bricks and cement for the construction industry but usage in large quantities can affect its mechanical strength also heavy metals loaded on biochar based sorbents can be used for the production of supercapacitors for example microwave oxidation carried out with ni2 loaded bc reduces the carbon content and increases oxygen content which increases the capacitance charge discharge capacity and power density 52 226 227 research shows that bc has a high potential for replacing expensive synthetic carbon nanoparticles for future supercapacitors 228 generally the raw material for biochar comprises algae microbes forestry and agricultural waste organic substances present in these materials are useful for the poor quality of soil hence these biomasses can also be used as fertilizers 214 217 in a study conducted to remove zn2 from wastewater with the help of marine algal biomass spent biomass was finally disposed of in the form of fertilizer to enhance soil quality 214 similarly a study conducted by tay et al 2016 217 on fishbone meat waste on lead reported that waste biomass could be used as organic compost or composite filler material in the downstream industry there are other paths too apart from these conventional methods which were followed to aid safe disposal of biosorbent after use in a work by vilar et al 2007 229 spent biomass was sterilized with the help of microwave irradiation and then was given seal treatment while placing it into inert material another option for safe disposal is using plants to phyto remediate these contaminants later these plants can be used for biochar synthesis few researchers ramrakhiani et al 2017 mccloy and goel 2017 218 230 also reported that phosphate glass being inert material can be used to immobilize the waste biosorbent a study conducted by ramrakhiani et al 2017 218 on the preparation of glass using 25 spent biomass showed no leeching of heavy metal ion up to 35 days in incubation further research needs to be conducted on the regeneration of biochar so that it could provide better results and can be a permanent solution for biochar disposal 7 conclusions this study summarized the recent advances of biochar based sorbents induced heavy metal removal from wastewater covering wide range of aspects of synthesis modifications mechanisms metal removal analysis thermos kinetics and regeneration methods the predominant heavy metal removal differed for variety of biochar based sorbents and metal pollutants it was seen that modification of biochar based sorbents resulted in higher adsorption capacity than unmodified or pristine biochar process parameters played a key role in adsorption some processes favoured acidic mediums whereas some favoured basic or neutral mediums impregnation of iron on biochar based sorbents resulted in maximum adsorption capacity among all modifications albeit with reduced pore volumes the difficulties faced in isolating and treating biochar based sorbents from aqueous solutions using conventional methods filtration and centrifugation were a major obstacle in the realistic treatment of biochar wastewater a few studies have shown that the magnetic separation approach is a promising technique for the separation of solid liquid phases therefore substantial studies on how to manufacture magnetic biochar based sorbents with excellent adsorption ability are required research shows that endothermic processes are useful for the elimination of heavy metals from contaminated water biosorption has been studied for many years but is yet to be brought into commercial use it has been seen that modification of biochar gave better results in comparison to unmodified biochar one of the main problems is in scaling up regeneration and disposal studies recovery and reincorporation of extracted metal from spent sorbet are often studied to add more economical value to the method most of the studies are done on aqueous solution in presence of a single ion these studies are often extended to real industrial effluent because it contains more than one ion however there is still a paucity of research in the application of biochar based sorbents as possible filters for the removal of heavy metals in addition future work on the development of large scale biochar based sorbents is required to determine the economic and environmental viability declaration of competing interest the

13826,the stability of single partial nitritation and anammox spna granular system at different nitrogen loads was evaluated in two laboratory scale continuous stirred tank reactor cstr reactors r1with lower influent ammonium concentration r2 with higher concentration the effects of different transient substrate shock 50 mg n l and 100 mg n l on the bacteria population structure nitrogen removal and granular sludge properties of the system were studied results showed that r1 had a better resilience and the average removal efficiencies of tn and ammonium can recover to 66 5 and 73 9 after two shocks while nitrogen performance of r2 deteriorated the inhibition of free nitrous acid fna to functional bacteria was the key factor influencing reactor performance when fna concentration exceeded 2 μg l fna mlvss 1 5 μg g vss the inhibition was irreversible moreover excessive substrate shock changed extracellular polymeric substances eps production and composition which led to granules disintegration the formation and disintegration mechanism of spna micro granules were also investigated keywords spna micro granules substrate shock recovery fna mlvss 1 introduction anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob is a kind of chemical chemoautotrophic bacteria in the phylum planctomycetes it takes ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor to remove the ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater without oxygen and organic matter 1 compared with the conventional nitrification and denitrification process anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox has the advantages of low aeration cost no requirement of additional carbon source and less sludge yield 2 3 in recent years the potential of the anammox for biological nitrogen removal has been paid more and more attention 4 anammox is often combined with aerobic processes such as nitritation or simultaneous nitritation denitrification 5 in the spna system ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaob co exist in the same reactor and the cooperation between the two bacteria makes complete autotrophic nitrogen removal possible 6 however since anaob is highly sensitive to environmental conditions it is difficult to maintain stable operation of anammox and its coupling processes in practical application there are a variety of exogenous inhibitors such as substrate organic matter salt etc 7 among them excessive substrate concentrations and substrate shocks are common and important factors 5 in general free ammonia fa and fna are considered the most critical inhibitors for substrate based inhibition in the process however a wide range of inhibition threshold for fa and fna made it harder to operate and maintain the anammox process comparing toxic threshold concentrations of various processes niu et al found a large gap between fna and fa inhibition thresholds which may be related to the diverse system configuration and species of anaob 8 although the adverse effects of fa and fna have been widely reported these reports conflict with respect to the threshold range and reversibility in addition to the reactor type and operating conditions the species and proportions of functional bacteria may be responsible for the tolerance ability to substrate concentration and the correlation between these factors has not been discussed in detail moreover the effects of fa and fna on spna system performance are still uncertain the specific growth rate constant of anaob is very slow μ 0 065 d 1 1 9 making biogranulation an effective strategy the granulation process can be divided into two steps nucleation and nucleus growth into the granule 10 the stable nitrogen removal ability can be obtained by granulating and the good settleability of the granules can retain the biomass in the system these two characteristics are particularly important for the anammox 5 in the biological wastewater treatment process eps have an important impact on the structure diameter and settleability of granules thus affecting reactor performance in recent years a large number of researches have also been conducted to investigate influence of eps content and composition on granules or biofilm formation tay et al suggested that polysaccharide ps can form the cross network structure with cells which was conducive to the change of cell surface properties and the formation of granule 11 protein pn with a higher content in eps could enhance the formation and stability of microbial aggregates 12 furthermore eps also play an important role in sludge granulating and maintaining the structural integrity of granules and they also have a significant influence on the structure and function of microbial aggregates 13 miao et al showed that influent characteristics significantly affected the composition of eps 14 zhang et al proposed that inappropriate substrate concentration or composition of eps might cause significant changes in the content of eps 15 however under the impact of transient shock the secretion of eps and the self defense response of functional bacteria in spna system are still in the exploratory stage in this study the operation strategies of two different substrate concentrations were compared the specific objectives are 1 to study the impact of influent and effluent nitrogen load fa and fna content changes per unit biomass on reactor performance functional bacteria abundance and ratio the main factors affecting the reactor recovery performance were also discussed 2 by observing the response of eps at the initial period of shocks discuss the changes of eps content and composition during inhibition and recovery periods and further explore the adaptation and self defense modes of bacteria under environment pressure such as substrate shock 3 investigate the effects of influent configurations on the performance and structure of spna granule by closely monitoring changes in granule characteristics microbial community and reactor treatment performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation for specific comparisons two laboratory sized cstr reactors were run in parallel both reactors operated continuously for more than 150 days the reactor structure air supply mode and biomass characteristics were the same as previous studies 16 the mlss of r1was about 5300 mg l and that of r2 was around 5700 mg l at the beginning of the operation anaob abundance of r2 2 13 was more than r1 1 30 there were three phases in the continuous experiment table 1 at the stable period phase i the ammonia nitrogen concentration of r1 was invariant around 250 mg l and that of r2 was about 300 mg l and the hrt of the both reactors was constant at 6 h then the influent ammonia nitrogen concentration was suddenly increased by 50 mg l shock a and 100 mg l shock b separately as two influent transient substrate shocks and the transient high substrate concentration was used to evaluate the impact of shocks on reactor performance and eps production in addition the influent load was still slowly increased during operation to achieve nob suppression the operation period can be divided into three phases phase i was the stable period phase ii included the inhibition period and recovery period of shock a and phase iii included the inhibition and recovery period of shock b at the later period of phase iii the substrate concentration gradually decreased to recover the reactor performance table 1 2 2 analysis method 2 2 1 chemical analysis the extraction and analysis methods of nitrogen compounds nitrite nitrate and ammonium and eps were the same as the previous studies 16 do concentration and ph value were monitored with a do and ph meter wtw multi 3430 germany during the experiment the aeration rate was 4 2 l min the do concentration of r1 and r2 were between 0 05 0 17 mg l and 0 06 0 10 mg l respectively by controlling the dosage of nahco3 the ph in bulk liquid was kept between 7 8 8 4 r1 and 7 9 8 3 r2 respectively based on the equation for nitrogen balance and chemometrics of vazquez padin et al we respectively calculated the ammonia oxidation rate aor nitrite oxidation

method apha 1998 2 4 statistical analysis two groups of parallel samples were taken to measure the eps components during operation as well as mlss mlvss and svi and the mean values of fa fna aor and anr in the effluent were calculated the mean values of r1 and r2 were taken within 10 days at 34d 53d 78d and 84d with a total of 8 samples the correlation represented by r among the components was obtained by pearson correlation analysis ibm spss statistic 24 was used for pearson correlation analysis to measure the relationship between analysis parameters the reliability of the experimental results was characterized by significance test represented by sig 2 5 fish analysis fish technology was used to conduct quantitative analysis of aob anaob and all bacteria in r1 and r2 systems eub338

probe mixture were used to investigate the presence of anaob all probes were purchased from sangon company china fish images were collected and recorded using an acquisition system software caseviewer coupled with an olympus ﬂuorescence microscope the probes and base sequences used are shown in table 2 2 6 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing in order to study the variations of microbial community in each reactor the sludge samples were extracted from two reactors at the beginning and the end of operation day 18 and day 78 and detected on an illumina mi seq platform at allwegene tech co ltd in beijing 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance 3 1 1 performance during stable period phase i according to the influent loads variation the operation period was divided into three phases including stable phase phase i and two shocks shock a in phase ii and shock b in phase iii as shown in fig 1 r1 and r2 operated steadily for 32 days phase i at the influent ammonia concentration of 250 mg l and 300 mg l respectively in the first 10 days of this period the ammonia removal efficiencies improved then tended to be invariant in the next 20 days the average ammonia and tn removal efficiencies of r1 were 84 4 and 70 5 and those of r2 were 65 8 and 54 7 in addition anr increased slowly in both reactors and nor decreased which indicated that nob existed in the reactors and its activity decreased slowly aktan et al pointed out that when fa was lower than 13 15 mg l the influence of fa on the anammox process was insignificant 24 moreover in order to maintain the performance stability of the system the optimal fa concentration was reported to be less than 38 mg l 25 and the fna level was preferably less than 1 5 μg l 7 during the stable operation the fa and fna of r1 were around 1 4 10 6 mg l and 0 03 1 01 μg l respectively r2 had a higher influent ammonium concentration and fa than r1 and fa and fna fluctuated in the range of 6 2 16 9 mg l and 0 04 1 27 μg l fig 2 3 1 2 variation and comparison of two reactors performance according to fig 1a and b when the influent ammonia was increased by 50 mg l as transient shock a the reactor nitrogen removal ability of r1 reduced immediately and then recovered well after two weeks adaption although the tn removal efficiency decreased from 77 8 48 5 in the early days of inhibition it recovered to the original value after 15 days 48d and remained stable in phase ii when the influent ammonia nitrogen slowly rised to 350 mg l anr increased slightly with a bigger reduction of nor for r2 the inhibition period of shock a was shorter 33d 40d compared with r1 r2 in the early stage was more capable of absorbing the shock load the tn removal efficiency dropped from 63 3 to26 9 and then increased to 62 0 10 days later 43d after the recovery the nitrogen removal efficiency of r2 basically remained stable during 25 days 43d 68d the tn removal efficiency of r2 was lower than that of r1 and the growth rate of that was slower it was indicated that in the middle stage of phase ii r2 was hard to improve the nitrogen removal performance in a short time this may be due to the species and relative abundance of functional bacterial were not enough to tolerate the substrate at this stage which made the poor nitrogen removal performance however the increasing anr meant that anaob remained active on the contrary nor began to be close to or lower than anr which meant nob activity was greatly inhibited when the both reactors were subjected to the shock concentration of 100 mg l shock b the effluent nitrogen concentration continued to rise and nitrogen removal efficiencies dropped showing the instability states after 12 days of shock b the nitrogen removal performance still deteriorated in order to relieve the effects of the too high nh 4 n concentration from the 80th day the concentration was decreased to the safety level obtained from the stable operation after that for r1 the phenomenon of treatment ability improvement was also observed at the end of the operation the removal efficiencies of ammonia nitrogen and tn in the recovery period were recover to 73 9 and 66 5 respectively we found r1 had a better tolerance to transient substrate shocks and was minimally impacted by fluctuations in influent substrate concentrations although such a perturbation occurred the reactor quickly recovered to the original operation level however for r2 the nitrogen removal performance degenerated for a longer time and recovered slowly there are two reasons for the destabilization of r2 one hand the instantaneous increasing concentration was so high that the reactor could not resist the rough shock on the other hand under the present configurations and conditions the influent nh 4 n concentration was in a critical level which could barely maintain stable performance as the concentration kept increasing the reactor became deterioration 3 1 3 reactor performance evaluation according to fig 2a and b in phases i and ii the sludge ammonia nitrogen loading sal of r1 was basically in an upward trend along with the increase of influent concentration biomass increased slowly discussed in 3 2 2 which made the tolerance ability of unit mass of biomass much higher than before indicating that r1 had a continuously enhanced robustness on the other hand the biomass of r2 may increase correspondingly because the influent nh 4 n concentration was suitable for microbial growth and the sal tended to slow down which indicated that unit mass of microorganisms in r2 was under reducing load in other words they were more suitable for the lower environmental pressure owing to the exacerbation of sludge performance by sudden overload r2 was less resilient than r1 for higher substrate concentrations shocks subsequent experiments confirmed the conclusion in addition in the later phase ii the ammonium concentration of r2 was imposed 50 mg l higher than r1 but sal of r2 was much lower than r1 it was indicated that influent nh 4 n concentration and sal were not synchronized completely and mlss or mlvss should be taken into account to evaluate the impact of influent on the reactor at the beginning of phase iii it can be seen that with the sudden increase of substrate concentration the sal of the two reactors increased correspondingly the sal of r1 doubled from 0 30 18d to 0 60 g nh 4 n g mlvss d 78d and r2 also increased from 0 35 to 0 49 g nh 4 n g mlvss d moreover the correlation analysis showed that ammonia nitrogen concentration and sal were not the main causes of r2 destabilization r tn removal efficiency and sal 0 377 sig 0 358 r ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency and sal 0 461 sig 0 250 the reason for r2 instability may be that with the continuous increase of the operation time the shock resistance decreased gradually in this case a sudden high concentration of substrate shock occurred which deteriorated the reactor performance in addition to the manipulation conditions the key factors affecting the reactor performance included the concentration of fa and fna fa could neutralize membrane potentials resulting in slow cell metabolism and even cell death 5 and fna can affect many metabolic processes through inhibition such as active transport of substrates across cell membranes and oxidative phosphorylation 26 strous et al also put forward that even a very low concentration fna can also act as inhibitors of anaob fna in 6 μg l completely inhibited ca brocadia activity 27 another enrichment medium containing ca kuenenia was completely inactivated at fna concentration of 40 μg l 28 however the specific reactor conditions sludge volume functional bacteria types and activity were not explored during phase ii the fa and fna levels in both reactors were lower than the inhibition thresholds aforementioned the maximum fa concentrations were 14 06 mg l r1 and 18 05 mg l r2 and the fna values were 0 21 μg l and 0 32 μg l respectively in phase iii the fa of r1 achieved a peak value of 30 5 mg l and fna was as high as 7 02 μg l then decreased to 3 10 0 20 μg l and remained unchanged although the fa values were still lower than the toxic thresholds described by above researches inhibition occurred which indicated the threshold of the reactor had been reached the fa concentration of r2 was up to 38 20 mg l and the fna level was to 11 03 μg l surpassing the threshold of the reactor adjustment by decreasing the load also failed to moderate the reactor performance resulting in further exacerbation of r2 compared with the previous phase the fa concentration in two reactors increased by 2 times and the fna even more than 10 times showing that effluent fa and fna values increased with the increase of substrate concentration through correlation analysis it was also found that the inhibition of fna was accompanied by the effluent accumulation of high ammonia nitrogen concentration and fa r fa and fna 0 806 sig 0 016 r effluent ammonia and fna 0 836 sig 0 01 in addition it can be seen from r1 that fna inhibition was reversible in anammox within 15 days 69 84d the concentration of fna surpassed 2 μg l which inhibited the reactor and gradually returned to the original processing level later however for r2 fna increased from 2 05 μg l 71d to 6 71 μg l 73d finally up to 11 03 μg l 81d and decreased slowly it was determined that when fna exceeded a certain concentration the inhibition was almost irreversible which also illustrated the importance of maintaining proper fna in the reactor moreover the concentrations of fa and fna in unit biomass fa mlvss and fna mlvss were compared fig 2c and d it can be seen that parameters of r1 in the first two phases were relatively invariant but in phase iii fa mlvss even increased from 2 07 to 10 13 mg g vss nearly 5 times of its original value and fna also slightly increased leading to system vulnerable by reducing the influent load the two values were quickly restored and the reactor was stabilized for r2 fna mlvss remained unchanged in the first two phases while fa mlvss showed a decreasing trend which resembled the sal of r2 in phase iii fa mlvss of r2 were similar to that at the beginning of operation but the nitrogen efficiency continued to be worsened combined with the performance changes of the two reactors it was indicated that the main reason for reactor instability was that microorganisms were very sensitive to fna variation correlation analysis showed similar results table 3 table 3 showed that anr was significantly negatively correlated with fna mlvss with the highest correlation than other parameters r anr and fna mlvss 0 907 sig 0 002 which proved that excessive fna inhibited anaob activity however the correlation between aor and fa or fna was not significant indicating that fa and fna had low influence on aob moreover it was obvious that fna mlvss was a key indicator affecting the operation of the reactor and had the significant influence on the system nitrogen removal performance with r fna mlvss and tn removal rate 0 978 fna mlvss of r1 kept below 0 16 μg g vss before shock b and r2 was below 0 46 μg g vss however after shock b fna mlvss of r1 briefly remained at 1 5 μg g vss and then dropped fna mlvss of r2 rose above 2 0 μg g immediately after fna mlvss maintaining a state of 1 5 μg g vss causing reactor vulnerable in other words when the fna mlvss of the reactor exceeds 1 5 μg g vss for a long time the nitrogen removal performance of spna system will deteriorate furthermore it was found that the correlation between fna and tn ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was 0 965 and 0 872 respectively while fa of that was 0 782 and 0 840 respectively which proved that fna had a more significant influence on spna system than fa for the study excessive fna inhibited the bacteria activity which made r2 difficult to recover its performance in the last phase fna mlvss was the key factor affecting reactor performance in addition fa and fna had a more significant impact on anaob than that of aob and fna had a greater impact on functional bacteria than fa 3 1 4 comparison of bacteria in each system the degree of system degeneration depends on the magnitude of the shocks and the adaptability of the bacteria community in view of the substrate shock on the system and the response of the bacteria the microbial community structure and the functional bacteria activities in spna system were analyzed and the sludge was sampled at 18d and 78d fig 3 a and b shows that with the variation of influent loads both anr and aor changed within a small range at the end of phase iii aor and anr of r1 increased indicating that the functional bacteria activity of r1 recovered however r2 showed a small decrease trend suggesting that the bacteria of r2 was in a slow recovering phase fig 3e shows the bacterial community composition at generic level many groups were observed among which ca kuenenia and nitrosomona were the main anaob and aob respectively it was observed that in both reactors aob fraction did not change much during operation while anaob continued to increase nitrosomona of r1 increased from 20 68 to 23 01 and that of r2 increased from 22 28 to 22 86 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia in r1 increased from 1 30 to 5 02 which in r2 went from 2 13 to 4 13 it can be found that at 18d the abundance of aob and anaob in r2 was significantly higher than r1 but it was inversely exceeded by r1 at 78d ammonium concentration of r1was 250 mg l sal was around 0 3 and r2 was 300 mg l sal was about 0 35 on 18d in terms of influent condition ca kuenenia in r2 was more suitable for survival under a moderate ammonium condition and showed a faster growth rate than that in r1 however at 78d excessive nh 4 n concentration or sal made aob in the two reactors reach the tolerant limit and a large amount of ammonium left which made fa increased and anaob inhibited in addition many nitrite generated cannot be consumed by anaob in time resulting in the led to the relative excess of nitrite the drastic accumulation of ammonium and nitrite formed double synergistic inhibition of fa and fna to the spna reaction for r1 with better performance the reactor gradually stabilized with the reduction of influent load however for r2 with poor efficiency the existing relative abundance of aob and aaob was insufficient to digest excessive substrate and the balance of functional bacteria was broken or the biomass even washed out of the reactor resulting in reactor destabilization in addition it should be noted that the proportion of aob in biomass was higher than that of anaob the ratio of aob to anaob relative abundance aob anaob in r1 changed from 15 9 to 4 6 and that of r2 changed from 10 5 to 5 5 the results were inconsistent with previous studies wang et al concluded that the aob anaob ratio was 1 3 with a high nitrogen removal of 82 after 400d of cstr operation qiao et al found that the ratio of 0 5 was the best after 6 months of operation and the reactor could still operate stably when the ammonium concentration rose to 500 600 mg l 29 30 this indicated that with the long term operation and the increase of the proportion of anaob the nitrogen removal performance and resilience to substrate shock will be better for nob the abundance of nitrospira has changed from 1 34 to 0 13 r1 and 2 35 to 0 26 r2 when detected at 18d and 78d at such a small amount nob nitrospira had a limited effect on total nitrogen conversion as shown by the decreasing nor values during the operation the results showed that nob was eliminated under the control strategy of increasing residual ammonia concentration in general aob and anaob were enriched effectively in the reactor during domestication but transient overloads would break the activities coordination and balance between functional bacteria lower aob anaob made a more stable performance and a higher tolerance capacity to high ammonia load and the corresponding fa and fna thresholds will increase for the continuous bioreactor when fna mlvss was lower than 1 5 μg g vss and aob anaob was in the range of 4 5 the performance of the reactor was easily kept in invariant with the influent load increased aob anaob should be further reduced 3 2 changes of granular characteristics 3 2 1 variation of eps production fig 4 shows the changes of eps production in a few days after transient substrate shock the total volume of eps showed a trend of first increasing and then dropping and returned to the range of stable period even slightly higher than the original value finally the load changing or influent conditions changing easily caused the bacteria to secrete more eps so as to better protect themselves since more eps would supply more extracellular enzymes and nutrients for microorganisms 31 which may ensure anaob activity when microbes gradually adapted to the environment eps secretion will return to the original level facilitating mass transfer and adhesion of bacteria although the shock concentration was different pn content was generally higher than ps content after two shocks ps variation showed the same trend which increased a little at the beginning then a large decrease for a long time and finally returned to the same value as before for shock a ps of r1 and r2 were 28 91 and 19 24 mg g vss respectively at the beginning of the shock which rose to the peak value 34 30 and 22 38 mg g vss at 12 h after the shock then fluctuated within the range of 13 2 18 8 mg g vss and recovered roughly to the original operation level at 15d after the shock shock b had the same condition as shock a the trend of eps and pn during operation was similar pn content rose to its highest at 6 h after shock a 50 mg l and then slowly declined returning to its original level almost 3 days after the shock for high concentration of shock b 100 mg l pn tended to be similar to shock a but high transient shock delayed the pn response with peaks occurring within 12 30 h after the shock and remaining at their highest based on the bacteria activity it was speculated that the reason for the delayed response was the bacteria were inhibited at the beginning of the instantaneous shock with the gradual adaptation to the environment the microbes showed intense reaction and secreted a large amount of eps to maintain their own activity the maximum pn values of r1 and r2 at shock b were 188 26 and 148 97 mg g vss respectively which were both higher than pn concentration at stable period and shock a indicating that eps secretion was affected by substrate load in other words the secretion of eps was related to the substrate utilization moreover when the reactor was shocked eps will be released to protect bacteria from damage and maintain bacterial activity in order to make reactor sturdy 32 appropriate eps production was conducive to biomass flocculation and granulation process and improved the biomass retention rate in the operation process 33 however during phase iii eps production was greatly higher than before which may weaken the biomass retention capacity and worsen the performance of the reactor 15 in addition excessive eps will have adverse effects on sludge sedimentation and cell adhesion promoting the production of more low density flocs 34 in the later phase of this study high substrate concentration led to excessive secretion of eps which reduced the density of granules and even led to granule disintegration fig 5 corresponding to the variation of eps content in the whole shock process especially phase ⅲ protein polysaccharide ratio pn ps of r2 reactor with high transient substrate shock was generally higher than that of r1 with low load the mean pn ps of r1 also increased from 7 0 2 5 phase ⅱ to 8 5 3 5 phase ⅲ and then gradually decreased the value of r2 ranged from 8 1 1 6 9 5 1 8 fig 4 this indicated that the higher the pn ps ratio was the worse the system stability was correlation results showed that pn ps was highly negatively correlated with sedimentation r pn ps and svi 0 668 sig 0 07 which reflected that higher pn ps resulted in lower granule settleability and increased the risk of biomass washout 3 2 2 changes in particle size and sedimentation higher concentration of fa and fna produced by shock and high ammonium load changed the granule performance in the reactor moreover the particle size distribution also changed during different operation period the classification of the sludge system was according to liu et al and it was better to use the sludge volume percentage with size below 200 µm svp sb200 to indicate that the sludge was a granule dominant sludge when svp sb200 was below 50 35 the granule content increased with the continuous operation of r1 for the sludge with particle size 0 2 mm each inhibition period accounted for more than that in the recovery period indicating that part of the sludge re formed micro granules in the recovery period for granules with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm the proportion of this range showed a decreasing trend combined with the growth trend of 0 4 1 0 mm it can be seen that during the operation of the reactor the micro granules in the range of 0 2 0 4 mm were not greatly susceptible to the shock and most of the particle sizes were gradually increasing compared with the granules with particle size 1 0 mm the range of particle size 0 2 mm showed an opposite trend it may be that transient shock led to granule expansion and porosity even decomposition into smaller granules overall during the load increasing process micro granules in r1 transformed from smaller granules with particle size 0 4 mm to larger granules with particle size 0 4 mm and the transformation process was relatively invariant in addition the granular sludge in r1 can recover quickly after shock and higher substrate load which indicated the robustness of r1 performance for r2 excessive substrate shock in the later stage of phase iii caused fna to increase rapidly resulting in significant changes in granule characteristics and system performance the instability was obviously reflected in the recovery period of shock b larger granules average particle size 0 4 mm disintegrated and the proportion of them was obviously reduced while the proportion of smaller granules average particle size 0 4 mm and even floc sludge was significantly increased compared with the increase of average particle size in the inhibition period of shock b the delayed disintegration of granules was indicated moreover granule sedimentation performance was reduced svi increased by 5 in the late phase iii mlvss decreased by 25 and some biomass washed out of the reactor further worsening the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor with the increase of suspended sludge the loss of biomass and the change of sludge system performance are inevitable the properties of sludge mlss mlvss and svi at different phases of operation were shown in fig 5c and d the biomass growth trend of mlss and mlvss in each reactor was roughly similar and the svi of each reactor changed in a small range without significant decrease in sedimentation 3 3 mechanisms for granule formation and disintegration the spatial distribution of aob and anaob in granules was visualized by fish fig 6 in fig s1and s2 all bacteria are shown in dark purple while the specific anaob and aob population are shown in bright pink and bright blue green the bright blue green fig s1c and d indicates the existence of a large number of aob populations the bright pink fig s1e and f shows that anaob was usually wrapped by aob and was inside the micro granules or floc sludge in addition it can also be seen that compared with r1 part of aob flocs in r2 did not contain anaob which may be due to too higher shock and the inhibition of fna made part of anaob inactivated and even washed out of the reactor in addition the structure of functional bacteria in the granules and the formation as well as disintegration of the micro granules in the reactor was also observed fig 6 chen et al proposed that most anaob agglomerated to form the kernel of granules and aob formed an outer thick edge 36 according to fig 6 a b and c it can be observed that at the early stage of the micro granules formation the granule skeleton may be formed by aob and filamentous bacteria through the connection of eps mainly ps then anaob agglomerations were trapped by these skeletons to form spna micro granules in other words in the core of the granules there was not all anaob that adhered to each other but other bacterial communities such as aob that played a connecting role the doped micro granule structure resulted in faster mass transfer and more efficient nitrogen removal slightly different from the conclusion of chen et al in addition to the above mentioned that ps can form a cross network structure which was conducive to the sludge granulation zhang et al also proposed that that filamentous bacteria existed in granules and played a role in granulation 15 with continuous high ammonia load and transient substrate shock the bacteria will start self protection mechanism under environmental pressure resulting in eps secretion thus protecting the relative activity of functional bacteria in the environment zhu et al proposed that nearly 50 of eps was secreted on the outer surface of granules 12 however environmental changes made bacteria produce a large amount of eps and the granules were wrapped in excessive eps the substrate must pass through the outer eps to reach the internal anaob which reduced the mass transfer efficiency and deteriorated the granule performance 15 meanwhile excessive eps reduced the adhesion ability between granulator bacteria and aob around the granules was further loosened and deviate from the granule fig 6d later the small anaob agglomerations left the granule and washed out of the reactor resulting in particle disintegration fig 6e fig s2 also shows small separate anaob aggregates distributed elsewhere in the field of view it can also be seen from fig s2 compared with r1 with stable sludge performance a small amount of individual anaob aggregates in r2 indicated the loss of small anaob aggregates in r2 3 4 factors affecting and deteriorating granule performance granule stability is generally considered to be strongly influenced by a variety of environmental and operating conditions such as substrate balance temperature wastewater composition and eps production 37 the disintegration of aerobic granular sludge is also a problem in long term operation in this study transient substrate shock and long term high ammonia load led to obvious changes in microbial community and eps content while excessively higher fa and fna concentrations led to deterioration of reactor performance in response to the stimulation of fa and fna eps continuously released by the bacteria in a short term may lead to granule disintegration luo et al proposed that the disintegration of aerobic granular sludge might be related to the change of tyrosine content in eps 38 ismail et al believed that the eps may reduce the particle strength leading to granule disintegration 39 some research also proposed that substrate shock caused changes of n acyl homoserine lactones ahls release in granules leading to variations of lb eps content and affecting granule characteristics 40 in addition zhang et al proposed that excessive lb eps also had a negative effect on initial cell to cell 15 in addition to the above factors the high or low hydraulic shear force and the concentration of metal ions fe2 mg2 and ca2 in the influent will also affect the stability of granules 41 44 in conclusion excessively higher ammonium loads will lead to higher fa and fna which will inhibit the functional bacteria activities and affect its growth consequently then proportion of functional bacteria and bacterial species involved in the granulation process will decrease and bacterial community structure will be changed furthermore the substrate load can affect eps production secreted by bacteria and the chemicals content in eps in some way such as the release of ahls thus affecting the accumulation of bacteria and worsening the granule performance such as settleability stability and strength 4 conclusion two spna systems were operated under increasing nitrogen load and experienced two influent ammonium shocks the transient increase of fna caused by shock was the main reason for the nitrogen removal performance deterioration when fna mlvss was less than 1 5 μg g vss and aob anaob was between 4 and 5 the system can restore nitrogen removal performance more easily after substrate shocks the formation and disintegration mechanism of micro granules were analyzed and the amount and composition of eps were crucial to the stability of granules moreover the micro granule structure with aob as the outer layer and skeleton anaob as the core was constructed

13826,the stability of single partial nitritation and anammox spna granular system at different nitrogen loads was evaluated in two laboratory scale continuous stirred tank reactor cstr reactors r1with lower influent ammonium concentration r2 with higher concentration the effects of different transient substrate shock 50 mg n l and 100 mg n l on the bacteria population structure nitrogen removal and granular sludge properties of the system were studied results showed that r1 had a better resilience and the average removal efficiencies of tn and ammonium can recover to 66 5 and 73 9 after two shocks while nitrogen performance of r2 deteriorated the inhibition of free nitrous acid fna to functional bacteria was the key factor influencing reactor performance when fna concentration exceeded 2 μg l fna mlvss 1 5 μg g vss the inhibition was irreversible moreover excessive substrate shock changed extracellular polymeric substances eps production and composition which led to granules disintegration the formation and disintegration mechanism of spna micro granules were also investigated keywords spna micro granules substrate shock recovery fna mlvss 1 introduction anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob is a kind of chemical chemoautotrophic bacteria in the phylum planctomycetes it takes ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor to remove the ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater without oxygen and organic matter 1 compared with the conventional nitrification and denitrification process anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox has the advantages of low aeration cost no requirement of additional carbon source and less sludge yield 2 3 in recent years the potential of the anammox for biological nitrogen removal has been paid more and more attention 4 anammox is often combined with aerobic processes such as nitritation or simultaneous nitritation denitrification 5 in the spna system ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaob co exist in the same reactor and the cooperation between the two bacteria makes complete autotrophic nitrogen removal possible 6 however since anaob is highly sensitive to environmental conditions it is difficult to maintain stable operation of anammox and its coupling processes in practical application there are a variety of exogenous inhibitors such as substrate organic matter salt etc 7 among them excessive substrate concentrations and substrate shocks are common and important factors 5 in general free ammonia fa and fna are considered the most critical inhibitors for substrate based inhibition in the process however a wide range of inhibition threshold for fa and fna made it harder to operate and maintain the anammox process comparing toxic threshold concentrations of various processes niu et al found a large gap between fna and fa inhibition thresholds which may be related to the diverse system configuration and species of anaob 8 although the adverse effects of fa and fna have been widely reported these reports conflict with respect to the threshold range and reversibility in addition to the reactor type and operating conditions the species and proportions of functional bacteria may be responsible for the tolerance ability to substrate concentration and the correlation between these factors has not been discussed in detail moreover the effects of fa and fna on spna system performance are still uncertain the specific growth rate constant of anaob is very slow μ 0 065 d 1 1 9 making biogranulation an effective strategy the granulation process can be divided into two steps nucleation and nucleus growth into the granule 10 the stable nitrogen removal ability can be obtained by granulating and the good settleability of the granules can retain the biomass in the system these two characteristics are particularly important for the anammox 5 in the biological wastewater treatment process eps have an important impact on the structure diameter and settleability of granules thus affecting reactor performance in recent years a large number of researches have also been conducted to investigate influence of eps content and composition on granules or biofilm formation tay et al suggested that polysaccharide ps can form the cross network structure with cells which was conducive to the change of cell surface properties and the formation of granule 11 protein pn with a higher content in eps could enhance the formation and stability of microbial aggregates 12 furthermore eps also play an important role in sludge granulating and maintaining the structural integrity of granules and they also have a significant influence on the structure and function of microbial aggregates 13 miao et al showed that influent characteristics significantly affected the composition of eps 14 zhang et al proposed that inappropriate substrate concentration or composition of eps might cause significant changes in the content of eps 15 however under the impact of transient shock the secretion of eps and the self defense response of functional bacteria in spna system are still in the exploratory stage in this study the operation strategies of two different substrate concentrations were compared the specific objectives are 1 to study the impact of influent and effluent nitrogen load fa and fna content changes per unit biomass on reactor performance functional bacteria abundance and ratio the main factors affecting the reactor recovery performance were also discussed 2 by observing the response of eps at the initial period of shocks discuss the changes of eps content and composition during inhibition and recovery periods and further explore the adaptation and self defense modes of bacteria under environment pressure such as substrate shock 3 investigate the effects of influent configurations on the performance and structure of spna granule by closely monitoring changes in granule characteristics microbial community and reactor treatment performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation for specific comparisons two laboratory sized cstr reactors were run in parallel both reactors operated continuously for more than 150 days the reactor structure air supply mode and biomass characteristics were the same as previous studies 16 the mlss of r1was about 5300 mg l and that of r2 was around 5700 mg l at the beginning of the operation anaob abundance of r2 2 13 was more than r1 1 30 there were three phases in the continuous experiment table 1 at the stable period phase i the ammonia nitrogen concentration of r1 was invariant around 250 mg l and that of r2 was about 300 mg l and the hrt of the both reactors was constant at 6 h then the influent ammonia nitrogen concentration was suddenly increased by 50 mg l shock a and 100 mg l shock b separately as two influent transient substrate shocks and the transient high substrate concentration was used to evaluate the impact of shocks on reactor performance and eps production in addition the influent load was still slowly increased during operation to achieve nob suppression the operation period can be divided into three phases phase i was the stable period phase ii included the inhibition period and recovery period of shock a and phase iii included the inhibition and recovery period of shock b at the later period of phase iii the substrate concentration gradually decreased to recover the reactor performance table 1 2 2 analysis method 2 2 1 chemical analysis the extraction and analysis methods of nitrogen compounds nitrite nitrate and ammonium and eps were the same as the previous studies 16 do concentration and ph value were monitored with a do and ph meter wtw multi 3430 germany during the experiment the aeration rate was 4 2 l min the do concentration of r1 and r2 were between 0 05 0 17 mg l and 0 06 0 10 mg l respectively by controlling the dosage of nahco3 the ph in bulk liquid was kept between 7 8 8 4 r1 and 7 9 8 3 r2 respectively based on the equation for nitrogen balance and chemometrics of vazquez padin et al we respectively calculated the ammonia oxidation rate aor nitrite oxidation

granules the particle size distribution and sedimentation were evaluated mastersizer 2000 malvern was used to determine the particle size distribution according to the particle size mm micro granules were divided into 4 groups 0 2 mm 0 2 0 4 mm 0 4 1 0 mm 1 0 mm mixed liquid suspended solids mlss mixed liquid volatile suspended matter mlvss and sludge volume index svi were analyzed by standard method apha 1998 2 4 statistical analysis two groups of parallel samples were taken to measure the eps components during operation as well as mlss mlvss and svi and the mean values of fa fna aor and anr in the effluent were calculated the mean values of r1 and r2 were taken within 10 days at 34d 53d 78d and 84d with a total of 8 samples the correlation represented by r among the components was obtained by pearson correlation analysis ibm spss statistic 24 was used for pearson correlation analysis to measure the relationship between analysis parameters the reliability of the experimental results was characterized by significance test represented by sig 2 5 fish analysis fish technology was used to conduct quantitative analysis of aob anaob and all bacteria in r1 and r2 systems eub338 and eub338 ii probes eub probe mixture were used together in an equi molar mixture to detect all bacteria and nso190 was mixed with nso1225 nso probe mixture for detecting aob amx0820 and amx1900 amx probe mixture were used to investigate the presence of anaob all probes were purchased from sangon company china fish images were collected and recorded using an acquisition system software caseviewer coupled with an olympus ﬂuorescence microscope the probes and base sequences used are shown in table 2 2 6 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing in order to study the variations of microbial community in each reactor the sludge samples were extracted from two reactors at the beginning and the end of operation day 18 and day 78 and detected on an illumina mi seq platform at allwegene tech co ltd in beijing 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance 3 1 1 performance during stable period phase i according to the influent loads variation the operation period was divided into three phases including stable phase phase i and two shocks shock a in phase ii and shock b in phase iii as shown in fig 1 r1 and r2 operated steadily for 32 days phase i at the influent ammonia concentration of 250 mg l and 300 mg l respectively in the first 10 days of this period the ammonia removal efficiencies improved then tended to be invariant in the next 20 days the average ammonia and tn removal efficiencies of r1 were 84 4 and 70 5 and those of r2 were 65 8 and 54 7 in addition anr increased slowly in both reactors and nor decreased which indicated that nob existed in the reactors and its activity decreased slowly aktan et al pointed out that when fa was lower than 13 15 mg l the influence of fa on the anammox process was insignificant 24 moreover in order to maintain the performance stability of the system the optimal fa concentration was reported to be less than 38 mg l 25 and the fna level was preferably less than 1 5 μg l 7 during the stable operation the fa and fna of r1 were around 1 4 10 6 mg l and 0 03 1 01 μg l respectively r2 had a higher influent ammonium concentration and fa than r1 and fa and fna fluctuated in the range of 6 2 16 9 mg l and 0 04 1 27 μg l fig 2 3 1 2 variation and comparison of two reactors performance according to fig 1a and b when the influent ammonia was increased by 50 mg l as transient shock a the reactor nitrogen removal ability of r1 reduced immediately and then recovered well after two weeks adaption although the tn removal efficiency decreased from 77 8 48 5 in the early days of inhibition it recovered to the original value after 15 days 48d and remained stable in phase ii when the influent ammonia nitrogen slowly rised to 350 mg l anr increased slightly with a bigger reduction of nor for r2 the inhibition period of shock a was shorter 33d 40d compared with r1 r2 in the early stage was more capable of absorbing the shock load the tn removal efficiency dropped from 63 3 to26 9 and then increased to 62 0 10 days later 43d after the recovery the nitrogen removal efficiency of r2 basically remained stable during 25 days 43d 68d the tn removal efficiency of r2 was lower than that of r1 and the growth rate of that was slower it was indicated that in the middle stage of phase ii r2 was hard to improve the nitrogen removal performance in a short time this may be due to the species and relative abundance of functional bacterial were not enough to tolerate the substrate at this stage which made the poor nitrogen removal performance however the increasing anr meant that anaob remained active on the contrary nor began to be close to or lower than anr which meant nob activity was greatly inhibited when the both reactors were subjected to the shock concentration of 100 mg l shock b the effluent nitrogen concentration continued to rise and nitrogen removal efficiencies dropped showing the instability states after 12 days of shock b the nitrogen removal performance still deteriorated in order to relieve the effects of the too high nh 4 n concentration from the 80th day the concentration was decreased to the safety level obtained from the stable operation after that for r1 the phenomenon of treatment ability improvement was also observed at the end of the operation the removal efficiencies of ammonia nitrogen and tn in the recovery period were recover to 73 9 and 66 5 respectively we found r1 had a better tolerance to transient substrate shocks and was minimally impacted by fluctuations in influent substrate concentrations although such a perturbation occurred the reactor quickly recovered to the original operation level however for r2 the nitrogen removal performance degenerated for a longer time and recovered slowly there are two reasons for the destabilization of r2 one hand the instantaneous increasing concentration was so high that the reactor could not resist the rough shock on the other hand under the present configurations and conditions the influent nh 4 n concentration was in a critical level which could barely maintain stable performance as the concentration kept increasing the reactor became deterioration 3 1 3 reactor performance evaluation according to fig 2a and b in phases i and ii the sludge ammonia nitrogen loading sal of r1 was basically in an upward trend along with the increase of influent concentration biomass increased slowly discussed in 3 2 2 which made the tolerance ability of unit mass of biomass much higher than before indicating that r1 had a continuously enhanced robustness on the other hand the biomass of r2 may increase correspondingly because the influent nh 4 n concentration was suitable for microbial growth and the sal tended to slow down which indicated that unit mass of microorganisms in r2 was under reducing load in other words they were more suitable for the lower environmental pressure owing to the exacerbation of sludge performance by sudden overload r2 was less resilient than r1 for higher substrate concentrations shocks subsequent experiments confirmed the conclusion in addition in the later phase ii the ammonium concentration of r2 was imposed 50 mg l higher than r1 but sal of r2 was much lower than r1 it was indicated that influent nh 4 n concentration and sal were not synchronized completely and mlss or mlvss should be taken into account to evaluate the impact of influent on the reactor at the beginning of phase iii it can be seen that with the sudden increase of substrate concentration the sal of the two reactors increased correspondingly the sal of r1 doubled from 0 30 18d to 0 60 g nh 4 n g mlvss d 78d and r2 also increased from 0 35 to 0 49 g nh 4 n g mlvss d moreover the correlation analysis showed that ammonia nitrogen concentration and sal were not the main causes of r2 destabilization r tn removal efficiency and sal 0 377 sig 0 358 r ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency and sal 0 461 sig 0 250 the reason for r2 instability may be that with the continuous increase of the operation time the shock resistance decreased gradually in this case a sudden high concentration of substrate shock occurred which deteriorated the reactor performance in addition to the manipulation conditions the key factors affecting the reactor performance included the concentration of fa and fna fa could neutralize membrane potentials resulting in slow cell metabolism and even cell death 5 and fna can affect many metabolic processes through inhibition such as active transport of substrates across cell membranes and oxidative phosphorylation 26 strous et al also put forward that even a very low concentration fna can also act as inhibitors of anaob fna in 6 μg l completely inhibited ca brocadia activity 27 another enrichment medium containing ca kuenenia was completely inactivated at fna concentration of 40 μg l 28 however the specific reactor conditions sludge volume functional bacteria types and activity were not explored during phase ii the fa and fna levels in both reactors were lower than the inhibition thresholds aforementioned the maximum fa concentrations were 14 06 mg l r1 and 18 05 mg l r2 and the fna values were 0 21 μg l and 0 32 μg l respectively in phase iii the fa of r1 achieved a peak value of 30 5 mg l and fna was as high as 7 02 μg l then decreased to 3 10 0 20 μg l and remained unchanged although the fa values were still lower than the toxic thresholds described by above researches inhibition occurred which indicated the threshold of the reactor had been reached the fa concentration of r2 was up to 38 20 mg l and the fna level was to 11 03 μg l surpassing the threshold of the reactor adjustment by decreasing the load also failed to moderate the reactor performance resulting in further exacerbation of r2 compared with the previous phase the fa concentration in two reactors increased by 2 times and the fna even more than 10 times showing that effluent fa and fna values increased with the increase of substrate concentration through correlation analysis it was also found that the inhibition of fna was accompanied by the effluent accumulation of high ammonia nitrogen concentration and fa r fa and fna 0 806 sig 0 016 r effluent ammonia and fna 0 836 sig 0 01 in addition it can be seen from r1 that fna inhibition was reversible in anammox within 15 days 69 84d the concentration of fna surpassed 2 μg l which inhibited the reactor and gradually returned to the original processing level later however for r2 fna increased from 2 05 μg l 71d to 6 71 μg l 73d finally up to 11 03 μg l 81d and decreased slowly it was determined that when fna exceeded a certain concentration the inhibition was almost irreversible which also illustrated the importance of maintaining proper fna in the reactor moreover the concentrations of fa and fna in unit biomass fa mlvss and fna mlvss were compared fig 2c and d it can be seen that parameters of r1 in the first two phases were relatively invariant but in phase iii fa mlvss even increased from 2 07 to 10 13 mg g vss nearly 5 times of its original value and fna also slightly increased leading to system vulnerable by reducing the influent load the two values were quickly restored and the reactor was stabilized for r2 fna mlvss remained unchanged in the first two phases while fa mlvss showed a decreasing trend which resembled the sal of r2 in phase iii fa mlvss of r2 were similar to that at the beginning of operation but the nitrogen efficiency continued to be worsened combined with the performance changes of the two reactors it was indicated that the main reason for reactor instability was that microorganisms were very sensitive to fna variation correlation analysis showed similar results table 3 table 3 showed that anr was significantly negatively correlated with fna mlvss with the highest correlation than other parameters r anr and fna mlvss 0 907 sig 0 002 which proved that excessive fna inhibited anaob activity however the correlation between aor and fa or fna was not significant indicating that fa and fna had low influence on aob moreover it was obvious that fna mlvss was a key indicator affecting the operation of the reactor and had the significant influence on the system nitrogen removal performance with r fna mlvss and tn removal rate 0 978 fna mlvss of r1 kept below 0 16 μg g vss before shock b and r2 was below 0 46 μg g vss however after shock b fna mlvss of r1 briefly remained at 1 5 μg g vss and then dropped fna mlvss of r2 rose above 2 0 μg g immediately after fna mlvss maintaining a state of 1 5 μg g vss causing reactor vulnerable in other words when the fna mlvss of the reactor exceeds 1 5 μg g vss for a long time the nitrogen removal performance of spna system will deteriorate furthermore it was found that the correlation between fna and tn ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was 0 965 and 0 872 respectively while fa of that was 0 782 and 0 840 respectively which proved that fna had a more significant influence on spna system than fa for the study excessive fna inhibited the bacteria activity which made r2 difficult to recover its performance in the last phase fna mlvss was the key factor affecting reactor performance in addition fa and fna had a more significant impact on anaob than that of aob and fna had a greater impact on functional bacteria than fa 3 1 4 comparison of bacteria in each system the degree of system degeneration depends on the magnitude of the shocks and the adaptability of the bacteria community in view of the substrate shock on the system and the response of the bacteria the microbial community structure and the functional bacteria activities in spna system were analyzed and the sludge was sampled at 18d and 78d fig 3 a and b shows that with the variation of influent loads both anr and aor changed within a small range at the end of phase iii aor and anr of r1 increased indicating that the functional bacteria activity of r1 recovered however r2 showed a small decrease trend suggesting that the bacteria of r2 was in a slow recovering phase fig 3e shows the bacterial community composition at generic level many groups were observed among which ca kuenenia and nitrosomona were the main anaob and aob respectively it was observed that in both reactors aob fraction did not change much during operation while anaob continued to increase nitrosomona of r1 increased from 20 68 to 23 01 and that of r2 increased from 22 28 to 22 86 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia in r1 increased from 1 30 to 5 02 which in r2 went from 2 13 to 4 13 it can be found that at 18d the abundance of aob and anaob in r2 was significantly higher than r1 but it was inversely exceeded by r1 at 78d ammonium concentration of r1was 250 mg l sal was around 0 3 and r2 was 300 mg l sal was about 0 35 on 18d in terms of influent condition ca kuenenia in r2 was more suitable for survival under a moderate ammonium condition and showed a faster growth rate than that in r1 however at 78d excessive nh 4 n concentration or sal made aob in the two reactors reach the tolerant limit and a large amount of ammonium left which made fa increased and anaob inhibited in addition many nitrite generated cannot be consumed by anaob in time resulting in the led to the relative excess of nitrite the drastic accumulation of ammonium and nitrite formed double synergistic inhibition of fa and fna to the spna reaction for r1 with better performance the reactor gradually stabilized with the reduction of influent load however for r2 with poor efficiency the existing relative abundance of aob and aaob was insufficient to digest excessive substrate and the balance of functional bacteria was broken or the biomass even washed out of the reactor resulting in reactor destabilization in addition it should be noted that the proportion of aob in biomass was higher than that of anaob the ratio of aob to anaob relative abundance aob anaob in r1 changed from 15 9 to 4 6 and that of r2 changed from 10 5 to 5 5 the results were inconsistent with previous studies wang et al concluded that the aob anaob ratio was 1 3 with a high nitrogen removal of 82 after 400d of cstr operation qiao et al found that the ratio of 0 5 was the best after 6 months of operation and the reactor could still operate stably when the ammonium concentration rose to 500 600 mg l 29 30 this indicated that with the long term operation and the increase of the proportion of anaob the nitrogen removal performance and resilience to substrate shock will be better for nob the abundance of nitrospira has changed from 1 34 to 0 13 r1 and 2 35 to 0 26 r2 when detected at 18d and 78d at such a small amount nob nitrospira had a limited effect on total nitrogen conversion as shown by the decreasing nor values during the operation the results showed that nob was eliminated under the control strategy of increasing residual ammonia concentration in general aob and anaob were enriched effectively in the reactor during domestication but transient overloads would break the activities coordination and balance between functional bacteria lower aob anaob made a more stable performance and a higher tolerance capacity to high ammonia load and the corresponding fa and fna thresholds will increase for the continuous bioreactor when fna mlvss was lower than 1 5 μg g vss and aob anaob was in the range of 4 5 the performance of the reactor was easily kept in invariant with the influent load increased aob anaob should be further reduced 3 2 changes of granular characteristics 3 2 1 variation of eps production fig 4 shows the changes of eps production in a few days after transient substrate shock the total volume of eps showed a trend of first increasing and then dropping and returned to the range of stable period even slightly higher than the original value finally the load changing or influent conditions changing easily caused the bacteria to secrete more eps so as to better protect themselves since more eps would supply more extracellular enzymes and nutrients for microorganisms 31 which may ensure anaob activity when microbes gradually adapted to the environment eps secretion will return to the original level facilitating mass transfer and adhesion of bacteria although the shock concentration was different pn content was generally higher than ps content after two shocks ps variation showed the same trend which increased a little at the beginning then a large decrease for a long time and finally returned to the same value as before for shock a ps of r1 and r2 were 28 91 and 19 24 mg g vss respectively at the beginning of the shock which rose to the peak value 34 30 and 22 38 mg g vss at 12 h after the shock then fluctuated within the range of 13 2 18 8 mg g vss and recovered roughly to the original operation level at 15d after the shock shock b had the same condition as shock a the trend of eps and pn during operation was similar pn content rose to its highest at 6 h after shock a 50 mg l and then slowly declined returning to its original level almost 3 days after the shock for high concentration of shock b 100 mg l pn tended to be similar to shock a but high transient shock delayed the pn response with peaks occurring within 12 30 h after the shock and remaining at their highest based on the bacteria activity it was speculated that the reason for the delayed response was the bacteria were inhibited at the beginning of the instantaneous shock with the gradual adaptation to the environment the microbes showed intense reaction and secreted a large amount of eps to maintain their own activity the maximum pn values of r1 and r2 at shock b were 188 26 and 148 97 mg g vss respectively which were both higher than pn concentration at stable period and shock a indicating that eps secretion was affected by substrate load in other words the secretion of eps was related to the substrate utilization moreover when the reactor was shocked eps will be released to protect bacteria from damage and maintain bacterial activity in order to make reactor sturdy 32 appropriate eps production was conducive to biomass flocculation and granulation process and improved the biomass retention rate in the operation process 33 however during phase iii eps production was greatly higher than before which may weaken the biomass retention capacity and worsen the performance of the reactor 15 in addition excessive eps will have adverse effects on sludge sedimentation and cell adhesion promoting the production of more low density flocs 34 in the later phase of this study high substrate concentration led to excessive secretion of eps which reduced the density of granules and even led to granule disintegration fig 5 corresponding to the variation of eps content in the whole shock process especially phase ⅲ protein polysaccharide ratio pn ps of r2 reactor with high transient substrate shock was generally higher than that of r1 with low load the mean pn ps of r1 also increased from 7 0 2 5 phase ⅱ to 8 5 3 5 phase ⅲ and then gradually decreased the value of r2 ranged from 8 1 1 6 9 5 1 8 fig 4 this indicated that the higher the pn ps ratio was the worse the system stability was correlation results showed that pn ps was highly negatively correlated with sedimentation r pn ps and svi 0 668 sig 0 07 which reflected that higher pn ps resulted in lower granule settleability and increased the risk of biomass washout 3 2 2 changes in particle size and sedimentation higher concentration of fa and fna produced by shock and high ammonium load changed the granule performance in the reactor moreover the particle size distribution also changed during different operation period the classification of the sludge system was according to liu et al and it was better to use the sludge volume percentage with size below 200 µm svp sb200 to indicate that the sludge was a granule dominant sludge when svp sb200 was below 50 35 the granule content increased with the continuous operation of r1 for the sludge with particle size 0 2 mm each inhibition period accounted for more than that in the recovery period indicating that part of the sludge re formed micro granules in the recovery period for granules with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm the proportion of this range showed a decreasing trend combined with the growth trend of 0 4 1 0 mm it can be seen that during the operation of the reactor the micro granules in the range of 0 2 0 4 mm were not greatly susceptible to the shock and most of the particle sizes were gradually increasing compared with the granules with particle size 1 0 mm the range of particle size 0 2 mm showed an opposite trend it may be that transient shock led to granule expansion and porosity even decomposition into smaller granules overall during the load increasing process micro granules in r1 transformed from smaller granules with particle size 0 4 mm to larger granules with particle size 0 4 mm and the transformation process was relatively invariant in addition the granular sludge in r1 can recover quickly after shock and higher substrate load which indicated the robustness of r1 performance for r2 excessive substrate shock in the later stage of phase iii caused fna to increase rapidly resulting in significant changes in granule characteristics and system performance the instability was obviously reflected in the recovery period of shock b larger granules average particle size 0 4 mm disintegrated and the proportion of them was obviously reduced while the proportion of smaller granules average particle size 0 4 mm and even floc sludge was significantly increased compared with the increase of average particle size in the inhibition period of shock b the delayed disintegration of granules was indicated moreover granule sedimentation performance was reduced svi increased by 5 in the late phase iii mlvss decreased by 25 and some biomass washed out of the reactor further worsening the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor with the increase of suspended sludge the loss of biomass and the change of sludge system performance are inevitable the properties of sludge mlss mlvss and svi at different phases of operation were shown in fig 5c and d the biomass growth trend of mlss and mlvss in each reactor was roughly similar and the svi of each reactor changed in a small range without significant decrease in sedimentation 3 3 mechanisms for granule formation and disintegration the spatial distribution of aob and anaob in granules was visualized by fish fig 6 in fig s1and s2 all bacteria are shown in dark purple while the specific anaob and aob population are shown in bright pink and bright blue green the bright blue green fig s1c and d indicates the existence of a large number of aob populations the bright pink fig s1e and f shows that anaob was usually wrapped by aob and was inside the micro granules or floc sludge in addition it can also be seen that compared with r1 part of aob flocs in r2 did not contain anaob which may be due to too higher shock and the inhibition of fna made part of anaob inactivated and even washed out of the reactor in addition the structure of functional bacteria in the granules and the formation as well as disintegration of the micro granules in the reactor was also observed fig 6 chen et al proposed that most anaob agglomerated to form the kernel of granules and aob formed an outer thick edge 36 according to fig 6 a b and c it can be observed that at the early stage of the micro granules formation the granule skeleton may be formed by aob and filamentous bacteria through the connection of eps mainly ps then anaob agglomerations were trapped by these skeletons to form spna micro granules in other words in the core of the granules there was not all anaob that adhered to each other but other bacterial communities such as aob that played a connecting role the doped micro granule structure resulted in faster mass transfer and more efficient nitrogen removal slightly different from the conclusion of chen et al in addition to the above mentioned that ps can form a cross network structure which was conducive to the sludge granulation zhang et al also proposed that that filamentous bacteria existed in granules and played a role in granulation 15 with continuous high ammonia load and transient substrate shock the bacteria will start self protection mechanism under environmental pressure resulting in eps secretion thus protecting the relative activity of functional bacteria in the environment zhu et al proposed that nearly 50 of eps was secreted on the outer surface of granules 12 however environmental changes made bacteria produce a large amount of eps and the granules were wrapped in excessive eps the substrate must pass through the outer eps to reach the internal anaob which reduced the mass transfer efficiency and deteriorated the granule performance 15 meanwhile excessive eps reduced the adhesion ability between granulator bacteria and aob around the granules was further loosened and deviate from the granule fig 6d later the small anaob agglomerations left the granule and washed out of the reactor resulting in particle disintegration fig 6e fig s2 also shows small separate anaob aggregates distributed elsewhere in the field of view it can also be seen from fig s2 compared with r1 with stable sludge performance a small amount of individual anaob aggregates in r2 indicated the loss of small anaob aggregates in r2 3 4 factors affecting and deteriorating granule performance granule stability is generally considered to be strongly influenced by a variety of environmental and operating conditions such as substrate balance temperature wastewater composition and eps production 37 the disintegration of aerobic granular sludge is also a problem in long term operation in this study transient substrate shock and long term high ammonia load led to obvious changes in microbial community and eps content while excessively higher fa and fna concentrations led to deterioration of reactor performance in response to the stimulation of fa and fna eps continuously released by the bacteria in a short term may lead to granule disintegration luo et al proposed that the disintegration of aerobic granular sludge might be related to the change of tyrosine content in eps 38 ismail et al believed that the eps may reduce the particle strength leading to granule disintegration 39 some research also proposed that substrate shock caused changes of n acyl homoserine lactones ahls release in granules leading to variations of lb eps content and affecting granule characteristics 40 in addition zhang et al proposed that excessive lb eps also had a negative effect on initial cell to cell 15 in addition to the above factors the high or low hydraulic shear force and the concentration of metal ions fe2 mg2 and ca2 in the influent will also affect the stability of granules 41 44 in conclusion excessively higher ammonium loads will lead to higher fa and fna which will inhibit the functional bacteria activities and affect its growth consequently then proportion of functional bacteria and bacterial species involved in the granulation process will decrease and bacterial community structure will be changed furthermore the substrate load can affect eps production secreted by bacteria and the chemicals content in eps in some way such as the release of ahls thus affecting the accumulation of bacteria and worsening the granule performance such as settleability stability and strength 4 conclusion two spna systems were operated under increasing nitrogen load and experienced two influent ammonium shocks the transient increase of fna caused by shock was the main reason for the nitrogen removal performance deterioration when fna mlvss was less than 1 5 μg g vss and aob anaob was between 4 and 5 the system can restore nitrogen removal performance more easily after substrate shocks the formation and disintegration mechanism of micro granules were analyzed and the amount and composition of eps were crucial to the stability of granules moreover the micro granule structure with aob as the outer layer and skeleton anaob as the core was constructed

13827,this study investigates microplastic mp removal by flotation and by settling units of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp that consisted of coarse screens fine screens aerated grit chambers agcs and the conventional activated sludge cas system agcs operate with rigorous mixing and short hydraulic residence times hrt that cause agcs to remove mps moderately while settling tanks operate with long hrts and steady flow conditions that favor sedimentation of mps mp characteristics such as flat shape e g films large size 1 5 mm and low density support mp removal by flotation while mps with large 3d structures 1 5 mm and high material density settle quickly as the highest rates of mp removal by relevant units agcs removed 59 of influent concentration of large size films 1 5 mm while settling tanks removed around 90 of the influent concentration of fragments the observed mp removal rates by the wwtp followed the order of fragments films fibers as 90 85 70 respectively for improvement of mp removal by wwtps addition of gravity based settling units installation of inclined plate and or tube settlers into existing settling tanks and use of coagulants in settling process are among the feasible options keywords wastewater microplastics removal flotation settling 1 introduction microplastics mps are tiny plastic particles that are smaller than 5 mm in size and that are persistent and ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments 1 5 because various organisms such as invertabrates and fish can ingest mps and incur problems such as chocking laceration and poisoning fate of mps in natural ecosystems has become a critical research field 6 8 accordingly scientific studies about sources occurences characteristics interactions transport and adverse effects of mps in natural environments are substantial 9 18 collectively the studies highlight critical challenges in mp research as to improve mp definition and to harmonize mp quantification methods 1 9 16 for instance current mp definition based on size 5 mm needs to be improved to consider mp s physical state e g solid gel solubility polymer type size e g nano micro shape and structure e g spheres fibers color and source 1 likewise analytical methods for sampling extraction quantification e g microscopic boundries and identification of polymer types must be harmonized for effective coordination and comparison of scientific findings in this area 9 16 at present mps are grouped as primary and secondary types based on their sources 14 29 primary mps include those such as pellets and microbeads that are fabricated for direct use in consumer products such as glitters in makeup and craft materials and microbeads in facial and body cleansers 16 22 secondary mps include a wide range of particles such as fibers that are released by laundry washing fragments that break away from tires bitumen and road marking paints and tiny pieces that disintegrate from macroplastics e g plastic bags as result of physical e g solar radiation wind and water waves chemical e g acidic conditions and microbiological erosion 23 30 in urban settings all mp types usually end up in sewer networks due to domestic discharges e g laundry washing rain runoff and street washing 14 16 sewer systems convey mps to municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps that consist of several treatment stages including preliminary primary secondary and tertiary treatment operations 31 32 among them preliminary steps include units such as screens to remove large debris e g wipes cotton tips cigarette buds and gravity based grit chambers to capture gravel and sand 31 primary stage includes sedimentation tanks and or flotation units that remove grease and colloidal particles such as clay 31 32 secondary treatment refers to conversion of dissolved organic matter e g fatty acids into carbon dioxide and water via microbiological processes such as conventional activated sludge cas system biofilm reactors and anaerobic digestors that convert organic substances to methane 31 33 typically a conventional wwtp includes the three stages above that achieve the required level of treatment so that the effluent is permissible by governmental agencies for discharge into a receiving body e g river lake ocean in certain cases such as when the receiving body is a sensitive ecosystem or when water must be recovered for reuse e g irrigation the effluent is further treated via tertiary operations such as media filters e g sand filters and disinfection units that remove residues as phosphorous and microorganisms e g viruses bacteria hence tertiary stage includes advanced treatment operations to produce high quality water 31 32 because wwtps serve as key barriers to control mp emissions into natural environment numerous research groups has focused on individual treatment stages to improve their performance 28 34 51 in general wwtps capture mps depending on the extent of their treatment operations 34 40 particularly the plants with tertiary stage consistently remove 95 of incoming mps while conventional wwtps capture mps at rates ranging from 64 4 to 99 9 14 36 39 44 a reason for this variability is that comparable treatment operations perform in a wide range 36 38 45 as an example michielssen et al 36 studied mp removal by two independent plants that employed screens and gravity based grit chambers as their preliminary treatment stages although the operations were very similar the reported mp removal efficacies were 35 and 59 for the comparable stages of those two independent plants 36 as a point of reference table s1 of the supplementary materials sm summarizes key features of representative studies that assessed mp removal by municipal wwtps likewise table s2 of sm summarizes methodological differences among the representative investigations in table s1 collectively the studies noted critical causes of the variability among mp removal efficacies by conventional wwtps as follows i mp load and mp characteristics e g size and density of incoming wastewater at each wwtp ii exact configuration of treatment operations and iii the differences in mp quantification procedures such as low end of mp sizing e g 10 μm vs 500 μm mps 5 mm set by each investigation 1 11 14 16 37 43 45 49 to improve mp removal past studies proposed to investigate primary removal mechanisms with respect to mp characteristics such as shape and density findings of such studies will allow for operation of individual units in a way to enhance overall performance of conventional wwtps in this context this study analyzes mp removal by a conventional wwtp that consists of coarse screens fine screens aerated grit chambers and the cas system the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the role of flotation i e aerated grit chambers and sedimentation units of the cas system in removing mps with respect to mp sizes shapes and polymer types we hypothesize that mp removal by a unit operation relies on its operational features such as hydraulic residence time hrt of wastewater in that unit as well as mp characteristics such as shape size and density for example flotation units typically operate with short hrts and turbulent mixing of wastewater due to air bubbling hence flotation units may remove mps moderately likewise mps that are captured by flotation units may have common characteristics such as small size e g 1 mm and low material density e g 0 9 g cm3 in contrast settling tanks operate with long hrts and low turbulence levels that are suitable to capture most mps by sedimentation however mp characteristics such as shape and material density affect settling behavior of mps and their removal rates by sedimentation to analyze these assertions we quantified and characterized mps at critical locations along the plant including the influent the aerated grit chambers effluent and the effluent of sedimentation tanks of the cas system we identified mps based on their shapes i e fibers films and fragment size ranges 1 mm vs 1 5 mm and polymer types e g polyethylene our results reveal how mp characteristics influence their removal rates by flotation and sedimentation processes as well as by the overall treatment operation we discuss our findings in light of past studies to formulate strategies to enhance mp removal by relevant units and by conventional wwtps and we suggest several new areas of research for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the wwtp the municipal wwtp is the karaman wastewater treatment plant that is located in northwestern region of turkey and serves to the city of sakarya with a population of 1 626 000 people as well as to regional industrial facilities fig 1 shows principle treatment units of the plant that include coarse screens fine screens aerated grit chambers and the cas system as the secondary treatment stage table 1 presents basic characteristics of the wastewater before and after its treatment by this facility the average wastewater flow rate is 81900 m3 day for dry weather summer and 85100 m3 day for wet weather winter conditions the plant had mechanisms to bypass excess stormwater flow that it received during heavy rain events hence the flow rate is relatively stable throughout a year for treatment fig 1 wastewater proceeds through coarse screens and fine screens for removal of debris such as wipes and cigarette butts coarse screens are typical bar screens with 20 mm openings between the bars while fine screens are static wedge wire plates with 6 mm spacing between its wires next wastewater moves into the aerated grit chambers that deliver coarse air bubbles ca 1 cm in diameter via perforated pipes located at its bottom air bubbles coalesce with low density substances such as fat oil and grease and lift them to the chambers surface where an automated scraper removes the skim for disposal via solid waste route the chamber operates with a hrt of around 4 minutes and rigorous mixing due to air bubbling then wastewater moves into the secondary treatment stage that is the cas system composed of aeration units and settling tanks in aeration units compressed air is pumped through air diffusers located at the bottom of aeration basin to transfer of oxygen from air into wastewater microorganisms use dissolved oxygen and oxidize dissolved organic substances into carbondioxide and water by doing so microorganisms gain energy for cell maintenance and growth then wastewater containing microorganisms biosolids and inert solids such as mps move and settle in sedimentation tanks in which treated water overflows for discharge into a nearby cark stream while settled solids sludge move to sludge processing facilities for dewatering some portion of sludge is recycled back to aeration tanks to maintain a steady concentration of microorganisms in those units with respect to mp removal bar screens have large spaces between their bars e g 20 mm and 6 mm through which mps 5 mm pass and avoid withdrawal the aerated grit chambers operate with short hrt and turbulent mixing and thereby they ought to capture mps moderately the aeration tanks of cas system house microorganisms to remove dissolved organics from wastewater and generate new microorganisms as biosolids hence aeration tanks are not expected to remove mps subsequently wastewater with all solids including mps move from aeration tanks into settling tanks of the cas system for sedimentation these tanks provide suitable conditions such as low turbulence and long hrts i e 6 8 hours that favor sedimentation of most solids hence settling tanks of the cas system are the principal units that ought to capture mps at this plant 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 grab and composite sampling we collected grab and composite liquid samples at the plant s inlet before coarse screens at the aerated grit chambers outlet and at the effluent of settling tanks we took grab samples once in a month over a year between september 2016 and october 2017 while we took composite samples monthly over 6 months from may 2017 to october 2017 we used a bucket like container and collected 10 l of wastewater as a grab sample for composite samples we used a peristaltic pump to transfer 12 l of wastewater at a rate of 100 ml min for 2 hours during pumping wastewater passed through a filtration unit that sieved solids including mps the filtration unit was composed of three steel pipes that were 75 mm in diameter and 30 cm in length each pipe had a steel sieve at its lower end with pore sizes as 1000 μm top sieve 500 μm middle sieve and 50 μm the three pipes were fitted together to form a single unit upon filtration of each sample we removed the sieves carefully and placed each one in a glass petri dish that we capped with a glass cover taped and labeled with sampling details such as location and date then we transferred the samples to our laboratory for mp analysis for sludge samples we removed 100 ml of sludge from sludge outlet of the settling tanks and analyzed the sample for mps as outlined in the next section 2 3 mp isolation from collected matrices to isolate mps we backwashed each sieve with approximately 200 ml of deionized water to transfer solids into a beaker to eliminate organic solids we treated the sample with fenton s reagent that was 10 ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with 10 ml 0 05 m iron ii as the catalyst feso4 7h2o 50 52 upon removal of organic matter we added 10 ml of zinc chloride zncl2 solution density of 1 6 g cm3 into the sample to increase density of the liquid phase then we centrifuged the liquid sample at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes and filtered the supernatant through filter papers with pore sizes of 12 25 μm whatman co grade 589 1 black ribbon part no 10300010 we repeated this step several times to transfer all inert solids from liquid phase to filter papers to extract mps from sludge samples we used 100 ml sludge sample and added 900 ml of deionized water to obtain a dilute slurry of 1 l then we extracted mps by following the procedure that we employed for wastewater samples as noted above 2 4 quantification and characterization of mps 2 4 1 microscopic analyses we used a light microscope olympus bx51 t olympus corp tokyo japan at 100x magnification to identify basic morphology and size ranges of mps the microscope was equipped with a digital camera olympus dp20 to capture microscopic images of mps to be systematic we categorized mps into three major shapes as fibers e g filaments and threads films e g flat shaped mps and fragments irregularly shaped 3d mps which agrees with mp classifications of past studies that investigated mp removal by wwtps 14 16 45 48 50 specifically the studies noted that fibers originate mainly from laundry washing while films and fragments originate from surface runoff that conveys road dust into sewer networks 14 23 26 hence our categorization accurately represented common sources and transport mechanisms of mps in urban settings for categorization of mps based on size we used four size ranges as 50 μm 50 330 μm 330 1000 μm and 1 5 mm however for succinct presantation we combined and presented our results in two size categories as small mps 1 mm and large ones 1 5 mm to achieve reliability in our analyses we verified that total mp counts in each sample corresponded well with the sum of individual mps in each shape or size category this quantitative balance approach ensured accuracy and consistency of our measurements throughout the study accordingly we report the number of mps per liter of wastewater or simply as mp concentrations which are the arithmetic averages of mp concentrations in the wastewater samples analyzed in this work 2 4 2 chemical identification by ft ir infrared ir spectroscopy is an analytical technique that is used commonly for identification of polymers and organic compounds 52 54 in this technique ir light beam hits a polymer so that chemical bonds stretch contract and bend and as a result the light reflects back at slightly lower intensity than its original one due to loss of intensity evanescent wave at sample s surface a photodetector such as mercury cadmidium telluride mct captures the portion of light that passes through the sample and converts the light intensity into electrical signal likewise a detector collects and converts the reflection called attenuated total reflection atr into electrical signal then a specific software performs fourier transformation calculation on the signals to present a spectrum as absorbance versus wavenumber of ir light collectively this technique is known as micro attenuated total reflectance fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy microatr ft irs we used a microatr ft ir spectroscope bruker lumos germany that was equipped with a microscope and cooled with liquid nitrogen to identify polymer types of mps in the samples the wavelength of ir ranged from 600 to 4000 cm 1 with 4 cm 1 spectral resolution in atr mode with accumulation of 64 scans we assessed each sample at 5 to 6 randomly selected and distinct areas and identified each polymer type by comparing its spectrum with polymer spectrums that are stored at bruker lumos plastic and polymer spectrum library as provided by the manufacturer we obtained a correlation factor between the spectrum of each polymer versus those provided by the library and we reported polymer names based on the best matching spectrums to prevent potential contamination of samples and instruments we kept each sample ft irs and the microscope under suitable covers except for when we carried out the analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp removal with respect to total mp concentrations operational features such as hrt and flow conditions e g turbulence levels of each unit affect mp removal rates of relevant unit operations in this case the aerated grit chambers operated with a hrt of 4 minutes and rigorous mixing while settling tanks operated with a hrt of 6 8 hours and low turbulence to assess potential role of hrt and flow conditions the results in fig 2 a compare total mp concentrations between the plant s influent the aerated grit chambers effluent and the effluent of the settling tanks for instance fig 2a shows that the influent total mp concentration of 30 7 mp l decreases to 21 7 mp l at the aerated grit chambers effluent and indicates a removal efficacy of around 30 for the flotation process in contrast settling units reduced total mp concentration from 21 7 mp l to 6 3 mp l at a removal efficacy of around 71 fig 2a the observed rates underline that settling tanks outperform flotation units in mp removal due to long hrts and steady flow conditions concomitantly mp characteristics such as shape size and material density affect their vertical movement in a fluid and their removal rates by relevant operations hence we examined mp shapes sizes and polymer types to understand their influence on mp removal rates by each method as presented in the following parts 3 2 mp removal with respect to major shapes shape of a mp affects its settling behavior such as a spherical mp may settle rapidly 53 thus we identified relative abundance of each mp shape at each sampling location and then we assessed mp removal rates with respect to mp shapes for relative abundance our results in fig 2 b c d illustrate that the influent concentrations of fibers films and fragments in units of mp l are 13 14 2 and 3 7 respectively which means that fibers and films are the predominant shapes while fragments constitute a small portion of the incoming mps the standard deviations for the reported concentrations of films and fibers were relatively high because their concentrations were elevated in winter due to frequent washing of garments while their concentrations were relatively low in summer months these variations resulted in standard deviations ranging from 30 to 50 for the reported influent concentrations of fibers and films for removal rates table 2 presents the observed removal rates for each mp shape by each removal method the removal rates are estimated based on mp concentrations presented in fig 2 as an example case fig 2d shows that fragment concentrations are 3 7 3 5 and 0 4 m p l at the influent at the aerated grit chambers effluent and at the effluent of settling tanks respectively these values indicate that flotation was unable to remove fragments while sedimentation was highly effective in capturing fragments with a removal rate of 89 the chief reason for this trend is that characteristics of fragments such as shape and density collectively favor their removal by sedimentation in particular fragments have irregular 3d structures while their densities usually are greater than that of wastewater 1 04 g cm3 to settle in support of this observation past studies assessed settling velocities of mp shapes such as fragments spheres and cylinders and fibers with densities e g 1 1 g cm3 higher than that of wastewater 55 57 the studies confirmed that settling velocities of fragments were the highest among typical mp shapes fragments fibers and films 55 57 the removal rates of fibers and films 2nd column of table 2 indicate that flotation units capture fibers and films at comparable rates of around 40 presumably because these particles behave similarly in flotation units so that their removal rates are comparable the removal rate of 5 for fragments by flotation supports that most fragments tend to settle instead of floating for comparison the removal rates for each mp shape by sedimentation appear as 89 for fragments 80 for films 52 for fibers 3rd column of table 2 this means that settling captures films and fragments at rates that are significantly higher than that of fibers the most likely reason for this outcome is that films and fragments are heavier than fibers and thereby they settle relatively rapidly 3 3 mp removal with respect to size ranges a particle s size is equally important as its shape for its removal by the unit operations 55 57 thus we further assessed our results by dividing mps in each shape group into two size ranges as large sizes 1 5 mm and small ones 1 mm by doing so we quantified relative abundance and removal rates of mps in each shape and size category for instance fig 3 a shows that the influent concentration of small fibers 1 mm i e 10 4 mp l is the highest among the influent concentrations of all shapes and sizes likewise the influent concentration of small fibers is four times the concentration i e 2 6 mp l of large fibers 1 5 mm meaning that small fibers are the predominant mp types in the incoming wastewater for comparison fig 3b depicts that the influent concentration of large films 8 4 mp l is slightly higher than that of small films 5 7 mp l while fig 3c shows that almost all fragments are in the small size category 1 mm collectively these results reveal that the incoming mps are composed of mainly small size fibers relatively equal amounts of small and large size films and a low amount of small fragments based on this segmentation we quantified removal rates for each shape and size group as summarized in table 3 the results in table 3 2nd column show that flotation withdraws small fibers and small films at comparable rates of around 40 because these tiny 1 mm particles behave similarly in the aerated grit chambers however mp removal rates by flotation increase along with mp sizes such as 46 for large fibers and 59 for large films a plausible reason for this trend is that large films 1 5 mm have relatively low mass and wide surface areas that favor their flotation hence their removal rate of 59 is the highest rate among all mp categories removed by flotation table 3 in contrast sedimentation removes most mp types effectively as depicted by mp removal rates of 91 for fragments 76 80 for films and 63 for fibers 3rd column of table 3 which follows the order of their volumes and masses as fragments films fibers we note that the removal rate of 14 for large fibers 2nd row of table 3 by sedimentation is unrepresentative due to their low incoming concentrations i e 1 4 mp l at the inlet of settling tanks hence we excluded this value from our analysis of the observed removal rates to confirm accumulation of mps in settling tanks we quantified mps in sludge samples that we obtained from settling units for instance total mp concentrations ranged from 570 to 1110 mp l sludge while concentrations of individual shapes ranged in units of mp l sludge as 350 760 fibers 60 230 films and 50 160 fragments the total mp concentrations i e 570 1110 mp l were about 20 to 37 times their concentration of 30 mp l at the plant s influent fig 2a such findings corroborate that most mps settle and accumulate in the sedimentation units 3 4 polymer types of mps polymer characteristics such as density are among the factors that affect mp removal by treatment operations 57 for instance low density polymers float in water while high density polymers settle rapidly hence we identified specific polymer types versus the sum of their occurences at each sampling point as presented in table 4 the number of occurrences in table 4 represent detection of each polymer in samples that were collected monthly for six months e g polypropylene pp was detected total of 13 times in the influent wastewater samples over six months accordingly the results in table 4 highlight that the most common polymer types in the influent were polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polyamide pa with total number of occurrences as 13 29 and 23 times respectively these polymers have numerous commercial varieties that serve as source materials to manufacture consumer goods such as textile products and packaging materials which then release mps as fibers and films into sewer systems due to laundry washing and surface runoff as a result pp pe and pa polymers are encountered frequently in municipal wastewater samples 18 23 24 27 for comparison modified polymers such as regenerated cellulose and natural fibers such as cotton appeared at considerable numbers e g 8 times while other plastic polymers such as polyester were detected infrequently to analyze the results in table 4 we note that mps interactions with other wastewater constituents will play a role in their removal by a specific unit for instance adsorption of fat and grease onto mp particles will influence density of the mixture in a way to favor their withdrawal by flotation likewise microorganisms can attach on mp surfaces and form biofilms that enhance removal of certain mps e g low density mps by sedimentation these interactions modify density of the mixture mps other solids or compounds to support their removal by flotation or by sedimentation concurrently microorganisms settle gradually as they form flocs that entrap mps and settle together 32 49 58 in this context we use polymer density as the basic factor to interpret the results in table 4 for instance densities of pp polymers range as 0 84 0 9 g cm3 and support their withdrawal by flotation the results in table 4 1st row show that pp types occurred 13 times at the influent 4 times at the effluent of flotation units and 4 times at the effluent of settling tanks these numbers suggest that flotation removed the bulk of pp type mps while sedimentation failed to remove pps presumably due to their buoyant nature as the second example densities of pe polymers 2nd row of table 4 are around 0 9 0 98 g cm3 and close to that of wastewater 1 04 g cm3 which means that pe polymers will mix well and move along with wastewater through the units hence the two operations i e floating versus gravity settling can capture pe polymers but neither one can be the primary removal mechanism for such mps accordingly the results table 4 demonstrate that pe polymers were detected 29 15 and 4 times along the sampling locations these values confirm that the two processes capture pe polymers at appreciable and comparable degrees however neither process seems to be the principal removal method for polymers such as pe as the third example densities of pa polymers 3rd row of table 4 range as 1 05 1 14 g cm3 and favor their removal by sedimentation the results show that pa polymers were detected 23 times at the influent 24 times at the chamber s effluent and 9 times at the effluent of settling tanks this means that sedimentation reduced pa polymers from 24 to 9 times and confirmed the expectation that high density polymers such as pa will be removed by settling 3 5 implications for wwtps the preliminary primary treatment operations of the wwtp included bar screens and aearated grit chambers the screens did not capture mps due to their small size 5 mm and thereby agcs were the only the preliminary primary unit operation that captured mps at this plant agcs operated with short hrts rigorous mixing and coarse air bubbles e g diameter of 1 cm thus agcs achieved relatively low rates of mp removal at this facility for improvement small size bubbles are preferable as they provide large contact area for particle attachment and its flotation 59 in this regard alternative flotation methods that deliver bubbles with diameters of around 2 mm e g fine bubble aeration or those that deliver bubbles with sizes ranging from 10 to 100 μm dissolved air flotation daf 59 achieve relatively high mp removal rates 36 40 44 hence a reduction in bubble sizes of flotation units will improve mp removal efficiencies of such units concomitantly past studies and our findings suggest that sedimentation should be the primary focus of efforts that aim to enhance mp removal rates by wwtps 55 58 in this direction primary settling units must be installed at wwtps that lack such units for those plants with primary settling tanks mp removal efficacy can be increased by cost effective options such as installation of inclined plates or tube settlers into existing tanks as well as addition of coagulants into wastewater for efficient sedimentation of mps past studies examined and discussed applicability of these suggestions for various scenarios and we refer our readers to those studies for comprehensive assessment of such applications 60 64 in this context future studies may investigate settling behavior of mps e g fibers in particular in inclined and or tube settlers likewise future studies may look into coagulation and flocculation of mps by common agents such as fecl3 or polyelectrolytes such investigations must utilize findings of relevant past studies for further advancement 60 62 64 4 conclusions this study explored how mp characteristics including shape size and density influence their removal by flotation and by sedimentation units mps that are characterized by low material density 1 g cm3 relatively large size 1 5 mm and flat shapes e g films are ideal candidates for removal by flotation conversely mps with high material density 1 1 g cm3 and relatively large structures e g fragments will be removed rapidly by sedimentation other mps that are characterized by small sizes 1 mm and with material densities near that of water 1 g cm3 will move along with wastewater and will be removed by each relevant process at comparable and appreciable degrees however neither flotation nor settling can be defined as the primary removal mechanism of such particles mp removal efficiency of a treatment unit relies on its design and operational features such as hrt of wastewater in that unit this study shows that sedimentation outperforms flotation in mp removal because sedimentation units operate at low turbulence and long hrt as opposed to turbulent mixing and short hrt of flotation units this finding underlines that sedimentation units should be the primary area of focus to improve mp removal by wwtps in this direction installation of gravity based settling units such as grit chambers and primary settling tanks into wwtps in case they are absent is an option that concerns significant capital investment and operational cost cost effective options include installation of inclined plate or tube settlers into existing settling tanks as well as addition of suitable coagulants into wastewater on its way to sedimentation units comprehensive evaluation of each suggestion is essential to develop optimal and site specific solutions to

13827,this study investigates microplastic mp removal by flotation and by settling units of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp that consisted of coarse screens fine screens aerated grit chambers agcs and the conventional activated sludge cas system agcs operate with rigorous mixing and short hydraulic residence times hrt that cause agcs to remove mps moderately while settling tanks operate with long hrts and steady flow conditions that favor sedimentation of mps mp characteristics such as flat shape e g films large size 1 5 mm and low density support mp removal by flotation while mps with large 3d structures 1 5 mm and high material density settle quickly as the highest rates of mp removal by relevant units agcs removed 59 of influent concentration of large size films 1 5 mm while settling tanks removed around 90 of the influent concentration of fragments the observed mp removal rates by the wwtp followed the order of fragments films fibers as 90 85 70 respectively for improvement of mp removal by wwtps addition of gravity based settling units installation of inclined plate and or tube settlers into existing settling tanks and use of coagulants in settling process are among the feasible options keywords wastewater microplastics removal flotation settling 1 introduction microplastics mps are tiny plastic particles that are smaller than 5 mm in size and that are persistent and ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments 1 5 because various organisms such as invertabrates and fish can ingest mps and incur problems such as chocking laceration and poisoning fate of mps in natural ecosystems has become a critical research field 6 8 accordingly scientific studies about sources occurences characteristics interactions transport and adverse effects of mps in natural environments are substantial 9 18 collectively the studies highlight critical challenges in mp research as to improve mp definition and to harmonize mp quantification methods 1 9 16 for instance current mp definition based on size 5 mm needs to be improved to consider mp s physical state e g solid gel solubility polymer type size e g nano micro shape and structure e g spheres fibers color and source 1 likewise analytical methods for sampling extraction quantification e g microscopic boundries and identification of polymer types must be harmonized for effective coordination and comparison of scientific findings in this area 9 16 at present mps are grouped as primary and secondary types based on their sources 14 29 primary mps include those such as pellets and microbeads that are fabricated for direct use in consumer products such as glitters in makeup and craft materials and microbeads in facial and body cleansers 16 22 secondary mps include a wide range of particles such as fibers that are released by laundry washing fragments that break away from tires bitumen and road marking paints and tiny pieces that disintegrate from macroplastics e g plastic bags as result of physical e g solar radiation wind and water waves chemical e g acidic conditions and microbiological erosion 23 30 in urban settings all mp types usually end up in sewer networks due to domestic discharges e g laundry washing rain runoff and street washing 14 16 sewer systems convey mps to municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps that consist of several treatment stages including preliminary primary secondary and tertiary treatment operations 31 32 among them preliminary steps include units such as screens to remove large debris e g wipes cotton tips cigarette buds and gravity based grit chambers to capture gravel and sand 31 primary stage includes sedimentation tanks and or flotation units that remove grease and colloidal particles such as clay 31 32 secondary treatment refers to conversion of dissolved organic matter e g fatty acids into carbon dioxide and water via microbiological processes such as conventional activated sludge cas system biofilm reactors and anaerobic digestors that convert organic substances to methane 31 33 typically a conventional wwtp includes the three stages above that achieve the required level of treatment so that the effluent is permissible by governmental agencies for discharge into a receiving body e g river lake ocean in certain cases such as when the receiving body is a sensitive ecosystem or when water must be recovered for reuse e g irrigation the effluent is further treated via tertiary operations such as media filters e g sand filters and disinfection units that remove residues as phosphorous and microorganisms e g viruses bacteria hence tertiary stage includes advanced treatment operations to produce high quality water 31 32 because wwtps serve as key barriers to control mp emissions into natural environment numerous research groups has focused on individual treatment stages to improve their performance 28 34 51 in general wwtps capture mps depending on the extent of their treatment operations 34 40 particularly the plants with tertiary stage consistently remove 95 of incoming mps while conventional wwtps capture mps at rates ranging from 64 4 to 99 9 14 36 39 44 a reason for this variability is that comparable treatment operations perform in a wide range 36 38 45 as an example michielssen et al 36 studied mp removal by two independent plants that employed screens and gravity based grit chambers as their preliminary treatment stages although the operations were very similar the reported mp removal efficacies were 35 and 59 for the comparable stages of those two independent plants 36 as a point of reference table s1 of the supplementary materials sm summarizes key features of representative studies that assessed mp removal by municipal wwtps likewise table s2 of sm summarizes methodological differences among the representative investigations in table s1 collectively the studies noted critical causes of the variability among mp removal efficacies by conventional wwtps as follows i mp load and mp characteristics e g size and density of incoming wastewater at each wwtp ii exact configuration of treatment operations and iii the differences in mp quantification procedures such as low end of mp sizing e g 10 μm vs 500 μm mps 5 mm set by each investigation 1 11 14 16 37 43 45 49 to improve mp removal past studies proposed to investigate primary removal mechanisms with respect to mp characteristics such as shape and density findings of such studies will allow for operation of individual units in a way to enhance overall performance of conventional wwtps in this context this study analyzes mp removal by a conventional wwtp that consists of coarse screens fine screens aerated grit chambers and the cas system the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the role of flotation i e aerated grit chambers and sedimentation units of the cas system in removing mps with respect to mp sizes shapes and polymer types we hypothesize that mp removal by a unit operation relies on its operational features such as hydraulic residence time hrt of wastewater in that unit as well as mp characteristics such as shape size and density for example flotation units typically operate with short hrts and turbulent mixing of wastewater due to air bubbling hence flotation units may remove mps moderately likewise mps that are captured by flotation units may have common characteristics such as small size e g 1 mm and low material density e g 0 9 g cm3 in contrast settling tanks operate with long hrts and low turbulence levels that are suitable to capture most mps by sedimentation however mp characteristics such as shape and material density affect settling behavior of mps and their removal rates by sedimentation to analyze these assertions we quantified and characterized mps at critical locations along the plant including the influent the aerated grit chambers effluent and the effluent of sedimentation tanks of the cas system we identified mps based on their shapes i e fibers films and fragment size ranges 1 mm vs 1 5 mm and polymer types e g polyethylene our results reveal how mp characteristics influence their removal rates by flotation and sedimentation processes as well as by the overall treatment operation we discuss our findings in light of past studies to formulate strategies to enhance mp removal by relevant units and by conventional wwtps and we suggest several new areas of research for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the wwtp the municipal wwtp is the karaman wastewater treatment plant that is located in northwestern region of turkey and serves to the city of sakarya with a population of 1 626 000 people as well as to regional industrial facilities fig 1 shows principle treatment units of the plant that include coarse screens fine screens aerated grit chambers and the cas system as the secondary treatment stage table 1 presents basic characteristics of the wastewater before and after its treatment by this facility the average wastewater flow rate is 81900 m3 day for dry weather summer and 85100 m3 day for wet weather winter conditions the plant had mechanisms to bypass excess stormwater flow that it received during heavy rain events hence the flow rate is relatively stable throughout a year for treatment fig 1 wastewater proceeds through coarse screens and fine screens for removal of debris such as wipes and cigarette butts coarse screens are typical bar screens with 20 mm openings between the bars while fine screens are static wedge wire plates with 6 mm spacing between its wires next wastewater moves into the aerated grit chambers that deliver coarse air bubbles ca 1 cm in diameter via perforated pipes located at its bottom air bubbles coalesce with low density substances such as fat oil and grease and lift them to the chambers surface where an automated scraper removes the skim for disposal via solid waste route the chamber operates with a hrt of around 4 minutes and rigorous mixing due to air bubbling then wastewater moves into the secondary treatment stage that is the cas system composed of aeration units and settling tanks in aeration units compressed air is pumped through air diffusers located at the bottom of aeration basin to transfer of oxygen from air into wastewater microorganisms use dissolved oxygen and oxidize dissolved organic substances into carbondioxide and water by doing so microorganisms gain energy for cell maintenance and growth then wastewater containing microorganisms biosolids and inert solids such as mps move and settle in sedimentation tanks in which treated water overflows for discharge into a nearby cark stream while settled solids sludge move to sludge processing facilities for dewatering some portion of sludge is recycled back to aeration tanks to maintain a steady concentration of microorganisms in those units with respect to mp removal bar screens have large spaces between their bars e g 20 mm and 6 mm through which mps 5 mm pass and avoid withdrawal the aerated grit chambers operate with short hrt and turbulent mixing and thereby they ought to capture mps moderately the aeration tanks of cas system house microorganisms to remove dissolved organics from wastewater and generate new microorganisms as biosolids hence aeration tanks are not expected to remove mps subsequently wastewater with all solids including mps move from aeration tanks into settling tanks of the cas system for sedimentation these tanks provide suitable conditions such as low turbulence and long hrts i e 6 8 hours that favor sedimentation of most solids hence settling tanks of the cas system are the principal units that ought to capture mps at this plant 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 grab and composite sampling we collected grab and composite liquid samples at the plant s inlet before coarse screens at the aerated grit chambers outlet and at the effluent of settling tanks we took grab samples once in a month over a year between september 2016 and october 2017 while we took composite samples monthly over 6 months from may 2017 to october 2017 we used a bucket like container and collected 10 l of wastewater as a grab sample for composite samples we used a peristaltic pump to transfer 12 l of wastewater at a rate of 100 ml min for 2 hours during pumping wastewater passed through a filtration unit that sieved solids including mps the filtration unit was composed of three steel pipes that were 75 mm in diameter and 30 cm in length each pipe had a steel sieve at its lower end with pore sizes as 1000 μm top sieve 500 μm middle sieve and 50 μm the three pipes were fitted together to form a single unit upon filtration of each sample we removed the sieves carefully and placed each one in a glass petri dish that we capped with a glass cover taped and labeled with sampling details such as location and date then we transferred the samples to our laboratory for mp analysis for sludge samples we removed 100 ml of sludge from sludge outlet of the settling tanks and analyzed the sample for mps as outlined in the next section 2 3 mp isolation from collected matrices to isolate mps we backwashed each sieve with approximately 200 ml of deionized water to transfer solids into a beaker to eliminate organic solids we treated the sample with fenton s reagent that was 10 ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with 10 ml 0 05 m iron ii as the catalyst feso4 7h2o 50 52 upon removal of organic matter we added 10 ml of zinc chloride zncl2 solution density of 1 6 g cm3 into the sample to increase density of the liquid phase then we centrifuged the liquid sample at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes and filtered the supernatant through filter papers with pore sizes of 12 25 μm whatman co grade 589 1 black ribbon part no 10300010 we repeated this step several times to transfer all inert solids from liquid phase to filter papers to extract mps from sludge samples we used 100 ml sludge sample and added 900 ml of deionized water to obtain a dilute slurry of 1 l then we extracted mps by following the procedure that we employed for wastewater samples as noted above 2 4 quantification and characterization of mps 2 4 1 microscopic analyses we used a light microscope olympus bx51 t olympus corp tokyo japan at 100x magnification to identify basic morphology and size ranges of mps the microscope was equipped with a digital camera olympus dp20 to capture microscopic images of mps to be systematic we categorized mps into three major shapes as fibers e g filaments and threads films e g flat shaped mps and fragments irregularly shaped 3d mps which agrees with mp classifications of past studies that investigated mp removal by wwtps 14 16 45 48 50 specifically the studies noted that fibers originate mainly from laundry washing while films and fragments originate from surface runoff that conveys road dust into sewer networks 14 23 26 hence our categorization accurately represented common sources and transport mechanisms of mps in urban settings for categorization of mps based on size we used four size ranges as 50 μm 50 330 μm 330 1000 μm and 1 5 mm however for succinct presantation we combined and presented our results in two size categories as small mps 1 mm and large ones 1 5 mm to achieve reliability in our analyses we verified that total mp counts in each sample corresponded well with the sum of individual mps in each shape or size category this quantitative balance approach ensured accuracy and consistency of our measurements throughout the study accordingly we report the number of mps per liter of wastewater or simply as mp concentrations which are the arithmetic averages of mp concentrations in the wastewater samples analyzed in this work 2 4 2 chemical identification by ft ir infrared ir spectroscopy is an analytical technique that is used commonly for identification of polymers and organic compounds 52 54 in this technique ir light beam hits a polymer so that chemical bonds stretch contract and bend and as a result the light reflects back at slightly lower intensity than its original one due to loss of intensity evanescent wave at sample s surface a photodetector such as mercury cadmidium telluride mct captures the portion of light that passes through the sample and converts the light intensity into electrical signal likewise a detector collects and converts the reflection called attenuated total reflection atr into electrical signal then a specific software performs fourier transformation calculation on the signals to present a spectrum as absorbance versus wavenumber of ir light collectively this technique is known as micro attenuated total reflectance fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy microatr ft irs we used a microatr ft ir spectroscope bruker lumos germany that was equipped with a microscope and cooled with liquid nitrogen to identify polymer types of mps in the samples the wavelength of ir ranged from 600 to 4000 cm 1 with 4 cm 1 spectral resolution in atr mode with accumulation of 64 scans we assessed each sample at 5 to 6 randomly selected and distinct areas and identified each polymer type by comparing its spectrum with polymer spectrums that are stored at bruker lumos plastic and polymer spectrum library as provided by the manufacturer we obtained a correlation factor between the spectrum of each polymer versus those provided by the library and we reported polymer names based on the best matching spectrums to prevent potential contamination of samples and instruments we kept each sample ft irs and the microscope under suitable covers except for when we carried out the analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp removal with respect to total mp concentrations operational features such as hrt and flow conditions e g turbulence levels of each unit affect mp removal rates of relevant unit operations in this case the aerated grit chambers operated with a hrt of 4 minutes and rigorous mixing while settling tanks operated with a hrt of 6 8 hours and low turbulence to assess potential role of hrt and flow conditions the results in fig 2 a compare total mp concentrations between the plant s influent the aerated grit chambers effluent and the effluent of the settling tanks for instance fig 2a shows that the influent total mp concentration of 30 7 mp l decreases to 21 7 mp l at the aerated grit chambers effluent and indicates a removal efficacy of around 30 for the flotation process in contrast settling units reduced total mp concentration from 21 7 mp l to 6 3 mp l at a removal efficacy of around 71 fig 2a the observed rates underline that settling tanks outperform flotation units in mp removal due to long hrts and steady flow conditions concomitantly mp characteristics such as shape size and material density affect their vertical movement in a fluid and their removal rates by relevant operations hence we examined mp shapes sizes and polymer types to understand their influence on mp removal rates by each method as presented in the following parts 3 2 mp removal with respect to major shapes shape of a mp affects its settling behavior such as a spherical mp may settle rapidly 53 thus we identified relative abundance of each mp shape at each sampling location and then we assessed mp removal rates with respect to mp shapes for relative abundance our results in fig 2 b c d illustrate that the influent concentrations of fibers films and fragments in units of mp l are 13 14 2 and 3 7 respectively which means that fibers and films are the predominant shapes while fragments constitute a small portion of the incoming mps the standard deviations for the reported concentrations of films and fibers were relatively high because their concentrations were elevated in winter due to frequent washing of garments while their concentrations were relatively low in summer months these variations resulted in standard deviations ranging from 30 to 50 for the reported influent concentrations of fibers and films for removal rates table 2 presents the observed removal rates for each mp shape by each removal method the removal rates are estimated based on mp concentrations presented in fig 2 as an example case fig 2d shows that fragment concentrations are 3 7 3 5 and 0 4 m p l at the influent at the aerated grit chambers effluent and at the effluent of settling tanks respectively these values indicate that flotation was unable to remove fragments while sedimentation was highly effective in capturing fragments with a removal rate of 89 the chief reason for this trend is that characteristics of fragments such as shape and density collectively favor their removal by sedimentation in particular fragments have irregular 3d structures while their densities usually are greater than that of wastewater 1 04 g cm3 to settle in support of this observation past studies assessed settling velocities of mp shapes such as fragments spheres and cylinders and fibers with densities e g 1 1 g cm3 higher than that of wastewater 55 57 the studies confirmed that settling velocities of fragments were the highest among typical mp shapes fragments fibers and films 55 57 the removal rates of fibers and films 2nd column of table 2 indicate that flotation units capture fibers and films at comparable rates of around 40 presumably because these particles behave similarly in flotation units so that their removal rates are comparable the removal rate of 5 for fragments by flotation supports that most fragments tend to settle instead of floating for comparison the removal rates for each mp shape by sedimentation appear as 89 for fragments 80 for films 52 for fibers 3rd column of table 2 this means that settling captures films and fragments at rates that are significantly higher than that of fibers the most likely reason for this outcome is that films and fragments are heavier than fibers and thereby they settle relatively rapidly 3 3 mp removal with respect to size ranges a particle s size is equally important as its shape for its removal by the unit operations 55 57 thus we further assessed our results by dividing mps in each shape group into two size ranges as large sizes 1 5 mm and small ones 1 mm by doing so we quantified relative abundance and removal rates of mps in each shape and size category for instance fig 3 a shows that the influent concentration of small fibers 1 mm i e 10 4 mp l is the highest among the influent concentrations of all shapes and sizes likewise the influent concentration of small fibers is four times the concentration i e 2 6 mp l of large fibers 1 5 mm meaning that small fibers are the predominant mp types in the incoming wastewater for comparison fig 3b depicts that the influent concentration of large films 8 4 mp l is slightly higher than that of small films 5 7 mp l while fig 3c shows that almost all fragments are in the small size category 1 mm collectively these results reveal that the incoming mps are composed of mainly small size fibers relatively equal amounts of small and large size films and a low amount of small fragments based on this segmentation we quantified removal rates for each shape and size group as summarized in table 3 the results in table 3 2nd column show that flotation withdraws small fibers and small films at comparable rates of around 40 because these tiny 1 mm particles behave similarly in the aerated grit chambers however mp removal rates by flotation increase along with mp sizes such as 46 for large fibers and 59 for large films a plausible reason for this trend is that large films 1 5 mm have relatively low mass and wide surface areas that favor their flotation hence their removal rate of 59 is the highest rate among all mp categories removed by flotation table 3 in contrast sedimentation removes most mp types effectively as depicted by mp removal rates of 91 for fragments 76 80 for films and 63 for fibers 3rd column of table 3 which follows the order of their volumes and masses as fragments films fibers we note that the removal rate of 14 for large fibers 2nd row of table 3 by sedimentation is unrepresentative due to their low incoming concentrations i e 1 4 mp l at the inlet of settling tanks hence we excluded this value from our analysis of the observed removal rates to confirm accumulation of mps in settling tanks we quantified mps in sludge samples that we obtained from settling units for instance total mp concentrations ranged from 570 to 1110 mp l sludge while concentrations of individual shapes ranged in units of mp l sludge as 350 760 fibers 60 230 films and 50 160 fragments the total mp concentrations i e 570 1110 mp l were about 20 to 37 times their concentration of 30 mp l at the plant s influent fig 2a such findings corroborate that most mps settle and accumulate in the sedimentation units 3 4 polymer types of mps polymer characteristics such as density are among the factors that affect mp removal by treatment operations 57 for instance low density polymers float in water while high density polymers settle rapidly hence we identified specific polymer types versus the sum of their occurences at each sampling point as presented in table 4 the number of occurrences in table 4 represent detection of each polymer in samples that were collected monthly for six months e g polypropylene pp was detected total of 13 times in the influent wastewater samples over six months accordingly the results in table 4 highlight that the most common polymer types in the influent were polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polyamide pa with total number of occurrences as 13 29 and 23 times respectively these polymers have numerous commercial varieties that serve as source materials to manufacture consumer goods such as textile products and packaging materials which then release mps as fibers and films into sewer systems due to laundry washing and surface runoff as a result pp pe and pa polymers are encountered frequently in municipal wastewater samples 18 23 24 27 for comparison modified polymers such as regenerated cellulose and natural fibers such as cotton appeared at considerable numbers e g 8 times while other plastic polymers such as polyester were detected infrequently to analyze the results in table 4 we note that mps interactions with other wastewater constituents will play a role in their removal by a specific unit for instance adsorption of fat and grease onto mp particles will influence density of the mixture in a way to favor their withdrawal by flotation likewise microorganisms can attach on mp surfaces and form biofilms that enhance removal of certain mps e g low density mps by sedimentation these interactions modify density of the mixture mps other solids or compounds to support their removal by flotation or by sedimentation concurrently microorganisms settle gradually as they form flocs that entrap mps and settle together 32 49 58 in this context we use polymer density as the basic factor to interpret the results in table 4 for instance densities of pp polymers range as 0 84 0 9 g cm3 and support their withdrawal by flotation the results in table 4 1st row show that pp types occurred 13 times at the influent 4 times at the effluent of flotation units and 4 times at the effluent of settling tanks these numbers suggest that flotation removed the bulk of pp type mps while sedimentation failed to remove pps presumably due to their buoyant nature as the second example densities of pe polymers 2nd row of table 4 are around 0 9 0 98 g cm3 and close to that of wastewater 1 04 g cm3 which means that pe polymers will mix well and move along with wastewater through the units hence the two operations i e floating versus gravity settling can capture pe polymers but neither one can be the primary removal mechanism for such mps accordingly the results table 4 demonstrate that pe polymers were detected 29 15 and 4 times along the sampling locations these values confirm that the two processes capture pe polymers at appreciable and comparable degrees however neither process seems to be the principal removal method for polymers such as pe as the third example densities of pa polymers 3rd row of table 4 range as 1 05 1 14 g cm3 and favor their removal by sedimentation the results show that pa polymers were detected 23 times at the influent 24 times at the chamber s effluent and 9 times at the effluent of settling tanks this means that sedimentation reduced pa polymers from 24 to 9 times and confirmed the expectation that high density polymers such as pa will be removed by settling 3 5 implications for wwtps the preliminary primary treatment operations of the wwtp included bar screens and aearated grit chambers the screens did not capture mps due to their small size 5 mm and thereby agcs were the only the preliminary primary unit operation that captured mps at this plant agcs operated with short hrts rigorous mixing and coarse air bubbles e g diameter of 1 cm thus agcs achieved relatively low rates of mp removal at this facility for improvement small size bubbles are preferable as they provide large contact area for particle attachment and its flotation 59 in this regard alternative flotation methods that deliver bubbles with diameters of around 2 mm e g fine bubble aeration or those that deliver bubbles with sizes ranging from 10 to 100 μm dissolved air flotation daf 59 achieve relatively high mp removal rates 36 40 44 hence a reduction in bubble sizes of flotation units will improve mp removal efficiencies of such units concomitantly past studies and our findings suggest that sedimentation should be the primary focus of efforts that aim to enhance mp removal rates by wwtps 55 58 in this direction primary settling units must be installed at wwtps that lack such units for those plants with primary settling tanks mp removal efficacy can be increased by cost effective options such as installation of inclined plates or tube settlers into existing tanks as well as addition of coagulants into wastewater for efficient sedimentation of mps past studies examined and discussed applicability of these suggestions for various scenarios and we refer our readers to those studies for comprehensive assessment of such applications 60 64 in this context future studies may investigate settling behavior of mps e g fibers in particular in inclined and or tube settlers likewise future studies may look into coagulation and flocculation of mps by common agents such as fecl3 or polyelectrolytes such investigations must utilize findings of relevant past studies for further advancement 60 62 64 4 conclusions this study explored how mp characteristics including shape size and density influence their removal by flotation and by sedimentation units mps that are characterized by low material density 1 g cm3 relatively large size 1 5 mm and flat shapes e g films are ideal candidates for removal by flotation conversely mps with high material density 1 1 g cm3 and relatively large structures e g fragments will be removed rapidly by sedimentation other mps that are characterized by small sizes 1 mm and with material densities near that of water 1 g cm3 will move along with wastewater and will be removed by each relevant process at comparable and appreciable degrees however neither flotation nor settling can be defined as the primary removal mechanism of such particles mp removal efficiency of a treatment unit relies on its design and operational features such as hrt of wastewater in that unit this study shows that sedimentation outperforms flotation in mp removal because sedimentation units operate at low turbulence and long hrt as opposed to turbulent mixing and short hrt of flotation units this finding underlines that sedimentation units should be the primary area of focus to improve mp removal by wwtps in this direction installation of gravity based settling units such as grit chambers and primary settling tanks into wwtps in case they are absent is an option that concerns significant capital investment and operational cost cost effective options include installation of inclined plate or tube settlers into existing settling tanks as well as addition of suitable coagulants into wastewater on its way to sedimentation units comprehensive evaluation of each suggestion is essential to develop optimal and site specific solutions to

13828,hydrochars from lignocellulose biomass have received an upsurge of interest in different fields especially in the area of adsorption hydrothermally produced hydrochars are effective adsorbents for removing different pollutants and they serve as a cheap and sustainable raw material for subsequent activation to achieve porous activated carbons acs with large surface areas in this review recent studies on preparation and characteristics of adsorbents in terms of hydrochars from lignocellulose biomass and their derived acs are presented and discussed the application of these adsorbents for the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals and other emerging pollutants is included the sources and classification adsorption isotherm kinetics and mechanism of these pollutants and the capability of regenerating and reusing cheap and efficient adsorbents such as hydrochar and acs are also discussed this review identifies knowledge gaps and proposes insights into new directions for

chemicals kinetics isotherm hydrothermal carbonization activated carbon emerging contaminants 1 introduction emerging contaminants ecs are recently discovered compounds and other materials that have long been existed in the environment but whose existence and influence are only now being identified ecs include a wide group of contaminates such as drugs and personal care products ppcps herbicides veterinary products e g hormones food additives industrial compounds e g metabolites and degradation products and engineered nanomaterials studies have revealed that these ecs are frequently and abundantly found in wastewaters and surface water 1 another class of pollutants is referred to as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs which are known to affect the endocrine system including the growth and reproduction of humans and animals such compounds are widely used in industrial applications cosmetics and pharmaceuticals these compounds may include some phenolic compounds polyaromatic hydrocarbons dioxins natural steroidal estrogens synthetic estrogens and industrial chemicals 2 their concentrations in water bodies are high and thus cause many health threatening problems therefore the presence of such toxic pollutants requires the immediate development of effective treatment strategies to achieve a safe and green aqueous environment the control of environmental pollutants namely ecs and edcs from aqueous systems through the adsorption technique has received growing interest because it is simple and offers a wide variety of cheap and efficient adsorbent materials like hydrochars and their derived activated carbons acs hydrochar is a solid residue containing reduced hydrogen and oxygen contents from the hydrothermal carbonization htc of biomaterials particularly lignocellulose in the presence of subcritical liquid water 3 unlike those from other biomass utilization techniques such as pyrolysis biological conversion and densification to solid fuel hydrothermal treatment based hydrochar materials have drawn significant research interest due to their numerous advantages such as low processing temperatures 180 c 250 c low ash contents direct applicability to wet feedstock high product yield 30 wt 60 wt and zero generation of hazardous chemical waste 4 other properties such as porosity and variety of aliphatic and aromatic functional groups place these materials at the forefront of certain applications such as mitigating atmospheric co2 producing biofuel by curtailing the dependency on fossil fuels energy storage environmental pollution control and soil amelioration 5 8 owing to the versatile properties of hydrochars and their economic viability they have gained increasing importance and have replaced ac based applications such as capacitors 9 energy storage 10 soil amelioration and adsorbents for water purification 11 acs are generally prepared by physical and chemical activation processes both processes require pyrolysis and additional activation steps by gases or chemical agents that result in energy and economic compromise being a cheap and efficient alternative hydrochars particularly their application to pollutant removal have been the center of many scientific research interests however studies performed with acs have shown that carbon adsorbents with a lower content of oxygen functional groups would present a higher sorption capacity for removal of organics when compared with carbon adsorbents with high contents of oxygen functional groups due to low ash contents hydrochars serve the best precursors in preparation of ac hydrochars based activated carbons from orange peels have been tested for the treatment of certain emerging pharmaceutical pollutants activation process surface texture and ph reportedly exert a significant influence on adsorption features 5 some anionic dyes have also been investigated in terms of the removal efficiency of food waste based hydrochars with an advanced approach in which an artificial neural network design is developed for an automated wastewater treatment plant 12 surface modified hydrochars have also been investigated for metal removal 4 meanwhile hydrochars outperform acs in certain applications but no review article has focused on the applications of lignocellulose based hydrochars and activated carbons derived from them to the adsorption of ecs and edcs dai et al 13 14 reviewed the application of agriculture wastes and biochars to the removal of different contaminants and organic contaminants respectively bhatnagar and anastopoulus 15 summarized the different types of adsorbents for bisphenol a removal and kim et al 16 reviewed the use of graphene based adsorbents for various organic and inorganic contaminants therefore the present review focuses on and discusses the recent advances in hydrochar and activated carbon formation their applications in removing ecs and edcs and the gaps associated with the adsorption performance of hydrochars and activated carbons derived from them recommendations for the future improvement of these materials are also detailed from economic and applied industrial perspectives 2 classification and sources of ecs ecs are new and known toxic pollutants that belong to different classes such as pharmaceuticals containing nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics and antifungal antimicrobial agents fragrances pesticides food additives artificial sweeteners lipid regulators hormones uv filters flame retardants and other industrial products 17 18 despite these classifications confusion remains in categorizing different pollutants for example some plasticizers that are considered endocrine disrupting compounds are also called ecs this ambiguity indicates that ecs are a broad spectrum of pollutants that pose hazardous impacts on humans and aquatic organisms in all aspects 17 fig 1 shows the classification of ecs which are chiefly found in many commercial and household products according to the literature 19 the common sources and pathways of ecs that lead to contamination in the environment include wastewaters from local wastewater treatment units 20 hospitals 21 livestock activities 22 food processing plants agriculture waste subsurface storage of industrial and household wastes and indirect means of ground water surface water exchange 23 generally ecs can be introduced to environment from two main sources namely point and diffuse sources first sources are identified or specific sites of pollutants and the input can be identified in a spatially separated way examples of such sources include different industrial effluents cosmetics hospitals sewage treatment plants mining activities buried septic tanks and waste lagoons the discharge of contaminants from these sources is usually concentrated meanwhile diffuse sources refer to unidentified or indistinct sources examples include run offs from biosolids or manure and floods in industrial or urban regions the discharge from these sources is often low and cannot be controlled fig 2 schematically explains the different sources from which ecs are discharged and enter the surface and ground waters surface water is more frequently loaded with ecs than groundwater is 24 the animal domestic hospital and industrial wastes along with landfill represent the major source relative to a minor aerial source of ecs in surface and ground waters moreover among these sources both landfill and aerial are the minor ecs pathways the disposal from the households are considered important point sources as most of the unused or expired drugs are disposed through household solid waste or flushed down in the toilet artificial recharge infiltration with treated waste water from industrial and domestic or urban and stormwater runoff may become important basis of re introducing these contaminants that might be still present in these waters animal feeding operations also present a major source of ecs as the significant portion of given antibiotics pesticides or hormones passes through the livestock and is excreted and stored in waste lagoons 3 classification and sources of edcs edcs are exogenous agents that alter the natural functions of the hormones in our body that are responsible for homeostasis development and reproduction 25 according to the review by tijani et al 26 nearly 38 000 different chemicals and elements have been identified as edcs these are classified to synthetic and natural hormones such as estrone 17 β estradiol e2 estriol testosterone dihydrotestosterone 27 ethynylestradiol and phytoestrogens 28 industrial compounds such as bisphenol a phthalates parabens nonylphenol and perfluorooctanesulfonate 29 30 dioxins flame retardants including polybrominated diphenyl ethers various medicines such as diethylstilbestrol pesticides such as endosulfan and organophosphorus pesticides and synthetic birth control pills 28 edcs are also considered ecs due to their uncertain prolonged health impacts the sources of edcs are widespread and diverse in nature similar to ecs edcs are commonly found in low concentrations ng μg l level in sewage wastewater treatment plants surface water ground water hospital wastewater soil sediments air and even drinking water 31 35 mostly industrial effluents after being treated are directly introduced to the ground water where traces of edcs still remain and thereby enter to the aqueous environment some pesticides in agriculture applications directly absorb into soil and may leach to the ground water and then make their way to the food chain by building up in fish animals and humans according to the recent research of saeed et al 36 significant concentrations of phthalates alkyl phenols and estrogens have been detected in coastal areas receiving sewage discharge different alarming concentrations of phthalates have also been found in the sediments of the northern part of the arabian gulf and they may have entered via industrial and agricultural activities 37 this finding suggests that edcs prevail heavily in water and airborne dust particles therefore strict guidelines and protocols must be implemented to restrain the discharge of these toxic and hazardous pollutants from their sources 4 lignocellulosic biomass in terms of renewability recyclability and sustainability biomass based resources are a main concern from the economic and energy perspectives lignocellulosic biomass is a non edible and renewable resource in different industrial applications such as production of biofuels i e bioethanol biobutanol and biomethanol value added chemicals and new polymers 38 40 lignocellulose biomass forms a significant fraction of forestry and agricultural crop wastes decreasing sources of fossils increasing economic demands and environmental pollution from greenhouse gases have urged today s scientific community to utilize lignocellulose biomass as an alternate renewable source in the context of agricultural and environmental restraints biomass resources are expected to supply power of 130 270 ej year in 2050 this value can satisfy 15 25 of the future total energy requirement 41 lignocellulose biomass mainly consists of three main structural components namely hemicellulose 20 40 cellulose 40 60 and lignin 10 25 42 depending on a wide variety of sources these materials may be processed to achieve different industrially important chemicals and biofuels for internal combustion engines given the recalcitrance of the lignocellulose network these materials undergo different modes of pretreatment such as hydrothermal methods including steam and co2 explosions hot water treatment chemical methods involving acid and base treatments organosolv methods using organic solvents ammonia recycle percolation ammonia fiber explosion and ozonolysis 40 to destroy their structures and achieve different fermentable sugars for obtaining alcohols and other value added products 38 43 the adsorption performance of lignocellulose biomass may be improved via substantial treatments such as chemical physical physico chemical and thermochemical treatments these treatments may introduce novel functionalities that are compatible with target pollutants among the numerous treatment protocols htc is considered as an eco friendly and cost effective technique and is further discussed in the next section 5 hydrothermal carbonization hydrothermal carbonization or wet torrefaction is a thermochemical method of converting biomass of low heating value and large moisture content into carbonaceous solid residues with chemical characteristics identical to those of lignite coal surrounding liquids e g furfurals and small organic acids including acetic lactic and levulinic acids and gaseous by products 44 45 the aqueous suspension of biomass is treated at the subcritical temperature of approximately 180 c 250 c in a closed reactor under autogenous pressure the solid residue from the hydrothermal treatment is called hydrochar by the european biomass industry association 46 htc is considered a simple and easily scalable technology that is suitable for any organic raw biomass in addition to its valorization htc is made advantageous by its use of water as a reaction medium and catalyst that is nontoxic cheap and ecofriendly under a subcritical temperature the characteristic features of water dramatically change the hydrogen bonds weaken the dielectric constants decrease and the ionization of water begins as the number of hydronium ions h3o increase to facilitate the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages in the hemicelluloses in biomass into hexoses and pentoses for subsequent transformation into value added chemicals 47 moreover this technique is applicable to biomasses with high moisture contents 60 humidity and is different from pyrolysis which is unsuitable for biomasses with high moisture contents and those that require sufficient pre drying before being properly utilized such treatment may enhance the consumption of energy moreover toxic heavy metals are concentrated in chars after pyrolysis due to their thermal stability by contrast in htc treatment these heavy metal contents are sufficiently removed from hydrochars through transformation into the liquid phase which leaves stable carbonized fractions 48 49 5 1 hydrothermal carbonization of lignocellulosic biomass to hydrochar the hydrothermal carbonization process is generally affected by operation temperature and residence time the properties of resulting hydrochars depend not only on these factors but also on the nature and composition of feedstock table 1 summarizes the yields and characteristics of hydrochars and their lignocellulose feedstocks 50 55 the degree of carbonization is determined by h c and o c ratios decreasing ratios of these elements suggest increased carbonization values whereas o c values suggest the presence of oxygenated functional groups ofgs 56 during htc the hemicellulose part of the lignocellulose biomass is prone to degradation due to the low activation energy and is converted to volatile products 54 however cellulose and lignin are resistant to degradation below 220 c the thermal stability of these species follows the order lignin cellulose hemicellulose 57 the htc of lignocellulose biomass involves different steps of reactions that occur simultaneously such as hydrolysis dehydration decarboxylation aromatization condensation and polymerization 58 with an increase in temperature the ionic product of water is believed to increase making water a weak acid base catalyst consequently a hydrolysis reaction commences with the breakage of the ether bonds in hemicellulose and cellulose in this case lignin is mostly unaffected the resulting monomers and oligomers then move toward the aqueous phase and are further degraded into various small chemicals fig 3 this process leaves small pores on the solid residue hydrochar properties are also greatly influenced by feed water ph hydrochars were produced from wheat straw by changing the acidic and basic ph of feed water hydrochars with great pore properties were derived using the acidic ph of feed water furthermore the production of sugars furfurals and organic acids under basic ph was found to be low 59 the metal retention in the form of ash is also a crucial factor that is the ash contents in hydrochars mostly decrease relative to their raw materials the ash contents further decrease with reaction severity high ash contents in hydrochars may impair the application of the latter as solid fuel and may cause slagging and fouling during combustion the presence of inorganic species such as na k ca mg p and n greatly affects the formation features of hydrochars 53 however a knowledge gap exists with regard to the role of these elements in the hydrochar formation mechanism and their effects on the composition production and characteristics of hydrochars lignocellulose biomass as feedstock has many benefits such as abundance and low cost when mixed with other non lignocellulose biomasses this raw feedstock can be applied as high quality solid fuel 60 and as an excellent material for soil amelioration 61 and it can reduce heavy metal content relative to individual feedstocks 62 microwave integrated htc is currently considered appealing as it accelerates hydrochar formation but this technique is underutilized due to its lower yields in comparison with those of conventional thermal methods the difficulty in processing tons of biomasses and its energy intensiveness 58 63 microwave produced hydrochars have been reported to serve as an alternative to raw coal that could reduce the cost to half when used as an energy source 64 the pore properties and yield of hydrochars significantly depend on the composition of lignocellulose feedstocks in terms of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin moreover htc temperature and acidic ph of feed water play a role in enhancement of pore properties of hydrochars from table 1 the high carbon and oxygen contents along with the low ash content of lignocellulose feedstocks result in the formation of hydrochars with large yield 40 79 and favorable heating value 17 16 32 1 mj kg and carbon content 42 65 72 2 in addition the low nitrogen and sulfur contents of these feedstocks produce hydrochars with less nitrogen 0 06 3 6 and sulfur 0 1 0 46 elements thus lignocellulose feedstocks derived hydrochar can be efficient and eco friendly precursor for acs with low emission of noxious gases during activation 5 2 preparation of acs from lignocellulosic biomass by conjunction htc and subsequent activation generally the ac requirement increases annually by approximately 8 1 and may reach up to 2 1 million metric tons in the coming years this change may further increase the ac cost 65 therefore many researchers are now switching to cheap and renewable lignocellulose biomasses as carbon sources acs are normally prepared by the carbonization of precursors at the temperature range of 600 c 700 c dry method for a certain time in the traditional process which is still used today the smoke from the process is freely emitted to the atmosphere thus contributing to environmental pollution and most of the ash is deposited on the resulting carbon these results call for an energy efficient separation process for obtaining pure ac as part of the effort to save energy and cut down the cost of ac production htc wet process is used to produce hydrochars before their activation to ac normally htc is conducted at 180 c 250 c which is much lower than that in the carbonization process moreover htc does not emit smoke to the atmosphere and produces minimal ash in the resulting hydrochars moreover the use of water in htc could produce hydrochars with many new functional groups oh cooh cho on the surface that can enhance adsorption capacity using htc based hydrochars as a carbon source could offer many benefits i provide an economic ecofriendly and sustainable way of reutilizing waste biomass ii yield a purified carbon source with abundant ofgs that facilitate activation to generate acs with a large surface area and iii create efficient and cheap adsorbent or catalyst support raw materials that could efficiently replace commercially available acs table 2 shows the textural properties of some acs produced through the activation of hydrothermally treated lignocellulose biomasses 66 75 generally the formation of acs with superior porosities and surface areas is promoted by the use of suitable activation agents at optimum proportion and suitable operation temperatures at a certain time activation agents such as koh naoh zncl2 and h3po4 have been widely studied to produce porous acs acid activators are preferred to alkali metal hydroxides as they remove inorganic impurities and can be easily recovered from the process 76 in addition acid treatment can introduce abundant oxygen containing functional groups to the resulting hydrochar 77 rice husk based hydrochars were chemically treated with h3po4 and ac with a bet surface area of 2700 m2 g was obtained at 500 c for capacitor application 68 activation with h3po4 is considered to occur under mild conditions the case is different for acs obtained by alkali activation in this context both rattan stalks and coconut shell derived hydrochars were chemically activated with naoh at 600 c to produce acs with bet surface areas of 1135 and 876 14 m2 g respectively 70 71 naoh activation resulted in a mesoporous structure and uniform surface fig 4 the development of acs porosity is attributed to activator s dehydration effect which breaks the coc and cc bonds of hydrochar naoh is reduced to metallic sodium na hydrogen gas and sodium carbonate na2co3 furthermore na2co3 is degraded into na and co as follows 78 1 6 naoh 2 c 2 na 3 h2 2 na2co3 2 na2co3 2c 2na 3co thus both the alkaline and carbonate metals are intercalated into the hydrochar structure and played a role in generation and enlargement of pores few studies have reported the use of k2co3 as an activator because it is known to be non deleterious unlike koh magnetic acs have been prepared from salix psammophila and rice straw hydrochars using k2co3 as the activator with a 2 1 impregnation ratio the resulting product performs well in the adsorption application due to its excellent surface area with microporous and mesoporous structures respectively 69 73 hydrochars may serve as ideal precursors for preparing acs for multiple applications because they evidently reduce energy consumption and environmental concerns according to table 2 hydrochars derived acs exhibit high surface areas within the range of 876 to 2960 m2 g different basic acidic and metallic salt activators are applied for the production of acs with well developed pores and microporous or mesoporous structures depending on the type of activator and activation conditions despite increasing research work gaps remain in current technology and some of them are mentioned here suitable activating agents should not only be cost effective but also environmentally benign and easily recoverable no work has explored the use of value added acids like lactic acids levulinic acid and acetic acid produced from the htl of biomass for the activation of resulting hydrochars using such biomass derived activating agents may exert some profound effects on ac production yield and textural properties and may reduce the cost of the method new strategies should be developed to overcome high temperature requirements and low ac yields in this regard few catalysts may be developed or equipment design should be engineered few new applications of hydrochar based carbons such as fuel cells membrane materials for ecs and edc removal from wastewater treatment plants should also be explored to offer sufficient removal below permissible limits large scale production cost estimation and the stability of hydrochars should be considered from an industrial point of view 6 mechanism of adsorption of ecs and edcs on hydrochar and acs the mechanism of adsorption involves a combination of a multitude of interactions i e hydrogen bonding pore filling hydrophobic interactions and π π interactions this combination depends on different factors such as surface chemistry surface area pore size surface charge zeta potential ph and the chemical structure of target compounds all these interactions occur either simultaneously or by changing the experimental parameters especially ph surface texture and functional groups greatly affect the adsorption mechanism although suggesting the exact mechanism taking place is difficult many researchers favor fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as a useful tool to investigate the interactions between solutes and adsorbents relying on ftir and surface charge results may arbitrarily predict the mechanism however we feel that the assistance of further advanced surface techniques is crucial in investigating the exact mechanism because mechanisms are essentially complex and require careful investigation table 3 shows different predominant adsorption mechanisms that are responsible for the effective removal of ecs and edcs by hydrochars or the acs derived from them 79 92 solution ph has a pivotal role in tuning the surface charges and active functional groups of target analytes it can alter the adsorption mechanism from being hydrophobic to being electrostatic a change in ph induces positive negative charges on hydrochars ac and the molecular state of solute and thereby affects electrostatic interactions the structure of hydrochars involves a hydrophilic shell which results from abundant ofgs and a hydrophobic core which results from fixed carbon and aromatization 79 kyzas and deliyanni 88 suggested that acs from potato peel hydrochars when subjected to hno3 oxidation produce an enhanced number of ofgs for the adsorption of pramipexole dihydrochloride and dorzolamide ftir spectrum results confirmed the presence of oh group of the phenol at 3400 cm 1 and cc group of the aromatic ring at 1615 cm 1 after the adsorption the disappearing of oh group and shifting of cc group was observed which indicated the role of these groups in adsorption process thus the mechanism is mainly π π electron coupling and lewis acid base reactions between amino groups in drugs and o in ac furthermore ph exerts a strong influence on uptake behavior because acidic ph 2 provides the highest removal efficiency that declines with a further rise in ph due to electrostatic repulsions a highly basic ph is unfavorable for most pollutants such as e2 that is removed by fe mn binary oxide functionalized hydrochar pzc 5 as e2 remains in neutral state at ph 10 ftir spectrum showed the peaks at 3415 cm 1 and 1508 cm 1 which attributed to the oh and aromatic cc stretching bonds respectively owing to the aromatic structure and presence of oh groups the principal adsorption mechanism was proposed to be π π interactions and hydrogen bonding 80 a similar observation was also found by li et al 87 who tested the adsorption of amoxicillin onto ac from previously modified hydrochars from corn stalks the presence of amoxicillin in different chemical forms at different ph levels and zeta potentials of the adsorbent affected the adsorption mechanism the removal of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen on ac from orange peel hydrochar was also found to be ph dependent with the acidic ph being the most suitable for maximum removal here dispersion was the main interaction proposed along with a slight electrostatic interaction between positively charged adsorbents and π electron of drug molecules ftir results only displayed a single peak at 1612 cm 1 that accounted for the complete disappearance of carboxylic groups and the presence of aromatic cc group indicating that only hard carbon components remained 5 in some cases changes in ph do not affect adsorption behavior for example chen et al 86 observed that changes in ph had no effect on the adsorption of tetracycline using magnetic ac derived from fir saw dust hydrochar in another study the removal of e2 and 17α ethynylestradiol by montmorillonite hydrochar composites was relatively the same within wide ph ranges due to stable hydrogen bonds π π interactions and intercalation 81 suo et al 92 also found no significant effect of ph on organophosphorus pesticides removed by ac from corn straw cellulose and graphene composites because the main mechanism was preferentially π π interactions in a raman study the degree of graphitization id ig was expected to play a vital role that is increasing activation temperatures lead to burn out that causes extensive dislocations and defects which in turn improve the surface area and adsorption properties of the resulting carbon 86 92 zhu et al 93 also observed that magnetic ac from sawdust hydrochars with great id ig possessed great porosities and great adsorption capability toward roxarsone 4 hydroxy 3 nitrophenylarsonic acid the predominant adsorption mechanism was found to be pore filling in addition to the mild surface complexation of as and fe on the surface of the magnetic ac 93 94 the same observation was found by suo et al 92 as discussed above in another study by zhu et al 73 magnetic ac from salix psammophila hydrochars was obtained at different temperatures the sample was obtained at the lowest activation temperature and fixed hydrochar the activator ratio had a great id ig ratio and the highest adsorption capacity toward triclosan pore filling may be a dominant mechanism depending on the dimensions of the adsorbate fernandez et al 5 found that the adsorption of salicylic acid is due to porosity development and that the molecular size of salicylic acid is smaller 0 6 nm than the size of the pores on the ac from orange peel hydrochars zhu et al 95 prepared magnetic ac from hydrochar at different temperatures for the removal of triclosan and obtained a linear increase in q e values as functions of the surface area and pore and micropore volumes that led to the pore filling being the suitable mechanism the removal of diuron and bisphenol a in addition to hydrogen and π π bonding was explained by the presence of micropores 79 the adsorption capacity of triclosan on ac from rice straw hydrochars was found to be several times greater than that of its magnetic derivative due to pore blockage by magnetic particles 69 this result also suggested that the adsorption of triclosan was mainly based upon pore diffusion ftir spectrum displayed wide bands at 3400 and 1080 cm 1 which attributed to oh and co groups being abundant in ofgs hydrogen bonding interactions play a major role in adsorption with ac from rice straw hydrochars sun et al 96 compared the adsorption mechanisms of three edcs namely bisphenol a 17 ethynyl estradiol and phenanthrene on biochars and hydrochars in addition to pore filling being the common mechanism the adsorption of bisphenol a and 17 ethynyl estradiol was mainly due to hydrogen bonding whereas phenanthrene was unable to facilitate hydrogen bonding due to the absence of oh groups but was able promote π h bond and π π interactions in the study the biochar showed mainly π π interactions due to the existence of aromatic co cc and ch groups at 1700 1600 and 885 752 cm 1 respectively in a special case caffeine adsorption on ac derived from pistachio nut shell hydrochar was studied experimentally and by molecular modeling the results based upon these two methods suggested that adsorption was mainly due to the microporous character of acs prior to adsorption caffeine formed aggregates that were disintegrated by surface oh groups on the adsorbent surface with further disintegration these molecules penetrated inside the pores and bound with the oh groups on the inner walls of the pores to make a monolayer attachment 83 fig 5 illustrates adsorption mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of different edcs and ecs by hydrochars and acs derived from them 79 88 89 overall many interaction mechanisms such as electrostatic hydrogen bonding pore filing π π interactions and hydrophobic are proposed for edcs and ecs adsorption on hydrochars and their derived acs table 3 solution ph chemical structure of ecs or edcs and surface texture functional groups and surface charge of hydrochar or its derived ac greatly affect the adsorption mechanism the mechanisms of adsorption of edcs and ecs pollutants are mostly the same relative to other carbon based materials obtained without hydrothermal treatment 97 99 but compared with hydrochars ac derived from them offer enhanced adsorption capacities due to wider pore volumes and enhanced specific surface area 5 69 85 owing to the limited work on hydrochars or acs derived from them for a limited number of ecs and edcs we need to employ new surface techniques to explore further the mechanisms of their adsorption and thereby understand the behavior of these pollutants correlation models should be developed to predict the influential interactions predominantly involved in the adsorption process weidemann et al 82 developed a correlation between the log kow values of fluconazole ciprofloxacin paracetamol sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim ochthilinone diphenhydramine bisphenol a diclofenac and triclosan and those of rice husk hydrochars horse manure hydrochars olive hydrochars and tomato hydrochars among the hydrochars those of rice husk had a positive correlation with the contaminants thereby confirming hydrophobic interaction as the fundamental mechanism the adsorption of additional edcs and ecs such as parabens phthalates and other industrial products should be studied to widen the scope of lignocellulose based hydrochars or acs obtained by their post treatment further work on real sample applications and their reusability is required 7 modeling of adsorption of ecs and edcs on hydrochar and ac 7 1 adsorption kinetic modeling both adsorption kinetics and equilibrium are baselines in designing and scaling up of adsorption systems kinetic studies involve modeling of experimental kinetic data collected by measuring the adsorbed amount against time pseudo first and pseudo second order are the most generally applied empirical equations in liquid phase adsorption systems lagergren first proposed a pseudo first order equation with the following expression form 100 3 q t q e q e e k 1 t linearizing the above equation gives the following 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q e and q t represent the adsorption capacities mg g at equilibrium and time t min and k 1 is the rate parameter 1 min an adsorption system is likely to follow this model under initial time intervals or prolonged intervals when the adsorption process is near equilibrium 101 103 the pseudo second order equation suggests that the adsorption rate is second order function of available active sites and is used for large time intervals 104 whereas the pseudo first order equation is applied to describe adsorption at small time intervals mathematically this model can be represented as 5 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t linearizing the above equation gives the following form 104 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t denote the equilibrium adsorption capacities mg g and adsorption capacities at a given time t min and k 2 is the rate parameter g mg min the adsorption kinetics of different pollutants frequently follow this model on the basis of high regression and low error analysis values and thereby signify this model s prominence the fitted rate constants k1 and k 2 are most probably lumped parameters that join reaction and diffusion influences under particular experimental variables the determination of primary adsorption phenomena is scarcely discussed after model fitting 105 another model that predicts chemisorption is the elovich equation 106 which is written as 7 q t 1 β ln α β t linearizing the above equation gives the following equation 8 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t the plot between q t and ln t should produce a straight line with 1 β slope and ln α β β intercept α mg g min represents the rate constant and β represents the extent of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorption another commonly applied model is the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model provided in the following equation 107 9 q t k i d t x where k id mg g min0 5 is the rate parameter and x is the initial adsorption mg g for kinetics controlled solely by this model a plot between q t and t should be straight line passing through the origin i e x 0 most research findings demonstrate multilinear curves within a studied time duration and these curves are indicative of multiple mechanisms occurring simultaneously with controlling mechanisms such as the transfer of solute to the external adsorbent surface intraparticle diffusion and the equilibrium stage in which the solute adheres to the walls of the pores these models are the most commonly studied and used to calculate rates and predict general adsorption mechanisms the suitability of each model relies on the characteristics of the adsorbents adsorbates and experimental conditions liu et al 69 studied the removal of triclosan using ac and magnetic ac from rice straw derived hydrochar the experimental data were applied to validate different kinetic equations like the pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and elovich equations in linear mode the results suggested the following order of best fittings pseudo second order equation pseudo first order equation elovich equation according to the highest r 2 magnitudes and the small deviation between the experimental q e and theoretical q e values the adsorption equilibrium was not immediately reached when high concentrations of triclosan were used the rate k 2 of ac decreased from 6 6 10 3 to 4 10 4 g mg min with a rise in initial triclosan concentration whereas the rate for the magnetic ac increased at high concentrations the adsorption capacities of ac were higher 175 588 mg g than those of its magnetic derivatives 161 286 mg g due to the highly porous network the application of the intraparticle diffusion model indicated a multilinear curve that produced a nonzero intercept which reflected the rapid diffusion of triclosan on the external surfaces of the ac and magnetic ac followed by diffusion inside the porous body kyzas and deliyanni 88 developed oxidized ac from potato peel hydrochars and pyrolyzed potato peels for the removal of dorzolamide and pramipexole drugs linear plots of pseudo second and pseudo first order models revealed that the former can effectively explain adsorption kinetics according to the closeness of the experimental q e values to the calculated q e values pp hyd ox prami q e cal 31 3 mg g and q e exp 31 1 mg g pp hyd ox dorzo q e cal 30 5 mg g and q e exp 30 4 mg g were greater than those of the ac obtained from pyrolyzed potato peels the rate of adsorption using ac from pyrolyzed potato peels was greater than that using a hydrochar precursor this result implied faster adsorption in the former than in the latter given that the pseudo second order equation is preferentially more valid than other kinetic models are most research groups only applied this model to determine the rates and adsorption capacities of adsorbents plazinski et al 108 showed that the preferential fitting of the pseudo second order equation over the pseudo first order equation can stem from a theoretical basis rather than a physical one the random errors in the calculated q e values did not vary to a great extent during the linearization of the pseudo second order equation as in the case of the pseudo first order equation an additional benefit of using the pseudo second order equation is that equilibrium q e is not required for data fitting zhu et al 93 prepared hydrochars using different temperature ranges i e 160 c 300 c for the hydrothermal treatment of sawdust from a furniture factory the resultant samples were simultaneously activated and magnetized to obtain magnetic acs the samples were studied for the removal of roxarsone the magnetic ac obtained from the hydrochars at 160 c exhibited high pore properties applying the linear form of the pseudo second order equation showed that the adsorption rate was high which suggested the excellent adsorption of roxarsone on the as prepared samples the adsorption capacities q e 515 mg g and rates of adsorption 13 2 10 4 g mg min increased in the following order mc 160 mc 200 mc 240 mc 270 mc 300 this order was mainly due to the favorable pore filling on the magnetic ac obtained from the hydrochars at low temperatures similarly chen et al 86 applied the pseudo second order equation to the experimental data of tetracycline adsorption on ac and magnetic ac from saw dust hydrochars the maximum adsorption capacities achieved were 250 mg g using acs and magnetic acs but the former achieved equilibrium earlier 10 min than the latter did 30 min on the basis of this model the authors assumed the rate limiting step to be chemisorption in nature an increase in initial solute concentration tends to increase equilibrium time fernandez et al 5 prepared ac from orange peel hydrochars using air co2 and phosphoric acid as activating agents for the removal of diclofenac salicylic acid and flurbiprofen respectively the kinetic data were as correlated to only the pseudo second order equation in nonlinear mode fig 6 the adsorbed amount of diclofenac was high on acid ac whereas those of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen were high on air ac the rates of adsorption of diclofenac and flurbiprofen were high on h3po4 treated ac from acid treated hydrochar whereas those of salicylic acid were high on air ac the data on the adsorption of triclosan on γ fe2o3 ac prepared from salix psammophila hydrochars revealed a preference for the pseudo second order equation in that study the effects of activation conditions influenced the q e values 170 9 787 4 mg g and such an increase was correlated with different textural characteristics like bet surface area volume and size of pores 95 mesopore size and large micropore volume are responsible for great diffusion and fast rates of adsorption as reported by mestre et al 109 who showed three types of ac namely ac prepared from sucrose hydrochars using koh and k2co3 as activating agents and commercial ac for the removal of paracetamol and iopamidol this model was again preferentially fitted when zhu et al 110 studied the adsorption of tetracycline on magnetic porous carbon obtained from salix psammophila hydrochars the order of fitting was as follows pseudo second order equation pseudo first order equation elovich equation in another study the adsorption of bisphenol a and diuron on argan nut shell hydrochars represented by the pseudo second order equation with excellent determination coefficients better than it did the pseudo first order equation the increase in temperature reduced the q e values 1094 664 mg g for bisphenol a and 773 557 mg g for diuron and the rate constant values dramatically increased with a rise in temperature 0 002 0 025 g mg min for bisphenol a and 0 013 0 208 g mg min for diuron this detailed analysis suggested that temperature can only accelerate the adsorption system in some cases and that it may not necessarily increase adsorption capacities furthermore the intraparticle diffusion model suggested two phase reactions namely macropore diffusion and mesopore diffusion 79 by contrast ahsan et al 99 suggested the first linear stage to be mesopore and macropore diffusion and the second stage linear curve to be micropore diffusion in their study of the adsorption of bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline on sulfuric acid treated sawdust the preferential fitting of the pseudo second order equation on every adsorption case reveals that the mechanism of adsorption depends on the presence of sufficient sites on adsorbents regardless of the type preparation method or aqueous environment used shi et al 97 achieved a preferential fitting of the pseudo second order equation in their study of the adsorption kinetics of ciprofloxacin on fe3o4 c from sucrose by htc the controlling mechanism was chemisorption in nature with a maximum q e of 38 6 mg g and rate of 19 9 g mg h li et al 87 fitted nonlinear kinetic equations namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich equations to the adsorption data of amoxicillin on ac from previously modified corn stalk hydrochar among these three models the elovich equation was found to have the best fit moreover chemical adsorption fast adsorption and slow desorption were suggested to be the most suitable rate controlling mechanisms ning et al 80 applied the nonlinear pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich equations to study the adsorption of e2 on fe mn binary oxide loaded hydrochars as anticipated kinetics preferentially followed the pseudo second order equation q e 47 43 mg g and k 2 4 79 g mg min with the following order pseudo second order model elovich equation pseudo first order model error analysis results including the root mean square errors and chi square statistics also supported the validation of the pseudo second order equation the morris weber plot was multilinear thereby implying that intraparticle diffusion was not the only governing mechanism rattanachueskul et al 89 used the nonlinear form of the pseudo second order equation to analyze the adsorption behavior of tetracycline on magnetic ac from sugar cane bagasse and obtained high rate constant values k 2 7 52 10 4 g mg min q e 28 14 mg g the authors elucidated the reason on the basis of the hierarchical structure of composites with macropores that were responsible for rapid diffusion meanwhile two phase linear curves of intraparticle diffusion indicated film and intraparticle diffusion as the rate limiting steps tetracycline adsorption with ac from hydrochars of agave americana fibers and tannin was also studied by the application of the nonlinear modes of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models 91 the pseudo second order model as usual had the best fit given its high determination coefficient r 2 values and low error values the experimental q e 51 35 mg g was close to the calculated one and the rate constant was 2 48 g mg min furthermore e2 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol followed the pseudo second order model with montmorillonite hydrochar composites activated by koh 81 the linear plots for e2 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol yielded q e 113 8 mg g and 68 8 mg g respectively the rate constants for the adsorption of e2 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol were 0 0083 and 2 21 g mg h respectively the mechanism was mainly proposed to be chemical in nature with the involvement of physical interactions the above discussion clearly reveals that the pseudo second order equation is the most frequently fitted model studied and that intraparticle diffusion is not the predominant rate control step in all studies all the above kinetic models were studied with different edcs ecs using hydrochars and their derived acs and are summarized in table 4 7 2 adsorption isotherm modeling generally an adsorption isotherm is a curve that expresses the phenomenon that governs the retention of liquid gas adsorbates on solid phase adsorbents by varying initial concentrations at particular temperature and ph 111 its physical parameters and underlying thermodynamic assumptions provide insights into the adsorption mechanism surface properties and degree of affinity of adsorbents two widely used empirical models namely the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were adopted in different studies to determine the mechanism of adsorption and the maximum adsorption capacities the langmuir equation is given as 112 9 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where q e mg g is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium q m mg g is the highest adsorbed amount and kl l mg is the langmuir parameter the linearization of the above equation yields the following form 10 c e q e 1 b q m c e q m a dimensionless constant also identified as the separation factor rl suggested by webber and chakkravorti 113 can be expressed as 11 r l 1 1 k l c o where kl corresponds to the langmuir parameter and c 0 mg l belongs to the initial adsorbate amount the magnitude of this factor explains the nature of adsorption as unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the freundlich equation is expressed by the following 114 12 q e k f c e 1 n the linearization of the above equation gives the following form 13 log q e log k f 1 n log c e here kf mg g l mg 1 n is the freundlich parameter that represents adsorbed amount and n is a parameter that indicates adsorption strength the magnitude of 1 n between 0 and 1 is an index of adsorption strength or surface heterogeneity as this value approaches 0 heterogeneity rises values below 1 imply chemisorption and values above 1 indicate cooperative adsorption the q m values from the langmuir isotherm are important in the selection of a suitable adsorbent and the design of an appropriate adsorption system the langmuir isotherm is a preliminary and simple model that retains unique importance with almost every study determining adsorption capacity from this isotherm regardless of best fit because the value of q m corresponds to the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity that other isotherm equations do not consider table 5 shows two commonly applied empirical isotherm models and their parameters obtained from the adsorption data of different edcs ecs on different hydrochars or acs derived from them these isotherms greatly depend upon the nature of the adsorbent with different functional groups adsorbates and experimental conditions roman et al 83 demonstrated that the adsorption of caffeine on pistachio nut shell hydrochar when processed with acidic water during hydrothermal carbonization and that of the same sample after pyrolysis followed a langmuir isotherm with preferably high adsorption capacities 12 95 22 6 mg g however the pyrolysis of base processed hydrochars followed the freundlich isotherm with poor adsorption capacity this work explored new insights such as the excellent adsorption capacity of acid processed hydrochars despite their lower bet surface area in comparison with base processed hydrochars and different isotherm slopes with acid processed hydrochars and the same sample after pyrolysis the reason for the former finding was attributed to the development of steric hindrance repulsive interactions and strong resistance of base generated functional groups the reason behind the latter finding was the removal of ofgs on thermal treatment that was unfavorable for adsorption when high initial concentrations were used the result suggested that despite the large pores on pyrolyzed acid processed hydrochars unpyrolyzed hydrochars were more promising further insights were also obtained by simulation studies liu et al 69 applied these two models to probe the interactions between tetracycline on ac and magnetic ac from rice straw hydrochars in comparison with the freundlich isotherm the langmuir isotherm in linear form was a better fitting model resulting in q m 714 mg g for ac and 303 mg g for magnetic ac r l value was within 0 02 0 04 which indicated a favorable adsorption zhu et al 93 fitted a linear langmuir isotherm in their study of the adsorption of roxorsone on magnetic ac from sawdust hydrochars obtained at different temperatures the maximum adsorption capacity of q m 588 mg g was obtained using magnetic ac derived from hydrochar obtained at 160 c a linear correlation between bet surface area volumes of micropore and total pores and the maximum adsorption capacities from the langmuir isotherm provided the main clue to this exclusively large capacity chen et al 86 prepared magnetic ac from sawdust hydrochar for tetracycline adsorption linear plots of the freundlich and langmuir equations favored the former isotherm on the basis of its high coefficient of determination the q m value from the langmuir equation 423 7 mg g was considered the greatest among all values for all adsorbents the magnetization barely impeded the adsorption performance of ac hydrothermally obtained hydrochars and their acs have proven to be promising adsorbents zhu et al 95 also obtained superior adsorption capacity in their triclosan adsorption study on γ fe2o3 carbon the langmuir fitted data presented a high regression coefficient that lacked information about the freundlich isotherm the correlation of the different texture characteristics of acs prepared at different temperatures with langmuir q m showed a linear response in particular micropore volume had the best correlation with q m profound research interest has long been noted in the nonlinear optimization of adsorption modeling ning et al 80 prepared fe mn binary oxide modified hydrochar from rice husk for the removal of e2 the nonlinear modes of the freundlich and langmuir equations predicted excellent fit to the isotherm data of e2 however error values were minimum with the langmuir model fig 7 the involvement of fe mn binary oxides augmented the adsorption capacity 49 7 mg g relative to the case of bare hydrochars 38 8 mg g tian et al 81 prepared rice husk hydrochar and montmorillonite composites for the removal of two edcs namely e2 and 17α ethynyl estradiol the nonlinear form of the langmuir model was the well fitted equation according to the regression coefficient values and a close agreement was found between the calculated values and the experimental q m values the adsorption capacity for e2 138 mg g was the highest followed by that for 17α ethynyl estradiol 69 mg g however the concentration range selected was small 0 2 8 mg l possibly because of the limited solubilities of both solutes that otherwise could provide a deviation from langmuir to freundlich the fabrication of these composites was claimed as an easy and cheap method with superior adsorption capacities for the two model pollutants in comparison with previously used materials fernandez et al 5 studied the adsorption of emerging pharmaceuticals diclofenac salicylic acid and flurbiprofen on acs achieved by air and phosphoric acid treatment of orange peel hydrochars an isotherm study was performed at ph 7 in the case of diclofenac and at ph 2 in the cases of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen in a nonlinear mode the freundlich equation best fitted with the adsorption data of diclofenac on air ac whereas the langmuir isotherm was the most appropriate when using phosphoric acid ac the adsorption capacities in both cases 0 164 and 0 211 mmol g were claimed to be higher than those of other biomass based acs in the case of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen the experimental data best fitted the langmuir isotherm in some cases the freundlich model was the preferable isotherm as explained by kyzas and deliyanni 88 who applied nonlinear freundlich and langmuir equations for their study of the adsorption of two pharmaceuticals namely dorzolamide and pramipexole on oxidized acs prepared via hydrothermal and pyrolysis treatments both drugs followed the freundlich model with pramipexole having higher adsorption capacity than dorzolamide did the acs prepared from hydrochars showed greater adsorption capacities than those prepared from biochars of the same precursor via pyrolysis their study showed that preparation methods greatly affect the adsorption performances of resulting acs the freundlich isotherm was again the best fitted model on the basis of the experimental data of tetracycline adsorption in magnetic ac from salix psammophila with a langmuir adsorbed amount of 25 4 mg g as a result of the many graphitic layers and porous texture the r l values within 0 011 0 16 also suggested a favorable adsorption process 110 rattanachueskul et al 89 studied the adsorption performance of magnetic ac derived from sugar cane bagasse for removing tetracycline the freundlich isotherm model was the better fitted model with a value of n 2 47 which indicated a heterogeneous adsorption that further strengthened the assumption that the resulting adsorbent possessed a large number of heterogeneous sites however relying on isotherms for the prediction of adsorption mechanisms is not the exclusive method for demonstrating solute adsorbent interactions some advanced computational modeling studies along with advanced characterization tools should be deduced to learn the effect of variables like ph molecular geometries and surface and interaction energies on the mechanisms of adsorption 83 another remarkable study is that conducted by flora et al 98 who investigated the influence of hydrochars with and without washing for removal of atrazine the calculation of the binding energies between the atrazine hydrochars showed low favorable binding energies when atrazine was parallel to the hydrochar plane the adsorptive capacities of the hydrochars obtained by acetone washing were superior to those of the hydrochars without washing this deviation in adsorption can be related to the less preferable attraction energy of atrazine for hydrochars without washing with weakly associated alkyl groups on the surface relative to hydrochars with washing according to table 5 langmuir model well represents the adsorption isotherm data of most edc ec pollutants on hydrochars and their derived acs freundlich model is also applicable in some cases from the parameters of both models the adsorption process is favorable in the literature the adsorption capacities of different hydrochars or the acs derived from them for edc ec removal were claimed to be superior to those of other reported materials 5 79 81 86 95 thereby suggesting that hydrochars may open a new horizon in carbon chemistry as their interesting surface features and low cost preparation methods supersede the features of commercially available acs the use of such material encourages further investigations into the removal of other wide varieties of pollutants the commercialization and implementation of the method in practical settings are encouraged in the current industrialization era 8 reusability of adsorbents the worth of any adsorbent material can be appraised if the material concerned is economic efficient and long lasting reusability is one of the important aspects in this technology because this property may help reduce the cost of adsorbents minimize disposal issues and prevent the laborious work needed to resynthesize fresh adsorbent materials for the consecutive adsorption system our extensive literature survey on the topic has revealed the limited number of studies on the reusability of lignocellulose based hydrochars their composites and the acs derived from them good desorption depends upon the type of interactions and solvents rattanachueskul et al 89 demonstrated that magnetic carbon from sugar cane bagasse hydrochar can be reused for tetracycline adsorption when treated with 25 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution as a normal trend the adsorption efficiency declined after every cycle from 81 84 to 57 27 thereby confirming strong interactions between tetracycline and the adsorbent in an existing study acs from potato peel hydrochars obtained after hydrothermal treatment and oxidation showed good reusable performance that is reusability of up to 20 times with desorption carried at an optimum ph level of 10 in dorzolamide and pramipexole removal 88 the work reported only an 11 decline in initial adsorption efficiency this decreasing trend was attributed to the progressive saturation of the active sites and the degradation of the materials due to the highly basic ph and blockage of active sites meanwhile fe mn binary oxide loaded rice husk based hydrochars showed good reusability of up to five times for 6 mg l e2 removal the desorption medium used was acetone water mixture in the ratio of 1 1 v v based on a high octanol water partitioning coefficient in acetone 80 tian et al 81 performed a regeneration study of montmorillonite rice husk hydrochar composites with 20 ml ethanol which were washed with water multiple times and then dried the regenerated adsorbent retained 82 and 80 2 of the initial sorption capacities for e2 and 17α ethynyl estradiol respectively excellent stability and reusability were found by zbair et al 79 using argan nut shell hydrochars for the removal of diuron and bisphenol a the desorption of the retained pollutants was conducted using ethanol the frequency of recycling up to 5 times had no significant effect on adsorption efficiency and the material could sustain its removal efficiency for bisphenol a 88 and diuron 94 as shown in fig 8 only a 5 decline was reported in the efficiency of bisphenol a removal whereas a 1 decline was reported for diuron for five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles hydrochars and their derived acs can be efficiently reutilized for several cycles after regeneration by naoh and organic agents ideally a desorbing agent should be neither too punitive nor too expensive for the regeneration of adsorbents to affect adsorbents efficiency or technology from the above discussions we observed that mostly organic solvents were used for the desorption of studied pollutants that are expensive and volatile this approach could affect process efficiency from the ecological and economic perspectives a systematic study with green solvents for the regeneration of spent adsorbents is necessary to achieve a successful adsorption of these pollutants moreover the fate of these desorbing agents remains undecided they are mostly disposed to the sink and may thus cause secondary pollution such gaps should be considered and recyclability techniques should be developed to regenerate desorbing solvents and recollect desorbed pollutants that may be removed or returned to the manufacturing industry only zbair et al 79 addressed some alternative solutions to the present dilemma that is the incineration of exhausted adsorbents and conversion of retained pollutants to less harmful byproducts however such a study requires proper waste management techniques and transport facilities that should be considered by environmental protection agencies 9 conclusions and future perspectives in this review we focused on the recent studies on the applications of lignocellulose based hydrochars and their post hydrothermally treated acs this work invokes the slogan treatment of waste by waste and may serve as a beacon in green chemistry these hydrochars can successfully replace commercially available resins and acs for the removal of ecs and edcs post treated acs from hydrochar precursors have shown promising and improved results relative to their precursors because of their large surface area and high porosity the mechanism of adsorption greatly depends upon experimental conditions and adsorption is controlled by a myriad of interactions such as electrostatic hydrophobic and π π interactions pore filling hydrogen bonding and intercalations the use of hydrochars and acs in the removal of ecs and edcs has elicited keen interest in the last few years due to the great adsorption capacities that they offer adsorption kinetics is a pseudo second order equation in all studies and intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate limiting step adsorption isotherms are frequently of langmuir type but some studies cited the freundlich isotherm as the best one efficient regeneration and reusability profiles have been exhibited for hydrochars and their derived acs some issues remain unaddressed and must be considered to broaden the scope of these new emerging materials the studies discussed in the current review were mainly based on the batch system for determining the adsorption performance of different hydrochars and their acs thus carrying out column pilot full scale and multi component adsorption studies is useful to appraise these adsorbents in real applications that involve interfering substances the adsorption behavior of other edcs and ecs such as phthalates parabens ddt herbicides and pesticides should also be investigated to apply these new materials to practical settings the proper and careful study of the exact adsorption mechanism is also required in designing a suitable adsorbent that depends on the complex structure of different ecs and edcs furthermore the magnetization of porous acs may enhance their adsorption efficiency relative to bare hydrochars the regeneration and reusability of hydrochar and ac adsorbents using nontoxic and cheap solvents should be investigated to make the process economically viable cost analysis studies and the practical implementation of these adsorbents should also be given adequate attention to strengthen their replacement with acs other gaps pointed out in the current review include the development of a systematic classification to distinguish ecs and edcs and the establishment of proper guideline values strict measures should also be taken to frame legislation on the release of these contaminants from industrial wastes an accurate precise and sensitive standard analytical method is required for the simultaneous determination of well known edcs and ecs at their trace levels proper knowledge of the mechanism of hydrochar formation from complex lignocellulose biomass is equally important the use of green activating agents for the preparation of acs should be studied owing to the frequent presence of these toxic unregulated pollutants at alarming levels wastewater treatments should be upgraded to resolve these rapid growing problems by either modifying the membrane materials with such novel and sustainable materials as their components or replacing commercially applied acs to treat recalcitrant ecs and edcs such attempts may improve water quality and substantially reduce the costs for expensive membranes hydrochars and their derived acs may leave some adverse effects therefore an evaluation of their ecotoxicity and an assessment of their environmental influences are strongly recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

13828,hydrochars from lignocellulose biomass have received an upsurge of interest in different fields especially in the area of adsorption hydrothermally produced hydrochars are effective adsorbents for removing different pollutants and they serve as a cheap and sustainable raw material for subsequent activation to achieve porous activated carbons acs with large surface areas in this review recent studies on preparation and characteristics of adsorbents in terms of hydrochars from lignocellulose biomass and their derived acs are presented and discussed the application of these adsorbents for the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals and other emerging pollutants is included the sources and classification adsorption isotherm kinetics and mechanism of these pollutants and the capability of regenerating and reusing cheap and efficient adsorbents such as hydrochar and acs are also discussed this review identifies knowledge gaps and proposes insights into new directions for

long been existed in the environment but whose existence and influence are only now being identified ecs include a wide group of contaminates such as drugs and personal care products ppcps herbicides veterinary products e g hormones food additives industrial compounds e g metabolites and degradation products and engineered nanomaterials studies have revealed that these ecs are frequently and abundantly found in wastewaters and surface water 1 another class of pollutants is referred to as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs which are known to affect the endocrine system including the growth and reproduction of humans and animals such compounds are widely used in industrial applications cosmetics and pharmaceuticals these compounds may include some phenolic compounds polyaromatic hydrocarbons dioxins natural steroidal estrogens synthetic estrogens and industrial chemicals 2 their concentrations in water bodies are high and thus cause many health threatening problems therefore the presence of such toxic pollutants requires the immediate development of effective treatment strategies to achieve a safe and green aqueous environment the control of environmental pollutants namely ecs and edcs from aqueous systems through the adsorption technique has received growing interest because it is simple and offers a wide variety of cheap and efficient adsorbent materials like hydrochars and their derived activated carbons acs hydrochar is a solid residue containing reduced hydrogen and oxygen contents from the hydrothermal carbonization htc of biomaterials particularly lignocellulose in the presence of subcritical liquid water 3 unlike those from other biomass utilization techniques such as pyrolysis biological conversion and densification to solid fuel hydrothermal treatment based hydrochar materials have drawn significant research interest due to their numerous advantages such as low processing temperatures 180 c 250 c low ash contents direct applicability to wet feedstock high product yield 30 wt 60 wt and zero generation of hazardous chemical waste 4 other properties such as porosity and variety of aliphatic and aromatic functional groups place these materials at the forefront of certain applications such as mitigating atmospheric co2 producing biofuel by curtailing the dependency on fossil fuels energy storage environmental pollution control and soil amelioration 5 8 owing to the versatile properties of hydrochars and their economic viability they have gained increasing importance and have replaced ac based applications such as capacitors 9 energy storage 10 soil amelioration and adsorbents for water purification 11 acs are generally prepared by physical and chemical activation processes both processes require pyrolysis and additional activation steps by gases or chemical agents that result in energy and economic compromise being a cheap and efficient alternative hydrochars particularly their application to pollutant removal have been the center of many scientific research interests however studies performed with acs have shown that carbon adsorbents with a lower content of oxygen functional groups would present a higher sorption capacity for removal of organics when compared with carbon adsorbents with high contents of oxygen functional groups due to low ash contents hydrochars serve the best precursors in preparation of ac hydrochars based activated carbons from orange peels have been tested for the treatment of certain emerging pharmaceutical pollutants activation process surface texture and ph reportedly exert a significant influence on adsorption features 5 some anionic dyes have also been investigated in terms of the removal efficiency of food waste based hydrochars with an advanced approach in which an artificial neural network design is developed for an automated wastewater treatment plant 12 surface modified hydrochars have also been investigated for metal removal 4 meanwhile hydrochars outperform acs in certain applications but no review article has focused on the applications of lignocellulose based hydrochars and activated carbons derived from them to the adsorption of ecs and edcs dai et al 13 14 reviewed the application of agriculture wastes and biochars to the removal of different contaminants and organic contaminants respectively bhatnagar and anastopoulus 15 summarized the different types of adsorbents for bisphenol a removal and kim et al 16 reviewed the use of graphene based adsorbents for various organic and inorganic contaminants therefore the present review focuses on and discusses the recent advances in hydrochar and activated carbon formation their applications in removing ecs and edcs and the gaps associated with the adsorption performance of hydrochars and activated carbons derived from them recommendations for the future improvement of these materials are also detailed from economic and applied industrial perspectives 2 classification and sources of ecs ecs are new and known toxic pollutants that belong to different classes such as pharmaceuticals containing nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics and antifungal antimicrobial agents fragrances pesticides food additives artificial sweeteners lipid regulators hormones uv filters flame retardants and other industrial products 17 18 despite these classifications confusion remains in categorizing different pollutants for example some plasticizers that are considered endocrine disrupting compounds are also called ecs this ambiguity indicates that ecs are a broad spectrum of pollutants that pose hazardous impacts on humans and aquatic organisms in all aspects 17 fig 1 shows the classification of ecs which are chiefly found in many commercial and household products according to the literature 19 the common sources and pathways of ecs that lead to contamination in the environment include wastewaters from local wastewater treatment units 20 hospitals 21 livestock activities 22 food processing plants agriculture waste subsurface storage of industrial and household wastes and indirect means of ground water surface water exchange 23 generally ecs can be introduced to environment from two main sources namely point and diffuse sources first sources are identified or specific sites of pollutants and the input can be identified in a spatially separated way examples of such sources include different industrial effluents cosmetics hospitals sewage treatment plants mining activities buried septic tanks and waste lagoons the discharge of contaminants from these sources is usually concentrated meanwhile diffuse sources refer to unidentified or indistinct sources examples include run offs from biosolids or manure and floods in industrial or urban regions the discharge from these sources is often low and cannot be controlled fig 2 schematically explains the different sources from which ecs are discharged and enter the surface and ground waters surface water is more frequently loaded with ecs than groundwater is 24 the animal domestic hospital and industrial wastes along with landfill represent the major source relative to a minor aerial source of ecs in surface and ground waters moreover among these sources both landfill and aerial are the minor ecs pathways the disposal from the households are considered important point sources as most of the unused or expired drugs are disposed through household solid waste or flushed down in the toilet artificial recharge infiltration with treated waste water from industrial and domestic or urban and stormwater runoff may become important basis of re introducing these contaminants that might be still present in these waters animal feeding operations also present a major source of ecs as the significant portion of given antibiotics pesticides or hormones passes through the livestock and is excreted and stored in waste lagoons 3 classification and sources of edcs edcs are exogenous agents that alter the natural functions of the hormones in our body that are responsible for homeostasis development and reproduction 25 according to the review by tijani et al 26 nearly 38 000 different chemicals and elements have been identified as edcs these are classified to synthetic and natural hormones such as estrone 17 β estradiol e2 estriol testosterone dihydrotestosterone 27 ethynylestradiol and phytoestrogens 28 industrial compounds such as bisphenol a phthalates parabens nonylphenol and perfluorooctanesulfonate 29 30 dioxins flame retardants including polybrominated diphenyl ethers various medicines such as diethylstilbestrol pesticides such as endosulfan and organophosphorus pesticides and synthetic birth control pills 28 edcs are also considered ecs due to their uncertain prolonged health impacts the sources of edcs are widespread and diverse in nature similar to ecs edcs are commonly found in low concentrations ng μg l level in sewage wastewater treatment plants surface water ground water hospital wastewater soil sediments air and even drinking water 31 35 mostly industrial effluents after being treated are directly introduced to the ground water where traces of edcs still remain and thereby enter to the aqueous environment some pesticides in agriculture applications directly absorb into soil and may leach to the ground water and then make their way to the food chain by building up in fish animals and humans according to the recent research of saeed et al 36 significant concentrations of phthalates alkyl phenols and estrogens have been detected in coastal areas receiving sewage discharge different alarming concentrations of phthalates have also been found in the sediments of the northern part of the arabian gulf and they may have entered via industrial and agricultural activities 37 this finding suggests that edcs prevail heavily in water and airborne dust particles therefore strict guidelines and protocols must be implemented to restrain the discharge of these toxic and hazardous pollutants from their sources 4 lignocellulosic biomass in terms of renewability recyclability and sustainability biomass based resources are a main concern from the economic and energy perspectives lignocellulosic biomass is a non edible and renewable resource in different industrial applications such as production of biofuels i e bioethanol biobutanol and biomethanol value added chemicals and new polymers 38 40 lignocellulose biomass forms a significant fraction of forestry and agricultural crop wastes decreasing sources of fossils increasing economic demands and environmental pollution from greenhouse gases have urged today s scientific community to utilize lignocellulose biomass as an alternate renewable source in the context of agricultural and environmental restraints biomass resources are expected to supply power of 130 270 ej year in 2050 this value can satisfy 15 25 of the future total energy requirement 41 lignocellulose biomass mainly consists of three main structural components namely hemicellulose 20 40 cellulose 40 60 and lignin 10 25 42 depending on a wide variety of sources these materials may be processed to achieve different industrially important chemicals and biofuels for internal combustion engines given the recalcitrance of the lignocellulose network these materials undergo different modes of pretreatment such as hydrothermal methods including steam and co2 explosions hot water treatment chemical methods involving acid and base treatments organosolv methods using organic solvents ammonia recycle percolation ammonia fiber explosion and ozonolysis 40 to destroy their structures and achieve different fermentable sugars for obtaining alcohols and other value added products 38 43 the adsorption performance of lignocellulose biomass may be improved via substantial treatments such as chemical physical physico chemical and thermochemical treatments these treatments may introduce novel functionalities that are compatible with target pollutants among the numerous treatment protocols htc is considered as an eco friendly and cost effective technique and is further discussed in the next section 5 hydrothermal carbonization hydrothermal carbonization or wet torrefaction is a thermochemical method of converting biomass of low heating value and large moisture content into carbonaceous solid residues with chemical characteristics identical to those of lignite coal surrounding liquids e g furfurals and small organic acids including acetic lactic and levulinic acids and gaseous by products 44 45 the aqueous suspension of biomass is treated at the subcritical temperature of approximately 180 c 250 c in a closed reactor under autogenous pressure the solid residue from the hydrothermal treatment is called hydrochar by the european biomass industry association 46 htc is considered a simple and easily scalable technology that is suitable for any organic raw biomass in addition to its valorization htc is made advantageous by its use of water as a reaction medium and catalyst that is nontoxic cheap and ecofriendly under a subcritical temperature the characteristic features of water dramatically change the hydrogen bonds weaken the dielectric constants decrease and the ionization of water begins as the number of hydronium ions h3o increase to facilitate the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages in the hemicelluloses in biomass into hexoses and pentoses for subsequent transformation into value added chemicals 47 moreover this technique is applicable to biomasses with high moisture contents 60 humidity and is different from pyrolysis which is unsuitable for biomasses with high moisture contents and those that require sufficient pre drying before being properly utilized such treatment may enhance the consumption of energy moreover toxic heavy metals are concentrated in chars after pyrolysis due to their thermal stability by contrast in htc treatment these heavy metal contents are sufficiently removed from hydrochars through transformation into the liquid phase which leaves stable carbonized fractions 48 49 5 1 hydrothermal carbonization of lignocellulosic biomass to hydrochar the hydrothermal carbonization process is generally affected by operation temperature and residence time the properties of resulting hydrochars depend not only on these factors but also on the nature and composition of feedstock table 1 summarizes the yields and characteristics of hydrochars and their lignocellulose feedstocks 50 55 the degree of carbonization is determined by h c and o c ratios decreasing ratios of these elements suggest increased carbonization values whereas o c values suggest the presence of oxygenated functional groups ofgs 56 during htc the hemicellulose part of the lignocellulose biomass is prone to degradation due to the low activation energy and is converted to volatile products 54 however cellulose and lignin are resistant to degradation below 220 c the thermal stability of these species follows the order lignin cellulose hemicellulose 57 the htc of lignocellulose biomass involves different steps of reactions that occur simultaneously such as hydrolysis dehydration decarboxylation aromatization condensation and polymerization 58 with an increase in temperature the ionic product of water is believed to increase making water a weak acid base catalyst consequently a hydrolysis reaction commences with the breakage of the ether bonds in hemicellulose and cellulose in this case lignin is mostly unaffected the resulting monomers and oligomers then move toward the aqueous phase and are further degraded into various small chemicals fig 3 this process leaves small pores on the solid residue hydrochar properties are also greatly influenced by feed water ph hydrochars were produced from wheat straw by changing the acidic and basic ph of feed water hydrochars with great pore properties were derived using the acidic ph of feed water furthermore the production of sugars furfurals and organic acids under basic ph was found to be low 59 the metal retention in the form of ash is also a crucial factor that is the ash contents in hydrochars mostly decrease relative to their raw materials the ash contents further decrease with reaction severity high ash contents in hydrochars may impair the application of the latter as solid fuel and may cause slagging and fouling during combustion the presence of inorganic species such as na k ca mg p and n greatly affects the formation features of hydrochars 53 however a knowledge gap exists with regard to the role of these elements in the hydrochar formation mechanism and their effects on the composition production and characteristics of hydrochars lignocellulose biomass as feedstock has many benefits such as abundance and low cost when mixed with other non lignocellulose biomasses this raw feedstock can be applied as high quality solid fuel 60 and as an excellent material for soil amelioration 61 and it can reduce heavy metal content relative to individual feedstocks 62 microwave integrated htc is currently considered appealing as it accelerates hydrochar formation but this technique is underutilized due to its lower yields in comparison with those of conventional thermal methods the difficulty in processing tons of biomasses and its energy intensiveness 58 63 microwave produced hydrochars have been reported to serve as an alternative to raw coal that could reduce the cost to half when used as an energy source 64 the pore properties and yield of hydrochars significantly depend on the composition of lignocellulose feedstocks in terms of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin moreover htc temperature and acidic ph of feed water play a role in enhancement of pore properties of hydrochars from table 1 the high carbon and oxygen contents along with the low ash content of lignocellulose feedstocks result in the formation of hydrochars with large yield 40 79 and favorable heating value 17 16 32 1 mj kg and carbon content 42 65 72 2 in addition the low nitrogen and sulfur contents of these feedstocks produce hydrochars with less nitrogen 0 06 3 6 and sulfur 0 1 0 46 elements thus lignocellulose feedstocks derived hydrochar can be efficient and eco friendly precursor for acs with low emission of noxious gases during activation 5 2 preparation of acs from lignocellulosic biomass by conjunction htc and subsequent activation generally the ac requirement increases annually by approximately 8 1 and may reach up to 2 1 million metric tons in the coming years this change may further increase the ac cost 65 therefore many researchers are now switching to cheap and renewable lignocellulose biomasses as carbon sources acs are normally prepared by the carbonization of precursors at the temperature range of 600 c 700 c dry method for a certain time in the traditional process which is still used today the smoke from the process is freely emitted to the atmosphere thus contributing to environmental pollution and most of the ash is deposited on the resulting carbon these results call for an energy efficient separation process for obtaining pure ac as part of the effort to save energy and cut down the cost of ac production htc wet process is used to produce hydrochars before their activation to ac normally htc is conducted at 180 c 250 c which is much lower than that in the carbonization process moreover htc does not emit smoke to the atmosphere and produces minimal ash in the resulting hydrochars moreover the use of water in htc could produce hydrochars with many new functional groups oh cooh cho on the surface that can enhance adsorption capacity using htc based hydrochars as a carbon source could offer many benefits i provide an economic ecofriendly and sustainable way of reutilizing waste biomass ii yield a purified carbon source with abundant ofgs that facilitate activation to generate acs with a large surface area and iii create efficient and cheap adsorbent or catalyst support raw materials that could efficiently replace commercially available acs table 2 shows the textural properties of some acs produced through the activation of hydrothermally treated lignocellulose biomasses 66 75 generally the formation of acs with superior porosities and surface areas is promoted by the use of suitable activation agents at optimum proportion and suitable operation temperatures at a certain time activation agents such as koh naoh zncl2 and h3po4 have been widely studied to produce porous acs acid activators are preferred to alkali metal hydroxides as they remove inorganic impurities and can be easily recovered from the process 76 in addition acid treatment can introduce abundant oxygen containing functional groups to the resulting hydrochar 77 rice husk based hydrochars were chemically treated with h3po4 and ac with a bet surface area of 2700 m2 g was obtained at 500 c for capacitor application 68 activation with h3po4 is considered to occur under mild conditions the case is different for acs obtained by alkali activation in this context both rattan stalks and coconut shell derived hydrochars were chemically activated with naoh at 600 c to produce acs with bet surface areas of 1135 and 876 14 m2 g respectively 70 71 naoh activation resulted in a mesoporous structure and uniform surface fig 4 the development of acs porosity is attributed to activator s dehydration effect which breaks the coc and cc bonds of hydrochar naoh is reduced to metallic sodium na hydrogen gas and sodium carbonate na2co3 furthermore na2co3 is degraded into na and co as follows 78 1 6 naoh 2 c 2 na 3 h2 2 na2co3 2 na2co3 2c 2na 3co thus both the alkaline and carbonate metals are intercalated into the hydrochar structure and played a role in generation and enlargement of pores few studies have reported the use of k2co3 as an activator because it is known to be non deleterious unlike koh magnetic acs have been prepared from salix psammophila and rice straw hydrochars using k2co3 as the activator with a 2 1 impregnation ratio the resulting product performs well in the adsorption application due to its excellent surface area with microporous and mesoporous structures respectively 69 73 hydrochars may serve as ideal precursors for preparing acs for multiple applications because they evidently reduce energy consumption and environmental concerns according to table 2 hydrochars derived acs exhibit high surface areas within the range of 876 to 2960 m2 g different basic acidic and metallic salt activators are applied for the production of acs with well developed pores and microporous or mesoporous structures depending on the type of activator and activation conditions despite increasing research work gaps remain in current technology and some of them are mentioned here suitable activating agents should not only be cost effective but also environmentally benign and easily recoverable no work has explored the use of value added acids like lactic acids levulinic acid and acetic acid produced from the htl of biomass for the activation of resulting hydrochars using such biomass derived activating agents may exert some profound effects on ac production yield and textural properties and may reduce the cost of the method new strategies should be developed to overcome high temperature requirements and low ac yields in this regard few catalysts may be developed or equipment design should be engineered few new applications of hydrochar based carbons such as fuel cells membrane materials for ecs and edc removal from wastewater treatment plants should also be explored to offer sufficient removal below permissible limits large scale production cost estimation and the stability of hydrochars should be considered from an industrial point of view 6 mechanism of adsorption of ecs and edcs on hydrochar and acs the mechanism of adsorption involves a combination of a multitude of interactions i e hydrogen bonding pore filling hydrophobic interactions and π π interactions this combination depends on different factors such as surface chemistry surface area pore size surface charge zeta potential ph and the chemical structure of target compounds all these interactions occur either simultaneously or by changing the experimental parameters especially ph surface texture and functional groups greatly affect the adsorption mechanism although suggesting the exact mechanism taking place is difficult many researchers favor fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as a useful tool to investigate the interactions between solutes and adsorbents relying on ftir and surface charge results may arbitrarily predict the mechanism however we feel that the assistance of further advanced surface techniques is crucial in investigating the exact mechanism because mechanisms are essentially complex and require careful investigation table 3 shows different predominant adsorption mechanisms that are responsible for the effective removal of ecs and edcs by hydrochars or the acs derived from them 79 92 solution ph has a pivotal role in tuning the surface charges and active functional groups of target analytes it can alter the adsorption mechanism from being hydrophobic to being electrostatic a change in ph induces positive negative charges on hydrochars ac and the molecular state of solute and thereby affects electrostatic interactions the structure of hydrochars involves a hydrophilic shell which results from abundant ofgs and a hydrophobic core which results from fixed carbon and aromatization 79 kyzas and deliyanni 88 suggested that acs from potato peel hydrochars when subjected to hno3 oxidation produce an enhanced number of ofgs for the adsorption of pramipexole dihydrochloride and dorzolamide ftir spectrum results confirmed the presence of oh group of the phenol at 3400 cm 1 and cc group of the aromatic ring at 1615 cm 1 after the adsorption the disappearing of oh group and shifting of cc group was observed which indicated the role of these groups in adsorption process thus the mechanism is mainly π π electron coupling and lewis acid base reactions between amino groups in drugs and o in ac furthermore ph exerts a strong influence on uptake behavior because acidic ph 2 provides the highest removal efficiency that declines with a further rise in ph due to electrostatic repulsions a highly basic ph is unfavorable for most pollutants such as e2 that is removed by fe mn binary oxide functionalized hydrochar pzc 5 as e2 remains in neutral state at ph 10 ftir spectrum showed the peaks at 3415 cm 1 and 1508 cm 1 which attributed to the oh and aromatic cc stretching bonds respectively owing to the aromatic structure and presence of oh groups the principal adsorption mechanism was proposed to be π π interactions and hydrogen bonding 80 a similar observation was also found by li et al 87 who tested the adsorption of amoxicillin onto ac from previously modified hydrochars from corn stalks the presence of amoxicillin in different chemical forms at different ph levels and zeta potentials of the adsorbent affected the adsorption mechanism the removal of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen on ac from orange peel hydrochar was also found to be ph dependent with the acidic ph being the most suitable for maximum removal here dispersion was the main interaction proposed along with a slight electrostatic interaction between positively charged adsorbents and π electron of drug molecules ftir results only displayed a single peak at 1612 cm 1 that accounted for the complete disappearance of carboxylic groups and the presence of aromatic cc group indicating that only hard carbon components remained 5 in some cases changes in ph do not affect adsorption behavior for example chen et al 86 observed that changes in ph had no effect on the adsorption of tetracycline using magnetic ac derived from fir saw dust hydrochar in another study the removal of e2 and 17α ethynylestradiol by montmorillonite hydrochar composites was relatively the same within wide ph ranges due to stable hydrogen bonds π π interactions and intercalation 81 suo et al 92 also found no significant effect of ph on organophosphorus pesticides removed by ac from corn straw cellulose and graphene composites because the main mechanism was preferentially π π interactions in a raman study the degree of graphitization id ig was expected to play a vital role that is increasing activation temperatures lead to burn out that causes extensive dislocations and defects which in turn improve the surface area and adsorption properties of the resulting carbon 86 92 zhu et al 93 also observed that magnetic ac from sawdust hydrochars with great id ig possessed great porosities and great adsorption capability toward roxarsone 4 hydroxy 3 nitrophenylarsonic acid the predominant adsorption mechanism was found to be pore filling in addition to the mild surface complexation of as and fe on the surface of the magnetic ac 93 94 the same observation was found by suo et al 92 as discussed above in another study by zhu et al 73 magnetic ac from salix psammophila hydrochars was obtained at different temperatures the sample was obtained at the lowest activation temperature and fixed hydrochar the activator ratio had a great id ig ratio and the highest adsorption capacity toward triclosan pore filling may be a dominant mechanism depending on the dimensions of the adsorbate fernandez et al 5 found that the adsorption of salicylic acid is due to porosity development and that the molecular size of salicylic acid is smaller 0 6 nm than the size of the pores on the ac from orange peel hydrochars zhu et al 95 prepared magnetic ac from hydrochar at different temperatures for the removal of triclosan and obtained a linear increase in q e values as functions of the surface area and pore and micropore volumes that led to the pore filling being the suitable mechanism the removal of diuron and bisphenol a in addition to hydrogen and π π bonding was explained by the presence of micropores 79 the adsorption capacity of triclosan on ac from rice straw hydrochars was found to be several times greater than that of its magnetic derivative due to pore blockage by magnetic particles 69 this result also suggested that the adsorption of triclosan was mainly based upon pore diffusion ftir spectrum displayed wide bands at 3400 and 1080 cm 1 which attributed to oh and co groups being abundant in ofgs hydrogen bonding interactions play a major role in adsorption with ac from rice straw hydrochars sun et al 96 compared the adsorption mechanisms of three edcs namely bisphenol a 17 ethynyl estradiol and phenanthrene on biochars and hydrochars in addition to pore filling being the common mechanism the adsorption of bisphenol a and 17 ethynyl estradiol was mainly due to hydrogen bonding whereas phenanthrene was unable to facilitate hydrogen bonding due to the absence of oh groups but was able promote π h bond and π π interactions in the study the biochar showed mainly π π interactions due to the existence of aromatic co cc and ch groups at 1700 1600 and 885 752 cm 1 respectively in a special case caffeine adsorption on ac derived from pistachio nut shell hydrochar was studied experimentally and by molecular modeling the results based upon these two methods suggested that adsorption was mainly due to the microporous character of acs prior to adsorption caffeine formed aggregates that were disintegrated by surface oh groups on the adsorbent surface with further disintegration these molecules penetrated inside the pores and bound with the oh groups on the inner walls of the pores to make a monolayer attachment 83 fig 5 illustrates adsorption mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of different edcs and ecs by hydrochars and acs derived from them 79 88 89 overall many interaction mechanisms such as electrostatic hydrogen bonding pore filing π π interactions and hydrophobic are proposed for edcs and ecs adsorption on hydrochars and their derived acs table 3 solution ph chemical structure of ecs or edcs and surface texture functional groups and surface charge of hydrochar or its derived ac greatly affect the adsorption mechanism the mechanisms of adsorption of edcs and ecs pollutants are mostly the same relative to other carbon based materials obtained without hydrothermal treatment 97 99 but compared with hydrochars ac derived from them offer enhanced adsorption capacities due to wider pore volumes and enhanced specific surface area 5 69 85 owing to the limited work on hydrochars or acs derived from them for a limited number of ecs and edcs we need to employ new surface techniques to explore further the mechanisms of their adsorption and thereby understand the behavior of these pollutants correlation models should be developed to predict the influential interactions predominantly involved in the adsorption process weidemann et al 82 developed a correlation between the log kow values of fluconazole ciprofloxacin paracetamol sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim ochthilinone diphenhydramine bisphenol a diclofenac and triclosan and those of rice husk hydrochars horse manure hydrochars olive hydrochars and tomato hydrochars among the hydrochars those of rice husk had a positive correlation with the contaminants thereby confirming hydrophobic interaction as the fundamental mechanism the adsorption of additional edcs and ecs such as parabens phthalates and other industrial products should be studied to widen the scope of lignocellulose based hydrochars or acs obtained by their post treatment further work on real sample applications and their reusability is required 7 modeling of adsorption of ecs and edcs on hydrochar and ac 7 1 adsorption kinetic modeling both adsorption kinetics and equilibrium are baselines in designing and scaling up of adsorption systems kinetic studies involve modeling of experimental kinetic data collected by measuring the adsorbed amount against time pseudo first and pseudo second order are the most generally applied empirical equations in liquid phase adsorption systems lagergren first proposed a pseudo first order equation with the following expression form 100 3 q t q e q e e k 1 t linearizing the above equation gives the following 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q e and q t represent the adsorption capacities mg g at equilibrium and time t min and k 1 is the rate parameter 1 min an adsorption system is likely to follow this model under initial time intervals or prolonged intervals when the adsorption process is near equilibrium 101 103 the pseudo second order equation suggests that the adsorption rate is second order function of available active sites and is used for large time intervals 104 whereas the pseudo first order equation is applied to describe adsorption at small time intervals mathematically this model can be represented as 5 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t linearizing the above equation gives the following form 104 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t denote the equilibrium adsorption capacities mg g and adsorption capacities at a given time t min and k 2 is the rate parameter g mg min the adsorption kinetics of different pollutants frequently follow this model on the basis of high regression and low error analysis values and thereby signify this model s prominence the fitted rate constants k1 and k 2 are most probably lumped parameters that join reaction and diffusion influences under particular experimental variables the determination of primary adsorption phenomena is scarcely discussed after model fitting 105 another model that predicts chemisorption is the elovich equation 106 which is written as 7 q t 1 β ln α β t linearizing the above equation gives the following equation 8 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t the plot between q t and ln t should produce a straight line with 1 β slope and ln α β β intercept α mg g min represents the rate constant and β represents the extent of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorption another commonly applied model is the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model provided in the following equation 107 9 q t k i d t x where k id mg g min0 5 is the rate parameter and x is the initial adsorption mg g for kinetics controlled solely by this model a plot between q t and t should be straight line passing through the origin i e x 0 most research findings demonstrate multilinear curves within a studied time duration and these curves are indicative of multiple mechanisms occurring simultaneously with controlling mechanisms such as the transfer of solute to the external adsorbent surface intraparticle diffusion and the equilibrium stage in which the solute adheres to the walls of the pores these models are the most commonly studied and used to calculate rates and predict general adsorption mechanisms the suitability of each model relies on the characteristics of the adsorbents adsorbates and experimental conditions liu et al 69 studied the removal of triclosan using ac and magnetic ac from rice straw derived hydrochar the experimental data were applied to validate different kinetic equations like the pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and elovich equations in linear mode the results suggested the following order of best fittings pseudo second order equation pseudo first order equation elovich equation according to the highest r 2 magnitudes and the small deviation between the experimental q e and theoretical q e values the adsorption equilibrium was not immediately reached when high concentrations of triclosan were used the rate k 2 of ac decreased from 6 6 10 3 to 4 10 4 g mg min with a rise in initial triclosan concentration whereas the rate for the magnetic ac increased at high concentrations the adsorption capacities of ac were higher 175 588 mg g than those of its magnetic derivatives 161 286 mg g due to the highly porous network the application of the intraparticle diffusion model indicated a multilinear curve that produced a nonzero intercept which reflected the rapid diffusion of triclosan on the external surfaces of the ac and magnetic ac followed by diffusion inside the porous body kyzas and deliyanni 88 developed oxidized ac from potato peel hydrochars and pyrolyzed potato peels for the removal of dorzolamide and pramipexole drugs linear plots of pseudo second and pseudo first order models revealed that the former can effectively explain adsorption kinetics according to the closeness of the experimental q e values to the calculated q e values pp hyd ox prami q e cal 31 3 mg g and q e exp 31 1 mg g pp hyd ox dorzo q e cal 30 5 mg g and q e exp 30 4 mg g were greater than those of the ac obtained from pyrolyzed potato peels the rate of adsorption using ac from pyrolyzed potato peels was greater than that using a hydrochar precursor this result implied faster adsorption in the former than in the latter given that the pseudo second order equation is preferentially more valid than other kinetic models are most research groups only applied this model to determine the rates and adsorption capacities of adsorbents plazinski et al 108 showed that the preferential fitting of the pseudo second order equation over the pseudo first order equation can stem from a theoretical basis rather than a physical one the random errors in the calculated q e values did not vary to a great extent during the linearization of the pseudo second order equation as in the case of the pseudo first order equation an additional benefit of using the pseudo second order equation is that equilibrium q e is not required for data fitting zhu et al 93 prepared hydrochars using different temperature ranges i e 160 c 300 c for the hydrothermal treatment of sawdust from a furniture factory the resultant samples were simultaneously activated and magnetized to obtain magnetic acs the samples were studied for the removal of roxarsone the magnetic ac obtained from the hydrochars at 160 c exhibited high pore properties applying the linear form of the pseudo second order equation showed that the adsorption rate was high which suggested the excellent adsorption of roxarsone on the as prepared samples the adsorption capacities q e 515 mg g and rates of adsorption 13 2 10 4 g mg min increased in the following order mc 160 mc 200 mc 240 mc 270 mc 300 this order was mainly due to the favorable pore filling on the magnetic ac obtained from the hydrochars at low temperatures similarly chen et al 86 applied the pseudo second order equation to the experimental data of tetracycline adsorption on ac and magnetic ac from saw dust hydrochars the maximum adsorption capacities achieved were 250 mg g using acs and magnetic acs but the former achieved equilibrium earlier 10 min than the latter did 30 min on the basis of this model the authors assumed the rate limiting step to be chemisorption in nature an increase in initial solute concentration tends to increase equilibrium time fernandez et al 5 prepared ac from orange peel hydrochars using air co2 and phosphoric acid as activating agents for the removal of diclofenac salicylic acid and flurbiprofen respectively the kinetic data were as correlated to only the pseudo second order equation in nonlinear mode fig 6 the adsorbed amount of diclofenac was high on acid ac whereas those of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen were high on air ac the rates of adsorption of diclofenac and flurbiprofen were high on h3po4 treated ac from acid treated hydrochar whereas those of salicylic acid were high on air ac the data on the adsorption of triclosan on γ fe2o3 ac prepared from salix psammophila hydrochars revealed a preference for the pseudo second order equation in that study the effects of activation conditions influenced the q e values 170 9 787 4 mg g and such an increase was correlated with different textural characteristics like bet surface area volume and size of pores 95 mesopore size and large micropore volume are responsible for great diffusion and fast rates of adsorption as reported by mestre et al 109 who showed three types of ac namely ac prepared from sucrose hydrochars using koh and k2co3 as activating agents and commercial ac for the removal of paracetamol and iopamidol this model was again preferentially fitted when zhu et al 110 studied the adsorption of tetracycline on magnetic porous carbon obtained from salix psammophila hydrochars the order of fitting was as follows pseudo second order equation pseudo first order equation elovich equation in another study the adsorption of bisphenol a and diuron on argan nut shell hydrochars represented by the pseudo second order equation with excellent determination coefficients better than it did the pseudo first order equation the increase in temperature reduced the q e values 1094 664 mg g for bisphenol a and 773 557 mg g for diuron and the rate constant values dramatically increased with a rise in temperature 0 002 0 025 g mg min for bisphenol a and 0 013 0 208 g mg min for diuron this detailed analysis suggested that temperature can only accelerate the adsorption system in some cases and that it may not necessarily increase adsorption capacities furthermore the intraparticle diffusion model suggested two phase reactions namely macropore diffusion and mesopore diffusion 79 by contrast ahsan et al 99 suggested the first linear stage to be mesopore and macropore diffusion and the second stage linear curve to be micropore diffusion in their study of the adsorption of bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline on sulfuric acid treated sawdust the preferential fitting of the pseudo second order equation on every adsorption case reveals that the mechanism of adsorption depends on the presence of sufficient sites on adsorbents regardless of the type preparation method or aqueous environment used shi et al 97 achieved a preferential fitting of the pseudo second order equation in their study of the adsorption kinetics of ciprofloxacin on fe3o4 c from sucrose by htc the controlling mechanism was chemisorption in nature with a maximum q e of 38 6 mg g and rate of 19 9 g mg h li et al 87 fitted nonlinear kinetic equations namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich equations to the adsorption data of amoxicillin on ac from previously modified corn stalk hydrochar among these three models the elovich equation was found to have the best fit moreover chemical adsorption fast adsorption and slow desorption were suggested to be the most suitable rate controlling mechanisms ning et al 80 applied the nonlinear pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich equations to study the adsorption of e2 on fe mn binary oxide loaded hydrochars as anticipated kinetics preferentially followed the pseudo second order equation q e 47 43 mg g and k 2 4 79 g mg min with the following order pseudo second order model elovich equation pseudo first order model error analysis results including the root mean square errors and chi square statistics also supported the validation of the pseudo second order equation the morris weber plot was multilinear thereby implying that intraparticle diffusion was not the only governing mechanism rattanachueskul et al 89 used the nonlinear form of the pseudo second order equation to analyze the adsorption behavior of tetracycline on magnetic ac from sugar cane bagasse and obtained high rate constant values k 2 7 52 10 4 g mg min q e 28 14 mg g the authors elucidated the reason on the basis of the hierarchical structure of composites with macropores that were responsible for rapid diffusion meanwhile two phase linear curves of intraparticle diffusion indicated film and intraparticle diffusion as the rate limiting steps tetracycline adsorption with ac from hydrochars of agave americana fibers and tannin was also studied by the application of the nonlinear modes of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models 91 the pseudo second order model as usual had the best fit given its high determination coefficient r 2 values and low error values the experimental q e 51 35 mg g was close to the calculated one and the rate constant was 2 48 g mg min furthermore e2 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol followed the pseudo second order model with montmorillonite hydrochar composites activated by koh 81 the linear plots for e2 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol yielded q e 113 8 mg g and 68 8 mg g respectively the rate constants for the adsorption of e2 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol were 0 0083 and 2 21 g mg h respectively the mechanism was mainly proposed to be chemical in nature with the involvement of physical interactions the above discussion clearly reveals that the pseudo second order equation is the most frequently fitted model studied and that intraparticle diffusion is not the predominant rate control step in all studies all the above kinetic models were studied with different edcs ecs using hydrochars and their derived acs and are summarized in table 4 7 2 adsorption isotherm modeling generally an adsorption isotherm is a curve that expresses the phenomenon that governs the retention of liquid gas adsorbates on solid phase adsorbents by varying initial concentrations at particular temperature and ph 111 its physical parameters and underlying thermodynamic assumptions provide insights into the adsorption mechanism surface properties and degree of affinity of adsorbents two widely used empirical models namely the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were adopted in different studies to determine the mechanism of adsorption and the maximum adsorption capacities the langmuir equation is given as 112 9 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where q e mg g is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium q m mg g is the highest adsorbed amount and kl l mg is the langmuir parameter the linearization of the above equation yields the following form 10 c e q e 1 b q m c e q m a dimensionless constant also identified as the separation factor rl suggested by webber and chakkravorti 113 can be expressed as 11 r l 1 1 k l c o where kl corresponds to the langmuir parameter and c 0 mg l belongs to the initial adsorbate amount the magnitude of this factor explains the nature of adsorption as unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the freundlich equation is expressed by the following 114 12 q e k f c e 1 n the linearization of the above equation gives the following form 13 log q e log k f 1 n log c e here kf mg g l mg 1 n is the freundlich parameter that represents adsorbed amount and n is a parameter that indicates adsorption strength the magnitude of 1 n between 0 and 1 is an index of adsorption strength or surface heterogeneity as this value approaches 0 heterogeneity rises values below 1 imply chemisorption and values above 1 indicate cooperative adsorption the q m values from the langmuir isotherm are important in the selection of a suitable adsorbent and the design of an appropriate adsorption system the langmuir isotherm is a preliminary and simple model that retains unique importance with almost every study determining adsorption capacity from this isotherm regardless of best fit because the value of q m corresponds to the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity that other isotherm equations do not consider table 5 shows two commonly applied empirical isotherm models and their parameters obtained from the adsorption data of different edcs ecs on different hydrochars or acs derived from them these isotherms greatly depend upon the nature of the adsorbent with different functional groups adsorbates and experimental conditions roman et al 83 demonstrated that the adsorption of caffeine on pistachio nut shell hydrochar when processed with acidic water during hydrothermal carbonization and that of the same sample after pyrolysis followed a langmuir isotherm with preferably high adsorption capacities 12 95 22 6 mg g however the pyrolysis of base processed hydrochars followed the freundlich isotherm with poor adsorption capacity this work explored new insights such as the excellent adsorption capacity of acid processed hydrochars despite their lower bet surface area in comparison with base processed hydrochars and different isotherm slopes with acid processed hydrochars and the same sample after pyrolysis the reason for the former finding was attributed to the development of steric hindrance repulsive interactions and strong resistance of base generated functional groups the reason behind the latter finding was the removal of ofgs on thermal treatment that was unfavorable for adsorption when high initial concentrations were used the result suggested that despite the large pores on pyrolyzed acid processed hydrochars unpyrolyzed hydrochars were more promising further insights were also obtained by simulation studies liu et al 69 applied these two models to probe the interactions between tetracycline on ac and magnetic ac from rice straw hydrochars in comparison with the freundlich isotherm the langmuir isotherm in linear form was a better fitting model resulting in q m 714 mg g for ac and 303 mg g for magnetic ac r l value was within 0 02 0 04 which indicated a favorable adsorption zhu et al 93 fitted a linear langmuir isotherm in their study of the adsorption of roxorsone on magnetic ac from sawdust hydrochars obtained at different temperatures the maximum adsorption capacity of q m 588 mg g was obtained using magnetic ac derived from hydrochar obtained at 160 c a linear correlation between bet surface area volumes of micropore and total pores and the maximum adsorption capacities from the langmuir isotherm provided the main clue to this exclusively large capacity chen et al 86 prepared magnetic ac from sawdust hydrochar for tetracycline adsorption linear plots of the freundlich and langmuir equations favored the former isotherm on the basis of its high coefficient of determination the q m value from the langmuir equation 423 7 mg g was considered the greatest among all values for all adsorbents the magnetization barely impeded the adsorption performance of ac hydrothermally obtained hydrochars and their acs have proven to be promising adsorbents zhu et al 95 also obtained superior adsorption capacity in their triclosan adsorption study on γ fe2o3 carbon the langmuir fitted data presented a high regression coefficient that lacked information about the freundlich isotherm the correlation of the different texture characteristics of acs prepared at different temperatures with langmuir q m showed a linear response in particular micropore volume had the best correlation with q m profound research interest has long been noted in the nonlinear optimization of adsorption modeling ning et al 80 prepared fe mn binary oxide modified hydrochar from rice husk for the removal of e2 the nonlinear modes of the freundlich and langmuir equations predicted excellent fit to the isotherm data of e2 however error values were minimum with the langmuir model fig 7 the involvement of fe mn binary oxides augmented the adsorption capacity 49 7 mg g relative to the case of bare hydrochars 38 8 mg g tian et al 81 prepared rice husk hydrochar and montmorillonite composites for the removal of two edcs namely e2 and 17α ethynyl estradiol the nonlinear form of the langmuir model was the well fitted equation according to the regression coefficient values and a close agreement was found between the calculated values and the experimental q m values the adsorption capacity for e2 138 mg g was the highest followed by that for 17α ethynyl estradiol 69 mg g however the concentration range selected was small 0 2 8 mg l possibly because of the limited solubilities of both solutes that otherwise could provide a deviation from langmuir to freundlich the fabrication of these composites was claimed as an easy and cheap method with superior adsorption capacities for the two model pollutants in comparison with previously used materials fernandez et al 5 studied the adsorption of emerging pharmaceuticals diclofenac salicylic acid and flurbiprofen on acs achieved by air and phosphoric acid treatment of orange peel hydrochars an isotherm study was performed at ph 7 in the case of diclofenac and at ph 2 in the cases of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen in a nonlinear mode the freundlich equation best fitted with the adsorption data of diclofenac on air ac whereas the langmuir isotherm was the most appropriate when using phosphoric acid ac the adsorption capacities in both cases 0 164 and 0 211 mmol g were claimed to be higher than those of other biomass based acs in the case of salicylic acid and flurbiprofen the experimental data best fitted the langmuir isotherm in some cases the freundlich model was the preferable isotherm as explained by kyzas and deliyanni 88 who applied nonlinear freundlich and langmuir equations for their study of the adsorption of two pharmaceuticals namely dorzolamide and pramipexole on oxidized acs prepared via hydrothermal and pyrolysis treatments both drugs followed the freundlich model with pramipexole having higher adsorption capacity than dorzolamide did the acs prepared from hydrochars showed greater adsorption capacities than those prepared from biochars of the same precursor via pyrolysis their study showed that preparation methods greatly affect the adsorption performances of resulting acs the freundlich isotherm was again the best fitted model on the basis of the experimental data of tetracycline adsorption in magnetic ac from salix psammophila with a langmuir adsorbed amount of 25 4 mg g as a result of the many graphitic layers and porous texture the r l values within 0 011 0 16 also suggested a favorable adsorption process 110 rattanachueskul et al 89 studied the adsorption performance of magnetic ac derived from sugar cane bagasse for removing tetracycline the freundlich isotherm model was the better fitted model with a value of n 2 47 which indicated a heterogeneous adsorption that further strengthened the assumption that the resulting adsorbent possessed a large number of heterogeneous sites however relying on isotherms for the prediction of adsorption mechanisms is not the exclusive method for demonstrating solute adsorbent interactions some advanced computational modeling studies along with advanced characterization tools should be deduced to learn the effect of variables like ph molecular geometries and surface and interaction energies on the mechanisms of adsorption 83 another remarkable study is that conducted by flora et al 98 who investigated the influence of hydrochars with and without washing for removal of atrazine the calculation of the binding energies between the atrazine hydrochars showed low favorable binding energies when atrazine was parallel to the hydrochar plane the adsorptive capacities of the hydrochars obtained by acetone washing were superior to those of the hydrochars without washing this deviation in adsorption can be related to the less preferable attraction energy of atrazine for hydrochars without washing with weakly associated alkyl groups on the surface relative to hydrochars with washing according to table 5 langmuir model well represents the adsorption isotherm data of most edc ec pollutants on hydrochars and their derived acs freundlich model is also applicable in some cases from the parameters of both models the adsorption process is favorable in the literature the adsorption capacities of different hydrochars or the acs derived from them for edc ec removal were claimed to be superior to those of other reported materials 5 79 81 86 95 thereby suggesting that hydrochars may open a new horizon in carbon chemistry as their interesting surface features and low cost preparation methods supersede the features of commercially available acs the use of such material encourages further investigations into the removal of other wide varieties of pollutants the commercialization and implementation of the method in practical settings are encouraged in the current industrialization era 8 reusability of adsorbents the worth of any adsorbent material can be appraised if the material concerned is economic efficient and long lasting reusability is one of the important aspects in this technology because this property may help reduce the cost of adsorbents minimize disposal issues and prevent the laborious work needed to resynthesize fresh adsorbent materials for the consecutive adsorption system our extensive literature survey on the topic has revealed the limited number of studies on the reusability of lignocellulose based hydrochars their composites and the acs derived from them good desorption depends upon the type of interactions and solvents rattanachueskul et al 89 demonstrated that magnetic carbon from sugar cane bagasse hydrochar can be reused for tetracycline adsorption when treated with 25 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution as a normal trend the adsorption efficiency declined after every cycle from 81 84 to 57 27 thereby confirming strong interactions between tetracycline and the adsorbent in an existing study acs from potato peel hydrochars obtained after hydrothermal treatment and oxidation showed good reusable performance that is reusability of up to 20 times with desorption carried at an optimum ph level of 10 in dorzolamide and pramipexole removal 88 the work reported only an 11 decline in initial adsorption efficiency this decreasing trend was attributed to the progressive saturation of the active sites and the degradation of the materials due to the highly basic ph and blockage of active sites meanwhile fe mn binary oxide loaded rice husk based hydrochars showed good reusability of up to five times for 6 mg l e2 removal the desorption medium used was acetone water mixture in the ratio of 1 1 v v based on a high octanol water partitioning coefficient in acetone 80 tian et al 81 performed a regeneration study of montmorillonite rice husk hydrochar composites with 20 ml ethanol which were washed with water multiple times and then dried the regenerated adsorbent retained 82 and 80 2 of the initial sorption capacities for e2 and 17α ethynyl estradiol respectively excellent stability and reusability were found by zbair et al 79 using argan nut shell hydrochars for the removal of diuron and bisphenol a the desorption of the retained pollutants was conducted using ethanol the frequency of recycling up to 5 times had no significant effect on adsorption efficiency and the material could sustain its removal efficiency for bisphenol a 88 and diuron 94 as shown in fig 8 only a 5 decline was reported in the efficiency of bisphenol a removal whereas a 1 decline was reported for diuron for five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles hydrochars and their derived acs can be efficiently reutilized for several cycles after regeneration by naoh and organic agents ideally a desorbing agent should be neither too punitive nor too expensive for the regeneration of adsorbents to affect adsorbents efficiency or technology from the above discussions we observed that mostly organic solvents were used for the desorption of studied pollutants that are expensive and volatile this approach could affect process efficiency from the ecological and economic perspectives a systematic study with green solvents for the regeneration of spent adsorbents is necessary to achieve a successful adsorption of these pollutants moreover the fate of these desorbing agents remains undecided they are mostly disposed to the sink and may thus cause secondary pollution such gaps should be considered and recyclability techniques should be developed to regenerate desorbing solvents and recollect desorbed pollutants that may be removed or returned to the manufacturing industry only zbair et al 79 addressed some alternative solutions to the present dilemma that is the incineration of exhausted adsorbents and conversion of retained pollutants to less harmful byproducts however such a study requires proper waste management techniques and transport facilities that should be considered by environmental protection agencies 9 conclusions and future perspectives in this review we focused on the recent studies on the applications of lignocellulose based hydrochars and their post hydrothermally treated acs this work invokes the slogan treatment of waste by waste and may serve as a beacon in green chemistry these hydrochars can successfully replace commercially available resins and acs for the removal of ecs and edcs post treated acs from hydrochar precursors have shown promising and improved results relative to their precursors because of their large surface area and high porosity the mechanism of adsorption greatly depends upon experimental conditions and adsorption is controlled by a myriad of interactions such as electrostatic hydrophobic and π π interactions pore filling hydrogen bonding and intercalations the use of hydrochars and acs in the removal of ecs and edcs has elicited keen interest in the last few years due to the great adsorption capacities that they offer adsorption kinetics is a pseudo second order equation in all studies and intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate limiting step adsorption isotherms are frequently of langmuir type but some studies cited the freundlich isotherm as the best one efficient regeneration and reusability profiles have been exhibited for hydrochars and their derived acs some issues remain unaddressed and must be considered to broaden the scope of these new emerging materials the studies discussed in the current review were mainly based on the batch system for determining the adsorption performance of different hydrochars and their acs thus carrying out column pilot full scale and multi component adsorption studies is useful to appraise these adsorbents in real applications that involve interfering substances the adsorption behavior of other edcs and ecs such as phthalates parabens ddt herbicides and pesticides should also be investigated to apply these new materials to practical settings the proper and careful study of the exact adsorption mechanism is also required in designing a suitable adsorbent that depends on the complex structure of different ecs and edcs furthermore the magnetization of porous acs may enhance their adsorption efficiency relative to bare hydrochars the regeneration and reusability of hydrochar and ac adsorbents using nontoxic and cheap solvents should be investigated to make the process economically viable cost analysis studies and the practical implementation of these adsorbents should also be given adequate attention to strengthen their replacement with acs other gaps pointed out in the current review include the development of a systematic classification to distinguish ecs and edcs and the establishment of proper guideline values strict measures should also be taken to frame legislation on the release of these contaminants from industrial wastes an accurate precise and sensitive standard analytical method is required for the simultaneous determination of well known edcs and ecs at their trace levels proper knowledge of the mechanism of hydrochar formation from complex lignocellulose biomass is equally important the use of green activating agents for the preparation of acs should be studied owing to the frequent presence of these toxic unregulated pollutants at alarming levels wastewater treatments should be upgraded to resolve these rapid growing problems by either modifying the membrane materials with such novel and sustainable materials as their components or replacing commercially applied acs to treat recalcitrant ecs and edcs such attempts may improve water quality and substantially reduce the costs for expensive membranes hydrochars and their derived acs may leave some adverse effects therefore an evaluation of their ecotoxicity and an assessment of their environmental influences are strongly

13829,reverse osmosis ro is essential for dairy processors to reduce their water input and the energy dedicated to dewatering processes such as evaporation indeed water can be reclaimed by ro from numerous dairy fluids e g milk cheese whey uf permeates condensing water but these applications may have different effects on plant efficiency in terms of water and energy use consequently this study uses predictive analysis to evaluate the impact of performing ro at different steps in the process flow chart of an industrial cheesemaking plant the hypothesis that preconcentrating milk by ro at the entry gate of the plant on skim milk would reduce the volume of by products to be processed and the resources used was not valid instead the most efficient way to reduce the amount of resources consumed was to perform ro on the cheese whey and milk uf permeate prior evaporation preconcentrating these by products to a total solids content of 20 and 22 respectively reduced the entire natural gas consumption by 36 and the electricity consumption by 10 compared to a scenario where only condensing water was reclaimed keywords water reuse membrane filtration efficiency assessment economic assessment dairy processing cheese 1 introduction dairy processing is one of the most water demanding industries in the food sector 1 for example cheese manufacture in european dairies may require up to 3 7 l of water per l of milk processed 2 3 reverse osmosis ro is currently the most efficient method for reclaiming water from dairy fluids which are mainly composed of water e g 87 w w 1 for whole milk 4 according to the efficiency definition of benoit et al 5 the ratio of the useful output i e water to the total input i e operational costs energy of the ro process is higher than that of other dewatering processes such as evaporation integrating ro into dairy processing thus offers opportunities to improve the water balance in dairy plants and to reduce their energy consumption 6 in fact ro uses only 10 of the energy used by a traditional industrial evaporator with thermocompression 7 8 for these reasons ro is currently used to reduce the volume of dairy fluids milk cheese whey permeate to be evaporated 6 9 or to polish vapor condensates obtained from evaporators and dryers 1 in addition ro could also be used in a filtration cascade process to restore cleaning solutions 10 recover diluted dairy solids in diluted rinse water 11 or reduce the volume of dairy plant effluent 1 12 indeed ro technology also has its disadvantages it does not allow to obtain a degree of concentration as high as with evaporation process 6 and the ro permeate cannot be considered as pure water 11 the production of process water requires a supplemental ro process known as polishing previous work showed that the step at which ro is performed in a process flow chart may affect the plant efficiency 13 for instance in milk protein concentrate mpc manufacturing plants the ro process is traditionally performed prior to the evaporation process after concentration by ultrafiltration uf 4 9 during uf molecular weight cut off of 10 kda milk proteins are mostly concentrated in a retentate 14 a low proportion of milk proteins are also transmitted in the permeate but uf permeate is mainly composed of lactose and minerals 14 uf permeate has a poor technological value in dairy technology and is generated in very large amount 523 106 tons of uf permeate powder in 2019 in usa 15 performing ro at the entry gate of the plant prior to uf could reduce the volume of fluids to be pumped into the plant by reducing the volume of milk to be ultrafiltered and thus the volume of uf permeate by product needing treatment later 13 consequently although ro offers better performance with more dilute fluids process water cheese whey uf permeate cleaning solutions using it on fluids with a higher ts content such as milk at the beginning of the process flow may improve the efficiency of the manufacturing plant such a strategy is appealing for the cheese manufacturing sector since it could reduce the large volume of liquid by products generated by the cheesemaking process indeed less than 12 w w 1 of milk is converted to cheese 16 leaving behind up to 88 of the initial milk as diluted by products such as milk uf permeate generated at the milk standardization step and cheese whey expelled from the cheese curd during the manufacturing process typically the total solids ts content of milk uf permeate and cheese whey is approximately 5 to 6 w w 1 and 6 to 7 5 w w 1 respectively 14 17 the major difference between these products is the higher protein content in whey around 1 w w 1 16 than in uf permeate 12 5 w w 1 vs 1 0 w w 1 on a dry basis 18 both fluids can be further processed into powders to manufacture dairy ingredients having a high lactose content that are used for flavor development caramelized aroma in baked goods 19 however their manufacture requires the most energy demanding processes performed in the dairy industry evaporation and spray drying 2 20 for example a six stage evaporator with thermocompression uses between 0 26 to 0 33 mj kg of water removed 7 8 compared to 0 014 to 0 036 mj kg of water removed using ro 21 22 in most plants around the world steam produced by natural gas fired boilers provides the energy to evaporators 4 evaporation thus generates large amounts of greenhouse gases 20 creating a major environmental impact 23 therefore processing scenarios that reduce the inlet flow rate of the evaporator have the potential to reduce a plant s environmental impact pre concentration of cheesemilk by ro reduces the volume of by product to be processed 24 this application of ro is still limited to low concentration factors e g 1 25 because ro concentration of cheesemilk increases lactose in the curd resulting in post acidification by starter cultures and flavor and texture defects in the cheese 25 nevertheless within these limits ro concentration can improve cheese yields and provide an opportunity to reclaim water in a cheese manufacturing plant 26 28 altogether the potential applications of ro in a cheese manufacturing plant are numerous and presumably not all as much efficient in terms of water and energy consumptions however to our knowledge no published study has assessed the impact of the processing step when ro is performed in the process flow chart e g at the beginning on milk or at the end on condensing waters of an industrial cheesemaking plant consequently this study assesses the impact of implementing ro systems and reclaiming water at different stages of the process flow on the water and energy consumption of the cheesemaking plant three scenarios were compared using predictive analysis performed in a virtual industrial cheddar cheesemaking plant these were differentiated by using ro on skim milk on by products whey and milk uf permeate or on condensing water generated from evaporators and dryers economic analysis focused on the operation of supplemental ro systems including prediction of capital capex and operational opex expenditures to compare the economic viability of the three scenarios 2 materials and methods the predictive analysis was performed based on the methodology described by chamberland et al 29 the boundary was gate to gate beginning with milk reception at the plant entry gate and finishing with the end of cheese maturation prior to expediting and bagging of by product powders exit gate fig 1 as in benoit et al 30 the chemical composition of the raw milk was 4 81 w w 1 lactose 3 97 w w 1 fat 3 27 w w 1 true protein tp and 0 75 w w 1 minerals the casein and whey proteins accounted for 78 3 and 21 7 of tp respectively the functional unit was the manufacture of one kg of cheddar cheese produced in a canadian plant operating 360 d per year and processing 1 500 103 kg of whole raw milk daily the chemical composition of cheddar cheese was 62 5 w w 1 total solids ts content 55 7 humidity in the non fat matter 52 3 fat in the dry matter and 4 4 salt to moisture ratio the outputs were cheddar cheese whey cream 50 7 w w 1 fat 31 cheese whey powder 15 0 w w 1 tp 0 57 w w 1 fat 75 4 w w 1 lactose uf permeate powder 3 7 w w 1 tp 0 fat 84 4 w w 1 lactose and reclaimed water the powders had a ts content of 96 w w 1 7 the discarded cleaning solutions and the minerals retained by the process water polishing in the ro retentate were mixed and treated as effluent renewal rate of cleaning solutions presented in appendix a the membrane filtration flux data used in this predictive analysis were obtained from experimental data generated at the pilot scale model 393 tetra pak filtration systems champlin mn for skim milk uf transmembrane pressure tmp 2 8 bar pressure drop δp 1 0 bar per membrane element whereas those for skim milk cheese whey and uf permeate ro were interpolated from data obtained from the literature 6 13 permeate fluxes for uf of ro retentate were determined from the data generated for skim milk uf but were extrapolated depending of the tp content of the retentate the characteristics of filtration systems and membranes are presented in supplemental materials appendix a tables a 1 and a 2 2 1 water reclamation scenarios the three scenarios have a similar process flow charts fig 1 but are differentiated by the use of ro to generate process water at different stages in the manufacturing process in scenario a baseline scenario process water is only reclaimed from vapor condensates of evaporators and spray dryers used to make whey and uf permeate powders scenario b reclaims water from vapor condensates and by products namely cheese whey and uf permeate scenario c is similar to scenario b with the addition of ro of the skim milk prior to uf at the cheesemilk standardization step the ro permeates generated from the concentration of skim milk cheese whey or uf permeate are polished with the same ro system polisher used to reclaim water from vapor condensates by uv treating the ro permeate it is assumed that the process water meets the guidelines for canadian drinking water quality 32 and it is used for cleaning purposes in the virtual plant 2 2 description of processing parameters for the predictive analysis the virtual plant was divided into five sections milk reception and standardization cheesemaking whey processing uf permeate processing and water recovery the main processing parameters of each section are presented below but more detailed assumptions can be found in the supplemental materials appendix a 2 2 1 milk reception and standardization section whole raw milk received at the plant at 4 c is stored for a mean duration of 20 h with the same agitation parameters defined previously by chamberland et al 2019 three streams namely whole milk uf retentate and cream are blended to standardize the cheesemilk 4 00 w w 1 tp 4 87 w w 1 fat and 4 77 w w 1 lactose the casein to fat ratio is 0 64 protein to fat is 0 82 uf retentate and cream are generated from a fraction of whole milk the proportions of whole milk milk uf retentate and cream are determined by solving a system of equations in three variables a fraction of the whole milk 69 is pumped directly into the standardization silos the other fraction 31 is skimmed 4 c 24 944 kg h 1 to generate the cream 40 0 w w 1 of fat and skim milk used to make the uf retentate the skim milk is pasteurized 72 c for 15 s and concentrated in a multi stage uf system at 15 c to a mass concentration factor mcf of 3 with 10 kda spiral wound membranes continuous process during 20 h to simplify the analysis the permeation flux was assumed constant although this does not reflect the industrial reality the protein rejection coefficient is 0 99 33 the assembled cheesemilk is finally pasteurized at 72 c for 15 s 64 231 kg h 1 cooled to 32 c in the heat regeneration section of the pasteurizer and directed to horizontal cheese vats in the cheesemaking section of the plant scenario c differed from scenarios a and b in the preconcentration of milk by ro prior to uf the ro process is performed at 40 bar with δp of 0 7 bar per membrane element 34 unlike uf ro concentrates all milk solids including lactose to avoid further postacidification in cheese during ripening a diafiltration df step performed with uf membranes using 0 1 diavolume dv is done following uf to generate cheesemilks with the same chemical composition in all scenarios the permeation flux during df was considered identical to those determined at last stage of the preceding uf because this assumption does not reflect perfectly what is observed in industrial filtration systems a sensibility analysis was conducted however increasing permeate flux by 25 during df had only a minor effect on the results data not shown 2 2 2 cheesemaking section the cheese curd is made in eight 30 000 l horizontal vats vat specifications were obtained from the publicly available tetra pak documentation 35 a warm 30 min maturation and coagulation is followed by a 2 h cooking process temperature increase of 0 3 c min 1 and final temperature of 39 c 4 35 as generally performed in an industrial plant vats are used for three to four cycles daily and rinsed for 10 min between each batch following whey draining the curd is acidified in a cheddaring machine the composition of cheese whey was predicted based on protein and fat retention of 77 11 and 90 95 respectively as obtained by guinee et al 16 for the manufacture of cheddar cheese with a cheesemilk standardized with skim milk uf retentate to a final protein content of 4 0 w w 1 2 2 3 cheese whey processing section immediately after draining cheese whey is clarified and skimmed to remove cheese fines and cream respectively it was assumed that the cheese fines are reintroduced in the cheese curd the clarified skim whey is heated to 79 c for 20 sec to reduce its mineral content and improve the performance of further concentration processes 36 in scenarios b and c whey is cooled to 30 c following heat treatment 6 and concentrated by ro to a ts content of 20 w w 1 4 the ro process is conducted at a tmp of 40 bar and δp of 0 7 bar per membrane element see membrane characteristics in supplemental materials table a 2 34 as suggested by schuck et al 7 the evaporation process is performed in a six stage evaporator to a ts content of 60 w w 1 in the three scenarios it is assumed that the inlet temperature of the whey in the evaporator is 70 c and that of the condensing water is 45 c 37 prior to the drying process the concentrated whey is cooled to 30 c for lactose crystallization which is essential to reduce the hygroscopicity of the resulting powder 4 7 38 2 2 4 ultrafiltration permeate processing section the uf permeate powder is generated with a process similar to that used for the manufacture of whey powder with the following differences in scenarios b and c uf permeate is concentrated at 15 c by ro with the same operating parameters than for whey ro to reach a ts content of 22 w w 1 4 as for whey processing the native uf permeate scenario a or uf permeate concentrated by ro scenarios b and c is heated at 70 c prior to evaporation to a final ts content of 62 w w 1 7 2 2 5 water recovery section the process water obtained from vapor condensates or ro permeates is pooled and cooled to 25 c it is polished by ro to a mass reduction ratio mrr of 4 with a mean permeation flux of 30 kg m 2 h 1 at a tmp of 20 bar with a δp of 0 7 bar per membrane element processing parameters obtained from the industry and the ro permeate is uv treated 2 3 prediction of electricity natural gas and water uses water natural gas and electrical energy use was estimated according to the methodology presented previously 29 water use mainly for cleaning was estimated individually for each piece of processing equipment two estimation methods were used depending on whether the equipment to be cleaned was purposely filled pipes plate heat exchangers phe filtration system or not silos spray dryers for example the amount of water used to rinse purposely filled equipment was three times the inner volume most conservative value used by chamberland et al 29 whereas a value of 12 7 l m 2 min 1 39 was used for equipment with open surfaces e g silos spray dryers the volumes of cleaning solutions were lower equivalent to 1 2 time the inner volume of purposely filled equipment because these were recirculated renewal rates of cleaning solution affected the water use to generate them appendix a table a 4 the cleaning protocols and the duration of each clean in place cip step are presented in supplemental materials appendix a table a 3 each processing equipment was cleaned once a day the water use estimate did not include boiler blowdown or renewal of cooling water in the cooling tower because this study focused on the differences between the scenarios and it was assumed that these processes used a similar amount of water in the three scenarios since they were predicted in the same plant however the mass of water 12 c used to generate the steam 150 c 500 kpa feeding the evaporator was considered in the mass and water balances the electrical energy consumption was calculated according to pumping and cooling needs for pumping the pipes of the virtual plant were designed so that all the fluids had a tangential velocity 2 5 m s 1 for each unitary operation the length of the pipes was calculated based on the height of the tank or silo where the fluid is pumped for the next step plus a mean pipe length of 10 m the hydraulic pressure of the feed was considered downstream and upstream of each pump balance tanks were dimensioned to handle the exiting fluid of each piece of equipment over 1 5 h 4 charge loss components were calculated as in the predictive analysis conducted by chamberland et al 29 as well as dimensioning of phe and heating energy 2 4 economic analysis the economic analysis focused on the costs expected to move from the baseline scenario a to scenario b and from a to c the difference between the capex of scenario a capexa and those associated with other scenarios was calculated as follows 1 capex capex x capex a where capexx represents the capex of the other scenario being compared e g b or c the capex only included the costs of ro systems generating process water from dairy fluids cheese whey and uf permeate in scenarios b and c and skim milk in scenario c and the costs of polishing ro permeates process water and vapor condensates from evaporators and dryers they were calculated using the following assumptions ro system costs of 400 ca m 2 industrial value interest rate of 7 an amortization period of 15 years 37 the daily savings δopex between the scenarios corresponded to the difference between their daily opex equation 2 which included the membrane replacement costs and costs associated with the treatment of effluents the consumption of natural resources water natural gas and electrical energy prices for each opex component are presented above table 5 2 δopex opex x opex a where opexa represents the opex of scenario a and opexx represents those for the scenario being compared e g b or c based on the daily savings for 360 d of production a pay back time pbt was estimated as follows equation 3 3 pbt capex 360 opex it was assumed that the virtual plant is sufficiently large to integrate the new ro systems suggested in scenarios b and c meaning that plant expansion or land acquisition was not required 2 5 sensibility analysis finally a sensibility analysis was performed to determine a possible advantage of reclaiming water from skim milk without considering the lactose content of the cheesemilk three scenarios based on scenario c were compared in scenario c 1 the df step lactose standardization with uf membrane was removed to reduce water consumption of scenario c and the same ro and uf sequences were performed mcf of 1 25 and 2 40 respectively in scenario c 2 and c 3 skim milk was concentrated by ro at a higher mcf 1 5 and 2 0 respectively to increase the process water recovered from milk a tp content target of 10 0 0 4 w w 1 was applied in all the scenarios consequently the mcf of the uf sequence was lowered in scenarios c 2 and c 3 1 97 and 1 43 respectively 3 results 3 1 mass balances and water utilization the three water reclamation scenarios yielded the same dairy products table 1 they processed the same amount of whole milk 1 500 103 kg and generated cheesemilks with the same chemical composition this resulted in the manufacture of the same amount of cheddar cheese 168 746 kg whey cream 9 627 kg and whey and uf permeate powders 71 815 and 16 055 kg respectively the main difference between the mass balances of the scenarios was related to the use of water to perform the df in scenario c for the lactose standardization of the ro retentate with uf membranes and feed boilers that generated vapor for evaporation processes the df increased water consumption in scenario c by 33 m3 tables 1 and 2 but part of it 25 m3 was converted to process water following ro of the resulting df permeate scenario a used more boiler feed water 292 m3 than scenarios b and c 154 m3 because whey and uf permeate whey were evaporated without ro preconcentration in scenario a scenarios b and c generated lower amounts of vapor condensates which led to lower amounts of process water to polish and less water to be reclaimed in scenarios b 1 043 m3 and c 1 068 m3 compared to scenario a 1 147 m3 all water reclaimed was reused in the plant to make cleaning solutions 80 to 89 of the water utilization or feed boilers dedicated to evaporators no scenario was self sufficient in water but scenario a required less external input of water 313 m2 than scenarios b 338 m3 and c 363 m3 table 2 this is in line with the greater use of cleaning chemicals in scenarios b and c table 1 and the higher ro membrane surface area to clean in these scenarios 1 456 m2 and 2 116 m2 in scenarios b and c respectively appendix a table a 1 3 2 energy demand as described above the use of ro in scenarios b and c increased the water demand compared to the baseline scenario but contributed significantly to lowering electrical and heating energy demands indeed the reduced need for vapor during the evaporation processes in these scenarios resulted in less natural gas consumption table 3 together the whey and uf permeate processing facilities used 27 175 m3 of natural gas 68 of total consumption in scenario a the preconcentration of whey and uf permeate by ro in scenarios b and c reduced the natural gas consumption of whey and uf permeate processing facilities by 50 other processing steps used similar volumes of natural gas in all the scenarios the demand for electrical energy mainly used for pumping or cooling operations was lowest for scenario b 0 270 kw h kg of cheese 1 and highest for scenario a 0 319 kw h kg of cheese 1 table 4 the implementation of ro in scenarios b and c increased pumping needs i e 2 621 kw h for the preconcentration of whey but also affected cooling needs for example whey had to be cooled after heat treatment 79 c to perform ro at 30 c most of the thermal energy of heated whey was transferred to unheated whey 39 c in the heat regeneration section of the phe but cooling energy 4 558 kw h had to be used to complete the cooling operation in scenarios b and c the recovery of process water by ro in scenarios b and c 15 30 c reduced the cooling needs for process water by half prior to polishing compared to scenario a in which all the process water was recovered from vapor condensates 45 c combining electrical and heating energies scenarios a b and c used 1 72 106 mj 1 14 106 mj and 1 15 106 mj 3 3 capital expenditures and daily savings associated with ro expansions in scenarios b and c an economic analysis of ro implementation in scenarios b and c was conducted by calculating δcapex and δopex directly associated with supplemental ro processes the results presented in table 5 show the increases or reductions of expenditures in scenarios b and c compared to those of scenario a scenario c with a higher membrane surface area had the highest δcapex the most important reduction in the δopex was found for natural gas daily savings of 1 360 ca and 1 356 ca in scenarios b and c respectively operating supplemental ro systems increased the human resources needs with increases of 434 and 869 ca in scenarios b and c respectively overall the implementation of new ro systems could allow an opex reduction of 1 169 ca and 495 ca in scenarios b and c respectively considering the δcapex and the interest rate assumed 7 the pay back time would be 3 19 and 8 48 years for scenarios b and c respectively in denmark where the costs of natural resources are significantly higher water 10 18 ca m 3 electricity 0 38 ca kwh 1 natural gas 0 13 ca m 3 effluent treatment 1 94 ca m 3 40 dairy operator salary 30 45 ca h 1 if 1 dkk 0 1939 ca pay back of scenarios b and c would be 0 90 and 1 36 years data not presented 3 4 assessing the impact of removing df in scenario c finally a sensibility analysis was performed to determine if increasing the lactose content in the cheesemilk in scenario c by removing the df step or changing the concentration strategy increasing mcf of the ro step and decreasing that of the uf step would affect the plant efficiency it affected the cheese yield at unmolding 0 02 to 0 07 w w 1 table 6 as more lactose was retained in the curd of scenarios c 1 c 2 and c 3 compared to c reduced uf permeate powder production 13 to 55 was predicted when increasing the mcf of the ro step from c 1 to c 3 however it increased the amount of whey to be processed 3 to 11 for this reason the energy used in by product processing facilities was almost identical in all scenarios of the sensibility analysis the higher mcf of the ro steps increased the ro membrane surface area but removing the df and reducing the uf mcf reduced that dedicated to uf this led to δopex and payback time reductions for scenarios c 1 and c 2 compared to scenario c but disadvantaged the c 3 scenario 4 discussion the main objective of this work was to compare three water reclamation scenarios in a virtual industrial cheddar cheesemaking plant using predictive analysis to determine if performing ro sooner in the process flow chart could improve the efficiency of the plant because all the scenarios led to the same useful outputs except low differences on the volumes of reclaimed water the efficiency comparison was based on water and energy consumption the estimates provided by this predictive analysis are not as accurate as direct measurements in industrial plants although the predicted water and energy consumptions were in the range of published data 2 3 41 assumptions must be made in this type of study but if they do not reflect perfectly industrial reality at least scenarios are compared on the same basis which provides trends facilitating further industrial developments what the predictive analysis offered was an interesting opportunity to detect where ro should be implemented to improve plant efficiency reclaiming water only at the end of the process flow chart scenario a allowed for a larger volume of reclaimed water but did not necessarily translate into better plant efficiency since scenario a was the most energy demanding conversely based on the conditions tested reclaiming water from skim milk at the entry gate of the plant scenario c was the most complex and definitely more expensive than water reclamation from by products scenario b finally by products whey and uf permeate appeared to be the best dairy fluid source for generating water notably because their preconcentration by ro could decrease the opex of the plant and its energy use by more than 32 despite requiring more external water input 8 and 16 in scenarios b and c respectively than the baseline scenario 4 1 reducing the environmental impact by reducing natural gas consumption one of the best strategies for reducing the environmental impact of a manufacturing plant is to improve the energy efficiency of processing equipment 23 the implementation of ro for by product preconcentration successfully reduced natural gas consumption by 36 and total energy both thermal and electrical by more than 32 in scenarios b and c compared to scenario a indeed the supplemental ro systems in scenarios b and c also generated supplemental wastewater from cleaning solutions 5 and 7 in scenarios b and c respectively however since waste treatment has a very low impact in cheese production compared to the other activities of the plant 23 the addition of supplemental ro systems in scenarios b and c is not expected to significantly increase the environmental impact of ro implementation a complete life cycle analysis is needed for confirmation 4 2 prioritizing the simplest cheesemilk standardization step despite the similar energy consumption of scenarios b and c 0 4 in scenario c scenario b should be prioritized according to the conditions tested as mentioned previously regardless of the longer payback time which was very close to the amortization time scenario c had the most complex cheesemilk standardization step involving ro uf and df processes whereas only a uf process was performed in scenario b in scenario c ro was suggested for cheesemilk standardization to reduce the pressure on by product processing facilities actually uf or microfiltration is normally used for this purpose because unlike ro it increases the protein lactose ratio of the retentate theoretical lactose rejection coefficient of zero 42 thus reducing the risk of potential acidification defects in cheese during ripening however it generates uf permeate requiring considerable energy input to be processed tables 3 and 4 in the predictive analysis the use of ro on skim milk scenario c effectively reduced the amount of uf permeate generated during uf however as the ro uf retentate had a higher lactose content than the cheesemilks of scenarios a and b a df was necessary to generate cheesemilks with an identical or very similar chemical composition in the three scenarios by doing so approximately the same volume of permeate combined uf and df permeates had to be treated in the three scenarios a potential solution to simplify the scenario c could be the use of nanofiltration nf instead of ro for the preconcentration of skim milk using less energy it could also slightly reduce the lactose content of the retentate depending on the membrane type and possibly makes unnecessary the df process thus improving the water balance of the plant in this study ro was preferred because it generates a permeate with a better quality than nf with dairy fluids 11 12 which facilitates reutilization in the plant future work is however necessary to determine if nf with its advantages 43 could increase the process water reclamation 4 3 preconcentrating cheesemilk by ro might not reduce the pressure on by product facilities when making cheese most of the initial lactose content of the milk approximately 98 44 must be expelled from the curd to avoid post production taste and texture defects however because it could contribute to cheese yields the cheesemaker would have an interest in retaining a higher amount of lactose in cheese 26 prior to developing technologies that could resolve issues related to excessive lactose content in cheese a sensibility analysis was conducted to determine more precisely the possible advantages of retaining more lactose in the cheese as described previously different variants of scenario c were compared even if these scenarios were not completely realistic because their lactose to protein ratios were higher than recommended 25 45 the initial hypothesis that ro could reduce the pressure on by product processing was not valid as almost the same energy was used in the scenarios of the sensibility analysis furthermore the sensibility analysis did not identify a scenario with a lower payback time than scenario b and scenario c 3 even had a pay back time longer than the amortization time however as more cheese and whey powder mean price of 824 us in 2019 46 and less uf permeate powder mean price of 709 us for lactose powder in 2019 46 were manufactured in scenarios c 1 to c 3 it could be interesting from an industrial point of view to assess whether the economic gain obtained from this product output could be worthwhile despite the superior δcapex and inferior operational daily savings of these scenarios in that case assuming no taste or functionality defects in these scenarios it would be necessary to quantify the increase in cheese yield resulting from the extra lactose content retained in the aqueous phase of the cheese indeed lactose contributes to manufacturing yields at unmolding but metabolites generated from lactose by ripening microorganisms might not contribute at the same level as mentioned lactose is recognized as a dairy constituent to be removed from the cheese to avoid quality defects for example moynihan et al 25 improved the functionality of fat reduced mozzarella cheese during storage by reducing the lactose content or lactose to casein ratio of the cheesemilk shakeel ur rehman 47 manufactured cheddar cheese at different lactose levels demonstrating that increasing the lactose content led to a greater drop in ph during ripening compared to the control however it was not necessarily detrimental to cheese quality after 120 days of ripening the lactose content of the cheesemilk 8 4 w w 1 was greater than what was predicted in this work 5 4 w w 1 in the scenario c 3 consequently future experimental work to determine the optimal lactose content of concentrated cheesemilk is definitely of great interest to draw a final conclusion or pave the way for using ro in cheese technology 5 conclusions this predictive analysis did not support the hypothesis that the use of ro at the entry gate of an industrial cheddar cheesemaking plant would improve the efficiency of the plant rather it revealed that the most efficient way to reclaim water within dairy processes is by preconcentrating fluids to be evaporated which does not necessarily improve the water balance of the plant but drastically reduces its energy consumption this is not to say that ro should be avoided for cheesemilk standardization but to enable it would need clear evidence of yield enhancement due to lactose following ripening as well as new technology allowing greater lactose retention in cheese without generating ripening defects declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13829,reverse osmosis ro is essential for dairy processors to reduce their water input and the energy dedicated to dewatering processes such as evaporation indeed water can be reclaimed by ro from numerous dairy fluids e g milk cheese whey uf permeates condensing water but these applications may have different effects on plant efficiency in terms of water and energy use consequently this study uses predictive analysis to evaluate the impact of performing ro at different steps in the process flow chart of an industrial cheesemaking plant the hypothesis that preconcentrating milk by ro at the entry gate of the plant on skim milk would reduce the volume of by products to be processed and the resources used was not valid instead the most efficient way to reduce the amount of resources consumed was to perform ro on the cheese whey and milk uf permeate prior evaporation preconcentrating these by products to a total solids content of 20 and 22 respectively reduced the entire natural gas consumption by 36 and the electricity consumption by 10 compared to a scenario where only condensing water was reclaimed keywords water reuse membrane filtration efficiency assessment economic assessment dairy processing cheese 1 introduction dairy processing is one of the most water demanding industries in the food sector 1 for example cheese manufacture in european dairies may require up to 3 7 l of water per l of milk processed 2 3 reverse osmosis ro is currently the most efficient method for reclaiming water from dairy fluids which are mainly composed of water e g 87 w w 1 for whole milk 4 according to the efficiency definition of benoit et al 5 the ratio of the useful output i e water to the total input i e operational costs energy of the ro process is higher than that of other dewatering processes such as evaporation integrating ro into dairy processing thus offers opportunities to improve the water balance in dairy plants and to reduce their energy consumption 6 in fact ro uses only 10 of the energy used by a traditional industrial evaporator with thermocompression 7 8 for these reasons ro is currently used to reduce the volume of dairy fluids milk cheese whey permeate to be evaporated 6 9 or to polish vapor condensates obtained from evaporators and dryers 1 in addition ro could also be used in a filtration cascade process to restore cleaning solutions 10 recover diluted dairy solids in diluted rinse water 11 or reduce the volume of dairy plant effluent 1 12 indeed ro technology also has its disadvantages it does not allow to obtain a degree of concentration as high as with evaporation process 6 and the ro permeate cannot be considered as pure water 11 the production of process water requires a supplemental ro process known as polishing previous work showed that the step at which ro is performed in a process flow chart may affect the plant efficiency 13 for instance in milk protein concentrate mpc manufacturing plants the ro process is traditionally performed prior to the evaporation process after concentration by ultrafiltration uf 4 9 during uf molecular weight cut off of 10 kda milk proteins are mostly concentrated in a retentate 14 a low proportion of milk proteins are also transmitted in the permeate but uf permeate is mainly composed of lactose and minerals 14 uf permeate has a poor technological value in dairy technology and is generated in very large amount 523 106 tons of uf permeate powder in 2019 in usa 15 performing ro at the entry gate of the plant prior to uf could reduce the volume of fluids to be pumped into the plant by reducing the volume of milk to be ultrafiltered and thus the volume of uf permeate by product needing treatment later 13 consequently although ro offers better performance with more dilute fluids process water cheese whey uf permeate cleaning solutions using it on fluids with a higher ts content such as milk at the beginning of the process flow may improve the efficiency of the manufacturing plant such a strategy is appealing for the cheese manufacturing sector since it could reduce the large volume of liquid by products generated by the cheesemaking process indeed less than 12 w w 1 of milk is converted to cheese 16 leaving behind up to 88 of the initial milk as diluted by products such as milk uf permeate generated at the milk standardization step and cheese whey expelled from the cheese curd during the manufacturing process typically the total solids ts content of milk uf permeate and cheese whey is approximately 5 to 6 w w 1 and 6 to 7 5 w w 1 respectively 14 17 the major difference between these products is the higher protein content in whey around 1 w w 1 16 than in uf permeate 12 5 w w 1 vs 1 0 w w 1 on a dry basis 18 both fluids can be further processed into powders to manufacture dairy ingredients having a high lactose content that are used for flavor development caramelized aroma in baked goods 19 however their manufacture requires the most energy demanding processes performed in the dairy industry evaporation and spray drying 2 20 for example a six stage evaporator with thermocompression uses between 0 26 to 0 33 mj kg of water removed 7 8 compared to 0 014 to 0 036 mj kg of water removed using ro 21 22 in most plants around the world steam produced by natural gas fired boilers provides the energy to evaporators 4 evaporation thus generates large amounts of greenhouse gases 20 creating a major environmental impact 23 therefore processing scenarios that reduce the inlet flow rate of the evaporator have the potential to reduce a plant s environmental impact pre concentration of cheesemilk by ro reduces the volume of by product to be processed 24 this application of ro is still limited to low concentration factors e g 1 25 because ro concentration of cheesemilk increases lactose in the curd resulting in post acidification by starter cultures and flavor and texture defects in the cheese 25 nevertheless within these limits ro concentration can improve cheese yields and provide an opportunity to reclaim water in a cheese manufacturing plant 26 28 altogether the potential applications of ro in a cheese manufacturing plant are numerous and presumably not all as much efficient in terms of water and energy consumptions however to our knowledge no published study has assessed the impact of the processing step when ro is performed in the process flow chart e g at the beginning on milk or at the end on condensing waters of an industrial cheesemaking plant consequently this study assesses the impact of implementing ro systems and reclaiming water at different stages of the process flow on the water and energy consumption of the cheesemaking plant three scenarios were compared using predictive analysis performed in a virtual industrial cheddar cheesemaking plant these were differentiated by using ro on skim milk on by products whey and milk uf permeate or on condensing water generated from evaporators and dryers economic analysis focused on the operation of supplemental ro systems including prediction of capital capex and operational opex expenditures to compare the economic viability of the three scenarios 2 materials and methods the predictive analysis was performed based on the methodology described by chamberland et al 29 the boundary was gate to gate beginning with milk reception at the plant entry gate and finishing with the end of cheese maturation prior to expediting and bagging of by product powders exit gate fig 1 as in benoit et al 30 the chemical composition of the raw milk was 4 81 w w 1 lactose 3 97 w w 1 fat 3 27 w w 1 true protein tp and 0 75 w w 1 minerals the casein and whey proteins accounted for 78 3 and 21 7 of tp respectively the functional unit was the manufacture of one kg of cheddar cheese produced in a canadian plant operating 360 d per year and processing 1 500 103 kg of whole raw milk daily the chemical composition of cheddar cheese was 62 5 w w 1 total solids ts content 55 7 humidity in the non fat matter 52 3 fat in the dry matter and 4 4 salt to moisture ratio the outputs were cheddar cheese whey cream 50 7 w w 1 fat 31 cheese whey powder 15 0 w w 1 tp 0 57 w w 1 fat 75 4 w w 1 lactose uf permeate powder 3 7 w w 1 tp 0 fat 84 4 w w 1 lactose and reclaimed water the powders had a ts content of 96 w w 1 7 the discarded cleaning solutions and the minerals retained by the process water polishing in the ro retentate were mixed and treated as effluent renewal rate of cleaning solutions presented in appendix a the membrane filtration flux data used in this predictive analysis were obtained from experimental data generated at the pilot scale model 393 tetra pak filtration systems champlin mn for skim milk uf transmembrane pressure tmp 2 8 bar pressure drop δp 1 0 bar per membrane element whereas those for skim milk cheese whey and uf permeate ro were interpolated from data obtained from the literature 6 13 permeate fluxes for uf of ro retentate were determined from the data generated for skim milk uf but were extrapolated depending of the tp content of the retentate the characteristics of filtration systems and membranes are presented in supplemental materials appendix a tables a 1 and a 2 2 1 water reclamation scenarios the three scenarios have a similar process flow charts fig 1 but are differentiated by the use of ro to generate process water at different stages in the manufacturing process in scenario a baseline scenario process water is only reclaimed from vapor condensates of evaporators and spray dryers used to make whey and uf permeate powders scenario b reclaims water from vapor condensates and by products namely cheese whey and uf permeate scenario c is similar to scenario b with the addition of ro of the skim milk prior to uf at the cheesemilk standardization step the ro permeates generated from the concentration of skim milk cheese whey or uf permeate are polished with the same ro system polisher used to reclaim water from vapor condensates by uv treating the ro permeate it is assumed that the process water meets the guidelines for canadian drinking water quality 32 and it is used for cleaning purposes in the virtual plant 2 2 description of processing parameters for the predictive analysis the virtual plant was divided into five sections milk reception and standardization cheesemaking whey processing uf permeate processing and water recovery the main processing parameters of each section are presented below but more detailed assumptions can be found in the supplemental materials appendix a 2 2 1 milk reception and standardization section whole raw milk received at the plant at 4 c is stored for a mean duration of 20 h with the same agitation parameters defined previously by chamberland et al 2019 three streams namely whole milk uf retentate and cream are blended to standardize the cheesemilk 4 00 w w 1 tp 4 87 w w 1 fat and 4 77 w w 1 lactose the casein to fat ratio is 0 64 protein to fat is 0 82 uf retentate and cream are generated from a fraction of whole milk the proportions of whole milk milk uf retentate and cream are determined by solving a system of equations in three variables a fraction of the whole milk 69 is pumped directly into the standardization silos the other fraction 31 is skimmed 4 c 24 944 kg h 1 to generate the cream 40 0 w w 1 of fat and skim milk used to make the uf retentate the skim milk is pasteurized 72 c for 15 s and concentrated in a multi stage uf system at 15 c to a mass concentration factor mcf of 3 with 10 kda spiral wound membranes continuous process during 20 h to simplify the analysis the permeation flux was assumed constant although this does not reflect the industrial reality the protein rejection coefficient is 0 99 33 the assembled cheesemilk is finally pasteurized at 72 c for 15 s 64 231 kg h 1 cooled to 32 c in the heat regeneration section of the pasteurizer and directed to horizontal cheese vats in the cheesemaking section of the plant scenario c differed from scenarios a and b in the preconcentration of milk by ro prior to uf the ro process is performed at 40 bar with δp of 0 7 bar per membrane element 34 unlike uf ro concentrates all milk solids including lactose to avoid further postacidification in cheese during ripening a diafiltration df step performed with uf membranes using 0 1 diavolume dv is done following uf to generate cheesemilks with the same chemical composition in all scenarios the permeation flux during df was considered identical to those determined at last stage of the preceding uf because this assumption does not reflect perfectly what is observed in industrial filtration systems a sensibility analysis was conducted however increasing permeate flux by 25 during df had only a minor effect on the results data not shown 2 2 2 cheesemaking section the cheese curd is made in eight 30 000 l horizontal vats vat specifications were obtained from the publicly available tetra pak documentation 35 a warm 30 min maturation and coagulation is followed by a 2 h cooking process temperature increase of 0 3 c min 1 and final temperature of 39 c 4 35 as generally performed in an industrial plant vats are used for three to four cycles daily and rinsed for 10 min between each batch following whey draining the curd is acidified in a cheddaring machine the composition of cheese whey was predicted based on protein and fat retention of 77 11 and 90 95 respectively as obtained by guinee et al 16 for the manufacture of cheddar cheese with a cheesemilk standardized with skim milk uf retentate to a final protein content of 4 0 w w 1 2 2 3 cheese whey processing section immediately after draining cheese whey is clarified and skimmed to remove cheese fines and cream respectively it was assumed that the cheese fines are reintroduced in the cheese curd the clarified skim whey is heated to 79 c for 20 sec to reduce its mineral content and improve the performance of further concentration processes 36 in scenarios b and c whey is cooled to 30 c following heat treatment 6 and concentrated by ro to a ts content of 20 w w 1 4 the ro process is conducted at a tmp of 40 bar and δp of 0 7 bar per membrane element see membrane characteristics in supplemental materials table a 2 34 as suggested by schuck et al 7 the evaporation process is performed in a six stage evaporator to a ts content of 60 w w 1 in the three scenarios it is assumed that the inlet temperature of the whey in the evaporator is 70 c and that of the condensing water is 45 c 37 prior to the drying process the concentrated whey is cooled to 30 c for lactose crystallization which is essential to reduce the hygroscopicity of the resulting powder 4 7 38 2 2 4 ultrafiltration permeate processing section the uf permeate powder is generated with a process similar to that used for the manufacture of whey powder with the following differences in scenarios b and c uf permeate is concentrated at 15 c by ro with the same operating parameters than for whey ro to reach a ts content of 22 w w 1 4 as for whey processing the native uf permeate scenario a or uf permeate concentrated by ro scenarios b and c is heated at 70 c prior to evaporation to a final ts content of 62 w w 1 7 2 2 5 water recovery section the process water obtained from vapor condensates or ro permeates is pooled and cooled to 25 c it is polished by ro to a mass reduction ratio mrr of 4 with a mean permeation flux of 30 kg m 2 h 1 at a tmp of 20 bar with a δp of 0 7 bar per membrane element processing parameters obtained from the industry and the ro permeate is uv treated 2 3 prediction of electricity natural gas and water uses water natural gas and electrical energy use was estimated according to the methodology presented previously 29 water use mainly for cleaning was estimated individually for each piece of processing equipment two estimation methods were used depending on whether the equipment to be cleaned was purposely filled pipes plate heat exchangers phe filtration system or not silos spray dryers for example the amount of water used to rinse purposely filled equipment was three times the inner volume most conservative value used by chamberland et al 29 whereas a value of 12 7 l m 2 min 1 39 was used for equipment with open surfaces e g silos spray dryers the volumes of cleaning solutions were lower equivalent to 1 2 time the inner volume of purposely filled equipment because these were recirculated renewal rates of cleaning solution affected the water use to generate them appendix a table a 4 the cleaning protocols and the duration of each clean in place cip step are presented in supplemental materials appendix a table a 3 each processing equipment was cleaned once a day the water use estimate did not include boiler blowdown or renewal of cooling water in the cooling tower because this study focused on the differences between the scenarios and it was assumed that these processes used a similar amount of water in the three scenarios since they were predicted in the same plant however the mass of water 12 c used to generate the steam 150 c 500 kpa feeding the evaporator was considered in the mass and water balances the electrical energy consumption was calculated according to pumping and cooling needs for pumping the pipes of the virtual plant were designed so that all the fluids had a tangential velocity 2 5 m s 1 for each unitary operation the length of the pipes was calculated based on the height of the tank or silo where the fluid is pumped for the next step plus a mean pipe length of 10 m the hydraulic pressure of the feed was considered downstream and upstream of each pump balance tanks were dimensioned to handle the exiting fluid of each piece of equipment over 1 5 h 4 charge loss components were calculated as in the predictive analysis conducted by chamberland et al 29 as well as dimensioning of phe and heating energy 2 4 economic analysis the economic analysis focused on the costs expected to move from the baseline scenario a to scenario b and from a to c the difference between the capex of scenario a capexa and those associated with other scenarios was calculated as follows 1 capex capex x capex a where capexx represents the capex of the other scenario being compared e g b or c the capex only included the costs of ro systems generating process water from dairy fluids cheese whey and uf permeate in scenarios b and c and skim milk in scenario c and the costs of polishing ro permeates process water and vapor condensates from evaporators and dryers they were calculated using the following assumptions ro system costs of 400 ca m 2 industrial value interest rate of 7 an amortization period of 15 years 37 the daily savings δopex between the scenarios corresponded to the difference between their daily opex equation 2 which included the membrane replacement costs and costs associated with the treatment of effluents the consumption of natural resources water natural gas and electrical energy prices for each opex component are presented above table 5 2 δopex opex x opex a where opexa represents the opex of scenario a and opexx represents those for the scenario being compared e g b or c based on the daily savings for 360 d of production a pay back time pbt was estimated as follows equation 3 3 pbt capex 360 opex it was assumed that the virtual plant is sufficiently large to integrate the new ro systems suggested in scenarios b and c meaning that plant expansion or land acquisition was not required 2 5 sensibility analysis finally a sensibility analysis was performed to determine a possible advantage of reclaiming water from skim milk without considering the lactose content of the cheesemilk three scenarios based on scenario c were compared in scenario c 1 the df step lactose standardization with uf membrane was removed to reduce water consumption of scenario c and the same ro and uf sequences were performed mcf of 1 25 and 2 40 respectively in scenario c 2 and c 3 skim milk was concentrated by ro at a higher mcf 1 5 and 2 0 respectively to increase the process water recovered from milk a tp content target of 10 0 0 4 w w 1 was applied in all the scenarios consequently the mcf of the uf sequence was lowered in scenarios c 2 and c 3 1 97 and 1 43 respectively 3 results 3 1 mass balances and water utilization the three water reclamation scenarios yielded the same dairy products table 1 they processed the same amount of whole milk 1 500 103 kg and generated cheesemilks with the same chemical composition this resulted in the manufacture of the same amount of cheddar cheese 168 746 kg whey cream 9 627 kg and whey and uf permeate powders 71 815 and 16 055 kg respectively the main difference between the mass balances of the scenarios was related to the use of water to perform the df in scenario c for the lactose standardization of the ro retentate with uf membranes and feed boilers that generated vapor for evaporation processes the df increased water consumption in scenario c by 33 m3 tables 1 and 2 but part of it 25 m3 was converted to process water following ro of the resulting df permeate scenario a used more boiler feed water 292 m3 than scenarios b and c 154 m3 because whey and uf permeate whey were evaporated without ro preconcentration in scenario a scenarios b and c generated lower amounts of vapor condensates which led to lower amounts of process water to polish and less water to be reclaimed in scenarios b 1 043 m3 and c 1 068 m3 compared to scenario a 1 147 m3 all water reclaimed was reused in the plant to make cleaning solutions 80 to 89 of the water utilization or feed boilers dedicated to evaporators no scenario was self sufficient in water but scenario a required less external input of water 313 m2 than scenarios b 338 m3 and c 363 m3 table 2 this is in line with the greater use of cleaning chemicals in scenarios b and c table 1 and the higher ro membrane surface area to clean in these scenarios 1 456 m2 and 2 116 m2 in scenarios b and c respectively appendix a table a 1 3 2 energy demand as described above the use of ro in scenarios b and c increased the water demand compared to the baseline scenario but contributed significantly to lowering electrical and heating energy demands indeed the reduced need for vapor during the evaporation processes in these scenarios resulted in less natural gas consumption table 3 together the whey and uf permeate processing facilities used 27 175 m3 of natural gas 68 of total consumption in scenario a the preconcentration of whey and uf permeate by ro in scenarios b and c reduced the natural gas consumption of whey and uf permeate processing facilities by 50 other processing steps used similar volumes of natural gas in all the scenarios the demand for electrical energy mainly used for pumping or cooling operations was lowest for scenario b 0 270 kw h kg of cheese 1 and highest for scenario a 0 319 kw h kg of cheese 1 table 4 the implementation of ro in scenarios b and c increased pumping needs i e 2 621 kw h for the preconcentration of whey but also affected cooling needs for example whey had to be cooled after heat treatment 79 c to perform ro at 30 c most of the thermal energy of heated whey was transferred to unheated whey 39 c in the heat regeneration section of the phe but cooling energy 4 558 kw h had to be used to complete the cooling operation in scenarios b and c the recovery of process water by ro in scenarios b and c 15 30 c reduced the cooling needs for process water by half prior to polishing compared to scenario a in which all the process water was recovered from vapor condensates 45 c combining electrical and heating energies scenarios a b and c used 1 72 106 mj 1 14 106 mj and 1 15 106 mj 3 3 capital expenditures and daily savings associated with ro expansions in scenarios b and c an economic analysis of ro implementation in scenarios b and c was conducted by calculating δcapex and δopex directly associated with supplemental ro processes the results presented in table 5 show the increases or reductions of expenditures in scenarios b and c compared to those of scenario a scenario c with a higher membrane surface area had the highest δcapex the most important reduction in the δopex was found for natural gas daily savings of 1 360 ca and 1 356 ca in scenarios b and c respectively operating supplemental ro systems increased the human resources needs with increases of 434 and 869 ca in scenarios b and c respectively overall the implementation of new ro systems could allow an opex reduction of 1 169 ca and 495 ca in scenarios b and c respectively considering the δcapex and the interest rate assumed 7 the pay back time would be 3 19 and 8 48 years for scenarios b and c respectively in denmark where the costs of natural resources are significantly higher water 10 18 ca m 3 electricity 0 38 ca kwh 1 natural gas 0 13 ca m 3 effluent treatment 1 94 ca m 3 40 dairy operator salary 30 45 ca h 1 if 1 dkk 0 1939 ca pay back of scenarios b and c would be 0 90 and 1 36 years data not presented 3 4 assessing the impact of removing df in scenario c finally a sensibility analysis was performed to determine if increasing the lactose content in the cheesemilk in scenario c by removing the df step or changing the concentration strategy increasing mcf of the ro step and decreasing that of the uf step would affect the plant efficiency it affected the cheese yield at unmolding 0 02 to 0 07 w w 1 table 6 as more lactose was retained in the curd of scenarios c 1 c 2 and c 3 compared to c reduced uf permeate powder production 13 to 55 was predicted when increasing the mcf of the ro step from c 1 to c 3 however it increased the amount of whey to be processed 3 to 11 for this reason the energy used in by product processing facilities was almost identical in all scenarios of the sensibility analysis the higher mcf of the ro steps increased the ro membrane surface area but removing the df and reducing the uf mcf reduced that dedicated to uf this led to δopex and payback time reductions for scenarios c 1 and c 2 compared to scenario c but disadvantaged the c 3 scenario 4 discussion the main objective of this work was to compare three water reclamation scenarios in a virtual industrial cheddar cheesemaking plant using predictive analysis to determine if performing ro sooner in the process flow chart could improve the efficiency of the plant because all the scenarios led to the same useful outputs except low differences on the volumes of reclaimed water the efficiency comparison was based on water and energy consumption the estimates provided by this predictive analysis are not as accurate as direct measurements in industrial plants although the predicted water and energy consumptions were in the range of published data 2 3 41 assumptions must be made in this type of study but if they do not reflect perfectly industrial reality at least scenarios are compared on the same basis which provides trends facilitating further industrial developments what the predictive analysis offered was an interesting opportunity to detect where ro should be implemented to improve plant efficiency reclaiming water only at the end of the process flow chart scenario a allowed for a larger volume of reclaimed water but did not necessarily translate into better plant efficiency since scenario a was the most energy demanding conversely based on the conditions tested reclaiming water from skim milk at the entry gate of the plant scenario c was the most complex and definitely more expensive than water reclamation from by products scenario b finally by products whey and uf permeate appeared to be the best dairy fluid source for generating water notably because their preconcentration by ro could decrease the opex of the plant and its energy use by more than 32 despite requiring more external water input 8 and 16 in scenarios b and c respectively than the baseline scenario 4 1 reducing the environmental impact by reducing natural gas consumption one of the best strategies for reducing the environmental impact of a manufacturing plant is to improve the energy efficiency of processing equipment 23 the implementation of ro for by product preconcentration successfully reduced natural gas consumption by 36 and total energy both thermal and electrical by more than 32 in scenarios b and c compared to scenario a indeed the supplemental ro systems in scenarios b and c also generated supplemental wastewater from cleaning solutions 5 and 7 in scenarios b and c respectively however since waste treatment has a very low impact in cheese production compared to the other activities of the plant 23 the addition of supplemental ro systems in scenarios b and c is not expected to significantly increase the environmental impact of ro implementation a complete life cycle analysis is needed for confirmation 4 2 prioritizing the simplest cheesemilk standardization step despite the similar energy consumption of scenarios b and c 0 4 in scenario c scenario b should be prioritized according to the conditions tested as mentioned previously regardless of the longer payback time which was very close to the amortization time scenario c had the most complex cheesemilk standardization step involving ro uf and df processes whereas only a uf process was performed in scenario b in scenario c ro was suggested for cheesemilk standardization to reduce the pressure on by product processing facilities actually uf or microfiltration is normally used for this purpose because unlike ro it increases the protein lactose ratio of the retentate theoretical lactose rejection coefficient of zero 42 thus reducing the risk of potential acidification defects in cheese during ripening however it generates uf permeate requiring considerable energy input to be processed tables 3 and 4 in the predictive analysis the use of ro on skim milk scenario c effectively reduced the amount of uf permeate generated during uf however as the ro uf retentate had a higher lactose content than the cheesemilks of scenarios a and b a df was necessary to generate cheesemilks with an identical or very similar chemical composition in the three scenarios by doing so approximately the same volume of permeate combined uf and df permeates had to be treated in the three scenarios a potential solution to simplify the scenario c could be the use of nanofiltration nf instead of ro for the preconcentration of skim milk using less energy it could also slightly reduce the lactose content of the retentate depending on the membrane type and possibly makes unnecessary the df process thus improving the water balance of the plant in this study ro was preferred because it generates a permeate with a better quality than nf with dairy fluids 11 12 which facilitates reutilization in the plant future work is however necessary to determine if nf with its advantages 43 could increase the process water reclamation 4 3 preconcentrating cheesemilk by ro might not reduce the pressure on by product facilities when making cheese most of the initial lactose content of the milk approximately 98 44 must be expelled from the curd to avoid post production taste and texture defects however because it could contribute to cheese yields the cheesemaker would have an interest in retaining a higher amount of lactose in cheese 26 prior to developing technologies that could resolve issues related to excessive lactose content in cheese a sensibility analysis was conducted to determine more precisely the possible advantages of retaining more lactose in the cheese as described previously different variants of scenario c were compared even if these scenarios were not completely realistic because their lactose to protein ratios were higher than recommended 25 45 the initial hypothesis that ro could reduce the pressure on by product processing was not valid as almost the same energy was used in the scenarios of the sensibility analysis furthermore the sensibility analysis did not identify a scenario with a lower payback time than scenario b and scenario c 3 even had a pay back time longer than the amortization time however as more cheese and whey powder mean price of 824 us in 2019 46 and less uf permeate powder mean price of 709 us for lactose powder in 2019 46 were manufactured in scenarios c 1 to c 3 it could be interesting from an industrial point of view to assess whether the economic gain obtained from this product output could be worthwhile despite the superior δcapex and inferior operational daily savings of these scenarios in that case assuming no taste or functionality defects in these scenarios it would be necessary to quantify the increase in cheese yield resulting from the extra lactose content retained in the aqueous phase of the cheese indeed lactose contributes to manufacturing yields at unmolding but metabolites generated from lactose by ripening microorganisms might not contribute at the same level as mentioned lactose is recognized as a dairy constituent to be removed from the cheese to avoid quality defects for example moynihan et al 25 improved the functionality of fat reduced mozzarella cheese during storage by reducing the lactose content or lactose to casein ratio of the cheesemilk shakeel ur rehman 47 manufactured cheddar cheese at different lactose levels demonstrating that increasing the lactose content led to a greater drop in ph during ripening compared to the control however it was not necessarily detrimental to cheese quality after 120 days of ripening the lactose content of the cheesemilk 8 4 w w 1 was greater than what was predicted in this work 5 4 w w 1 in the scenario c 3 consequently future experimental work to determine the optimal lactose content of concentrated cheesemilk is definitely of great interest to draw a final conclusion or pave the way for using ro in cheese technology 5 conclusions this predictive analysis did not support the hypothesis that the use of ro at the entry gate of an industrial cheddar cheesemaking plant would improve the efficiency of the plant rather it revealed that the most efficient way to reclaim water within dairy processes is by preconcentrating fluids to be evaporated which does not necessarily improve the water balance of the plant but drastically reduces its energy consumption this is not to say that ro should be avoided for cheesemilk standardization but to enable it would need clear evidence of yield enhancement due to lactose following ripening as well as new technology allowing greater lactose retention in cheese without generating ripening defects declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest
